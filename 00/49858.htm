<h2>            Revert back to Windows 7 from Windows 10 messed up my PC</h2>
                    Before the forced windows 10 update that I never asked for, my Computer ran fine on windows 7, than it updated by itself while i was in school. Windows 10 ran like **** so i reverted back to windows 7, soon after, my monitor would go black every once in
 a while and it would act like my graphics card was just unplugged. I tried updating my graphics card but i continued, during the period of my main monitor going black for a second i would hear a noise that you get when your computer freezes. Now it crashes
 instead of doing this with both my monitors going black and in sleep mode and it freezes there with the same sound.

            <em><strong>Re-install Windows 7</strong></em>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed.</strong> Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first.
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.&nbsp; This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
</p><div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.&nbsp; I have done this on 150 client computers and it works flawlessly, and has continued to that since Spring,
 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>
</p><p>March 15, 2016</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Be advised that Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10&nbsp;installation promises to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and sometimes requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition
 on their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have tried Windows 10 and decided they want their Windows 7 back.&nbsp; If you are one of those, once you have Windows 7 back, you will need to take steps to keep it that</p>
<p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;advise my clients to&nbsp;change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015, not a single update that was not security, was something that improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>Read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp; </p>
<p>

 Woody calls the Windows 10 download “crapware.”&nbsp; Woody’s advice is that if you have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 files.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; A free app:</p>
<p><a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove any of Microsoft’s installed or attempts to install spyware.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The following process will remove those features which you do not need.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed, enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>List of updates that if already installed should be removed:</p>

            <p><span><span>You CPU processor temperatures are too high. How often do you play Guild Wars 2. This software will cause too high CPU processor temperatures leading to crashes etc., if the cooling system is inadequate.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>With a desktop you can remove the left hand side panel and remove any dust bunnies clogging fans. Also check that all fans are working. To be safe switch the computer off and pull out the power lead
 before removing the side panel. You can then switch the computer back on and check that the fans are working.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Next switch the computer off again and allow some time for it to cool down. It is best to use a wrist band, which you clip on the computer case to earth you before touching anything inside the casing.
 You can buy one from a computer accessory shop. Static electricity can damage a motherboard if you do not take precautions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You then use a small brush to remove the dust bunnies around the fan on the processor. I have used an electric razor cleaning brush. I use an Air Duster to clean the power supply fan. An Air Duster
 is also useful for cleaning keyboards. When you use an Air Duster do it when the computer is cold.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A more permanent solution, if removing dust bunnies does not eliminate overheating, is to replace the fan mounted over the processor with a more robust version. To do this properly you need advice
 from an experienced computer repair engineer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you run Guild Wars often, there are settings within the software than be be changed that could help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How are you getting on with increasing your free disk space on your C partition?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How many internal drive bays does your computer have? If you had a second internal hard drive managing use of disk space becomes much easier.</span></span></p>

            <p>Sorry for being quiet for a while, So I got somewhere finally, i did cleans my registry stuff and i also downgraded my nvidia drivers, that seemed to work, not one without the other though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't until they were both done that my stuff started working alright. The only issue is that with older drivers, a lot of my games can barely run, but the one's having the problems from the windows 10 mess worked alright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of guild wars, i never play it anymore and don't know why its installed. I was able to free up a good chunk of space for my c drive, and I'm pretty sure i only have one hard drive.</p>

<h2>            How do I uninstall Windows 7 Service Pack 1&#63;</h2>
                    <p><i>Need to remove sp1 in win7 to get a job. &nbsp;Help!! Help!!</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Recently (Nov. 2011) I upgraded from Vista(OEM) Home Premium&nbsp;to Windows 7 (Home Premium).&nbsp;Evidently, the upgrade installed Service Pack 1 when it installed the windows 7.&nbsp; Now, I have a chance of getting a job (work from home), but I have no chance if I
 cannot get rid of SP1.&nbsp; I have tried everything suggested in the searches for how to remove SP1.&nbsp; I have 2 questions:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; How can I get rid of SP1?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Can it work if I download SP1, install it over what is already there, and then remove SP1 using either
 the command prompt or Add/Remove programs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks much:&nbsp; Sandra Beall</p>

    <title>Duplicate Files in Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gfunc88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Files in Vista</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am using Windows Vista on my Laptop. Currently, I&nbsp;have about 8 Gigs of space left on my 70 Gig drive. There is no way that I have that much data on my machine....
</p>
<p>My question is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way for me to check and see if files are being duplicated or where some of these massive files are being stored? I&nbsp;really don't have enough experience to&nbsp;do anything other than search&nbsp;through individual files &amp; folders and there has to be
 a better way, right? </p>
<p>My machine has really slowed down recently, and the lack of hard disk space is disconcerting. I know that probably doesn't have much to do with the performance of the machine itself, but&nbsp;I would like to&nbsp;address this first.
</p>

<p>One thing to try, if you have not already is Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; Please follow the steps below.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Start</strong> orb, type Disk cleanup in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and press
<strong>Enter</strong></p>
<p>Disk cleanup will scan your system and find any files that are available to be deleted.</p>
<p>Once the scan has completed it will tell you how much space it will be able to free up.</p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Delete Files</strong> in the Disk Cleanup dialogue box.</p>
<p>Disk cleanup will now perform the process of cleaning up your hard drive.</p>
<p>We have also provided some information on System Restore and restore points, which can be very large files.</p>
<p><b>How much hard disk space does System Restore require?</b></p>
<p>To store restore points, you need at least 300 megabytes (MB) of free space on each
hard disk that has System Protection turned on. System Restore might use up to 15 percent of the space on each disk. As the amount of space fills up with restore points, System Restore will delete
 older restore points to make room for new ones.</p>
<p><span>System Restore will not run on hard disks smaller than 1 gigabyte (GB).<br />

 to reserve your free upgrade to Windows 10</span></a> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What is the Reserve Upgrade app?</strong></p>
<p>The Windows 10 upgrade is designed to be compatible with your current Windows device and applications*. We are hard at work to make this upgrade process a great experience.
<strong>You can reserve your free Windows 10 upgrade now through a simple reservation process.</strong> Look for this icon in your system tray at the bottom of your screen, simply click on the icon, and then complete the reservation process.
<a href="http://www.windows.com/windows10upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">You can find more details on how this works at Windows.com</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong>The reservation app is not working, it displays a blank screen:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If the application has a blank screen or does not work or is not available:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Check Windows Update for an updated version of KB2952664 (Windows 7 SP1) or KB2976978 (Windows 8.x)</strong></li><li>After installing the Windows Update, re-run the&nbsp;Compatibility Appraiser. This will happen automatically within a day or it can be run manually from an&nbsp;admin command prompt:
<ul>
<li>schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser"</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once started, it may take&nbsp;10 minutes or so&nbsp;for the appraiser to complete. Once&nbsp;complete, re-open the Get Windows 10 app and it will have the updated compatibility information.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn’t get a notification? </strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
•Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
•Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
•Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
•Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
•Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
•Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each update and click Uninstall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Other reasons why you might not be seeing it:</em></strong></p>
<p>Why don’t I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don’t see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.
</strong></li></ol>
<p>Running Windows Update and installing any available updates will fix the first three issues. Need more help? Go to our

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we’ll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC’s compatibility if you
 choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device is managed as part of a school or business network, please check with your IT administrator about upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10.</p>

<br />Copy and paste it into Command Prompt if you haven't already, and keep me posted!

<h2>            My HDD died, how can I update to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Unfortunately, my HDD died. It was licensed for Win7 and upgraded to Win10 for free.</p>
<p>I installed Win7 (same license key)&nbsp;on a new HDD, and I was wondering how can I install Win10 back.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>yes now after installing 7 again, go here and use update assistant and update to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>Also download the media creation tool for later for a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(IF YOU ARE NOT DOING CLEAN INSTALL AFTER UPGRADE).</p>
<p>Then after 1709 WIN 10 upgrade install, go here and download and install&nbsp;this update to the newest build of 1709, January 3, 2018—KB4056892 (OS Build 16299.192)</p>
<p>Get the Cumulative Update and for right version such as 32 or 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4056892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4056892</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advise after upgrade and newest update and if all works good, is to now do a clean install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go here, download key retrieval tool and run it and write down your Windows activation key code</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then use the media creation tool to create Windows 10 DVD or USB Install media. Be sure to get 64 bit and the same version you have, such as Home or Pro etc. (Avoid the "N" or "S" versions)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then during install, enter your activation Key Code you retrieved and after install, install&nbsp;this update to the newest build of 1709, January 3, 2018—KB4056892 (OS Build 16299.192).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not want a windows OS installed over a previous one. There will be issues sometime down the&nbsp;road most likely. Clean Install is the only way to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest to invest a small amount and buy another large enough hard drive and create a system image and save it there. Keep your image update frequently. Then if anything happens, a quick restore of your system image and all is good. System images/shadow
 copies&nbsp;are your savior and best friend ever.</p>

<p>Should is only a possibility. And if it does not activate, then people go through a bunch of BS. They should retrieve their key code right after upgrade and save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, since he installed 7 again already, he is better off doing the upgrade, getting the 10 Key code and then doing a clean 10 install with the key code for definite activation results. This little time doing upgrade first could save him hours of
 wasted time and BS.</p>

<h2>            Network Cable shows as &#34;Unplugged&#34; when it is in fact, plugged in properly - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So, I have a really strange problem, I am looking for thoughts.&nbsp; I have a system running Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; It has run fine for years.&nbsp; A while back, I started getting an error that my network cable was unplugged.&nbsp; I checked the cable and it was plugged in
 normally.&nbsp; I replaced the cable and it still generated the same error.&nbsp; I have two network adapters on the system.&nbsp; I moved the cable to the second adapter and the problem went away.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system worked fine for months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time later, I started getting the same error on both adapters.&nbsp; I would get the "network cable unplugged" error no matter what adapter I had the cable plugged into.&nbsp; I once again tried additional cables to no avail.&nbsp; I tested a different router and
 it changed nothing, as well.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a new NIC and installed it into the machine.&nbsp; Adding a third NIC changed nothing.&nbsp; It still showed that the network cable was unplugged.&nbsp; I went into properties and tried different negotiation, i.e. I tried auto, TX 100, half duplex, full duplex,
 etc and it made no difference.&nbsp; I updated all the drivers and even got the factory Realtek driver for one of the NIC's rather than using the Microsoft driver.&nbsp; Nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was about to give up when the April Creator's update came up.&nbsp; I did the update and the problem corrected itself.&nbsp; The computer worked perfectly until yesterday.&nbsp; Now, I am suddenly getting the same error again with the April Creators' edition.&nbsp; I have
 tried new cables, etc, but I am up against the same wall as I was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we are clear, the device manager says the device is working properly.&nbsp; I plug the cable in and it is detected.&nbsp; It starts the identification process and then almost immediately says "network cable unplugged."&nbsp; If I wait a few seconds, it again detects
 that it is plugged into the router, but a few seconds later, it will gain say "network cable unplugged."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.

<br />
<br /> It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:

<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

<p>Thank you very much for your assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize when you reply to comments online, it isn't easy to know the skill level of the person you are working with.&nbsp; In this case, you are providing me with "trouble shooting 101" information.&nbsp; It happens that
 I am a computer engineer with over 45 years of experience.&nbsp; I have a masters in computer science, first obtained in 1973.&nbsp; I also have a bachelors in electrical engineering.&nbsp; I am now retire from a long career starting on punch cards and second generation
 machines, working most recently on sophisticated Windows server based networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is something obscure going on with my personal desktop computer.&nbsp; In all of my years, I have never seen it before.&nbsp; I had thought that, when the creators edition was installed, it over-wrote the previous Windows and the problem had gone away.&nbsp; I was
 caught off-guard when it returned yesterday.&nbsp; It appears that there is something on my system that is causing the problem to re-surface.&nbsp; It could be app related, driver related, it is even possible that there is some kind of malware.&nbsp; It is just a strange
 issue.&nbsp; It isn't BIOS and isn't hardware.&nbsp; Resetting the BIOS was one of the first things that I did.&nbsp; While the BIOS is older, it is the current version for my motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first built this computer, I ran Windows 8.1 on it, but this has a clean
 install of Windows 10.&nbsp; Before I did the upgrade, I added an SSD.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a personal machine that I use and has run well for years.&nbsp; I have seen no need to upgrade the CPU or system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said all of that, I am hoping that someone in the community has actually seen this obscure problem and gotten down to what actually may be causing it.&nbsp; With all of my years of experience, I haven't seen everything and I learn more all the time.&nbsp; I
 have read online of others running into this, but I can't see where anyone has ever solved it with anything other than changing full/half duplex or negotiation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious solution is to use the new, "RESET PC" function and just let it do a clean install.&nbsp; I may have to resort to that, but I hope to avoid it.&nbsp; I really don't want to have to re-install all of my software and reconfigure the whole things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any ideas other than the very obvious, I would appreciate it.&nbsp; In any case, I do appreciate your help.&nbsp; I realize that you didn't know my skill level and I understand that providing tech support from a public community is challenging.</p>

            There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709/1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709/1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709/1803 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.
<br />
<br />Just to touch back on why I personally think it might be broken. When Microsoft starts preparing for a new release, it goes through a process called refactoring. It seems this is introducing some significant code changes that breaks certain protocols and API's required by older apps and drivers. Considering the Windows Driver Model has not changed much in its near 30 year history not to mention the application programming interfaces such as Win32, this might be culprit. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft is trying break with both old driver and API's as gracefully as possible - but I will be honest with you - its a disaster. 
<br />
<br />Here is what I am going to ask you to try if you are up for it. 
<br />
<br />Setup a partition and install Windows 8.1 there and monitor how the driver behaves. 
<br />
<br />I am going give you all the details of how to do that, 43 years of experience with computers should help you with that. ;)

            Thank you.&nbsp; I certainly believe that it is possible that there is a compatibility issue with Windows 10.&nbsp; I am a little bit skeptical though since one network adapter is a Realtek controller on the motherboard and the other is a USB controller.&nbsp; Something
 is happening to cause an issue with the network stack.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is weird because I have an external USB Wi-Fi adapter on the computer as well.&nbsp; I can connect with WiFi and then have access to all network resources.&nbsp; It is all just weird.&nbsp; I am thinking about buying
 a new motherboard and trying it again.&nbsp; I probably won't re-install Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I don't need the ISO.&nbsp; I installed from a full, legal, retail version.

<h2>            Xbox Live Gold Membership and the Transfer from 360 to ONE</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am posting here with some concerns involving Gold memberships on the 360 making the trip to an Xbox ONE. I have quite a bit of time left on my current Gold membership and recently picked up a 12month Gold Card. My concern is will my Gold transfer
 with my account to the Xbox ONE or will I be able to redeem this Gold card on the Xbox ONE also?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Most often this is memory, have you added any lately? It is also possible that it is driver related and maybe<br />
antivirus/antispyware/security program related though those are rare.<br />
<br />
<p>The MEMORY_MANAGEMENT bug check has a value of 0x0000001A. This indicates that a
<strong>severe memory management</strong> error occurred.</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since your issue is related to BitLocker codes, the troubleshooting steps that needs to be done requires advanced and complex configurations. Because of this, we might need to refer you to our Microsoft TechNet forums. For us to direct you to the correct
 forum category, we would need you to answer the following questions: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and edition of Windows 10 is installed on your device?<br />
</li><li>Was your computer previously connected to a domain network?</li><li>When you had your BitLocker set up, was it on the same hard disk drive?</li><li>Is the computer a workstation or is it a personal computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If in case you'll experience an issue with BitLocker recovery keys, you can use this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/17133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> as your reference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response. </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and edition of Windows 10 is installed on your device?</li></ul>
<p>The Windows is Version<span> </span>10.0.16299 Build 16299.</p>
<p>

<li>Was your computer previously connected to a domain network?</li></ul>
<p>No</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you had your BitLocker set up, was it on the same hard disk drive?</li></ul>
<p>I don't really know, but I guess so. I was not even aware of the BitLocker until I was asked for the key. It only happened after they changed the motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the computer a workstation or is it a personal computer?</li></ul>
<p>Personal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should emphasise that I am only asked for the key sometimes.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge browser won&#39;t allow downloads</h2>
                    <p>For whatever reason my Edge browser won't allow any downloads.&nbsp;&nbsp; In IE, there is usually&nbsp;an option that pops up at the bottom, which&nbsp;asks me if I want to Open or Save the file, but I don't get that option with Edge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everytime I press the download link
 on various websites, nothing happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; I even tried disabling Smartsceen and the pop-up blocker under advanced settings but it doesn't solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another setting that I need to change that will allow downloads on Microsoft Edge?</p>

    <title>Music&#47;Audio problems on Windows DVD maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dancerkat8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music&#47;Audio problems on Windows DVD maker</h2>
                    I just recently got a new laptop that has windows Vista on it, and it had the program "Windows DVD maker" on it. As a birthday gift to my dad, I am making him a DVD with picture and music on it. However, I only have 2 songs that I want to play on it, and
 It will only play the first one on the list and not the second one (I know its not an audio combatibility problem because it can play both songs because I tried switching the 2 songs around and it would only play the other one. It only plays the first one
 on the list). Sp I want to know if I am doing something wrong, or if I didnt hit something, but it reads that there is 2 songs (because the audio time&nbsp; says I am playing 7 min when each song is only like 3.5 min.) But when I play the slideshow, it stops after
 the first song and continuse to show the pictures....<br />
<br />
Please Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<p>[/quote]^Quick fix to above post. The first two locations are EAST of Michael's safe house. I wrote it after being up all night and my sense of direction was apparently off. I will update with locations near the other safe houses. If there are other items

    <title>I cannot be able to install Sky Drive again after Changing Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a cooperator  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cannot be able to install Sky Drive again after Changing Windows Account Name,User Profile Folder Name</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Let me say that I had a Windows account name 'problem account' and user profile folder name under C:\Users\problem account'</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have installed Skydrive and it was installed very well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have changed the Windows Account Name and User Profile Folder Name from 'problem account' into 'problem_ account'. Even in the registry, I have changed them.</p>
<p>C:\users\problem_account'</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, I don't know why when I run Task Manger, I found that the old name(problem account) is still listed
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/383fb2c3-445c-44a2-ba0e-d6fc8e904f0b" /></p>
<p>Altough in the user in the registray, visible account and profile&nbsp;folder name is 'problem_account'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4bad753b-8326-4994-a2d4-bf0a65022f89" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bd32d34-e4d2-49f6-b470-1a97df902645" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then Skydrive got unfunctioned. Also, Skydrive folder was still listed under the NEW&nbsp;User Profile Folder Name 'Ali'. However, there&nbsp;was no "skydrive" in the system tray. When open&nbsp; 'Microsfot Skydrive', no response at all, altough there&nbsp;was (Microsfot Skydrive)
 still listed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I saw this, I have uninstalled and removed all folders assocatiated to Skydrive, as you see below there are no results of 'Skydrive' at all. Which means that everying about Skydrive got removed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcf2a882-f6a4-49af-aafa-e07ab24f694c" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, whenever I reinstall the Skydrive from the SkyDrive setup file I have used to install&nbsp;before changing Windows account name and profile name, I got the error below, although, as you see above, there are no any folders or Skydrive installed or existing
 on the Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9477798b-bb4d-412b-b9a5-1d60d6e6ecc3" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have checked the features and programs, I found no Skydrive listed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91bc1a5e-caa9-446d-95e6-83ae250a85b8" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tired&nbsp;installing the same Skydrive on other accounts on the same computer, it was installed well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think that the permissions for the old user account name 'Mohammad' are precluding installing Skydrive and return that there is a newer version installed on 'Mohammad' changed into 'Ali'</p>
<p>Because as far as I know that the permissions will still&nbsp;displaying 'Mohammad', although 'mohammad' was changed into 'Ali', which means that&nbsp;the old user account name will still control over the permissions.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried <font>SubInACL tool. And it worked well, but the poblem still presists.</font></p>
<p><font><br />

            <p>I really have found the solution, but it&nbsp;is a little bit strange, which is I have deleted the&nbsp;SkyDrive from the registry entry as the&nbsp;screen shot shows&nbsp;below. How can a user&nbsp;know that this&nbsp;is causing the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: that the 'problem account' is the old one, however, the new one replaced is 'problem_account'</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think&nbsp;that the&nbsp;old Windows user account name, and profile folder name of&nbsp;a user account will be still shown in some places after&nbsp;changing&nbsp;both Windows user account name, and profile folder name into antoher name.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Come in mind, permissions and Taks manager.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0267bc9-758f-4c9a-bc35-adcf27c70b32" /></p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/786f2f55-ebe7-49c3-9984-2fe701584709" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The old account"problem account" is still controlling over permissions of 'Application data', although I have changed 'problem account' into 'problem_account'.</p>
<p>However, when trying to copy files from 'problem_account' into another new one, I faced this error not finding 'app data'</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7d7143d-8be3-487b-b25e-7c327f2347ed" />
<p>Could you please help me how can I let new user account only be shown in all places alone without showing the old one?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then what benefit is there from changing Windows user account name, and profile folder name as long as the old one will be sitll shown in some places?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry for late response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you for try following these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For User accout issue, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Log on to the system by using an administrative user account other than the user account that is experiencing the problem.<br />
b. Back up all data in the current users profile folder if the profile folder still exists, and then delete the profile folder. By default, the profile resides in the following location: %SystemDrive%\Users\UserName<br />
c. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
d. Locate the following registry subkey:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList<br />
e. Under the ProfileList subkey, delete the subkey that is named SID.bak. </p>
<p>Note:SID is a placeholder for the security identifier (SID) of the user account that you want to delete. The SID.bak subkey should contain a ProfileImagePath registry entry that points to the original profile folder of the user account that is experiencing
 the problem.<br />
f. Exit Registry Editor.<br />
g. Restart Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For changing the default installation directory do the following steps. A small registry change has to be done for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Type “regedit” in Start menu search box and hit enter to continue.<br />
b. Navigate to the following registry key in the Registry Editor:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion<br />
c. Locate the value named “ProgramFilesDir” and change the default value “C:\Program Files” to your new directory path(address).<br />
d. Close the registry editor and reboot your system to apply the change.</p>
<p><br />
Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For

<h2>            C&#58; Drive too full to update to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>I recently bought a <span>Lenovo YOGA 300 Laptop Notebook (Intel Celeron N2840 2.16 GHz, 2 GB RAM, 32 GB eMMC, Windows 8.1) with Free Windows 10 upgrade. After registering the computer I tried to download windows
 10 but was told there was not enough space on the c: drive for the upgrade. After checking the c: drive I found in the USERS a folder with my name which had within it&nbsp; folder called Onedrive (this was in addition to the normal onedrive folder)which had several
 GB of photos on it. </span></p>
<p><span>I never store pictures or documents on my c: drive and haven't installed any apps or programs other than those that came with the computer&nbsp;yet.</span></p>
<p><span>I removed the pictures but the computer still indicates that the c: is very full and I cannot download the windows 10 upgrade. I tried disk cleanup but could only free up megabytes of space and checked to
 see how big the other folders are and the maths doesn't add up&nbsp;it says&nbsp;the C: drive&nbsp;has 106mb of 20.3Gb free but when I look at the size of the folders,&nbsp;Program files is 1.92gb, Program files (x86) is 1.91gb, Users is&nbsp;68.1mb and windows is 20.7mb.</span></p>
<p><span>I don't know much about computers and could use some help to work out whats going on and how I can free up more space. Presumably Lenovo wouldn't sell a computer with the feature of downloading windows 10
 that physically cannot do it would they???</span></p>
<p><span>Any help would be greatly appreciated</span></p>

            <p>You need way significantly more than 106 MBs to install Windows 10. You need to have at least 10 GBs of free space on the C:\ in order to install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you follow the instructions to backup free up space:</p>

</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't do this, I recommend performing a manual upgrade using the ISO file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326" title="Microsoft has provided instructions how to download the official .ISO files for Windows 10 32 and 64 bit.

<p>
</p><p>Choose the option, to Keep personal files only, if this does not work, then choose the option 'Keep Nothing'</p>

<p><span><span>When making significant changes to your computer such as updating the operating system, you should always backup.

<p>I&nbsp;would contact Orange technical support. If other computers connect successfuly to the router you have something wrong with the settings on your Acer Aspire 5552.</p>
