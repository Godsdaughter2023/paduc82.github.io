<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7  disaster - unusable</h2>
                    <p>I have now done 4 upgrades to Windows 10 &nbsp; 2 worked well 2 a total utter disaster. What is the difference? &nbsp;Upgrading from Windows 8.1 seems to work. From Windows 7 - complete utter time wasting disasters.</p>
<p>A question for Microsoft WHY have you not designed the upgrade to work properly from Winnows 7???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried an install on an older desktop that ran reasonably well on Windows 7. &nbsp;Result - complete utter disaster. It installed OK, managed to trash several programs and was a complete mess . I tried a 2nd time after uninstalling several unneeded older programs.
 It installed OK started to work then started to go into a spasm of constant disk activity locking up the whole PC and the screen blanking out or going on and off. I left the PC on for a day and a half including overnight &nbsp;but STILL the constant disk activity.
 &nbsp;Fortunately I had taken the precaution of doing a drive backup with Acronis so was able to get back to Windows 7 and a WORKING PC again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried an upgrade on my older laptop. It has a 1TB disk, plenty of spare disk space in each partition. Upgrade installation took a while but went in OK since then its the same old problem. Constant disk activity, system totally hangs up with blank screen.
 It has been on for almost 2 days now - STILL constant disk activity, blank screen (although screen saver comes on). I have tried to close down and re-start 2 or 3 times but EVERY time it goes into this frenzied disk activity - screen blanks and its impossible
 to use. I tried re-starting in safe mode - same thing.</p>
<p>I now have a totally unusable laptop thanks to this incredibly inept upgrade. What I don't understand is why it appears to work upgrading from Windows 8.1 but from Windows 7 in both cases it is a complete utter disaster.</p>
<p>Unless I can get my laptop going again today it will be &nbsp;Windows 10 banished forever from it and I'll go back to the tried tested and WORKING Windows 7 &nbsp;- and keep to that.</p>
<p>Has anyone else in the forum had this experience? from Google searches it looks like a LOT of people have but no one seems to come up with an answer that works and a thundering silence from Microsoft who MUST know they have a serious problem ((and credibility
 problem) on their hands. This was supposed to be the wonder Windows, the best one yet &nbsp;fully tried and tested etc etc. &nbsp;Really is embarrassing when you talk to Mac owning friends!</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE &nbsp;Finally got fed up with this. Screen now blanks out soon after logging in, still constant disk thrashing and system freezes so cant do anything. Left running to see if it sorts out but after 3 days wasted time and effort come to conclusion its just
 not worth wasting any more time on it. Its a lost cause. I can only think that within a short time Windows 10 managed to get corrupted making it unusable. Although the laptop is getting a bit old the hard drive is only a year old</p>
<p>Microsoft &nbsp;should issue a warning before upgrading to Windows 10 to make sure you do a FULL drive image backup using Acronis, Nortons Ghost, Paragon Drive backup or other good drive image software. Windows restore is useless to revert to 7. You have to do
 a proper, complete drive image backup. Also before doing it create boot media on a CD or memory stick.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>FURTHER UPDATE. &nbsp;TRIED YET AGAIN TO UPGRADE MY LAPTOP WINDOWS 7 TO WINDOWS 10 RESULT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same totally unusable Windows. This time before upgrading I &nbsp; took these steps</p>
<ul>
<li>uninstalled all un-needed programs</li><li>Took out all temp files and junk</li><li>De-fragged Drive C</li><li>Ran thorough disk check to check for bad sectors, file errors etc.</li><li>Removed as many data files from D &amp; E and stored them on an external drive.</li><li>i.e. slimmed down everything in case the problem was Windows trying to update old programs or spend excessive time indexing data files</li></ul>
<p>Installed Windows 10 and this time did a drive image back-up immediately afterwards, set default options to custom ones recommended by a bulletin I received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RESULT:</p>
<p>Yet again Windows 10 went into a mad frenzy of disk activity, screen blanked out - absolutely utterly impossible to do anything. Clicking mouse, moving over touchpad, etc does nothing. The system is frozen out while its frenzied disk activity goes on. The
 laptop has been left on for 36 HOURS so far and STILL the continuous disk activity. It appears there is downloading going on as the WiFi light is flashing as well as the disk activity light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>yet again a totally unusable version of Windows. searching this forum using Windows 10 disaster soon shows me I am not alone there are &nbsp;hundreds if not thousands of people who have had countless similar or other problems upgrading from Windows 7 to 10. &nbsp;There
 is a pattern there which Microsoft appear to totally ignore. The only solutions seem to be to do an clean install &nbsp;i.e. admitting that trying to upgrade to version 10 from 7 simply WONT WORK, Why doesn't Microsoft come clean on this and admit that there are
 so many problems &nbsp;upgrading 7 top 10 that it us not worth the effort and put a big warning on their web site. All I can think is that any testing the did was on a pristine copy of Windows 7 not one that had been used in real life.</p>
<p>Unless this wretched Windows 10 starts working on my laptop pretty soon I'll be going back to Windows 7 and staying with 7 and not waste any more time on this 10. At least 7 actually WORKS. &nbsp;Thank goodness I had the foresight to do a drive backup to I &nbsp;can
 get back to a working version again</p>

<h2>            &#91;Suggestion&#93; More jRPGs &#40;Japanese RPG&#41; on Xbox360 in EUROPE</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft claims that users will be happy with the new "Forza", "Gears of War" and "Halo".<br />
I disagree with that statement, Xbox360 needs more JRPG's (Japanese RPG), the titles of this genre are reduced in the Microsoft console (<span><span>especially in Europe)</span></span>, so I want to extend my suggestion
 to those responsible for these decisions.</p>
<p><span><span>I hope</span> <span>
the</span> <span>community support</span> <span>the</span> "<span>Japanese</span> RPG"
<span>freaks</span></span>.</p>
<span>freaks</span></span>.</p>

<p>I don't think Microsoft being a predominantly American company could make JRPG's. &nbsp;It's kind of up to the Japanese RPG developers.</p>

<p>Well, if he wants to hire translators, dubbers and whatnot that are necessary sure. Bring them on over.</p>
<p>As it stands for the westerns markets, evidence of the lack of interest in east Asian video games is clear.</p>

<p>I totally agree! I love JPRG's! They are funny and just because some western people don't like it doesn't mean others doesn't. The same goes for MS in Japan. It still will never sell good as the PS3 or the WII. There are more games out on those consoles
 that appeals some audiance who cares for games like that! </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>That's why I will never buy only one console to limit myself in gaming. Ps3 and Wii offers totally different games while xbox offers more shooter games (which is BORING)</p>

<p>The best JRPG I've played this gen is Tales of Vesperia. &nbsp;It wasn't that easy for me to get. &nbsp;Had to pay a bit more than the prices of a new game even though I bought a used copy. &nbsp; &nbsp;Might be one of the times Games on Demand is worth is as it is up there

<p>yea tales of verperia is on GoD and its not a terrible price compared to retail.</p>
<p>OP should play lost oddessy and eternal sonata as well. not sure if avalible in EU</p>
<p>MS doesn't have to make the games just get them translated and shipped to US and EU.

<p>Not only that launch more, if not to edit those already released in <strong>USA</strong>, here in
<strong>Europe</strong>. In USA there are several titles that have not reached the European continent.</p>
<p>Not for lack of systems, I have the PS3 and Wii, but I like playing on Xbox360 and I see missing titles ... Too many FPS and
<strong>RPG's Japanese zero</strong>.</p>
<p>Also missing classics "<strong>beat'em ups</strong>" with current technology.</p>
<p>There extinct genera that were once the daily bread?</p>
<p>Microsoft must realize and not get stuck in TPS, Racing and more FPS.</p>

<p>Its not MS that you should be asking this from. &nbsp;You should be asking the publishers of the JRPG's you want in your country. &nbsp;They are the ones who make those decisions.

    <title>Lenovo tablet frozen&#47;unresponsive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveymike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo tablet frozen&#47;unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>I reset my tab two days ago, left it for about seven or eight hours and then turned it back on and the touchscreen doesn't work. I've tried resetting it numerous times, letting the battery run out and it's still completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a lot of data (apps, bookmarks, downloads, pics) so I don't want to completely reboot it and lose all my data. I've tried looking for a reset button/switch for a soft reset but I can't find it anywhere on my tab.<br />

            If the touchscreen doesn't work, I would suggest you plugin a mouse or keyboard so you can control the tablet.&nbsp;Then you'll be able to go to the Lenovo website and download the drivers for the touchscreen to make it work.&nbsp; Or you can use safe mode and roll
 back to before the problem started (your files will be saved).&nbsp; But either way, getting control with a mouse or keyboard is required first.&nbsp; Otherwise, you'll have to send it to Lenovo for service.

            <p>Take a look at the instruction manual or Lenovo website, there is usually some kind of key combination you can use to force the reboot, such as holding in the power button and one of the volume keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>instructions provided by Lenovo should give better guidance on how to recover their own systems in case of failure, especially if they didn't provide a keyboard originally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it's only a few days old, if you don't have luck with it take it back to the shop for a replacement.</p>

<h2>            Windows Task Manager- I clicked cascade under windows tab yesterday.</h2>
                    In the support and help center it says to right click on an empty spot on the taskbar and pick uncascade. It doesnt give me the option of uncascading. It gives me option to cascade.&nbsp; I dont remember which program or window i had open and selected when
 i cascaded yesterday. If you know how to find that out, then maybe it would give me the option to uncascade if i launched the same window and selected it. Problem is, if its cascaded some open windows dont show on the task manager. I just want to uncascade
 because i use task manager a lot to manage or quit or refresh programs and i cant do that if i cant see the open program on the applications window of task manager.&nbsp;

            Hi Marne, <br />
<br />
First, make sure you are logged on with an administrator account. Then change your password to a strong password. Follow instructions on creating a strong password on the link below.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Look at user accounts and delete any user accounts you are not using or unknown. <br />
<br />
Download the Microsoft Safety Scanner from the link below: The page also has good security measures you can review.
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
It is best to have only one Antivirus that is running Real Time protection. You can use other scanning tools, but not multiple at the same time.
<br />
<br />
If you are using Wireless for your home computer, I would reset it and change the&nbsp;default SSID immediately when configuring wireless security on your network. Most ship with a default SSID and you should change it to prevent hackers from gaining entry to your
 network. <br />
<br />
Be sure you have a firewall enabled on your router and computer. <br />
<br />
If you are still having problems with access to folders or files, take ownership of the file.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Incorrect Windows settings are one of the possible reasons why you're not able to use the shortcut key to switch between two keyboards. We recommend using the
<strong>Windows key + Spacebar</strong> to switch between keyboards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more reference about <strong>Keyboard shortcuts in Windows</strong>, click on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I have no problem switching between French and Korean Microsoft IME with&nbsp; windows key + space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem is once I am on the Microsoft IME I cannot toggle between Korean and English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the screenshot I took. SHIFT + SPACE is dedicated as hotkey to toggle between
</p>
<p>
</p><p>two languages, but IME does not recognize the hotkeys.</p>

    <title>Unable to IM to someone showing offline when they are really online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boondcr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to IM to someone showing offline when they are really online with windows 10</h2>
                    So I am not able to send an IM to someone in my contacts that has Skype business (am not running Skype business). It shows them as offline when in fact they are online. I am using&nbsp; Skype for windows 10. I can send them an IM with my android phone but not
 through windows 10. I tried signing out and signing back in--this did not work. I checked for updates and am running the most current. Anyone have any ideas or is Skype for windows 10 just useless?

            Hi there!<br /><br />Many users have reported having difficulties with the new version. Maybe this could be solved soon. In the meantime, I suggest you try installing Classic Skype <a href="https://download.skype.com/5d7ac191986ccb485223c4e4e9e3e4ce/SkypeSetupFull.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.skype.com/5d7ac191986ccb485223...</a>

<p>
</p><p>The :O smiley is used in a lot of occasions where a smile is simply wildly inappropriate (e.g. legitimate shock and surprise over a bad event), so the current animation is very out of touch with the actual use. If you need to keep the silly animation, revert
 between a neutral face and the open mouth, and not a smile and an open mouth.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t update - &#40;0x80048504&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I successfully updated and installed Windows 10 on 6/14/2007 ("Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703") and found out recently I'm not getting automatic updates and unable to update it manually. I get this:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x80048504)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed in some forums this 0x80048504 error was also similar to an issue people were having in the Microsoft Store. I went to check that out and when I open the store and click SIGN IN and select my email, I get a new box popping up to say:</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I don't really care about the Microsoft Store, I just want to be able to update my Windows and make sure it's safe and protected. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code <strong>0x80048504 </strong>can be due to broken Windows Update components, corrupted system files, and/or hardware related factors. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you've previously made changes to Windows Update settings on your device.</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're currently using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The Store app is also dependent on the update components of Windows to function properly. In line with this,
<span>we'd recommend performing the steps posted on this</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to
 find and fix Windows Update issues.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Note: The link will also include the Windows Update Troubleshooter that can scan your device and fix any related errors. There are also other items that are listed in the article that help isolate the issue.</span><br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Updater from the first link and that ran for about 15 mins and updated and restarted my computer. Then I checked Windows Updates to see if there was more I could do. It ran that and updated about 6 things. Then I ran the Update Troubleshooter
 and that fixed 3 things and now everything seems to be up to date with Windows, which was my main priority to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the Microsoft Store is still giving me the same 0x80048504 "Something went wrong. Please try again later" error when I try to sign in at the Microsoft Store. It is different than the last error because when I click "Send Feedback" it actually takes
 me to a Feedback Hub, however it doesn't let me sign in without taking me back to the original error screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a priority of mine as I hardly even use the store, but I am just letting you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>I was able to get windows update to work by uninstalling the patch that fixed the Store and Feedback Hub.&nbsp; I installed (using the standalone installer) the most recent cumulative patch (kb4284819).&nbsp; so, no more horrible red warning on windows updates.&nbsp; BUT,
 the cume patch apparently does not include the fix for the store or the feedback hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>help for your debuggers:&nbsp; it may be because I do NOT use a m/s account for my computer.&nbsp; the old option for the signon to store and hub that says NO, just this app, are gone.&nbsp; now it says Just M/S apps.&nbsp; you cannot say JUST this ONE app.&nbsp; so i suspect it
 has to do with the signon or m/s credentials.</p>

 five seeing as how it doesn't list for a pc that's already on Windows 7 and, B. how, if possible, to do this from an Ext HDD.

</span></font></span></span><span>Which operating sis installed on the computer?</span></font></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Answer to your question A: In some scenarios, you may be unable to perform an
 upgrade from an earlier version of Windows. If you cannot upgrade, you may have to perform a custom installation. When you perform a custom installation of Windows 7, Windows creates a Windows.old folder that contains the files from your previous system.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If you install Windows 7 by performing a custom installation and don't format
 the partition during the installation process, files that were used in your previous version of Windows are stored in the Windows.old folder.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If you already have windows 7 on the computer, why do you want to revert to previous
 version of windows?</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Answer to your Question B: Further, you need to check what is the drive letter
 associated with the external drive.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">In the article they have provided letter D as drive letter for the dvd drive.
 Similarly you need to type the appropriate drive letter for the external drive and proceed with the steps.</font></span></p>

            I don't necessarily want to go to a different version of windows, I want to restore everything from the Windows.old folder - as in the computer is running on bare minimum right now, even had to do F8 and load on minimal resolution just to get passed the
 "Starting Windows" screen. There was also this - How to restore a computer to a previous Windows installation after you install Windows Vista&nbsp;[&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933168</a>&nbsp;]&nbsp;- and I'm wondering
 if this would also work with Windows 7 just so that I can get everything back from the windows.old folder including Users and Photos and music and really everything in there.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit - the Ext HDD is E:\<br />
<br />
The Windows.old folder is larger than the room remaining on the int hdd,so I want to delete it from the int and load it in CMD from the ext whether it be renaming it or moving all current stuff to the side and bringing in windows.old from the ext.

            We installed the AMD driver and got the computer to start up normally. My brother got rid of a tonne of stuff that he didnt need from the windows.old folder and we will probably move stuff from there into the normal spot on C:\. But is it possible to to
 uninstall all of the programs from the old user so that there isn't wasted hdd space?

<span>Click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Office Button</span><span> , and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Open</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Do one of the following: </span></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>
<span>In Windows Vista: <br />
<br />
Click Templates, and then double-click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Normal.dotm</span><span> file to open it.</span>
</li><li>
<span>In Microsoft Windows XP or Microsoft Windows Server 2003:
<br />
<br />
Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Templates</span><span> next to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">File name</span><span>.<br />
<br />
If no templates are listed in the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Open</span><span> dialog box, click the arrow next to the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Files of type</span><span> box, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">All Word Templates</span><span>.</span>
</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>
<span>To be certain that you're working in the default template, check to see that
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Normal.dotm</span><span> appears in the Word title bar.
</span></li><li>
<span>Make any changes that you want to the fonts, margins, spacing, and other settings. You can use the same commands and features that you use to change a document&nbsp;— but remember that any changes that you make to
 Normal.dotm will be applied to documents that you create in the future. </span></li><li>
<span>When you have finished, click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Office Button</span><span>, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Save</span><span>.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
After I walked through the steps listed above it definitely saved the "normal" template in the way I had made the changes.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This may be done in each of the applications suggested in your post, if this is the process being walked through in Windows Vista, it should be changing. One note that I almost omitted when I was walking through it was actually : ) I almost forgot to save it,
 but, after officially saving it everything turned out fine.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Please let us know if this helps, we do want to help you in your venture.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you,</p>

<h2>            can a game cause the &#38;quot&#59;red ring&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    


<div>I have had my console just over a year and I had never encountered any issues with my console until I downloaded Monday night combat.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I used to play it for a few hours a day but not to franticly&nbsp;&nbsp;to cause any issues for my console. when the 1st (and only)&nbsp;patch came out to fix some of the faults with the game my console started freezing&nbsp;mid game and during host migration, when this happens
 I can not do anything like exit to dash or pull up any menus and I have to turn the console off from the console itself. then about 3 weeks ago I was in a very heavy lag game and before I could open the menu and&nbsp;exit the game it had a host migration and froze.
 i tried turning the console off but it wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;so I had to switch it off from the mains (I had no other choice) I waited 10min to turn it back on but I had a red light on the right of the on button on my console. &nbsp;I took all the cables out then put them
 back in and it was still off.&nbsp;it took over 24hrs for it to come back on. people on the uberent site have had the freezing issue but no one has said they have had their console red ring. i have no problems with any other game or service on xbox live. I have
 tried talking to the makers but they are overly rude and aggressive&nbsp;when they reply and blame it on my console and I know for a fact its not. I'm really keen to get a reply asap so I know where I stand. thanks very much in advance for any replies&nbsp;I may get.&nbsp;</div>

<p>thanks for posting that. had a read through it but it doesn't contain the info I'm looking for. I don't know what to do as I want to continue playing the game but if my hardware is going to suffer then I can't.

<p>Hey mate, your other post has been deleted (we don't permit double posts on the same issue). It's unlikely that a game is causing your console this issue. What's likely happening is that your console is having an issue, and this game is exacerbating it.
 If the steps in that red light troubleshooter don't do the trick (and if <a href="http://xbx.lv/agwoVE%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this guide</a> doesn't help with the freeze issues), then your console will need a repair. You can set one up (and check your&nbsp;warranty status)
<a href="http://xbx.lv/alhhR6%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<h2>            Minecraft can&#8217;t join world xbox one</h2>
                    <p>(Xbox One) My friends cant join my worlds in minecraft. I can join theirs with no problem, and they can all join each other, however whenever anyone tries to join mine, it says ‘unable to connect’. This happens both through invite and when joining from the
 ‘friends’ tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have checked NAT types, made sure we’re using the same version, and also tried it with multiple worlds and players, i even switched wifi, but nothing seems to work. Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
