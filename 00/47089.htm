<h2>            how to uninstall optional updates&#40;it&#39;s a driver for video card actually&#41;</h2>
                    one day i checked for the updates ,I found a update for my video card <br />
here are its details<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
ATI Technologies Inc. - Display - ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470<br />
<br />
Installation date: ‎3/‎26/‎2012 00:29<br />
<br />
Installation status: Successful<br />
<br />
Update type: Optional<br />
<br />
ATI Technologies Inc. Display software update released in January, 2010<br />
<br />
More information: <br />
http://winqual.microsoft.com/support/?driverid=20330854<br />
<br />
Help and Support: <br />
http://support.microsoft.com/select/?target=hub<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
after that one of my games was unable to run correctly(minecraft, based on Java and OpenGL)<br />
I checked the "Installed Updates" at Control Panel, not to find the update(driver)described above.<br />
<br />
(I've reinstalled my Java and Offical driver for ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470<br />
but it seemed to be useless..)<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What happens when you try to play minecraft?</p>
<p>

</span></span></span>Was it working fine earlier?</p>
<p>If you want to revert to a state when the update was not installed follow the link mentioned below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to roll back the video drivers to get the previous settings.</p>
<p>Restore a driver to its previous version

<h2>            Surface pro 4 partitions deleted --can&#39;t fresh install</h2>
                    <p>A surface pro 4 was handed to me to fix after the IT Dir had attempted a fresh Win 10 install and apparently repartitioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The downloaded recovery environment apparently cannot see the system disk.&nbsp; How do I restore this system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>SurfacePro4_BMR_15_6.6.0.zip unzipped to a 16gig FAT32 jump drive boots but fails when it can't find a system disk.&nbsp; Attempts to install drivers out of "System" from SurfacePro4_Win10_1701001_0.zip don't get me a system disk.&nbsp; I can't even tell which driver
 is the "storage" driver.&nbsp; I'm unable to install SurfacePro4_Win10_1701001_0.msi from the command line available on the recovery drive, so I'm just stuck without a working Surface pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I restore this system.&nbsp; We don't have another Surface Pro 4 available to work with to create an image or another recovery drive.</p>

<h2>            WIndows 10 Installation failed&#47;Can not validate key</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having a nightmare trying to install Windows 10 so turning to you guys for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently on Windows 8.1 Pro and the Windows 10 upgrade has downloaded. I seem to be hitting two issued with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave my additional harddrives plugged in I can download the updates and get to the first screen telling me the system will restart multiple times. It then starts loading and gets to 42% before closing with the dialogue box saying Something Went Wrong:
 Windows Failed To Install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I unplug the hard drives and just have my install drive I can open the upgrade, select check for updates and I'm then told my product key can not be validated. I'm using a genuine Windows 8 Pro upgrade key which I have installed over a full version of
 Windows Vista. I've check the Windows Validation on my PC and it is still reporting valid. I've followed the other suggestions of clearing and repairing registry and I have enough memory (8GB) and free space (120GB left).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss for what to do now. If I try to do a full clean install of Windows 10 I'll get an invalid key message as my Windows 8 key is an upgrade and I would lose all my programs/settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well it sounds like it's not tilted far enough forward to "see" your feet. If you tried adjusting the angle and retuning it, then I suspect you are to close to it. Back up farther away from it.

<p>Have you tried sitting it right on the floor? Of course you'd then need to retune it. I'm thinking if it's that you're to close, then at that point your head will get cut off instead of your feet.
</p>
<p>To make sure it can see all of you, ideally you'd put the sensor at about your waist height. But again remember, anytime you change the sensors position it needs to be retuned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So you want to play Chess Titans on Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you take a look in the Windows Store app, there are several Chess games available there.
</span></p>
<p><span>You can go to your Start screen by either clicking in the bottom left hand corner or pressing the Windows key, and then
 go to the Windows Store app. </span></p>
<p><span>Once in the Store, you can then search for apps by pressing Windows key + C and click Search in the Charms bar, and search
 for Chess games from there.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The
 games from Windows 7 are not available by default in Windows 8. Keep checking the Windows Store for available games.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may want to click here "<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/explore-windows-store#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Apps
 in the Windows Store</a>" it tells us about variety of great apps available for
<span><span>Windows 8</span></span></span></span></p>

            why should people buy chess when it came with a version of Windows 7 that they also purchased?... and WHY was Chess titans (along with other games) deleted during Windows 7 to Windows 8 upgrade A.K.A. "Migration"<br />

            <p>In the beginning I was very enthusiastic with the idea to get upgraded to Windows 8... But for me such an action would be like a downgrade... Losing my favourite games,&nbsp;Office start package, Mediaplayer with possibility for playing of DVD' s- this could
 not be a good choice for me. And what do we receive in return: maybe better speed, but stronger control from Microsoft, and ugly&nbsp;tiles.
</p>
<p>I do not understand why do we lose in Windows 8 these applications that we have paid buying Windows 7.

            I could not agree more, this has not been the best upgrade considering that in order to do anything that a computer is really meant for you have to revert back to the "desktop" to do anything and at that point your back in windows 7.

            Yes there are plenty of chess games and such in there but the graphics are so horrible that I feel like I'm back in DOS. This has been a very big let down. I have stayed with Microsoft due to loyalty but if you guys are going to act like Apple and make
 it to where we have to get apps that are "FREE" as long as you don't mind advertisements constantly then I may as well go ahead and jump ship.

            Windows 8 is different and I can get use to the differences, but I am very dis-satisfied with Windows 8 leaving out the old standard games. I am considering throwing away Windows 8 and going back to windows 7 and Office 2010 Office Outlook no long supports
 graphics of .gif files. This is no way pleasing, I spent a lot of money on the upgrades and I wish that I had stayed with the older versions. &nbsp;

            I believe Microsoft had a plan with Windows 8; it was a&nbsp;strategic effort to capitalize on "No-Cost" apps from developers, while pursuing the growing market in gaming and graphics.&nbsp; It was almost teasing us including all the extras that Windows7 offered
 then stripping it away in the efforts to save money and overcome competition.&nbsp; It poses the real question with most of the comments here.&nbsp; Will Microsoft's customer loyalty remain when there is another that's already taken the market share in graphics and
 games (Apple)?

            Microsoft will remove all handy / easy to use items, then in a couple of years, re-introduce them with a fanfare. I got rid of my windows phone when it wouldn't sync with Outlook. It wanted me to use their cloud - oooooh!&nbsp; Got an android Galaxy S3 LTE
 - synced up straight away, no problem. However, I must be a nutter, I've just upgraded my Windows 7 to 8, DOH! My other machines will NOT be getting the same treatment. 8 changed my log on to
***@Hotmail,co.uk, so I couldn't log onto my network storage drive until I changed back to my usual name, that was once I discovered what the problem was. Same old Windows new release issues, but the next upgrade will
 solve all the problems. 98SE where are you now?

<br />
The issue with browsing through the Windows Store app is that presently, the games for Chess are REALLY BAD. It shouldn't be THAT difficult to make Chess Titans for Windows 8. One would think that if Microsoft were to change things around and remove features
 like the game in question, they would replace it for a better game rather than the games that are available.

            Are you using the /r switch?&nbsp; How long have you left chkdsk running before determining that it is hung?&nbsp; Depending on the size of the volume and the number of files on it you should be aware chkdsk can take a very long time to run.<br />

            I did use command prompt and yes used /r.It ran through and said some files were missing.When running I left on most of the day before shutting down.I had just did a complete system restore about a week ago.I was wondering if this hotfix could be used.<br />

            Oh, bad idea to shutdown a chkdsk in progress, sometimes you may have no choice but it's still not something you want to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the size of the disk and the number of files on the volume or when using the /r switch chkdsk may need 24 hours
 or more do complete.<br />
<br />
Chkdsk told you some <i>files</i> were missing?&nbsp; Were you running chkdsk on the Windows drive or on a data drive?&nbsp; If you run chkdsk without the /f switch on the Windows volume it may report spurious errors because it can't get a lock on the volume.&nbsp; Were you
 running chkdsk from the Recovery Console or was it running scheduled on a reboot?<br />
<br />
You say that you "did a complete system restore about a week ago.I was wondering if this hotfix could be used."&nbsp; What hotfix are you talking about?&nbsp; Used for what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Chkdsk is not a hotfix it's a disk checking tool, unless you suspect disk or file system problems
 there is no need to run chkdsk.<br />

            After I did complete restore and reinstalled all necessary software,and set internet server I defragged&nbsp; and setup to run a chkdsk,this is when the problem occured.I have gone through this process numerous times and never has chkdsk taken that long (at
 least 16 - 18 hours)After using microsoft community scanning through all I could read about this problem, I tried numerous attempts to correct chkdsk ,one community answer was about this hotfix file I don't know much about.The&nbsp; computer seems to run fine so
 far,I scanned for malicious viruses and said all was good.I'm just concerned that problems will still occur .<br />

            So the problem occurred at startup when the computer rebooted to run chkdsk?<br />
<br />
I don't know of any hotfix for Windows XP Chkdsk, what is this hotfix that you mention?<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer for the chkdsk log and post it here, the log is the Application section from source Winlogon.<br />
<br />
From a command prompt run chkdsk without parameters and redirect the output to file then post the contents of the file here, enter the following commands, pressing enter after each:<br />
<br />
chkdsk &gt;c:\ckdsk.txt<br />
c:\ckdsk.txt<br />

<p>Microsoft Account</p>
<p>The error code ox80070032 came up after downloading and installing windows updates and then it wouldn't Restart and that's when the error code came up also had trouble installing Security update for Microsoft office outlook 2007, KB2880510 which finally
 installed and that's when the restart came up with the error code on all updates that were listed installed but wouldn't restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>The freeze happens when the computer goes onto sleep itself. I can bring the computer back up to desktop but it is frozen and nothing works that's when I switch off at the wall.&nbsp;

            <p>I have done a clean boot. This fixed the update problem but didn't fix the freezing problem when the computer goes to sleep.
</p>
<p>The clean boot has caused another problem.&nbsp; when starting a clean boot you have to take computer off Normal startup, and untick the Hide all Microsoft services, this puts the computer onto Selective startup by clicking Load startup system.</p>
<p>But when I went to computer back into normal startup, this wouldn't happen.&nbsp; I found when I went to untick the Selective startup, I found that the box for Hide all Microsoft services was already unticked.
</p>
<p>Now the normal startup just won't stay ticked, when I follow all the proper procedures and do restart procedure, I found the computer keeps going back to Selective startup, with the box for Hide all Microsoft services unticked</p>

<h2>            Synaptics Touchpad scrolling works until restart then forgets its settings in Windows 10</h2>
                    My touchpad works great until I shut down or restart the computer.&nbsp; Then it forgets the settings and I have to go back in and enable scrolling, etc..&nbsp; What can I do to get it to remember its settings?&nbsp; Also, if I set the touchpad to show&nbsp;the static settings
 shortcut&nbsp;on the taskbar it will work until I restart or shut down and then the synaptic&nbsp;shortcut&nbsp;disappears.&nbsp; Same thing it doesn't retain the settings.&nbsp; BTW I did try to uninstall and reinstall the drivers.&nbsp; There was even a driver that windows 10 update
 installed but same result.

            <p><span>Hello Kostais,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A quick question before we begin. Did you upgrade to Windows 10 from a previous OS on the same computer?
</span></p>
<p><span>Also, let us know from where did you update the drivers for Synaptics Touchpad?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue check if latest drivers are available for Synaptics Touchpad and update the drivers through Windows Update. Make sure to restart your computer installing
 the latest/updated drive. Check if this works to resolve the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer and check for a solution to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Yes, I upgraded from windows 8.1.&nbsp; I was going to install a driver I had from HP for windows 8.1 but when I uninstalled the software (via programs and features)&nbsp;after the restart I decided to check windows update and that's where I got the driver it was
 installed from windows update Synaptics Click Pad Driver&nbsp;19.0.12.95&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW it is the same synaptics software that was installed previously for my touchpad.&nbsp; As I said, what is&nbsp;interesting to me is that I can go to the settings and set my&nbsp;touchpad to perform
 all of its functions but&nbsp;once you restart it forgets the settings and reverts back to its original state.&nbsp; Also, my notebook is an HP Envy Touchsmart if that is helpful.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to download and install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right click on the driver setup file and then select “Properties”.</p>
<p>2. Choose the “Compatibility” tab.</p>
<p>3. Place a check mark on “Run this program in compatibility mode”.</p>
<p>4. Choose “Windows&nbsp;8.1”.</p>
<p>5. Click on “Apply” and then “Ok”.</p>
<p>6. Try to install the drivers and check the issue.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please update us with the status. We will be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hello Sharief,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of that to no avail.&nbsp; But what did work was the new windows 10 driver on synaptics web site.&nbsp; Unfortunately, windows update decides that it has a newer driver (which it does not) and replaces it shortly after I install it.&nbsp; So, we are once again
 lost until MS and Synaptic get it together.&nbsp; I know that the new driver on the synaptic web site works because I had my wifi off while I tested it.&nbsp; This is a prime example of why MS should do updating for windows 10 as they have done in the past.&nbsp; That way
 I would be able to ignore the third party driver and I could stop re-setting up my mouse after every restart.&nbsp; I wish MS would sincerely consider giving back the opportunity to be alerted of updates and download and install them when and if I choose.&nbsp; This
 has saved me much pain in the past, especially when it comes to third party drivers.&nbsp; For example just this June many of us had an issue with an Nvidia driver update that created problems with many of the features in windows.&nbsp; We discovered the cause in this
 very forum and were able to revert back to an April driver solving our problem until Nvidia released a newer driver with a fix.&nbsp; Had we not been able to uninstall the driver and revert back without windows update interference it would have left us with only
 partially working operating systems.&nbsp; MS has taken the ability to fix and diagnose our issues away.&nbsp; I wish us all well.&nbsp; Now since I cant fix this problem please work on it post hast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, </p>

<div><br />
<strong>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Synaptics \ SynTP \ Install]</strong><br />
<strong>"DeleteUserSettingsOnUpgrade" = dword: 00000000</strong></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Then save with the name you want.<br />
Then change the file extension from "txt" to "reg"</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Then double click on the file created.<br />
Authorizing changes in the PC.<br />
Restart the PC.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Make the changes you want in the "Control Panel" then "Mouse", and then Synaptics.</p>

            <p>Yes, I have the exact same problem, the setting I choose do not remain upon restart.&nbsp; I did click on apply and ok. The touchpad settings that refuse to be changed cause page jiggling, scrolling up out of sight, changes in size of type either up or down.&nbsp;
 It is infuriating to have to reset these touchpad settings every time I turn on my pc.&nbsp; I originally had windows 8.1, came with new pc.&nbsp; Downloaded windows 10 and problems began.&nbsp; How do I fix this permanently?</p>

            <p>Hi ScottCramb, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For&nbsp;clarification purposes,&nbsp;I would like to ask as to what exactly do you mean by&nbsp;" link " your child account to your account?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with this, would you like to have the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Web filtering — Control the categories of websites your kids can view, or specify individual sites they may or may not access. SafeSearch is turned on for popular search sites such as Bing, Yahoo!, and Google.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Activity reports — Get reports on your kids' computer use: the websites your kids have visited or tried to visit, time spent on computers, and the games and programs they've used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Time restrictions — Limit the amount of time your kids use the computer, and specify the times of day they can use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Game restrictions — Limit the games your kids can play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Program restrictions — Limit the programs your kids can run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Let me know if you have any other concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ann </p>

<h2>            Upload Studio - record game clip button missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I want to record clips longer than the max 10mins supported by the default Xbox recorder, and I've read online that upload studio should allow to record clips up to 30mins. So I've downloaded the app looking for that record clip button, that I can see in all the tutorials online. The problem is that my app doesn't have the button at all. The only button I see is "manage my clips", but the "record new game clip" button, that is supposed to be just below that, is not there at all. I've tried to find solutions online, but apparently I'm the only one experiencing this problem. Is it something that someone have experienced? Do someone have some ideas on why? Some hints? Thank you all</p>

<br />If you happen to use an Apple device such as an iPhone, iPad, you might need to have this driver installed for compatibility. 
<br />
<br />For instance, if you are browsing an Apple device and you need to import pictures from it.

    <title>How do I get photo into the Pictures library&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hayhurst2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get photo into the Pictures library&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My video editing computer is running Windows 10 and I have an (S:\) drive for video Storage and a P:\ drive for photos. I want all my photos to be shown in the Pictures Library. For my videos I was able to do this by R clicking on the S:\ drive and clicking
 on "Include in" and choosing the Videos Library. This doesn't work for photos and I wonder what is different? When I R click on the P:\ drive and then choose "Include In" &gt; and choose the "Pictures" Library I get an error Window. The Window is labeled at the
 top "Windows Libraries" and inside the window it says: "The folders could not be included in Pictures. Why will Windows 10 not let me include all my folders of photos in my P:\ drive in the "Pictures" library? Any one know. My Windows 10 installation is an
 upgrade from Windows 7. I don't know of any other problems. I used Adobe Photoshop Elements 13 when I was using Windows 7&nbsp;and when I upgraded the OS to Windows 10 I installed a new Photoshop Elements 14. I did this by uninstalling&nbsp;Photoshop Elements 13 first
 and then installing Photoshop Elements 14. The new&nbsp;Photoshop Elements 14 uses all the photos normally and will accept edits I have done with the 13 version with no problems. Is there some way of getting all the photos from the P:\ drive into the Pictures&nbsp;Library
 without moving each folder separately? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Hayhurst,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have including pictures drive to libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a internal drive or a external drive?</p>
<p>What is the exact error message you get when you try to include the drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could occur if you don't have permissions. If&nbsp; it is a internal drive, I suggest you to take ownership of the drive and check if it works:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign on as an administrator on your machine.</li><li>Navigate to the folder where you're having the problem, Right-click and select Properties from the pop-up menu.</li><li>Under Properties | Security tab, click the Advanced button, then click "Change" owner on the Advanced Security Settings dialog (if you are already the owner, do this step anyway!), and in the resulting dialog enter whatever you want the owner to be, in
 my case it's my Microsoft account). </li><li>Now a new check-box appears labeled "Replace owner on subcontainers and objects"; check it.
</li><li>Also check the box at the bottom "Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object."
</li><li>Make sure under the Permission entries grid that your current account has Full control (if not Edit or Add your account to be listed with full control). Finally hit Apply. This may take a while.</li><li>If you don't follow the above Advanced procedure and just try to add permissions on the Security tab, you may get errors.</li></ol>
<p>Please reply with the results, we are happy to help&nbsp; you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 and old games</h2>
                    When an old&nbsp;game is started in a&nbsp;Windows 7 PC, the game process will be put on hold and an instance of rundll32.exe will load gameux.dll and start a process requiring Internet connectivity, (probably an update of some kind), if the user's PC is connected
 to the Internet, all goes well and the game launches few seconds later, but if&nbsp;the PC is&nbsp;offline, rundll32.exe will hang retrying indefinitely and consume a lot of CPU usage, killing that process will also kill the game and thus make the user unable to launch
 the game fault of not having an Internet connectivity, I know this issue have been around since probably Windows&nbsp;7 was initially launched, and that there are ways to overcome it, but I believe this behaviour should change and the the rundll32.exe process should
 stop after a number of retries and start the game instead, if you guys at Microsoft could implement this in one of the future updates, I will be quite glad.

            <p>What games are you speaking of ? Are they retail disk versions or Steam or other download ?</p>
<p>I've never had this problem with Win7, and the gameux.dll is still there on Win10 as well.
</p>
<p>I never used&nbsp; Game Explorer though. I had one look and though 'bloatware' and never used it,
</p>
<p>so maybe that's why I never had a problem ?</p>
<p>Or maybe it was if fixed in an early game related Windows Update (there were several early on) ?</p>
<br />
<p>This is only a community form. There are no 'you guys at Microsoft' here, and they wouldn't do anything
</p>
<p>if there were. You will have to use one of the fixes you have undoubtedly already read about.</p>
<p>- Win7 is on it's way out, and MS will not be changing <em>anything</em> between now and it's end of support.</p>
<p>Windows Updates from now to the end of support will be only security updates.</p>

            <p>Hello BoosDweeb,</p>
<p>And thank you for taking the time to read my post and respond to it, I had this issue recently with a retail disk game called Pariah,&nbsp;looking this issue through the Internet, I managed to understand why it happens and also find many different ways to bypass
 it,&nbsp;many of which aren't very pretty (including deleting registry entries or renaming or deleting gameux.dll), this may cause&nbsp;Windows to not function properly, so I was wondering if Microsoft devs&nbsp;could fix this in one of the future updates, but I believe
 you were right, I will be too much hoping for such a change (though I'm sure it's a minor one, only changing few lines in gameux.dll), Microsoft is starting to loose interest&nbsp;in it's aging OS, but I still believe issues like these should still be considered
 due to Windows 7 still dominant market share.</p>
