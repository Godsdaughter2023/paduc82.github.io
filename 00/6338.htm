<h2>            Can you freeze the column fields in pivot tables&#63;  If yes, Could you please tell show me how&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to Use two sheets in MS Excel 2007. Sheet 1 = Input sheet, sheet 2 = Pivot tables derived from sheet 1.&nbsp; Sheet 1 data will change periodically, and depending on the data, Pivot table columns shift from "left to right" or "right to left"&nbsp; Is there
 any way I can freeze these columns within pivot table, so that the columns do not shift(when the data is being changed in "Sheet 1".</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            Assuming that you have the same number of columns at all times, it sounds like you need to stop the PivotTable from sorting automatically. Under field settings, there should be an option to change this to manual. Then, you can order the columns however
 you like and it will stay that way.

<h2>            Groove Music&#47;Store app Music page.</h2>
                    I purchased an on sale album in the Windows Store and it says the album can be downloaded but when i try to download I get an error on all the songs in the album. The code is 0x800700a1 and says "item missing or can't get to it". Tried resetting Store
 in App list but still have the same issue. Unable to locate any viable solutions by search.

            I had already reset Store with no change, but ran the Troubleshooter still with no change. I am already signed in on an administrator Microsoft account and everything else associate with the account works well. Only this one on sale album is the problem.
 I can view the album and play it but it won't download showing the code I mentioned above.

            On the Mail app, if you're using a third party app like Norton or McAfee the security system could be uninstalling the app. I had a problem with Norton seeing my Microsoft Mail/Calendar app as a possible virus and removing it till I created a scan exclusion
 for the app and filed multiple complaints to both Norton and Microsoft and finally Norton started accepting the Mail installs and updates as valid.

            I checked that folder and there is no copy of the album in it, apparently something is amiss between the Store Music section, Groove Music and my computer; sync is getting lost somewhere and the album is invisible to Windows as far as downloading it although
 I paid for it. I can play it with Groove, so it is able to be discovered by Groove to add to its playlist but not for downloading.<br />

<p>Edited version:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked my Groove Music app. I clicked on "filter:" choose "purchased". This gave me all my purchased music. Then I choose one album and right click to choose "download". After couple of minutes I looked in C:\User\myname\Music\Purchases folder and
 there was complete album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using any third party antivirus I suggest you uninstall it and then see if you have same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no third party antivirus I believe insider trborgs suggestion to do clean install or maybe just wait for next insider update are reasonable solutions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your on sale album is playing but not on your pc then it plays from this "purchased" filter.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 not accepting outgoing server password</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up Outlook to receive email from my ISP (using POP) but send using my Gmail account so I can send and receive email while I'm away from home. I set up the outgoing smtp.gmail.com server so it requires authentication. I entered my Gmail
 account name and password as my logon credentials and required SPA. I also changed the outgoing port to 587 and selected TLS encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I try to send a message from Outlook, a dialog box appears requesting my user name and password. I enter them again, but the dialog box reappears. When I stop the process, and error message reports that my smtp server is not accepting my credentials.
 That doesn't seem correct because&nbsp;I can sign into my Gmail account using a browser and the same account name and password provided to Outlook.<br />

My activeysn 4.5 is not working at all.&nbsp; The message I get is: "Synchronization cannot be completed successfully.&nbsp; Reconnect your device and try again...."<br />

I've done a soft reset to my device, rebooted my computer, no luck.<br />

            I have a similar problem when I connect my HTC Touch phone to my XP sp3 machine--to fix it, I connect the device, then go to the File/Connection Settings menu--there's a checkbox that says "Allow USB connection", and I've found that it somehow randomly
 unchecks itself. &nbsp;After checking the box, the device syncs up for me. &nbsp;Kind of a pain in the pachoinker to have to go into the settings menu all of the time, but at least I can sync my device--that is, at least until the next Microsoft "software improvement".

<p>I'm using AS 4.5 and after installation of XP SP3 i see strange problem. I-mate JASJAM (which is using "USB to PC" in Connections) i can connect and syncronize without problem while I-mate JASJAR (using another driver
 and "Local area connection") can't be connected and sinchronized.I've tried everything from again reinstalling of AS 4.5 to trying to find solution on Microsoft sites. No result. JASJAM is working fine while JASJAR simply refuse to connect. Any idea, please?</p>

<p>For example <em>planning</em> and <em>material ordering</em> cannot happen until the

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

I just tested from my side. The Conditional format is not wiped out when I update the PivotTable. Could you confirm the following questions with us?<br />
1. is the PivotTable in the same workbook with the data source?<br />
2. What condition do you use?<br />
3. Could you share the Office version(File &gt; Account&nbsp;) and Windows version with us?</p>

<p>4. What if you make a new PivotTable?<br />
5. Does this happen to all the PivotTable? Is there any chance you could share a sample with us for further test via

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes Pivot and data are in same workbook.</p>
<p>Formatting was working and has now mysteriously stopped.</p>
<p>I tried reformatting, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Condition is a graded colour scale from the standard menu. I use this all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens to all Pivots now in this workbook and another workbook, but not in backup copies I have of these workbooks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I build a brand new PIvot in the same workbnook, the conditional formatting is ok - I can refresh and it does not drop out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebuilding all the pivots is NOT a solution. I have this occurring in a 2nd workbook as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I"m happy to share, how do I do this? The workbooks are close to 10mb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Version is:</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I just noticed if I conditional format the same formatting to more than one pivot, it disappears when I refresh.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the change?</p>

<p>So do you select data within more than one pivot and conditional format the entire selection?</p>
<p>I thought it was working for me, but now it's not, but it does work if I select each pivot table and format seperately - not so useful as more black and white - less overall gradiation.</p>

                    Daily for years I get Phishing emails. &nbsp;I report all of them, but keep getting the same ones that I have already reported in my Hotmail account. &nbsp;What does Microsoft actually do when I report these types of emails. &nbsp;I do notice that the email goes into
 my trash after clicking that it is a Phishing email, but don't they do anything else about it?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through the reports that you're sending us, we're able to know how these type of online thievery works and create necessary counter measures. For example, most Microsoft email programs come with built-in anti-phishing detection. This detection helps prevent
 fraudulent email messages from reaching you in the first place. Anti-phishing detection automatically deletes the email message or moves it to the junk folder depending on the degree of probability that it is a fraudulent message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are just one of the few things that Microsoft does to make sure that all our customers are safe from this type of fraudulent activities. To keep you safe from email and web scams, see

<p>
</p><p>Hi folks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep turning on my metered connection but it keeps popping back to non-metered all the time. I have checked&nbsp;all my setting, deleted the wifi connection, reinstalled it, done a hard reset on my lap removing all personal settings from 8.1 and started fresh
 with WIN10 TP and still it keeps popping back to non-metered. Now mind you that I have 100GB/month and on the 22:d I had to pay 299SEK to continue online at 4G speed and the other day another 299SEK to continue my work online at 4G speed. It's a wifi broadband
 connection.</p>
<p>My hubbies account on the same laptop has no faults. It stays on metered all the time.</p>
<p>What am I missing? Why does it keep popping back to non-metered all the PH..ing time?</p>

                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_win10-mso_2010/custom-footnote-numbering-on-word/c38ffac3-bc24-4691-9669-0bba9c40d814" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
What about using foreign language numerals? My installation is in English, which I prefer, but sometimes I want the footnotes in a Thai or Lao document to use the native language numerals. As&nbsp;Vonn Abeabe stated, this is already possible (for Thai, not&nbsp;for Lao)
 in numbered lists, but I cannot find a way to use the Thai numerals already recognized by Word as numbered footnotes.</p>

<p>Yes, these issues might be specific to Mac, since I realize there is less functionality in Office for Mac than there is in Office for Windows. I have an Office 365 subscription, with the latest version (15.40) on my brand new MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I implied earlier, I added Numbering to my Home ribbon, and apparently I have Thai enabled, although I wasn't able to follow your instructions earlier about enabling editing in Thai, since there is no Options menu on Word for Mac 2016, and so many other
 things have been moved around. Anyway, in Numbering, Word already offers me the option of making lists using the Thai alphabet (ก, ข, ค, etc), Thai numerals (๑, ๒, ๓, etc), or even Thai numbers spelled out (หนึ่ง, สอง, สาม, etc), but I have none of these options
 in the footnotes dialog box. In the Tools &gt; Language menu, I have identified the text as Thai, which apparently enabled the Thai dictionary in the Review &gt; Spelling &amp; Grammar menu. I don't know if there is anyplace else to tell Word that I am using Thai that
 would, in turn, enable Thai numerals in footnotes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a separate issue, Lao is not currently supported in MS Office. In Excel, I did add the Lao alphabet in Preferences &gt; Custom Lists, so that I can fill cells in alphabetical order in Lao, and I did the same in Thai. I also added a third-party app called
 Dictionaries, which identifies word boundaries using a Hunspell dictionary, since there are no spaces between words in either Thai and Lao, although Word was already able to identify word breaks in Thai because of the embedded dictionary. So I'm still interested
 in VBA and macros if they will enable me to improve the Lao functionality in Word and/or Excel for things like footnote numbering, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help and for taking an interest in my dilemma.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I missed your last reply, but</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;&lt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;since there is no Options menu on Word for Mac 2016, and so many other things have been moved around.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&gt;&gt;<br />
</span>Where Windows apps tend to have "Options", Mac has "Preferences" under the app's menu, i.e. in this case Word-&gt;Preferences. Also, on Mac, a lot of things are still in the "traditional" menu structure at the top of the screen (I would guess that choice
 has been made for backwards compatibility reasons and because you always have to have such a menu on Mac, so why not use it?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you will not find much in there to do with language choices - except perhaps for an East Asian language choice. On Mac Office, the "division of labour" amongst the various different language choices is different from on Windows - some of the choices
 made at "Word/Office" level on Windows Word have to be made at "Mac OS-&gt;Preferences level" on Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the whole, though, I suspect that the omission of "non-Latin" numbering sequence options from footnote/endnote numbering could be just an oversight on Mac Word. It would probably make sense to report it via the "smiley" mechanism - click the smiley icon
 near the top right of the screen and take it from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without built-in support for Lao numbering sequences, using VBA to insert or modify existing number sequences is probably your only option. In that case you basically cannot rely on automatic numbering, so at some point you have to replace any automatic
 numbering with manual numbering - as far as footnote &amp; endnote numbering are concerned, it would probably be simplest to apply automatic numbering in some other numbering format until you are ready to publish your document, then have a macro to replace the
 numbering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to try and do that with VBA. let me know and perhaps we could make some progress on that front.</p>

<p>Try going to TOOLs&gt;Internet Options&gt;Programs and Reset Websettings.<br />

Then run a file check (sfc /scannow) which will restore any damaged files in IE - the instructions are on this link:-<br />

    <title>Does PC Suite backup SMS messages&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyst---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does PC Suite backup SMS messages&#63;</h2>
                    Hi - I've spent ages browsing Nokia's site and don't seem to be able to find the one bit of info I need.<br />
My sister has an old 6170 and has just bought a 6300. She wants to transfer all the contacts and SMS from the old phone to the new.<br />
What's the best way to go about it? Do I have to get PC Suite or is there an easier way. Everything I read about PC Suite goes on about backing up movies and music, but nothing about SMS (which is probably what most people use their phones for!)<br />
If PC Suite is the only way it's going to be a pain cos we use Macs and I'll have to try and get it to work under a Virtual PC emulator.<br />
Any help is gratefully received!<br />
Andy

            PC Suite does backup the SMS in phone memory. If those text messages are in the SIM card, you need to copy them to the phone memory first.<br />
<br />
You can then restore the backuped .nbu file to the new phone.

            Thanks for that! The SIM will move into the new phone so I assume all contacts and messages on it go as well. It's only the messages in the phone itself she's worried about losing.

<p>ok, so I can take the backup file I just made (2009-02-08 N76.nbu) which has:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>user files from the phone memory</li><li>contacts</li><li>calendar</li><li>notes</li><li>messages</li><li>bookmarks</li><li>Nokia device specific backup</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.. and put on another phone if need be? the LCD stopped working on my N76 and I'm going to send it in for repair. Fortunately I'm able to connect this phone to Nokia Ovi Suite to access the phone.&nbsp; Ideally, I'd be able to pull the messages and notes off
 and be able to view them while my phone's gone.&nbsp; But I guess I can wait until my phone comes back to see these items.&nbsp; However, if this phone's declared dead or something and won't come back, I'm wondering what I can do with this .nbu file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't care to much about the contacts or calendar because I sync my phone w/ my via my 15" MacBook Pro running Leopard via iSync - I can put all that stuff back on.&nbsp; (I use the Nokia Ovi Suite on Windows XP being run on Parallels)</p>

<p>You had suggested using Noki to open and extract the .nbu file. I was able to use Ovi Suite's content copier to take the .nbu file and move its contents onto my N79.&nbsp; however, I wasn't able to pick and choose things I wanted. Perhaps w/ the Noki program,
 I would have been able to do that? It's no big deal moving all the texts, contacts, etc., but it would have been a little nice to do some house cleaning along the way.</p>

<p>Hiya</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>After searching for ages to acually get somewhere i found this post, thank u al_lea for posting about Noki.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>A question if anyone knows the answer, my phone screen is blue and i can't use it, however did manage to use PC suite and did a back up of my phone contents. I have a nokia 6085 and in the book it says all texts are saved to phone memory
 and i didn't think from what i've read you could get them off, but i wanted too so had a go!.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>When i use Noki to view it all, it says text messages, inbox: 679, which sounds about right. But i can only view 50 of them, anyone know why this is?. In my phone u cannot move texts to sim card or to phone memory they are in phone memory
 and that's it but i don't understand why i can only see some of them. Any idea how i can get them all?.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Confused</font></p>

            Hi RaghuramP,<br />
<br />
Webex has not yet released an app for Windows Phone, although we'd love it if they did. I would suggest you "hound" WebEx to create either a specific Windows Phone app and/or request for functionality via the Mobile IE9 web browser (perhaps via HTML 5, since
 Adobe announced Flash for mobile is basically dead).<br />
<br />
Here is a link to <a href="http://www.webex.com/mobile/mobilefaq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WebEX's Mobile FAQ</a>. On their web site, they do state "Other Smartphones - join WebEx meetings from the web browser on your smartphone. No download required!." If it's not recognizing the Mobile IE9 browser, than they need to change some coding on their
 end. Maybe it's time for a few customers to start calling them on their statement!<br />
<br />
I hope this helps!<br />
David<br />

    <title>Database design and relationships - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apteceiba  say:</h3>
<h2>            Database design and relationships</h2>
                    <p>I am struggling with my datbase design, in particular the relationships between my tables. This is possibly because my application is a non-typical use for Access. What I am trying to do is collect information from customers, that will be used to auto-generate
 a number of documents. Therefore I will have few records, and many fields, which from my understanding lessens the requirement for indexing, and makes it difficult to see where I would create relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is not my application, but puts what I am&nbsp;doing in a setting more familar. Say I am a company which decorates and furnishes newly built houses. I want to get customer information from an extensive questionnaire which asks what they want by
 way of finishings (floor type, lamps, curtains, colour of paint, fittings, etc) and the furniture to be bought for each room (beds, tables, chairs, etc). It seems logical to break the house down into rooms, and each becomes a table. Once the information is
 complete, I will use this to generate purchanse orders, tenders for sub-contractors, a work plan, job description and proceedure, cost estimate, etc. [As a final product I want Access to provide all my fields to a merge with Word to generate my documents].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I therefore create a number of tables, one for each&nbsp;room in the house. While they are all related in the sense they pertain to the same house,&nbsp;I don't see an obvious way of setting up relationships in the typical customers/products type. Is it possible to
 set up pseudo-relationships not based on any particular field (autogenerate and index)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example, theoretically I could have just one record, with&nbsp;several hundred fields. But it would still be beneficial to create many smaller tables rather than one large one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In practice, I would probably like to keep track of changes to the customer choices, so I was contemplating recording the date whenever the customer changes any item, and&nbsp;creating a new record. In this way I could autogenerate the&nbsp;PK.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could also (although not indispensible) keep data from multiple customers in the same database, so could have a composite field consisting of "customername"+"date". Even so, I don't see the number of customers (max 100) and their responses (even 20 each)
 exceeding the number of fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do need to link the tables in some way, for example to query "paint" to get the paint requirements for the whole house, and then maybe bathroom and kitchen to get the "plumbing fittings".&nbsp;So I do need to establish relationships, but don't know how to&nbsp;go
 about it. Any suggestions would be gratefully appreciated (please bear in mind that the example is an analogy of my actual application). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            With the hypothetical scenario which you have outlined the problem is not that this would be an untypical use for a database, but that by setting it up in the way you describe, you would be using Access to in effect create something more akin to an Excel
 workbook than a relational database.<br />
<br />
A relational database is a model of the underlying reality in terms of its entity types, the attributes of those entity types and the relationship types between the entity types.&nbsp; A relationship type is itself a special kind of entity type so can have its own
 attributes, e.g. UnitPrice and Quantity are non-key attributes of a relationship&nbsp; type between Orders and Products, the relationship type in this case being modelled by a table OrderDetails (see Northwind for an example).<br />
<br />
A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle (also known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codd%27s_12_rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Codd's Rule #1</a>).&nbsp; This requires that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables, and in no other way.&nbsp; So by having separate tables for each room this rule
 is being violated as values of attribute RoomType are being modelled as table names.<br />
<br />
Another fundamental basis of the database relational model is that data is not stored redundantly, i.e. each 'fact' must be contained once and once only in the database.&nbsp; So a table of addresses which has columns for City and State contains redundant data in
 that we are told for instance that San Francisco is in California multiple times, once for each address in San Francisco.&nbsp; This is not just wasteful; more importantly it undermines the integrity of the database by allowing for update anomalies in that there
 is nothing to stop San Francisco being entered in California in one row and Colorado in another.&nbsp; Redundancy is eliminated, or at least reduced as far as possible, by the process of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Normalization</a> which decomposes a table into a set of related tables in which each non-key column is functionally determined solely by the whole of the primary key.&nbsp; (Third Normal
 Form - 3NF).&nbsp; There are higher normal forms beyond this, but in most cases a table normalized to3NF will be normalized to the higher normal forms without the need for further decomposition.<br />
<br />
So how do we apply these principles to your hypothetical model?&nbsp; Firstly of course there should not be separate tables per room.&nbsp; Instead there should be a table RoomTypes, a table Properties and to model the many-to-many relationship type between then a table
 PropertyRooms.&nbsp; So property with three bathrooms for instance would have three rows in PropertyRooms each with the same PropertyID and RoomTypeID value, and to distinguish them a RoomNumber column with values 1, 2 and 3 respectively in each row.&nbsp; Similarly
 for other room types in the property.<br />
<br />
On the same principle that data is only stored as values at column positions in rows in tables, there should not be a separate column per Finishing, but a table Finishings, and a further table to model the many-to-many relationship type between PropertyRooms
 and Finishings.&nbsp; This table will have a column to hold the values of the finishing in question, this column itself being a foreign key referencing a table of finishing values, which itself would be categorized by having a foreign key referencing a table of
 finishing categories.&nbsp; It would also have a date column so that changes&nbsp; in customer choices can be logged.<br />
<br />
If each property relates to only one client then the properties table would simply require a foreign key ClientID column referencing the primary key of a Clients table.&nbsp; If it can relate to more than one client than you'd need a further table to model the many-to-many
 relationship type between the properties table and Clients table.<br />
<br />
With a correctly normalized model like this you'll see that it is characterized by a set of table with relatively few columns each, but many rows.&nbsp; This is as it should be, tall skinny tables being a sign of a good design, short fat ones of a bad one.<br />
<br />
When it comes to outputting this as documents you can create the necessary Word templates and use queries in your database as the data source for a merge, or you can insert data from Access into bookmarks in a Word document, or into a Word table in a document.&nbsp;
 However, Access itself has a good report designer, so you might well be able to avoid the need for merging altogether.&nbsp; It largely depends on to what degree you might want to use the fancy formatting which Word is capable of, over and above what can be done
 in an Access report.<br />

            <p>Ken, thanks for the detailed and educational reply. I agree whole-heartedly, that I don't need a relational database for the application I am attempting, but let me give you some background on how I arrived at Access. This will be the second (and most likely
 the last) database application I will have written. I approach it from being a consultant in the geological sciences with sufficient background in computers to attempt to write something myself, rather than hire someone to do it for me. This, to me, means
 I can continue to develop and refine as required. On the other hand, I don't want to become a professional database programmer, so you have to understand the limits of my aspirations here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent a couple of months researching some of the alternatives. I really need the final documents to be in Word, with suffcient formatting options to appear "professional". I also need a front end to gather my customer details that needs to be flexible
 in a number of areas. My perception was that doing everything in Word would not work (at least without learning VB). I looked at a number of form and document generation software applications, but all seemed limited on either the front end options, or the
 document output formats. Hence, I decided that Access was probably my best bet (I had previous experience with Foxpro for Dos). I won't bother in going into the specifics of my requirements here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As my example was an analogy of my application, I need to consider your recommendations in light of my database details. But it does lead me to the question "Is it necessary to have a professional and optimized database structure (in terms of relationships)
 for the application I am proposing, which doesn't attempt to take advantage of the "relational" part of a relational database?". You say that tall and skinny is better than short and fat, which would be true if I wanted to design a traditional relational database.
 But as I'm not, aesthetics aside, what is the downside of short and fat? Apart from being unwieldly, I can see advantages of combining my fields into larger tables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realise that I am probably using the wrong tool, and asking advice to do something that goes against the standard principles. However, I just need something that is "fit for purpose", preferably with the minimum of aggro.
</p>

            Don't imagine that I'm a database developer, professional or otherwise, who sees the purity of the relational model as paramount without regard to the functionality of the database.&nbsp; Like you I come to databases from a different professional basis, as
 an environmental planning officer in my case, and databases are merely a tool of the trade.<br />
<br />
Nothing you've said leads me to believe that there's any reason why modelling the reality by means of a set of correctly normalized tables would not be the right way to go in your case.&nbsp; There is one fundamental reason why I say this, which is that, because
 the model is expressed formally, if the model accurately reflects the reality it will consistently behave in the same way as the reality.&nbsp; All my experience using relational databases over the years has convinced me of this key fact.<br />
<br />
At a practical level inserting data into a well designed database should be very straightforward; one thing I've said to people many times over the years is that if you get the logical model right the interface will by and large design itself, i.e. the structure
 of the interface will be to a large degree self-evident from the structure of the model.&nbsp; As for output, that can be in whatever format you want.&nbsp; Because the data goes in tall and skinny doesn't mean it can't come out short and fat; that's what pivot tables
 and crosstab queries are for.<br />
<br />
While I'm more than happy to pass on what I've learned over the years about putting a relational database together, with the best will in the world I'm afraid I'm not in a position to help where Access is merely being used as a medium for collecting and storing

            <p>I can definitely see some areas where I can make smaller related tables, along the lines you suggested in your first reply. But in others, relationships are less obvious. However, I am now looking at the project from a different viewpoint, so it make take
 a while to uncover the correct logical model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This begs another question. If my application (overall) doesn't benefit from the relational datbase model, would it not be better to create a set of&nbsp;smaller database applications, that individually&nbsp;can be&nbsp;optimised for&nbsp;Access?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use my decorator contractor analogy, I could have&nbsp;one database for Paint for example, in&nbsp;which there would be relationships between types of room&nbsp;(PropertyID), RoomTypeID, types of Paints (PaintID), etc. In this case, while&nbsp;a collection of smaller databases
 all relate to the same House, and therefore can be related to ClientID, PropertyID, with few clients and houses, to me the separtion into smaller&nbsp;applications would be workable, and could be joined outside of Access. [Remember, my application is for the Oil

<p>Or am I missing a fundamental of database design, and that every project, if it is conceived as overall project, will always have relationships, and therefore can be normalised&nbsp;as you say. If this is the case, would you have examples that deal with normalisation
 of databases that aren't the ordinary ProductID, CustomerID type?</p>

            First, assuming your application is very similar to your analogy in that it collects information from a questionnaire, then you start off right there with the need for a&nbsp;relational&nbsp;database. The mode for a questionnaire is pretty specific. It goes like
 this:
<div><br />
<div>tblQuestion</div>
<div>QuestionID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>Question</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblRespondent</div>
<div>RespondentID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>FirstName</div>
<div>LastName</div>
<div>other info about Respondent</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblResponse</div>
<div>ResponseID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>RespondentID (FK)</div>
<div>ResponseDate</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblAnswer</div>
<div>AnswerID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>QuestionID (FK)</div>
<div>Answer</div>
<div><br />
<div>This would make it easy to query tblAnswer and generate other documents based on the answers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like Ken I subscribe to tall and skinny. It makes for a much more&nbsp;usable&nbsp;application.</div>

            I don't think separating a model into a set of databases, in modelling terms a set of different schemas or logical models, will help; it could introduce other problems. Insurance companies have come up against this when they try to integrate data from
 separate systems to bring all policies together after a takeover of one company by another.&nbsp; I recall hearing of one case where this resulted in policies being related to the wrong policy holders.&nbsp; But even if we rule something like that out as a possibility
 I don't see any advantages ensuing.<br />
<br />
Continuing your decoration analogy, rather than having separate files per house you just have a Houses table which can be related to one or more clients, and to multiple room types, with the latter relationship type (modelled by a table, remember, so also an
 entity type) related to multiple paints. This is a simple model, but the same principles apply if the complexity of the model is extended.&nbsp; In essence the process is pr4etty straightforward:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Identify the entity types.<br />
<br />
2&nbsp; Identify the attributes of those entity which are determined solely by the whole of the key, e.g. city in my addresses example, where city is determined solely by the key (you know the address, you know the city), but not state which is not only determined
 by the key, but also by the non-key attribute city (you know the city, you know the state; note that we are talking about the city as an entity not the city name here, which can legitimately be duplicated).<br />
<br />
3. Identify the relationship types between the entity types.&nbsp; Some will be unary (1-way) and represented by a foreign key in a table, e.g. a State column in a cities table; others will be binary (2-way), ternary (3-way) etc and modelled by a table which resolves
 the many-to-many relationship type into two or more one-to-one relationship types, as with the OrderDetails example I gave earlier.<br />
<br />
To establish the logical model use an entity relationship diagram, something invented by Peter Chen in 1976 and akin to a flow chart, with tables represented by boxes and relationship types by directional lines between the boxes.&nbsp; Do this on paper before creating
 the file in Access.&nbsp; Mentally test the model by asking as many questions as you can think of to see if it will cope reliably, e.g. can the model tell me how many litres of Oxford blue I will need for use in the kitchens in 4-bedroom houses in Stafford, England.&nbsp;
 Only when you are satisfied that the model is robust should you create the file.<br />
<br />
You'll have perhaps noticed my quote from Richard Feynman below my signature.&nbsp; Whether he in fact said this I haven't a clue, but William Hurt did when playing him in the film The Challenger, and it is certainly in the spirit of his writings.&nbsp; It is very apposite
 to many of the posts we receive where we give people a solution to a problem, which they try to implement, but without understanding how what we are telling them works.&nbsp; If you are not familiar with the principles of the database relational model, be sure
 to do some background reading first.&nbsp; You don't need to read Codd or Date from cover to cover; the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wiki article</a> on the subject is not a bad starting point, and the concepts discussed should not present any difficulties for you with your scientific background.

            <p>Thanks to Ken and Scott's replies, I am seeing relationships within my application, and have an idea how to proceed with the design. However, I am still having a problem with some aspects, so perhaps I can pose some specific questions to solicit solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, I want my customers to give me their preferences for light fittings. I can create a "rooms" table and a "light fittings" table&nbsp;in a many-to-many relationship. This would give me what type of fittings would go in each room. My problem is
 that I want to force a response to every possible choice. So I would like the customer to declare a preference for all possible combinations (I see the solution to be a matrix, rather than relational). So for each room, and type of light fittings, I would
 get one of 3 or more responses (Yes, No, Depends on Price, etc) for each combination. So for the living room, the customer would not just list one preference, but says yes to ceiling light, no to wall lights, maybe to chanderlier depending upon the price,
 no to lamp stands. This gives me a complete picture of my customer preferences, and prevents a later "oh I hadn't thought of a lamp stand in the bedroom". Is there a way to do this in the relational database model?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of my application is auto-generation of documents in Word, so Access will need pass unique fieldnames to Word. In a relational sense, I suppose the unique part is created by "tablename"+"fieldname". This could potentially produce some unwieldly
 merge fieldnames. Is this a problem, and should I take it into consideration when naming fields and tables?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; I want to keep track of changes to my customer responses, so as Scott suggests, a field with ResponseDate(+time?). How does that relate to all the other tables? Do I have to&nbsp;include the ResponseDate field in all tables (and update all tables at the same
 time). Intuitively this doesn't seem to be an efficient use of&nbsp; the relational aspect, but no doubt I am missing a trick here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            1.&nbsp; Forcing a response to each possible question could be done by requiring some validation code to ensure that there is a row for each house/room/fitting in the table which model the relationship type between the three entity types.&nbsp; This can't be done
 as part of the logical model, however, as a row must exist in each referenced table before a row can be inserted into a&nbsp; referencing table.&nbsp; You'll find an example as Families.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
This simple little demo file illustrates two methods of forcing at least one family member to be entered per family.&nbsp; Usually a form/subform would be used for this, and with this method in the demo the code in the parent form's module checks for a row in Families
 with no matching records in Family Members.&nbsp; It does this in the parent form's Current event procedure, for when a user moves off a family record, and in the form's Unload event procedure for when a user tries to close the form.&nbsp; If it finds a family with
 no members it informs the user and navigates back to that record.<br />
<br />
With your hypothetical scenario, however, the number of rows per room/light fitting type would be predetermined, so another option, and probably a simpler one would be to automatically insert the rows into the table modelling the relationship type by building
 and executing an 'INSERT INTO' SQL statement in code when a row is inserted into the relevant referenced table.&nbsp; The rows inserted would be determined by what type of fittings which are appropriate for the room, e.g. all rooms would require light fittings,
 but only bathrooms would require shower fittings.&nbsp; Which rooms require what would be inherent in the model.&nbsp; The user would then be presented with the set of questions as rows in a subform, in which they then would supply the answer to each by selecting from
 a combo box of possible answers.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The table and column names are immaterial to the output, which is determined by the queries.&nbsp; These can return whatever terms you wish as aliases for the table and/or column names.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; You only include the ResponseDateTime column in one table.&nbsp; Which table you include it in depends on which entity type it is an attribute of, i.e. by which table's key is it functionally determined.&nbsp; With Scott's simple model it is assumed that a respondent
 supplies all answers to a questionnaire on one occasion.&nbsp; If you wish to track answers to each question temporally the date/time would be an attribute of the answers table.&nbsp; For an example of a database for building simple questionnaires take a look at the
 file Questionnaire.zip in my SkyDrive folder at the link I gave above.&nbsp; This file assumes a single date per response to a questionnaire, so the ResponseSessionDate column is in the ResponseSessions table.<br />

            1) I go along with Ken's&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;to pre-populate your table with all the options. So, if you are going to ask the user to make a choice for each type of light fitting, then you would run an Append query appending all the light fitting options to
 the junction table for the customer and room. You can then test to see if any of those values are not filled in before you close the form.
<div><br />
<div>2) What Ken said</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) Again, I agree with Ken. If you are "surveying" your customers at different times and expect them to complete the entire survey, then you would add a record to tblResponse with the date and then the ResponseID would become a FK for all the answers.
 But if you want customers to update only specific answers, then you can either add a modified date to the Answers table, or use an Audit trail. An Audit trail will create a record in a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;table that lists the table and recordID that was changed, the
 old and new values, the date/time it was changed and who changed it.</div>

            This has happened to me several times. The only way that I was able to correct is to do a fresh install. I know it is a pain.

    <title>Failure to connect to web sites - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trusteduser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure to connect to web sites</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Greetings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Whenever Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, or any other browser fails to reach a web site, one gets an error message that says "This page cannot be reached.", "So-and-so is taking too long to respond." or something to this effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am from Pakistan, where the quality of service provided by the ISPs is zilch. I know it for a fact that 99.99 times in the case of a failure to access a site, it the ISP at fault.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if it is possible to configure IE and Edge in a way that if a site is not being accessed, the browser clearly points a finger the ISP. I am sure this would help ISP customers in Pakistan to pull up their socks, stand up for their rights as
 customers and complain to the ISPs more frequently. I use multiple Internet services. Whenever there is repeated failure in accessing a site, I run Network Diagnostics, take a screen shot of the result and email it to half a dozen executives at the concerned
 ISP, ANDposting the grabs on various Social Media sites. The net result is that, so far as my accounts are concerned, the ISP's services have improved dramatically. A bonus is that those living in my vicinity also experience less problems regarding ISP services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Greetings Raymond,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I myself own and manage a number of domains and web sites, so, about those I am always sure that they do exist. My web sites are hosted by a company in the USA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My S O P is that if the browser reports inaccessibility of a web site, I immediately try to access major sites such as Google, Times London, Hotmail, Indian Express, The Australian, WSJ,&nbsp; etc.. This selection gives me an almost worldwide reach. It is
 well nigh impossible for ALL these sites to be down at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Yes, we do use multiple devices, multiple ISPs, and multiple browsers. In the room I am at present, there are always two laptops and 3 desktops doing something. All the machines in this location have at least 4GB RAM and 3Ghz or better processors, and
 identical software configurations. Each machine has its individual Internet connectivity, we do not share Internet connections. The machine I am working on right now has the slowest clock speed, 133Ghz. So, if 4 computers can access a certain web site and
 one cannot, we can safely assume with reasonable surety that the ISP connecting that machine to the Internet isn't delivering on its promise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. We also use real-time network connection monitoring, and know what speeds we are getting at any given moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Possibly, I failed to put across what I intended to say. My experience on the Internet in Pakistan is&nbsp; that 99.99 per cent of the time failure to reach a web destination is due to the poor quality of the Internet connection. If a so-called high-speed
 broadband connection delivers speeds in <strong>BYTES</strong>, no user is going to get anywhere. In Pakistan, and other countries in the South Asian region, an ISP not functioning as per connection specifications for a part of the day is a daily occurrence.
<strong>I would love to see some browser report something such as "You cannot get connected to http://www. . . . .com because right now your Internet connection is delivering speeds of 65 bytes per second."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Our IdeaMines team is active countrywide in Pakistan. Everyone of them follows exactly the same S O Ps, including those outlined above in the case of failure to access web sites. Sadly, Internet connectivity issues are also the same everywhere in Pakistan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Browsers explicitly reporting ISP connectivity issues would be very useful for ISP customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the interest in this issue, and regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>No.&nbsp; It isn't even possible to "clearly" show that using the F12 Developer Tools.&nbsp; You would have to use a Network tracer such as Message Analyzer (or NetMon or WireShark)&nbsp; to see enough to be able to draw such an inference.&nbsp; In fact, often the cause is
 misconfigured security packages which tend to treat newly updated versions of a browser as possible Trojans and therefore block the requests "silently".</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 pop up and drop down menus won&#39;t stay open.</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with my office 2010 programs. &nbsp;This is happening in excel, word, publisher, and powerpoint. &nbsp;When I right click in the open document, the pop up menu will not stay open long enough to click on anything. &nbsp;Same thing with the drop down
 menus for fonts. &nbsp;This is only happening in Office. &nbsp;Not on my browser, on the desktop, nowhere but office. &nbsp;I have tried looking for add ons, there aren't any other than onenote, I created another user account, checked for updates, called Microsoft, scanned
 for virus and malware in safe mode, even did a system restore in safe mode. &nbsp;Nothing is helping and the tech desk people at Microsoft do not comprehend what the issue is. &nbsp;They keep asking what error code I am getting and if it is all documents I am having
 problems opening. &nbsp;I need help. &nbsp;Please share your computer wisdom with me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information, I am running a lenovo w530 64 bit with windows 7 pro and office 2010 pro. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Edge doesn't use that location for storing favorites... so changes there will not be reflected in Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you're describing a fairly common problem where favorites just tend to magically disappear (typically associated with a windows update).&nbsp; For some, it happens more than once... and for countless thousands of others, it never happens at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There apparently isn't a fix yet, but we're hoping that the new version of Edge that's coming in about a week will solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>So, about the only thing that we can offer is a way to perform a backup and restore of your favorites for the next time this happens. (Yeah, I know...)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>There are two approaches... a simple one that only works if you're using the Edge "Sync your content" feature, and a more turn-key version where you install a 3rd-party application</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>1) If you are using Sync your content, you can copy the contents of the %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState for safe keeping.&nbsp; And then just copy it back after a crash/reset</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>2) You can use the free 3rd-party <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EdgeManage</a> application to perform a backup/restore (plus many more features).&nbsp; This technique works without regard to the "Sync your content" settings.</div>

<h2>            S60 V3.1 OVI maps free license.</h2>
                    
<p>I know the free license for S60 3rd edition, Feature Pack 1 devices haven't come yet :smileysad:(except for E71 and E66). But nokia can give our poor old devices working on FP1 free navigation license for life time.<br />
<br />
As they used to provide free voice guided navigation for free for a week (or 7 days). So the same way they could provide our devices with free navigation for lifetime&nbsp;:smileywink: if they can’t make new version of maps then.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The OVI maps 3.0 works flawlessly in N82, N95. If nokia somehow decides to give the activation key for lifetime navigation then we all users would be very grateful.<br />
<br />
So anybody who likes this post could support me and please give kudos to me:smileywink:..<br />
We can mail this post to nokia and if they listens poor chap’s cry then we would also be among the ones using free navigation in our phones!<br />
<br />
Cheers..:)</p>

            Nokia already gave an announcement that other s60 3.1 devices will not support free satnav. But I was wondering, is 9 euro really too much for a license for you? Its already what, 10% of the old price.

<p>Nope, the price isn't the matter here. The matter is about injustice with older models especially the flagship model N95 of &nbsp;year 2006.<br />
Doesn't nokia care about their earlier flagships chum?</p>

<p>So where does the buck stop? It is nothing to do with not caring about older phones. They have to draw the line somewhere. 4 years is a long time when it comes to things like this. I bought a laptop last year with Vista. I don't think any amount of persuasion
 on my part will get me a free Windows 7 upgrade even though if I had bought the same laptop 3 months later, it would have been shipped with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, at the end of the day, I own an N95-2 so I know how you feel.&nbsp; But fair is fair. This free license was not part of the deal when I made the conscious decision to buy this phone so I don't expect anything. However, just like you, it would be a nice
 gesture on Nokia's part if they did back port it to the N95's.</p>

            Well, even if it was flagship, the fact is, its 4 years old. Just like the free Win7 update analogy used by cjlim above. Its not about caring, but they do have to sell newer models as well. If they backport it to every phone they made, why bother making
 newer phones to sell? The newer phones wouldnt be as attractive.

<p>Yeah you are right:)! i think now i should get another cheap phone out there like 5230 or so :(. This phone will let me get the free navigation too. And my older phone would do other things which 5230 couldn't do it.<br />
<br />
Even if i want to get license for my N82 so whats the tariff plans of it?<br />
<br />
Ok, could you tell me why couldn't i get 3D landmarks in my maps "Nokia_Maps_3.01_2602_3.1"?<br />
Doesn't this version support 3D landmarks?</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, I also have an N95 so I know how it feels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see the new much reduced license fees when you try to purchase the license. They are in around €10 per region per yer and €3 per region per month. A typical region would be like all of Europe or all North America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3D landmarks are actually in the map data and is only available for some but not all urban areas and cities. Try downloading the map data for London and you should see it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problem regarding the bing-ads testing.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I am facing problem with bing-ads testing using sandbox. As, whenever I create a new campaign in bing-ads using sandbox the campaign is created but the ads wont run as its shows the error that "payment method need to be mentioned". But this should not be asked
 as sandbox testing provides the free code testing environment.<br />
please provide solution regarding the problem as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
<br />
with regards,<br />
Vishal Agrawal<br />
