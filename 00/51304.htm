    <title>New console&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New console&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Right, this is starting to annoy me..</p>
<p>I have recently bought some brand new games which I believe has some 'new disk format'. DiRT3, L.A. Noire &amp; Brink.</p>
<p>I can play DiRT for ages until the sound goes off and I have to restart my Xbox console. L.A. Noire and Brink on the otherhand freezes, cancels out the sound and says disk unreadable. I've looked this up online and there are talks online about replacement
 consoles as the 'new disk format' doesn't work on Premium and Arcade Xbox's.</p>
<p>If anyone can post below this to inform me whether or not I'm entitled to a new Xbox or not as it peeves me off spending Â£40 on new games and then them not working properly. This is unfair if I have to buy a new Xbox just for the games to work as I've had
 no say in any 'disk formats' for new games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>James</p>

<p><em>From what I have seen that update affected a very small number of older consoles.<br />
To be sure whether yours was one or not it might be an idea to phone support for your region, make sure you have the consoles id handy when you call them.<br />

<p>Hi Gabriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the concern, we'll be needing additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to log in on the computer before receiving the error?</li><li>&nbsp;Was the issue only happening when you are using Windows Defender?</li><li>&nbsp;Can you send us a screenshot of the error?</li></ul>

                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please Help! My HP laptop has been frequently shutting down or frozen by its own throughout of all this week.
 Every time I start to boot it up, it always goes into automatic repair loop. I used to have this problem before but I fix it last time with command prompt. When automatic repair failed it is normal for a blue screen to pop up with the options: continue to
 windows 10, troubleshoot and turn off your PC. Now it doesn't display the option to continue to windows 10. It only has two options: troubleshoot and turn off your PC. I've tried everything. Now after the failure of automatic repair, it loads me to a choose
 your keyboard screen then to advanced options. So weird. Again I don't have the option to continue to windows 10 normally. My laptop is stuck in this loop, I tried to system restore and command prompt but it didn't work. Is there any other way to fix this?</span>

            Hi Ruby.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  Try Last Known Good Configuration and then Safe Mode with Networking.
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesnât fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesnât work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Asack.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you get into Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode accessed by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If not I'd Reset it choosing the deep clean option since someone else might have returned it.   <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-reset-your-pc-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-re...</a>
<br />
<br />See how to get to Reset via the Repair Mode accessed one of these methods:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

            That's why I gave you detailed steps to create and use bootable media for repairs in case you couldn't get into Safe Mode or the Repair Mode to attempt the repairs.  
<br />
<br />If you don't want to do these repairs then take it to a shop where they will charge a minimum $150 I'm am trying to save you here.  If you want to work with me then we will get it fixed one way or another.

<p>Hi BreadedGinger7,</p>
<p>You say you bought Gold online. Did you buy the family pack or just a single membership? You also say the parental account and the child account is the same?? You cannot have a child account and parental account on the same gamertag. If you have two gamertags
 did you buy gold for the correct account? If not then why you cannot connect to Xbox live with the child account. I don't think its possible to transfer Xbox live gold memberships between tags.I would also check the parental controls to make sure that it is
 not blocking the Xbox Live connection for the child account. I would also recommend going to this link &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a> and chatting with someone in the billing
 and accounts department , or calling them at 1-800-4-MYXBOX.</p>

<p>Agreed. It sounds like you purchased Gold on the parental account. A Gold membership goes to the account purchasing, and only covers one account.</p>
<p>If this just happened, the billing department may be able to cancel that subscription and give you a code you can apply to the proper account. I'm not sure though.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for bringing this inquiry to our attention! Unfortunately the only ones who would be able to check the current balance on the card (without redeeming on a Microsoft account) would be a retailer (Microsoft store or Original Point of Purchase). Try

    <title>Virtual Disk Manager unable to format USB HDD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b_phillips  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virtual Disk Manager unable to format USB HDD</h2>
                    <p>See the screen shot below taken on my Surface Pro 3. The 4TB USB 3.0 External My Book hard drive is RAW and as shown in the dialog box in the screen shot Disk Management is unable to format the drive. I've also tried&nbsp;<strong>Convert F:/ FS:NTFS</strong>,
 and the <strong>Error Checking Tool</strong> neither worked. I've looked at the drive properties which show that the driver is working properly. I have found 3rd party applications, such as m3, that claim to not only convert the drive but also recover the
 data lost. I've avoided these tools so far because I'm expecting either Windows 10 or the CMD processor to be able to make the conversion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>History: I mistakenly left a 4TB WD My Book connected to my PC when I attempted to boot from an Windows 10 installation Media 4GB USB Drive on another USB port. All the data on the 4TB was lost and the PC defaulted to a normal boot. I disconnected the 4TB
 My Book and completed the clean install of Windows 10 on the PC. The PC's fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it takes some time but I'm able to eject the drive using the Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media tool in the tray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to be able to format the My Book and put it back in service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            The solution was to use the Format tool and to uncheck the Perform Quick Format check box and click OK. For my 4TB USB 3.0 My Book, formatting took between 6 &amp; 12 hours. Once formatted &nbsp;the drive was in default NTFS format and ready to use. I'm using it
 now. The default Quick Format would not work for a drive in RAW status.

    <title>Groove &#40;version 3.6.1210.0&#41; Keeps Losing My Album - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoffc1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove &#40;version 3.6.1210.0&#41; Keeps Losing My Album Collection&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft has released a new version of Groove (version 3.6.1210.0), and this keeps losing my entire&nbsp;album collection, and trying to rebuild it in a never-ending cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 1,000+ albums stored on a Windows Home Server system, and four Windows PCs (desktop, laptop, a&nbsp;Windows Tablet and a Surface 3) all running Groove connected to it, with the&nbsp;root music folder on the WHS2011 system defined as a library (and hence defined
 as a watched folder within Groove).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that all&nbsp;the instances of Groove have been updated to version 3.6.12.10.0, what will happen is that when I'm viewing my Albums, the albums will suddenly disappear, Groove will say there are zero albums available offline, and &nbsp;display the "Get some music"
 message. After some time (30 minutes?), or a restart of&nbsp;the app,&nbsp;Groove will start reindexing the music folders and albums will start appearing. This goes on (slowly!)&nbsp;until all the albums have been scanned from the WHS2011 folders, at which point they will
 all suddenly&nbsp;disappear again and the process starts over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on <del>three</del> all four of the PCs. <del>Interestingly, the Surface 3 is not losing the albums. However, it's also not displaying the correct number of albums held in my music library. I have 1,103 albums in my collection; according
 to Groove on the Surface 3, I only have 1,084. I suspect that this instance of Groove isn't actually watching my watched folders...</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I deleted the database within Groove on the Surface 3, to force it to rebuild its index. And now it is behaving the same as the other instances of Groove - it loses the albums, rebuilds the index, loses them again - in a never-ending cycle...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3.6.12.10.0&nbsp;version of Groove is also not always displaying the "Adding music" notification when music is being added. Is this change in behaviour expected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel&nbsp;that Microsoft is not testing this app sufficiently well; does anyone on the testing team bother to test it with a library held on a Windows Home Server 2011 system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mind being a beta tester when software is in beta; but Windows 10 and the Microsoft apps are now released. Groove&nbsp;is still not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also sent this information in as feedback.</p>

            I have a similar setup, WHS 2011 with a desktop (running W10 Pro) and a couple of laptops (running W10Home). All are experiencing the same problem even after running sfc/scannow (which I had already run and corrected some errors because of a problem with
 Office Outlook mail not sending). It corrected that problem but not the issue with Groove. Using sfc/scannow produces no errors now, but issue with Groove remains. Troubleshooter could find no problems. Incidentally I was running another machine with Insider
 builds on and that didn't have this issue until it updated to the final version.

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions, but they haven't helped to either identify or cure the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Not relevant, I think, since the only common denominators between the four machines are Groove and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: No problems found by the Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: sfc /scannow reported corrupt files on two machines. These files are a couple of PNG image files belonging to Edge. This issue has been around for some time (since Edge was introduced in Technical Previews), so I don't think it's related to the
 Groove issue at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the Groove issue persists, and now I see that someone else is reporting the same.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue - Windows 10 computer pulling music from a WHS2011 server.&nbsp; It also does the same thing with Movies &amp; TV.&nbsp; If I give it a couple of minutes, they come back, but they shouldn't go away in the first place.&nbsp; They do seem to stay until
 I close the program - when I reopen it, they disappear again.&nbsp; Note that they will be there when I first open Music.</p>
<p>Your method 2 found no problems with the Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>I'm running sfc /scannow...now on my Win 10 computer; I don't expect that to work, but I'll give it a swing.</p>

            <p>Okay, I may have an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use libraries, with the default being a folder on the server for each library.&nbsp; I noticed today that I couldn't save items to the library (a picture, in this case).&nbsp; It was saying I didn't have permission, contact the administrator.</p>
<p>After fiddling back and forth with uninstalling Windows Home Server Connector, rebooting, etc., I tried something a little different.</p>
<p>In file explorer, I went into my libraries and removed the server as a save location entirely, and then reinstated it.&nbsp; Suddenly I could save to the server, and when I opened Groove, all of my songs were there.</p>

</p><p>I've checked my libraries held on my WHS2011, and I'm able to save items to them as normal, so I don't think that's the cause of the issue I'm seeing here.</p>

            <p>Right, I've removed and now re-added the music folder on the WHS2011 to the music library on my desktop PC to try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove did nothing for about 15 minutes, but is now adding my music collection to itself (without the "Adding your music" notification being displayed, I might add). I'm curious to see what will happen when this is complete. I'll report back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing I've changed here: I have always had the music folder on the WHS2011 set as both the Save location and the Public Save location. Now I have both of these settings pointing to my local Music folder.</p>

            Nope - same thing; it completed adding all my albums, and then less than a minute later, everything disappeared again, apart from two test albums I have in my local Music folder at F:\Users\Geoff\Music (I store my local data on my F: drive; it's bigger
 than the C: drive).

            Hi Hillard
<br />
<br />Skype to Skype calls are free, both video and audio
<br />
<br />Skype to landline or Skype to non-Skye enabled Mobile Phones are not free, because Microsoft has to pay the local provider to connect the call
<br />
<br />Are you having difficulty using Skype, or are you being prompted to pay for Skype to Skype calls?

<p>Hey dude,</p>
<p>It could be a problem with the disc, but i'll get you to give you console a power cycle to see if that helps.</p>
<p>To power cylce, have you console on and sitting at the dashboard. Then, hold down the power button on the front of the console for 10seconds, until the console switches off. Then leave it off for a couple of minutes, before switching it back off and trying
 again.</p>
<p>Hopefully that'll kick it into gear :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Denaz</p>

<p>Here is a thought. &nbsp;If you have been playing online the saves should be in the cloud. &nbsp;You could try deleting the local save data and see if it will load. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<p>I also have had this same issue.</p>
<p>No sooner hit the Fallout 4 start screen and moment I press start to get to the options it locks up with a annoying buzzing/beeping sound. After a few irritating seconds of this noise it boots me back to the Xbox One dashboard.</p>
<p>My disc is clean and is brand new. I have tried holding the Xbox One console's power button for 10 seconds to do a full power down, even removed the CD, and unplugged the system. Let it sit for a good 5-10 minutes too. Still same results. Even went to the
 trouble of uninstalling and reinstalling at least 3 times now.... Nothing has worked.</p>
<p>Not sure if its a corrupt save, as I have no way of telling if that's the case. But hoping someone has found a fix for this because I'm about to tap out here.</p>

<p>Delete your account (remove accounts) then:</p>
<p>1. Make sure your console is plugged into an outlet, NOT power surge or power protector.
</p>
<p>2. Settings &gt;disc and blue ray &gt; blue ray &gt; persistent storage &gt; clear persistent storage.</p>
<p>3. Settings &gt; power and start up &gt; turn off or restart &gt; restart now</p>
<p>4. Repeat step 2</p>
<p>5. Power cycle the console by holding the power button for 10 seconds, and unplugging the console from the wall for 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>Then re-download your account. </p>

<p>Thank you ThirdEyeLove</p>
<p>I tried your trouble shooting steps. Sadly the same result came about with the game freezing barely a second or two after I press START at the "Press any button to start" screen. I went through Xbox Support Chat with two different staff members and we went
 through these same trouble shooting steps as well as uninstalls/re-installs. None of which having success.</p>
<p>The last option they gave to me was to contact Bethesda Support via email or by phone directly. Sadly, when emailing this issue to Bethesda's Technical Support they simply suggest I contact Xbox One Support... No help whatsoever...</p>
<p>So if any others are having this same issue as me... PRAY! And PRAY hard Bethesda is EVEN LISTENING... and MIGHT put put a patch to fix title screen crashes, and corrupt saves.</p>

<h3> taemim123  say:</h3>
<h2>            No more WiFi network on Windows 10 on Inspiron 14z 5423</h2>
                    <p>When I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 I still had network. Months later, after some update, it stopped working. No more WiFi nor Bluetooth for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Wireless card shows in the Device Manager. So the problem is not the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Wireless USB adapter and also doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all possible solutions from the internet so far. Please help me?<br />
<br />
PS: I haven't tried the following one yet, but that is because I have no idea where to get this Cisco CPN client... Apparently there's a fix for it on Windows 10... Maybe it's related to that?

<p>
</p><p><span>"What are the troubleshooting steps you performed to resolve the issue?"</span></p>
<p><span>I have updated the driver, I have tried to enable the WiFi (it shows disabled constantly on Network and Internet&gt; Network Connections), I have deleted the driver and installed again, turned off wifi
 button on laptop and on again, and all possible combinations of those...</span></p>

<p>When I click it, it runs troubleshooting for the internet, and it tells me I should plug in an ethernet cable. It doesn't even mention WiFi, it's as if it doesn't know about its existence.</p>
<p>

<p>Does not apply to my problem, I know how to connect to the internet and the problem is not in my network.</p>

<h2>            Win 7&#58; How to Drag&#47;Move Created Toolbar from Taskbar to Desktop &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Hello;</div>

<div><strong>1)</strong> This (simple!)&nbsp;question sprung from my recent thread:</div>
<div><strong>Office 2010: Is There a MS Office Shortcut Bar ??</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-customize/office-2010-is-there-a-ms-office-shortcut-bar/f5555e62-b94e-4222-9a3c-a729a9f44e73">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-customize/office-2010-is-there-a-ms-office-shortcut-bar/f5555e62-b94e-4222-9a3c-a729a9f44e73</a></div>
<div>(The answer to the above question is: <strong>NO</strong>)</div>

<div><strong>2)</strong>&nbsp;The idea of using Windows 7 Toolbars feature appears to be a reasonable alternative to the Office 2010 (missing!) Shortcut Bar:</div>
<div><strong>a</strong>--&gt; place the Office 2010 applications shortcuts in a folder (<strong>myOffice2010</strong>)</div>
<div><strong>b</strong>--&gt; right-click on the Taskbar, point to âToolbarâ, and select âNew toolbarâ</div>
<div><strong>c</strong>--&gt; in the âNew Toolbar â Choose a folderâ window, select the folder (<strong>myOffice2010</strong>), and press the âSelect folderâ button</div>
<div><strong>d</strong>--&gt; the new toolbar
<strong>myOffice2010</strong> appears on the Taskbar</div>
<div><strong>e</strong>--&gt; click the double-arrow (on the toolbar top right) and select an Office application to run</div>
<div><strong>f</strong>--&gt; works fine</div>

<div><strong>3)</strong> The difficulty is that Iâm unable to drag the
<strong>toolbar</strong> from the <strong>Taskbar</strong> (<strong>Win 7</strong> Pro 64-bit) to the
<strong>Desktop</strong>.</div>
<div>Iâve tried right-click the toolbar and looked at &amp; tried every option on its pop-up menu, made sure the Taskbar unlocked, moved the toolbar to the far left on the Taskbar &amp; tried again, etc..
 Nothing worked!</div>

<div><strong>Any</strong> suggestion on how to move the newly created
<strong>toolbar</strong> (myOffice2010) from the <strong>Taskbar</strong> (<strong>Win 7</strong>) to the
<strong>Desktop</strong> ??</div>
<div><strong>What</strong> is the trick ??</div>

            I'm sorry I didn't say so directly... but unfortunately the ability to have any free-floating toolbar away from the Taskbar at all was discontinued immediately after XP was released in 2001.
<div><br />
<div>A program that will do it for you is called RocketDock (from&nbsp;<a href="http://RocketDock.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RocketDock.com</a>). &nbsp;It has a lot of styles but the basic one closely matches a plain toolbar without any fancy graphics or effects.</div>

<h2>            I&#39;m going crazy&#33; - 169 ip address ethernet</h2>
                    Ok, I use my laptop to connect to xbox live. today, it decides to stop working and I have a 169 ip instead of 192. I have tried EVERYTHING and after reading a thread on here I uncheck iPv6 and entered the right values into iPv4.<br />
<br />
But now my xbox is saying "your dns server can't resolve the names of the xbox live servers or xbox.com"<br />
<br />
What the ____ does that mean? i think im just going to buy a wireless adaptor before i throw my xbox out the window lol<br />

<p>Hi cmaxm<br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion.<br />
<br />
Can you try a different Port on the Router (if you haven't already).</p>
<p>Try a different Network cable (if you haven't already)</p>
<p>Go to an Elevated Command prompt and type in <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> then press the ENTER key<br />
also type in <strong>ipconfig /release</strong> then press the Enter key<br />
Then type in <strong>ipconfig /renew</strong> then press the Enter key<br />
<br />
You may also want to reset the IP stack by typing in <br />
<span><strong>netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your response.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Steve</b>, your other post was deleted because we cannot have more than one thread pertaining to the same issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Was your phone syncing without any problems in Windows 8?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let's check if we have any pending Windows Updates for your device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Plug in your phone to your computer and follow the steps in the below:</div>
<div><br />
<p><b>Update the Device Drivers on the Computer.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</b></p>
<p>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</p>
<p>a) Press âWindows Logoâ + âWâ keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) Type â<b><i>Updates</i></b>â in the search bar and click on â<b><i>Install optional updates</i></b>â from the left pane.</p>
<div>c)&nbsp; From the âWindows Updateâ window, click on â<b><i>Check for Updates</i></b>â on the top left corner, to receive a fresh list of updates and then install all the updates listed there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once you complete the above steps, update us on the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have a good day!!</div>
<div><br />

    <title>I forgot my password. I need help. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bald freaks  say:</h3>
<h2>            I forgot my password. I need help.</h2>
                    
<p>The gamertag is: I use Lancer. I've had my account for about 5 years now, and I haven't really known my password seeing as my friend had helped me and he put the password in 5 years ago. He also put the security question and and answer which I do not know.
 I've tried to get help with my password multiple times but I have never succeeded. I give you the info I believe is correctly on my account, but I always get the response, "We cannot verify you are the owner of the account." So what I was thinking was what
 if I messaged someone that could help me get my password on Xbox Live on my account that I need the password for. Like I could go get on my xbox and send you a message from my account that I need the password for. Wouldn't that show ownership? Like could I
 message you saying, "Could I please be told my password for this Windows Live ID?" Isn't that ownership? I really just want my password so I can get stuff from Xbox Live Rewards. I can also tell how much microsoft points are on my account, there is no credit
 card(I could probably put one on though if it helped), the name, number, address, state, city, my download history. I just really want my password. Thanks.</p>

<p>No one can give you your 5-yr-old password...not even MS. &nbsp;It would be stupid to allow thousands of support people access to your "secret" password. &nbsp;I can't really make sense of your post...did you pass the account verification? &nbsp;If so, you can simply reset
 the password to something you can remember....and don't let anyone else do it for you since you have already found out that was a bad idea. &nbsp;If you did not, you just have to keep trying...it took me some 6 months and several tries before I passed the test.
 &nbsp;You will not get the password from anyone...you will just have to change it if you can gain access to your account.

<p>Being on an account does not prove ownership. &nbsp;Would you want a friend to be able to sign in to your account on your Xbox and change your password without requiring the password to do that?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>As far as the account is concerned, if you can't prove account ownership, Xbox support won't be able to assist you. &nbsp;You can try doing a password reset on login.live.com. &nbsp;If they can't assist you then you're out of luck unfortunately.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>What I don't understand is how did you get past the winter dashboard update THAT REQUIRED YOU TO PUT YOUR PASSWORD IN to proceed? &nbsp;In order to agree to the updated terms of use you needed your password, so while you claim you forgot it since it had been
 5 years, you also mention messaging other people which requires being online to do that. &nbsp;Something here isn't adding up to me.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Account wont Connect in Win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eonstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account wont Connect in Win 8.1</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently got a Surface Pro and everything was working perfectly fine until I upgraded to Windows 8.1. Now when I attempt to download and install anything from the Store I am told to sign into a Microsoft Account. When I do this I am taken to a screen
 where I must input a code sent to my email, and I do so. After this I am taken to a screen where I have the option to Switch Account or to Cancel.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is in this screen where I receive the error after hitting the Switch button. I am shown the error below;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We're sorry, but something went wrong. Your account wasn't changed to this Micrsoft Account. Code: 0x80070057.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have verified that I am using the correct username and password on the<font color="#00802a"><span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color="#00802a"><span>https://account.live.com/â&nbsp;</span></font>website. I am not sure what the issue is but it is basically blocking
 me from using the Store app completely. This is also occurring when I attempt to link the account in the settings as well. I have tried flashing the Surface Pro back and re-installing it and this did not work. I also attempted deleting the account and reattempting
 the login and it still does not work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there something that I can do or is there something on the backside that can be done to fix this?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Are you accessing internet through proxy?<br />
2. Are you using any third party antivirus application?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>If you are using any third-party antivirus software, you may disable it and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the antivirus maker website to check for the options to disable antivirus.</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not help, you may consider uninstalling antivirus and check with the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>If you uninstall antivirus, install it after switching the user account.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 2: Disable Windows firewall and check.</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>a. Hover the mouse to the right hand top corner and click on search and type Windows firewall and click on settings</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>b. Click on windows Firewall</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>c. Click on turn firewall on or off at the left hand pane</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>d. Check the option to turn off the firewall.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Repeat the steps for public and private network settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>After checking with the issue, enable Firewall.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this helps and do let us know if you need any assistance.</span></p>

<div>Thanks for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I attempted to disable the windows firewall and it does not appear to have fixed the issue. I even attempted logging out of the profile and re-logging in but this also didn't fix anything. The same error is displayed as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for a proxy, I am not sure if I am using one. I have not set one and this is mostly a fresh install on the Surface Pro. This is pretty much new out of the box a couple of days ago. I dont know when this could have been set up.</div>

            <div>I have the same issue (but I have a laptop, not Surface Pro). Both methods don't work for me: I have no third-party antivirus software, I have no proxy. Disabling Windows Firewall doesn't change anything. Clean Boot, Safe Boot - nothing helps.</div>
<div>I don't know what to do anymore. Every time this 0x80070057 error stops me from switching to MS account.</div>

            Hello Alex,
<div><br />
<div>I am the same person as the original poster, another great error happened and that Username is not mine to use anymore...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, I have found a work around for this issue. By no means is it a fix and I am still waiting for this issue to be properly addressed. However it will allow you to access the store and the items therein. When you are prompted to enter in your password
 there will be an option on the bottom saying something along the lines of "Sign into each app individually." Select that and when you open the app you will be prompted for the Username and Password. Just use the Username and Password for your live account
 and this appears to work around the issue we are both seeing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            I had the same issue, and I have tried every single fix on every single variation of this error, and nothing works. &nbsp;The problem is on Microsoft's end, I believe. &nbsp;This all began when I changed my primary alias in my Microsoft account and delete out an
 old one. &nbsp;Every since then, on one of my computers, I cannot properly connect to the account.

            I found a workaround, but not a solution. &nbsp;I tried to fix the problem tens of times, and it seems that it is was necessary for me to create a new primary alias, and create a new Windows profile and connect it to a previously created local account. &nbsp;I also
 had to move OneDrive from my secondary E drive to my primary OS drive, possibly because of leftover permissions issues, although I tried fixing the permissions manually with no success. &nbsp;I have a Surface and a PC, and I want to note that the Surface is much
 less likely to have issues with changes or renames to MS account aliases.

<h2>            calibration application takes 5 minutes to calibrate on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>i calibrated with a spyder pro 4. I'm not using their software on boot. I have very few hints starting with Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once he he profile was created I applied it directly to Windows as the default and it's working. But t takes literally five minutes before it kicks in. Why so long? Surely there has to be a way to get this loaded feet. Right now I'm already opening Lightroom
 mediating files. Or watching video Jr. Whatever. Five plus minutes later it finally loads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way too long. It should boot. Look for calibration data and apply it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im also curious in terms of monitor if there's a inf for the surface pro 3 display. &nbsp;Or a manual driver update. &nbsp;I tried to is tall Intel drivers directly and it balked. Telling me my manufacturer tweaks them. &nbsp;I'm guessing there's a more recent driver with
 performance enhancement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original title:Drivers. Inf file. Why does Windows 10 take so long to apply a color calibration to the monitor?

            <p>By calibration application I mean the process of applying the color profile. Not a third party pplication that launches. &nbsp;The computer is in a very clean state normally as I don't allow applications to take over startup and I update my own software. I &nbsp;also
 tried disallowing all startup items and a clean boot. Any other ideas? </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a built in Windows function, to apply a color profile. &nbsp; Perhaps there's a way to prioritize the application of the profile (making it work, agas j when I use thebwirdnwollucstuon it's defined as to apply &nbsp;not a program just to be clear). This is
 a Windows problem. &nbsp;The color profile should be loading immediately as a first step in widows. &nbsp;Perhaps you can open a bug report to an engineer ? The problem is very few people run hardware Calibrated color profiles in Windows as it's not widely used by creative
 professionals so I'm not sure too many others will be chiming in or that the support staff or even most engineers have access. I believe you can go through the steps to calibrate he monitor with Windows software which also generates the same type of file.
 Just less accurate. So if you want to replicate go into advanced display. &nbsp;Go to calibrate color or similar and go through the sifrware process. &nbsp;You're a Windows expert so I'm sure you know about Windows color calibration software which also makes an ICC
 profile. .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can can say it never took Windows Xp anywhere near this long. And Windows 8 was also considerably faster. &nbsp;</p>

            I've not received a follow up per my previous answer. I'd love to find out why Windows takes so long to apply a color profile and if there's a way to shift it forward in the boot process.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<span>If you have a whole video in your project you need to split it first if you want to arrange it. Click the video, and then drag the playback indicator to the point where you want to split the video.
 Under <b>Video Tools</b>, on the <b>Edit</b> tab, in the <b>Editing</b> group, click
<b>Split</b>. If&nbsp;you are done in splitting your video, you can now proceed in arranging&nbsp;them by dragging and dropping to your preferred location. For the shortcut keys of Windows Live Movie Maker ("<strong>M</strong>" for Split option), ("<strong>Ctrl</strong>
 + <strong>X</strong>" for Cut) ("<strong>Ctrl + V</strong>" for Paste), &amp; ("<strong>Ctrl + C</strong>" for Copy). Let us know if you have any follow up questions.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Gerard G.</span>

            <p>PASTE is part of the standard copy and paste procedure.&nbsp; You can copy anything in the storyboard and paste it back to the storyboard multiple times.&nbsp; You can also copy external videoclips (I like "Wildlife") and photos (I like "Penguins") and paste them
 into a WLMM project.<br />
<br />
I can't suss CUT either.</p>

    <title>Reset All Game Statistics - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timbowling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset All Game Statistics</h2>
                    
<p>There is one thing that I just don't understand at all. Why do I not have the ability to go in and reset all game statistics to zero? These are just games, people, just games. They have no impact on the real world whatsoever. Yet it would be easier to change
 my name, social security number, mailing address and even my gender than to reset all my game statistics! Sometimes, I just feel like Microsoft does things to purposely irritate me. All I'd like to do is go into my account, delete all the game statistics in
 Microsoft Solitaire Collection to zero and start over. I mean it's not like Microsoft gives money away for statistics or awards, or achievements. On Playstation, I can completely delete all my game statistics, even delete my account and start completely over
 as a new profile. Can you do any of that on Xbox? No.</p>
