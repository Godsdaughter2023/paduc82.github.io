<h2>            error 8004230f, can neither create or recall a restore point</h2>
                    <p>I can neither create or recall a restore point in Windows 7.&nbsp; This problem started the day before yesterday.&nbsp; The error code is as above.&nbsp; I have tried running in safe mode with networking but right clicking on my computer to get at system protection locks
 the machine up.&nbsp; I tried the little bat file that MS Tech recommended but with no result.&nbsp; It cannot be a Symantec problem as I use Kaspersky security.&nbsp; That reports the system as competely clean.&nbsp; The volume shadow copy service is tunning and I can think
 of nothing else.</p>
<p>Can any kind informed souls help me out with this one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would running a system repair disk help?</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 slow load &#47; freezing</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>New to Xbox One and only just set up. Bought my kids FH4 and it just seems to load really slowly. We have the disc so thought wouldn't even need to load? We have also bought Minecraft and it loaded within seconds. Is something faulty?</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

            It's possible the disc could have been damaged or is dirty. How long are the load times. About 45 seconds is normal for the Xbox One S and OG Xbox One.<br />

<p>Ive setup my Xbox One on a 1080p TV. However, I'm now using another TV that doesnt support 1080p and the TV says "mode not supported". How do I reset the display settings if I cant see the dashboard?</p>
<p>On Xbox 360, you could press Y and RT when console is starting up to reset the settings however, this doesnt work on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Had the same problem just now, literally just held the power button until the console went off, then did the Xbox button and eject and nothing happened. Then tried it again except I held it until the the power light lit up, heard a beep and it reset fine.
 Works like a dream now. I think I held them both for about 45 seconds.</p>

<p>Hey PlonKey,<br />
<br />
I understand that you've purchased your hard drive from Amazon, but this doesn't mean that it's legitimate to say the least. Unless it was in a retail box and had Microsoft logo's and packaging it's likely not legitimate.<br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know what seller you purchased this from on the Amazon Marketplace. If you don't know, please login to your Amazon.com account and take a look at your order history, that should tell you.</p>
        </p>

<p>That is a link to the hard drive I bought. I bought it about a year and 8 months ago if that helps at all. I don't remember if it came in Microsoft packaging.</p>

<p>I can click the link, but please go into your order history and take a look at the actual seller that sold it to you. If it didn't come in that Microsoft packaging that the link shows it's likely that it's not an original Xbox 360 hard drive and it's a fake/knock
 off.<br />
<br />
These fakes/knock offs are sold at a cheaper price than retail as they are manufactured by a 3rd party and do not have the ability to play original Xbox games. They will play your Xbox 360 games just fine. It seems to me that the issue here is that you've honestly
 purchased a knock off hard drive and you won't be able to play this game until you get a genuine hard drive. There's nothing physically wrong with the game download, it just won't work on the hard drive you currently have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hard drive you have might not be Microsoft. It will not let you play Xbox Originals on non-Microsoft hard drives. &nbsp;Go to system settings, then storage and it will say Microsoft be the the name of the device.

<p>But in my case, &nbsp;I have a 120GB non Microsoft Installed. &nbsp;(hacked with hddhackr and then formatted using the Xbox 360 storage manager)</p>
<p>There is a Microsoft label (Within the Storage manager, just beside the hard Drive)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 RSoD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlm61  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 RSoD</h2>
                    <p>I see that lots of people have reported this problem and I've read zillions of replies and suggested ways to fix it, but so far nothing has worked for me. &nbsp;I did the free upgrade from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10 Pro through the icon in my taskbar.
 &nbsp;Everything worked fine for the first 24 hours. &nbsp;I put my computer to sleep at the end of the night and when I woke it up the next day it had a red flashing screen with the loading circle of dots just spinning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried rebooting but after the first two Window panels and the piano riff, it goes right to the RSoD. &nbsp;I can't get to my desktop. &nbsp;I booted in Safe Mode and tried to uninstall the two new programs that I installed after the upgrade but only 1 uninstall
 was successful - the other program showed a message that said some components couldn't be uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc/ scannow and it said everything is fine. &nbsp;I tried a clean boot, msconfig, services and the whole process of checking/unchecking boxes and restarting. &nbsp;Got down to one service checked and still have the problem. &nbsp;Rechecked all the boxes except that
 one and rebooted but still have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to do a System Restore or a System Image - did both the night before I upgraded - but Windows 10 can't find the files. &nbsp;Says I don't have any system images or restore points, but I do. Tried to access the drive they're on (external drive) and it won't
 let me access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to wipe the PC. &nbsp;Is there anything else I can do? &nbsp;The problem doesn't exist in Safe Mode.</p>

            <p>It probably can't see the external drive in Safe Mode.&nbsp; Maybe you can disable everything that runs after Startup&nbsp;via msconfig and then gain access to the external drive for the Restore.&nbsp; Do you have a Windows 10 install on USB or DVD&nbsp;that you can boot with
 to&nbsp;run Repair?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also be able to create a recoverydrive USB on another computer with Windows 10.&nbsp; Just type recoverydrive in Cortana search and have an empty&nbsp;small USB flash drive to use.&nbsp; If you uncheck system files, you only need a 512MB USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I am also thinking that your Restore points and System Image are for Windows 7, so you might have to re-install that to make any use of them (if you have to).&nbsp; If you do choose this, you could then put Windows 10 install on a USB stick and upgrade
 that way.&nbsp; Since sleep mode may have been an issue, you could disable all power management until you are certain that Windows 10 has installed all of the needed drivers for your device.</p>

            <p>Once you have upgraded a device from Windows 7 or 8&nbsp;to Windows 10 and Windows 10 has been activated on it, it gets registered with Microsoft's activation servers as a licensed Windows 10 device.&nbsp; Any future clean installs to that same device should activate
 based on it's "Digital Entitlement" to run Windows 10, without any need for a unique Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a way that was discovered to save your activation status&nbsp;in a file, just in case, if you want.&nbsp; There have been some times when a Windows 10 licensed device did not auto-activate after a clean install of Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I decided to just give up on Windows 10 and go back to Windows 7 using the built in function they have in Windows 10 for doing that, so I started my computer in safe mode and told it to go back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it finished, I had the Windows 7 blue screen with the flowers/vines on it and a message saying that Windows couldn't start properly. &nbsp;I realized that I still had all the startup functions disabled from my repair attempt in Win 10 - forgot to turn them
 back on before reverting. &nbsp;Don't know if that's the problem or not, so tried to start in safe mode again to turn them back on, but now I can't even start in safe mode. &nbsp;Every time I try, I get a blue screen full of information that I can't read fast enough
 before it disappears, but the top line says that an error occurred and it's shutting down my computer to avoid damage. &nbsp;If I choose start Windows normally, it fails and takes me to the advanced repair options, which all fail. &nbsp;When I tried to restore wih a
 system image, it found the drive but gave me a message that there was a error enumerating the backups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying my hardest to resolve the problem without having to reset my PC, but it seems like that's my only choice. &nbsp;The problem now is that Windows 7 doesn't give me that option like Windows 10 did. &nbsp;Windows 10 had a box in the advanced repair options
 to click on for resetting that said I could choose to keep or discard my files. &nbsp;I want to keep them, but the entire "reset this PC" option doesn't come up in Win 7 repair options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just an average home PC user - this is all pretty much greek to me. &nbsp;What do I do now?<br />

            <p>If you can create a Windows 10 install on a USB stick/flash drive, you might be able to fix things with that.&nbsp; If you can boot your computer with that USB, on the first screen should be the option: &nbsp;Repair your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also be able to fix things with a Windows 7 DVD if you have that and can boot from the DVD.&nbsp; I would have to look up the options, but it might be obvious by following through the choices after you boot with the DVD.</p>

    <title>Epson stylus photo printer R200 has been printing evenly spaced - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leetipton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson stylus photo printer R200 has been printing evenly spaced horizontal lines under, over and through lines of text.</h2>
                    Have had this Printer for years and has never displayed this problem before. &nbsp;I went to Epson and only got generic answers like: &nbsp;have you cleaned your injet cartriges etc. &nbsp;These lines are nice and neat, as though its part of a program to do this. &nbsp;I
 have had this Windows 7 HP &nbsp;computer for a year and it worked well with my printer. Prior to that I had XP. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;though I have searched forums, I have seen so sign of discussion about a problem like this. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you can imagine the Windows Printer Test Page for example, (it even does it on XLS), below is a fairly close approximation of the lines in relation to my description of the text on the page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;______________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;_________________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp;WINDOWS " &nbsp;lies between lines 1 and 3, bisected by line 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp; _________________________________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3</div>
<div>&nbsp; _________________________________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Printer Test Page" &nbsp;lies between lines 3and 5, bisected by line 4</div>
<div>&nbsp; _________________________________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5</div>
<div>&nbsp; _________________________________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp;</div>
<div>________________________________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Congratulations!" is between line 7&amp; 8, almost touching line 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;___________________________________________________________________ &nbsp; 8</div>

<div>___________________________________________________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; 10</div>
<div>___________________________________________________________________ &nbsp; &nbsp; 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and it keeps going all the way down the page along with the text.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not sure if this is of any help, but maybe its enough of a start to get some ideas for trouble shooting. &nbsp;The lines stop about .5 inch below the last line of text on any given page, be it word pad, a bank statement, etc. &nbsp;I have not found a document that
 is immune from the lines.</div>

            Re; step one. &nbsp;Epsons web site says that Windows 7 already has the current drivers, so they dont offer them. &nbsp;I deleted my printer and reinstalled without success.
<div><br />
<div>RE step two. &nbsp;I'm embarrassed to admit. &nbsp;for some reason, the System Restore function was turned off. &nbsp;I just turned it back on. &nbsp;There had never been a restore point set. &nbsp;Not sure why or how this happened. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess i will have to go back to Epson Support. &nbsp;This is indeed a strange problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just thought of a trouble shooting step I havent tried. &nbsp;I will hook up another printer to see if problem happens there too. (for that matter, I could hook the Epson up to my laptop and see what happens)</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any other simple but obvious trouble shooting steps, feel free to toss them my way</div>

<h2>            windows 7 stuck in startup repair help me ASAP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    So I am trying to sell my desktop computer so I can get a laptop for school and robotics. I turned it off to take a break from working on it for awhile. I turn it back on. It then tells me that my computer did not shut off correctly. So I accidentally
 pressed enter on run startup repair. I thought oh well, I will let it run. Then it says startup repair can not fix this problem. I then clicked on finish and it turned my machine off. When I booted it up, I noticed that it went into startup repair again. I
 let it do its thing, then it said the same thing. But this time, it had a dialog window that said that the program could not fix the issue. So I clicked on don't send. Then I clicked on advanced options. And it brought up the system recovery options after
 the language and password boxes. I tried the system restore and it said I had no points. I am pretty sure I made one when I bought the computer. Please help me! I am wanting to get my laptop by January when the robotics build season starts!&nbsp;

            Hey there, I tried both of those options, and none of them worked. So I tried to reinstall windows via a recovery USB drive. When it got to the hard drive page, it said no drivers were found. So I navigated to the driver directory in the system files when
 I clicked browse. Then it still said no drivers found. I still have my product code and I am more than willing to work through this issue. I have a very good knowledge of computers and I know how to fix a lot of errors, but not this one. I am sorry if I sounded
 impatient on my first post. It was not my intent :-)&nbsp;

            Sorry for the late reply, I got busy with school. I tried it on all 8 of my USB ports and none of it worked. Would it work if I got my device drivers from the manufacturer website? I will keep trying the upgrade in place. Until the last resort is to reinstall
 windows.&nbsp;

            <p>For REAL!.&nbsp; The most recent problem I've been having is with an HP 6500ProPlus web printer.&nbsp; The certificate conflicts with IE and due to admin restrictions no attempt to import the cert&nbsp;had worked.&nbsp; I finally called Microsoft tech and after 3+ hours they
 couldn't get my machine to administer certificates either. I did have a glimps at the Microsoft tech guy go thru the registry which lead to a wildcard fix where I gave myself full out privelages on all the certs I could find. Albeit probably cheating but after
 having IE go ape@#$7 progressively along with Group policy and others in win 7 I was ready to try anything. Side note IE9 and Win7 would not allow install of correct verisign digital ID and another pick... The thing is I only have
 a laptop and a desktop and I am the only user with @ 15 network devices on the network. The two most demanding of hightened security being the printers (Xerox Phaser 6360 and HP 6500 Pro Plus).

    <title>Music app not displaying album art - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wraithtdk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music app not displaying album art</h2>
                    <p>The built-in music app will not display some of my album art correctly.&nbsp; As illustrated in
<a href="http://www.wraithtdk.com/imagedump/support/musicapp1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this screenshot</a>, some of my albums do not display album art. What's strange about this is that I have the album art embedded in the music files' ID3 data, and it displays perfectly in Windows Explorer, as s-seen in<a href="http://www.wraithtdk.com/imagedump/support/musicapp2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 this screenshot</a>, and Windows Media Player, as seen in <a href="http://www.wraithtdk.com/imagedump/support/musicapp3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this screenshot</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Edit:&nbsp;<span>Ultimately, I suspect the issue was cloud match. Cloudmatch is a fantastic idea that's ultimately kind of a mess, TBH. It really only works reliably if you buy all your music from the music store. If you've got a version of an album
 that isn't what it offers, it chokes. For example, a lot of times an album will get extra tracks for international release. If you have one of these, it gets confused. If you download a song and then change its metadata (for example, I bought "I'm The One
 That's Cool" a few months ago from Zune market place, and changed the artist field from "Guild" which what they had, to "The Guild" which is their proper name) it shows the track twice, once as streaming and once as local, because it doesn't recognize it as
 the same thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just don't think I'm going to use the app. If I want to play music locally, I'll continue to use WMP. It shows me what I have, it displays it as I entered it (and I spent a<b>considerable</b>&nbsp;amount of time making sure everything I
 entered was&nbsp;<b>perfect</b>), and it has a ratings system which I for one highly value. If I want to stream my music from somewhere else, I'll use Google Music or Amazon MP3. I understand the idea of cloud matching, but I'd rather just stream my collection
 exactly as it is, which I can do with those services, since they let me upload everything. If I want to play music from my XBox, I can stream it from my desktop. When I get a surface or Windows phone, I'll just put the music I want on it instead of streaming.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just don't see a reason to deal with the&nbsp;hassle.&nbsp;</div>

            Those steps help if the app is not running. The app is running fine. What I said is that it's not displaying album art embedded in the ID3 tags. This is why I attached screenshots; so there would be no confusion about the fact that the app is running just
 fine.

            <p>I had the same problem. After extensive testing I have a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.) Do not use M4A or WAV files, and stay away from MP3s. Only WMA files seem to work reliably. You MUST embed the album art into the WMV or MP3 file and then unistall and reinstall XBOX Music for it to pick up the missing album art.&nbsp; Immediatley turn off
 the option to grab missing metadata or artwork from the internet as soon as you reinstall XBOX Music.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, make sure the artwork is 200x200, no larger. If an album gives you trouble after all of these steps, try coverting it to a different format liek uncompressed WAV and then converting it to WMV, to strip out whatever Music is choking on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WMP works well to embed the album art.&nbsp; Copy the 200x200 album art into the clipboard (CTRL-C) and then right click on the ablum art in WMP and select "Paste Album Art." It should then pop up a window that says&nbsp; "Working" and embed the art.&nbsp; Make sure to
 first delete any other .jpg files in the folder to make sure you don't have conflicting artwork. For MP3's you may need to use tagging software to delete any embedded artwork that might be larger than 200x200 or have mutliple artwork images.</p>
<p>Here are the step that have worked for me.</p>
<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>1) Use only WMA files, with any custom art being 200x200 album art pasted into WMP.</p>
<p>2) Delete the all tracks in the album from Windows Media Player (from the library, NOT from you hard disk)</p>
<p>3) MOVE them to another directory</p>
<p>4) delete them from XBOX Music</p>
<p>5) Then move them back to their original directory</p>
<p>6) Add the tracks back into WMP </p>
<p>7) Watch them show up into XBOX Music with their correct album art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option#2</p>
<p>If you have a LOT of track missing artwork, this option may save you some time.</p>
<p>1.) Use only WMA files, with any custom art being 200x200 album art pasted into WMP. (Transcode the files if you have to, stripping out any extraneous or larger artwork than 200x200.</p>
<p>2.) UNISTALL XBOX MUSIC</p>
<p>3.) Go to the App Store - swipe from the bottom of the screeen (or right click at the bottom of the screen) and select "Your Apps"</p>
<p>4.) REINSTALL XBOX MUSIC</p>
<p>5.) Go back to the START Screen. Watch for when XBOX Music moves from "Pending" to "Installing" and then completes.</p>
<p>6.) As soon as it completes, open XBOX Music and then open the charms bar, selecte preferences and turn off "Automatically Retrieve and Updata Album Art and Metadata."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above combination of steps seems to work very well, and I now have custom album art in XBOX Music.

            I only use 320kbps MP3's specifically because they're the most compatible audio format.
<div><br />
<div>WMV? WMV is a format. Why would anyone use that for audio? Even the tracks you buy from the Zune market place are MP3.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I said, all of my songs have album art&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;in the ID3 tags. Unfortunately, it seems that the music app decided to what's embedded in favor of their own metadata.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The album art has to be under 200x200? That's insane! My art is all between 600x600 and 900x900 so it will display cleanly on high-rez screens and TVs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>FYI; I haven't checked the new Win 8 version, but every version of WMP I've ever tried, up to Windows 7's version, does not embed album art. It hides a copy in the folder the music is located in, and then WMP creates a link in its database between the
 track and the song. I use a program called MP3tag (http://www.mp3tag.de/en/) to ensure that everything is properly&nbsp;embedded.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Ultimately, I suspect the issue was cloud match. Cloudmatch is a fantastic idea that's ultimately kind of a mess, TBH. It really only works reliably if you buy all your music from the music store. If you've got a version of an album that isn't what it
 offers, it chokes. For example, a lot of times an album will get extra tracks for international release. If you have one of these, it gets confused. If you download a song and then change its metadata (for example, I bought "I'm The One That's Cool" a few
 months ago from Zune market place, and changed the artist field from "Guild" which what they had, to "The Guild" which is their proper name) it shows the track twice, once as streaming and once as local, because it doesn't recognize it as the same thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just don't think I'm going to use the app. If I want to play music locally, I'll continue to use WMP. It shows me what I have, it displays it as I entered it (and I spent a
<b>considerable</b>&nbsp;amount of time making sure everything I entered was <b>perfect</b>), and it has a ratings system which I for one highly value. If I want to stream my music from somewhere else, I'll use Google Music or Amazon MP3. I understand the idea of
 cloud matching, but I'd rather just stream my collection exactly as it is, which I can do with those services, since they let me upload everything. If I want to play music from my XBox, I can stream it from my desktop. When I get a surface or Windows phone,
 I'll just put the music I want on it instead of streaming.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just don't see a reason to deal with the&nbsp;hassle.&nbsp;</div>

            I was really hoping this issue would be fixed by now. Almost none of my album art shows up in the Windows 8 music app. It shows up in literally every other microsoft product that I've used with my music collection (Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center,
 Zune client, the Xbox, and my Windows Phones (7 and 8) have all displayed the art just fine).
<div><br />
<div>I have all of my MP3s meticulously sorted into directories. Each directory contains a folder.jpg with the album art (as well as the additional .jpgs that the Zune client/media player library add), and each mp3 itself has the album art embedded.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A screenshot of what my collection looks like:</div>
<div>https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12890269/Win8NoAlbumArt.jpg</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows 8 has been out for ages and, seriously, every other Microsoft product handles my music library properly. As a former SDE at MSFT, I realize how things like this tend to get prioritized, but it's an awful and super-frustrating experience. I've been
 continuing to use the Zune client on my desktop, but now that I have a surface pro I'd really much rather it actually show properly in the win8 music app, which is otherwise quite nice.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there ever going to be a fix for this? Or even a way for me to manually add album art that's missing? Even THAT would be better.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for reading :)</div>

            <blockquote>I only use 320kbps MP3's specifically because they're the most compatible audio format.
<div><br />
<div>WMV? WMV is a format. Why would anyone use that for audio? Even the tracks you buy from the Zune market place are MP3.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I said, all of my songs have album art&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;in the ID3 tags. Unfortunately, it seems that the music app decided to what's embedded in favor of their own metadata.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The album art has to be under 200x200? That's insane! My art is all between 600x600 and 900x900 so it will display cleanly on high-rez screens and TVs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>FYI; I haven't checked the new Win 8 version, but every version of WMP I've ever tried, up to Windows 7's version, does not embed album art. It hides a copy in the folder the music is located in, and then WMP creates a link in its database between the
 track and the song. I use a program called MP3tag (http://www.mp3tag.de/en/) to ensure that everything is properly&nbsp;embedded.&nbsp;</div>

<p>It's funny how everybody evades the OP's perfectly sensible remarks &amp; posts. The rundown is that this music app doesn't work with how real people treat their music collection (i.e, well organized, like OP). Instead, MS is offering us to fit into their mould.
 Not gonna happen, sorry. I'll stay away from the app since there aren't any satisfying solution (wma??? 2015?? Come...on!)</p>

            <p>I have found that metadata that is provided by a CD, or Amazon, or wherever, is often full of errors, inconsistencies, misspellings, wrong year information, weird capitalization, etc. generally looks like it was entered by an illiterate person.&nbsp; I, too,
 meticulously maintain my metadata and song art, and I have had unplesant experiences with iTunes and other apps that take your perfect metadata and then screw it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time I have tried to put music on my cell phone and I am proceeding very cautiously.&nbsp; I'm glad that I'm not the only one who is supsicious of apps that think they know better than you.</p>

            Try downloading VLC for Windows Phone from the app store. At least until the Windows Phone devs fix this issue. It might be too much of a pain to convert and reconfigure all of your music for those who do not have enough time to do so.

<h2>            Music app not showing the track and tag list correctly in the App.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: Music &amp; Tags</strong></p>
<p>Some of my music is showing up wrong in the Music app even though its is tagged correctly (ID3) and shows up correctly in Zune, WMP, iTunes etc..</p>
<p>Most of the music is okay, but a lot of is missing track numbers.</p>
<p>Those that are wrong are usually a wrong artist attached to a track.&nbsp; Its like Xbox Music assumes only one artist will ever record the same track name.&nbsp; Also there is a wrong album cover when everything is else okay...</p>
<p>Microsoft needs a way to manually override this, as no track identification system will be perfect.&nbsp; Especially since&nbsp;I have music from unsigned indy bands.</p>

            <p>An old thread, but I finally decided to search for an answer to the problem (I've been having it too - or at least a similar problem).<br />
<br />
Found this over on the XBL Website:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-NZ/apps/windows-8/windows-8-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-NZ/apps/windows-8/windows-8-faq</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- It says "</p>
What can I do if music content is not displaying after I add it to my music collection?
<div>
<p>To resolve this problem, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and the E key at the same time to open Windows Explorer.</li><li>Under <b>Libraries</b>, expand <b>Music</b>.</li><li>Right-click <b>My Music</b>, and then click <b>Properties</b>.</li><li>Click <b>Advanced</b>.</li><li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>If the <b>Allow files in this folder to have contents indexed in addition to file properties</b> check box is selected, go to step 6.</li><li>If the <b>Allow files in this folder to have contents indexed in addition to file properties</b> check box is not selected, go to step 10.</li></ul>
</li><li>Click to clear the <b>Allow files in this folder to have contents indexed in addition to file properties</b> check box.</li><li>Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Apply</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Confirm Attribute Changes</b> dialogue box, click <b>Apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files</b> and then click
<b>OK</b>.</li><li>In the My Music Properties window, click <b>Advanced</b>.</li><li>Click to select the <b>Allow files in this folder to have contents indexed in addition to file properties</b> check box, click
<b>OK</b>,<b> </b>and then click <b>Apply</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Confirm Attribute Changes</b> dialogue box, click <b>Apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files</b> and then click
<b>OK</b>.</li><li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li><li>Repeat steps 2-12 for every folder that appears under <b>Music</b>. <br />
<br />
<b>Note</b> The window titles will change to reflect the name of the folder.</li></ol>
<p>After you do this for your music library folders, close and reopen the music app.</p>
<p>When the music app opens, it will start inspecting the music library and should start receiving the album and artist data.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Windows 8 generally suspends apps when they are in the background. If you want make sure that the music app keeps processing, you need keep it in the foreground or snapped to the side."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess would be that some of your music library has additional indexing, and some of it doesn't :)</p>

<h3> sm06278  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t run ICS on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've searched high and low for ways to make Win10 run ICS on my desktop. The setup below worked perfectly under Win7 on another workstation which I upgraded to Win10 multiple times and always had to revert back as ICS wouldn't run. That workstation is not
 functional at the moment. It seems that some here have been able to make ICS work with Win10 so I'm optimistic but currently stymied.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my current configuration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Sprint 598U Mobile Broadband (USB dongle) (connects to the Internet just fine; using it right now)</p>
<p>* Ethernet port (Intel 82579V driver 12.12.50.6) &nbsp;connected Linksys 54G distributing wireless signal to laptops, phones, tablets (worked fine with Windows 7 workstation but won't work with Win10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found some incidents ( http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/internet-connection-sharing-ics-doesnt-work/acc568fa-52a1-4c23-8206-34f71a5dbe31 ) in the MS Community forums that pointed to needing to automatically start various
 services including:</p>

<p>It didn't mention needing to start the Routing and Remote Access service but I auto started it (apparently no help) but it starts then stops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My USB interface says "Internet Access" while the connected Ethernet interface (I have 2; one not connected) says "No network access". However, I can ping it at 192.168.137.1 and I can ping another laptop at 192.168.137.16 (which can ping ...137.1 too).

</p><p>A laptop with a wireless interface (connecting via the Linksys acting as a wireless repeater (not routing or serving DHCP) is obtaining its IP address 192.168.137.116 from 192.168.137.1 (the ICS system) which is also its gateway. This connection worked fine
 with the Win7 ICS setup. I can ping between these 2 systems. Can't reach 4.2.2.2 from the laptop but I can from the ICS system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking some service isn't started on the ICS system that needs to be (routing?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<h3> netnov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Errors burning movie to BD-R using HP bd340i burner and PowerProducer software</h2>
                    
<p>I have:</p>
<p>HP Pavilion</p>
<p>Model #: p6210y PC</p>
<p>AMD Athlon II 620 Quad-Core Processor</p>
<p>6GB system memory</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce 9100 integrated graphics</p>
<p>Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</p>
<p>Super Multi DVD Burner with LightScribe Technology</p>
<p><br />
Hardware added:</p>
<p>HP Blu-ray DVD Writerbd340i-H01&nbsp; 2 (I’ve seen where bd340iRH24 = Bd340i = LiteOn iHBS112 = HP N82E16827140051),</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software Added:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 64-bit,<br />
Business Contact Manager 2010 64-bit,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Communicator 2007 R2 32-bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HP bd340i came Bundled with Cyberlink Software DISK: Cyberlink BD Solution&lt;sup&gt;v6&lt;/sup&gt;, The ultimate playback &amp; burning suite for Blu-ray Disc</p>
<p>For BD Writer</p>
<p>Ÿ Power DVD &amp; BD</p>
<p>Ÿ PowerProducer 5</p>
<p>Ÿ PowerDirector 7</p>
<p>Ÿ Power2Go 6</p>
<p>Ÿ PowerBackup2</p>
<p>Ÿ LabelPrint2</p>
<p>I bought the bd340i-H01 2 burner and then some disks, Memorex Recordable BD-R 4X which I discovered are actually RITEK-BR2-000, in September 2010 and burnt a couple BD-R Blu-ray movies with no problem using the CyberLink Software. Since the end of November
 2010 I’ve been trying to burn another BD-R movie but keep getting errors. CyberLink takes 3 to 4 days to respond to anything and after a lengthy amount of time have not resolved my problem. Their last attempt to remedy was for me to install PowerProducer from
 a file they sent me. This did not work and I let their support know 1/12/11 and they have yet to respond so I am seeking help wherever I can.</p>
<p>I uninstalled all my CyberLink software, re-installed it, and I still get errors. I contacted HP and they suggested using Sony, Verbatim, TDK, or Tayo Yuden disks.</p>
<p>With the Memorex BD-R’s PowerProducer would usually go to 90% to 99% and then say there was an error. I bought some Verbatim D-R LTH Type Registrable, (VERBAT-IMw-000) and still get errors. But now it only goes to 20% to 21% before the error box pops up.</p>
<p>Errors I’ve received: “Burning Failed EB191E82”, “PowerProducer has stopped Working”, “Burning Failed …. (1)Burning not complete. (EB191087)”, “Burning Failed…. Not enough storage is available to complete this operation. (8007000E)”, “Burning Failed … Unspecified
 error (80004005)”, and with the Verbatim disks: “Burning Failed… (1) Could not format disc.(EB191784)”, “Burning Failed… (1)Burning not complete.(EB191087)”.</p>
<p>The only problem I’ve had with this computer was a few minor glitches after windows did an automatic update/upgrade in October 2010 and one of the things it did was change my email.&nbsp; It did not allow me to restore and I lost all my email contacts, rules,
 folders, settings, etc.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make a BD-R movie with menus from video I took with my HD Camera. The files download from my camera onto my computer as MP4 video. Even though this software came with my BD burner, the CyberLink software (PowerDirector) says it can’t import
 my video because it is H.264. I can only use PowerProducer. Any suggestions on what I need to do to successfully burn a BD-</p>
<p>R movie using PowerProducer v 5.5.3.2325 ULTRA? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 ISO near End of Support date</h2>
                    <p>I accept that this is a bit of a weird ask, but I hope someone can give me a definitive answer to the following question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have an unbranded OEM pack for Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit (That's the Microsoft produced DVD and product key in a blue cardboard sleeve), could I download an ISO of Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit on say the 13th January 2020 from Microsoft's own website
 that would have most of the security updates that have been released since my Windows 7 DVD was produced included?</p>

<p>You can download Windows 7 Retail and OEM System Builders ISO from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, NO, they do NOT contain all the updates since you obtained your DVD.</p>
<p>In other words it is not up to date with security Updates at the time you download it.</p>
<p>Microsoft does not slipstream monthly&nbsp;updates into its ISO download.</p>
<p>

<p>By calling the PC maker and see if they can supply a key.</p>
<p>Or if you have previously used your recovery / windows cd to install win, use Belarc Advisor or MagicJellyBean to reveal the key</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> If its the origonal factory image it will only reveal the VL key which is of no use to you</p>

 Windows Vista 64-bit.&nbsp;What do I do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Paviro suggested, you should attempt to boot to <span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a>.&nbsp; If you are able to do that then you can attempt
 a System Restore to a date prior to the updates.&nbsp; Then I would suggest that you install the updates one at a time (making a note&nbsp;of which one you install each time)&nbsp;and see if the issue occurs again.&nbsp; If it does you will know which one caused the issue and
 that will help in troubleshooting the problem.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also you should verify that all your hardware drivers are up to date.&nbsp; You should go to the website of the hardware maker to get the latest drivers.</span>
