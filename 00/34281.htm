<h2>            How to change &#34;sound control panel&#34; settings in Windows 10</h2>
                    <table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Bitrate For Audio Playback and Bits Per Sample For Audio</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Use these settings to fine-tune audio playback quality. For best results, the settings must match your settings in the Sound control panel in Windows.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In iTunes Edit/Preferences/Playback, there are user selected&nbsp;settings for audio sample rate and audio bits/sample. I found the above description in the iTunes documentation, i.e., "For best results (i.e., audio playback), the settings must match your settings
 in the Sound control panel in Windows"</p>
<p>How can I check&nbsp;the Windows sound control panel settings, and change them if necessary???</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Yes, I did this twice already. It is pretty tiring, and I am hopeful that someone from MS gets the message that we do not always think they know best.&nbsp;

<p>A) You would need to purchase a license if you wish to run an "activated" (full-featured) version of Windows 10; if you are okay with missing out on a few things like personalization settings, you
 can skip the activation and run an unlicensed copy on your VM.<span>&nbsp; </span>See here:</p>

    <title>Autologon on a Microsoft Account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t4ord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autologon on a Microsoft Account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro x-64, Autologon seems to have quit working around version 1809.&nbsp; It worked, along with sync with other devices, but since upgrading to 1809, I can only get it to work on a local user account.&nbsp; I tried the netplwiz fix, and the Registry fixes;
 I twice deleted my user account, created new local accounts, then changed them to Microsoft accounts, only to have Autologon work with the local accounts and quit working when they were changed to Microsoft accounts.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also have upgraded to version 1903,
 but still no Autologon with a Microsoft user account.&nbsp; Is this possible to fix, or has Microsoft eliminated this feature?&nbsp; I am not using Cortana.</p>

            Hi t4ord.
<br />if you set up auto login with a local account and then change the logon to use a microsoft account you need to set up the auto login again, same applies if you change the password.
<br />
<br />click start 
<br />type netplwiz and press enter 
<br />untick "users must enter a username and password..." 
<br />click apply 
<br />(if it is already unticked, tick the box and click apply then untick it again and click apply)
<br />you will be asked for a username and password (used to automatically log on). 
<br />if you are using a Microsoft account enter the FULL email address. 
<br />enter and verify your password and click ok 
<br />next time you boot the computer it will automatically log on. 
<br />
<br />NOTE - there is no need to switch to a local account, it WORKS perfectly well with a Microsoft account, as long as you enter the full email address in the username field. 
<br />blank passwords are NOT a good idea.
<br />do not forget the password.
<br />
<br />to prevent it asking for a password when waking from sleep, go to settings -&gt; accounts -&gt; sign-in options 
<br />under "require sign-in" select Never. 
<br />
<br />hope that helps please let us know if you experience any problems.

            Hi t4.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I've not heard skipping login has stopped working.
<br />
<br />Remember that you can change a Local Account password to blank in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options.  MS Account requires the password. 
<br />
<br />Besides the steps here to Skip Sign in try the ones to skip the Lock Screen:
<br /><a href="https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/skip-windows-10-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/skip-windows-10-lo...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-lock-screen-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-lock-scr...</a>
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks.&nbsp; After 1809, netplwiz didn't seem to have any effect - until I went to 1809 - then it did.&nbsp; Something must have gotten whacked by the 1809 upgrade (or something else about the same time) and fixed by the 1903 upgrade.

            is it working now?
<br />I have used it with a microsft account on every build (including insider builds) without any issue, so am surprised it didn't work for you on 1809.
<br />each time I have seen problems is when the requested information has had a typo (or in some cases left blank)
<br />that said, I did not try the registry fixes as well as netplwiz.
<br />
<br />still the important thing is that it is working for you now.

<p><span>At least once, you need to perform an upgrade to Windows 10 from an eligible operating system (Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1). As you have already done that from next time, you can perform clean install on the same computer using the Windows 10 ISO

            <p>Hello Milos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When attempting to boot to the F8 prompt, you may wish to hit the F8 key every second after the BIOS screen disappears.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes this helps if we run into problems just as we are supposed to see the F8 prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Gareth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that there is an issue with the system files of Windows 10. This can be the reason why you cannot run the DISM and SFC tools, and why you're unable to update to the latest version. We recommend
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">performing an in-place upgrade</a></strong>
 to replace the system files of Windows 10 and also to upgrade your copy of Windows 10 to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Having issues getting Update to work.</h2>
                    <p>This all started when I tried to install Quickbooks 2018, and found that Installer was not operating correctly. The first thing I did was to check for updates only to find Updater not on. When I try to turn it on I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows could not start the Windows Update service on local computer. error 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running System File Checker thru the cmd:sfc/scannow. But it came back with "did not find any integrity violations". So now I am stuck. There was apparently a Fix It at one time, but that is now gone. So now where do I go?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Tried Windows Update Troubleshooter, says it found and fixed issues but no change. Still no Updater</p>

<p>I had done most of this previously while following another help page, but I repeated it all again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Worked, although a couple were not on</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Ren catroot2 did not work because I already had a file named catroot2.bak from previous attempt last night. I gave it a different name and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ren SoftwareDistribution did not work because I already did this last night. SoftwareDistribution is already there, non-backup doesn't exist</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) wuauserv failed to start giving this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The Windows Update service is starting</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Windows Update service could not be started</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>A system error has occured.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>System error 2 has occured.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The system cannot find the file specified.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The other 3 starts worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same thing, no Updater, wusa.exe won't install with 0x80080005 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: I also tried setting the date back to before the certificate expiration to no effect.</p>

<p>I thought I had done this already, but I was not sure so I did it again. I can't run the SSU because Installer won't work. I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Installer encountered an error: 0x80080005</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Server execution failed</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually thought I had posted about the Installer error already, but reading back on my posts I see I never mentioned it. My apologies.
</p>
<p>Note that I had the same 0x80080005 issue when I tried to run the KB947821 SURT Windows Update Standalone Installer<em><strong>.</strong></em></p>

<p>We might need to look at your recovery options. You may try to perform an in-place upgrade. This will reinstall your Windows while keeping your files and installed applications. Follow the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2255099/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-on-windows-vista--windows-7--window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. If the issue persists, reset or reinstall your Windows by following
 the guide in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17101/windows-7-system-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both process will require you to use your installation disc. Use the one that came with your devices or the one provided by the manufacturer. Otherwise, learn how to create your own installation disc by following the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17423/windows-7-create-system-repair-disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>            Troubleshooting &#34;Unidentified network&#34; and &#34;No Internet access&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 64-bit Dell Precision desktop with Realtek wireless adapter card, trying to connect to home network. Many computers have connected wirelessly to the network just fine, desktop connects to the network via wired connection just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting to home network results in a public unidentified network with no internet access. Adapter settings are configured to automatic, an IP address is assigned. Logging into the router that IP address is listed next to a machine named "local-host-2"
 (not the actual name of the machine), with an inactive status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been Googling around trying to find a solution, I tried the following and there was no effect:</p>
<p>-Network Troubleshooter</p>
<p>-Drivers: update / roll-back / disable and enable / uninstall and scan for changes</p>
<p>-Network connection / router / desktop restart</p>
<p>-Disable IPv6</p>
<p>-ipconfig /release &amp; /renew - /renew times out and says "An error occured while renewing interface : unable to contact your DHCP server."</p>
<p>-route delete 0.0.0.0 and ipconfig /flushdns</p>
<p>-Disable McAfee network agent service (doesn't exist on this machine)</p>
<p>-netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Tried configuring static IP, no luck. I can't ping the router. arp -a -v shows physical address that is all 0s and a type "invalid" for the router's local IP.</p>

<h2>            My xbox360 is dead, apparantly.</h2>
                    
<p>So i played Borderlands 2 yesterday, when BOOM; ( disc is not readable/ unrecognizable) ..and i bought the game online so no disc was in. Restarted the console a couple of times, when i finally got a message saying i had to update the system. Updated, but
 still couldn't play the game.</p>
<p>Went on settings and saw that my HDD wasn't there.. great.. all game saves gone, everything bye bye..</p>
<p>So i turned it off and went to bed, wishing for better days today. Turned it on and BOOM!!! RED effn DOT.. E68 showing on my screen. Shouldnt a xbox last more than 4years??</p>
<p>So heres the question, Do I get a new one?, or is it time to say HEYYUU SONY!!</p>
<p>And i guess all my gamesaves are gone.. effn great!</p>

<h2>            Fable III DLC Dependancy -Stupid Issue-</h2>
                    
<p>HI, I've got a stupid issue, I've bought Some Fable 3 DLC on MY Console, on MY Gamer tag. Here's the list:</p>
<p>Fable III Industrial Knight Outfit<br />
Fable III Red Setter Dog Potion <br />
Fable III Dye Pack<br />
Fable III Five Star Dog Potion <br />
Fable III Dog Breed Set</p>
<p>Now, that's all well and good, but it's affecting a friends game save. (Different Gamer tag)&nbsp; (This is where it gets stupid)</p>
<p>A friend baught Her Gamesave and Gamertag to my place so we could do some missions together, and so we did, and everything was fine.<br />
She took her save and Gamer tag back to her console, and it is Refusing to load because 'You do not have the required DLC' Download Now.<br />
She never had any DLC to begin with.</p>
<p>She can load her game fine IF my Gamer tag is signed in on a second controller. Which tells me that the stupid game has made her save REQUIRE the DLC that i paid for, even though she has not used any of it. and now it's wanting her to BUY the same DLC just
 to load her game. This is ridiculous.<br />
The game shouldn't have given her MY DLC to begin with. and i see this as a shameless attempt at ripping her off.</p>
<p>Is there a way OTHER THAN Hacking the DLC dependency's out of her save file or Buying the DLC that she has NEVER HAD OR USED,&nbsp; just to get her save loading again without having me signed in on the same console.</p>

<p>Sadly this is the way DLC works in a great deal of cases. The game has to add that information into her save otherwise she would not have been able to play alongside you, she had access to it by virtue of playing on your console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I agree that it is a not very nice practice but sadly the only way to fix this is to buy the content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would not attempt to 'hack' the save either. Not only is it likely that you could mess up the save and destroy it entirely, but there is a rik that Microsoft could detect that and her profile ends up banned.</p>

<h2>            GTA V wont install from Xbox 360 MARKETPLACE&#33;&#33; HELP PLEASE&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Back in December, I purchased GTA V through the XBOX 360 MARKETPLACE(not any discs) and I downloaded it over night. It worked fine until last week. Last week before the Independence Day update, the game literally deleted itself from my games. I went to download
 it back and had a few problems. First, it was very slow, and stayed at 0% and moved 1% after 30 minutes of staying at 0% then moved on at normal pace. Once at 100%, I got an error saying "Xbox can't download GTA V" or something of that sort.. Every day for
 the past week, it would stay at 0% and then say it couldn't install the game. After the Xbox told me it couldn't install the game, I would be in the Xbox Guide menu (where it shows Friends, Party, Messages, etc.) and my screen would freeze. I was able to still
 talk to my friends in the Xbox Live Party, but my screen would stay frozen and I would have to turn off my Xbox. Also, it would be slow to download the free games with gold , this month's being Gotham City Imposters. With every other download such as game
 updates or new games (one being Castle Crashers), it would install and download smoothly. I do have enough memory for the games, I tried the Port switch (or Port swap, I don't remember the exact term), clearing the marketplace cache, the data cache, and deleting
 the corrupted files but I'm still not able to download the two games. PLEASE HELP?!?!</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>I have an XBOX 360 4GB Slim with two flash drives for memory. I am in the US and checked all the correct country services. I've never had this problem before and it's sort of slowing down my Xbox Speed. My Verizon FIOS is NOT the problem of the install or
 any connection problems of the sort, or I don't think that it is connecton problems. PLEASE HELP ASAP!

<p>its the fact that you have a 4GB console, and your using USB flash drives for the game. 3.0 USB flashdrives are the best ones to have, but if you don't want to have anymore problems with your xbox as far as games being deleted, or freezing issues, you will
 need to get a hard drive. I have a 250GB console and have had it for about 4 years now, and I still have 40GB to download games. also a hard drive can handle games better than a USB flash drive, and this is the perfect example of why you should not use flash
 drives</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft uses the <strong>ESD</strong> file format to deliver the installation files needed.
<strong>ESD</strong> stands for <strong>Electronic Software Delivery</strong>.<br />
<br />
The Windows <strong>install.esd</strong> file contains the usual Windows <strong>
install.wim</strong> file (WIM = Windows Imaging), encrypted and compressed. <strong>
Install.wim</strong> file it contains everything needed for a complete Windows installation.<br />
<br />
May we know the exact build you are using?</p>

            <p>I am currently using Windows 10, having recently upgraded from Windows 8.1. In the Disk Cleanup utility I deleted everything that was available on accident. I was reading on an article that if the ESD files were deleted, then I would be unable to reset Windows

    <title>Lenovo laptop getting stuck on updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cameronwatt95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo laptop getting stuck on updates</h2>
                    <p>I have a second hand Lenovo laptop with Windows 8.1 which seems to have gotten stuck on updating. I tried to shut it down yesterday, but it only gave the option to either shut down and update or restart and update. I don't want any updates, but it seemed
 unavoidable. So I tried to shut it down, and it just continuously loaded without actually shutting down properly. The screen went off, so I assumed it was shut down, but when I tried to switch it on the next morning it said it was still shutting down. So I
 just held the power button until it switched off entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to switch it on and it came up with something saying 'updating your system'. It loads up until 11%, at which point it just gets stuck and I have to switch it off and try again, but it still keeps getting stuck at 11%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? Is there a way I can just get the laptop to switch on without installing the updates? Help please.</p>

    <title>Humble indie supplement Week of 22nd of August - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hobblejp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Humble indie supplement Week of 22nd of August</h2>
                    
<p>Welcome once again to my unprofessional look at what the indie marketplace has managed to come up with this week.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering on the delay pick one of the reasons below</p>
<p>I was going to write it but I found I had alcohol instead</p>
<p>Some developer managed to slip out a release today meaning I delayed to write a review of that game as well</p>


<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Pajamorama</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80 MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> “Oh god not another piece of **** game that tries to sell on some stupid concept of *** alone I’m not reviewing this ******* piece of ****” That was my initial reaction upon seeing the game on the indie marketplace but I thought I’d do
 it to give a few people a laugh as I wrote a huge rant of the game and how terrible it is and there better stuff free on the internet etc etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I played the game and that’s why this isn’t one of those reviews. If you after material for your own intimate pleasure look elsewhere as short of the game icon this game tries and fails miserably at the *** sells idea. The game itself plays like Smash
 Bros but without the random item mayhem that comes with that game rather than health you have damage and the aim is simple in the main mode, reduce the enemies stock to nothing by knocking them off the level. Now before I go on I should say I’m going to be
 very hard on this game but you’ll see why in the verdict. The fighting works with each character having slightly varied moves but they are based on the same attacks meaning the game is balanced and has some difference beyond aesthetic in the characters I’m
 sure some one could find a way to abuse the game or one characters moves but I didn’t find a way.</p>
<p>The characters move like they are card split pinned together most of the time and I can’t help but feel time would have been better spent on giving a decent impression of gravity to the characters themselves and not just their breasts which seem to have
 been coded with the jiggle engine from the DOA series while the girls themselves seem immune to gravity as long as you’re doing a move of some kind . The game also boasts 2-4 player online multiplayer which for an indie game is rare and for a fighting game
 on indie marketplace is rare too my point being no one will play it there, its an indie game people don’t play those online and seriously who has a friend out there who would buy a game called Pajamorama about girls fighting with one another just to vs you
 online ? seriously ?</p>

<p><b>Verdict:</b> The Best Fighting game on the indie marketplace, I’m not joking it really is, balanced yet different characters where the moves work unlike some other indie fighting games I’ve played and nor can the game be won by spamming a single button
 (or infact require you to do that to win). If you can convince a friend to buy it they won’t regret it. With varied stage locations that aren’t simply different pallet swaps as each level has different physical features such as extra platform sections. It
 even manages almost competent AI (something many big developers still can’t manage ).</p>
<p>This game was a pleasant surprise even if I do feel the development team would have been better using their talents on a game that didn’t try and sell itself on boobs alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Motorbike Stunt Agent Julie</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80 MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A comic book art style that hides under it a very impressive mix of trials HD and metal slug only without the annoyance and broken controllers that come with Trials HD. With again actual voice actors, I think this week my faith in indie
 developers have been restored and actually increases as this is two games for two that were damn well done and dare I say it something I’d have expected to have seen Microsoft steal and try to pass off as more games room machines etc (please don’t do that
 MS)</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A valiant effort worth the 80MSP asking price my only major issues being the extreme precision in the shooting and the level of on screen chaos meaning I sometimes lost where I actually was on screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> 4 [unknown Japanese symbols I can’t type] 3D</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80 MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> OK its 4 in a row in 3D how do I even review it, the game works and lets you rotate the board etc, though lack of online play hampers it slightly. Also there’s a slight annoying glitch / error where the game will pick up on the 4 in a
 row but won’t say you’ve won until your opponent goes for his turn.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> It works mostly if you really must own a digital 4 in a row 3D game then you’ve got lucky other than that I really don’t see why you’d buy it.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Nene Minigames</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Nene minigames or to give the game its full title Nene Hell is these Mini games. I’m sorry I love mini games as much as the next person but no just no, this game shattered my faith in indie developers. This game is not Mario Party, it’s
 not Wario Ware, this game is incredible crisis only worse, the game follows some paper thin storyline about having to do mini games to progress through the day, only unlike incredible crisis where the mini games at least related to the action this game seems
 to want to be everything and it does nothing right, the mini games are dull a unimaginative and simplistic to the nth degree, I’ve played the first set of mini games and the first day two mini game here’s what they were. Whack a mole , Build a burger for total
 idiots, Cups (finding an object under a cup and watching where it goes etc), Quick Draw (which as the games for up to 4 players I have no idea how it would work), Pick a face (math the face given to the line up) and finally counting shapes (which even managed
 to have a glitch as there was only 1 blue star yet it classed that as the wrong answer). Each player gets a score based on the mini game and the player with the highest score or who was fastest wins and if you were say helping with the illegal torture of another
 human to extract information using this game, would mean the winner gets t pick the next game assuming it’s not a mandatory game space. Each day brings more mini games with it but on the first day you’re limited to 5 mini games until you finish the day but
 each time you play the same mini game it gets harder. Now I didn’t top any of the games out but I can tell already by level 6 finishing the game would be a joke as on duel at level 3 I had 0.8 of a second to press the corresponding button to win, it takes
 me 0.8 of a second the read and comprehend which button to press while sober. The game so badly wants to be Mario Party and it just isn’t. If you lose all your lives in single player you also have to restart the day over from the very beginning. Even Duke
 nukem forever had better mini games in it than this.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> 240MP for this game with no online play is a joke plain and simple. In incredible crisis the mini games got harder but you played because of the insanity of the story to see what could possible go wrong next even though the mini games lost
 their fun and became a chore quickly, in this game the mini games start as chores which only work to break up the most boring storyline ever written about a kid walking to school then finding he has to study for a test. If you want a game for the same price
 go out to you local games store and buy Bishi Bashi special on PS1 or Incredible crisis and play those. At best this is a game for your 3 year old who has never played a game with mini games in it ever before in his life. Otherwise unless you’re working at
 a secret government detention centre trying to get information from a suspect by and means I can’t in good conchiouns recommend this game to you.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Doc Logic</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> I reviewed an 8 bit game last week and it make me want to barf this week I’m reviewing another but this one is actually good. The 8bit style works and yet lets people sign in without having an 8 bit sign in screen which makes you feel
 like you’re butchering the 360 graphics card just by playing it. Doc Logic is a 2D game where you’re only objective is to get the highest score possible and survive, and it works you can only die by running out of time and hitting enemies powers you down so
 you can’t jump as high or run as fast to get the stopwatches to keep the timer running, each time you clear the screen of stopwatches a new lot randomly respawn in as do more enemies, which come in varied types and also pallet swapped versions with different
 behaviour behind them, the game even offers a variety of stuff to help you, as at a distance you fight shots at enemies up close the game automatically does a sweeping melee, you also have shields and can nuke the enemies.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> I once an old “portable” played Space invaders game for 18 hours straight and got to over level 500 on it. Thank god it wasn’t dock damage or I probably would never have got board and left the thing alone. 80 MSP, bargain for a game that
 will keep the kids quiet for hours ( if you do have kids that is).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Attack</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A new old school inspired art style, Attack has your line tank driving along the printer paper along a table taking out turrets and other tanks along the way with suitable explosions into numbers and garbled symbols. This game is also
 quite tough but worth playing with some of the most natural controls I’ve ever felt in a tank game which really give the feel of driving a heavy machine of war.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Worth every point for the art style alone, if it were done micro machine style as a small tank fighting it might have had me saying it deserves to be priced up for more but as it is the art style works even if it is simplistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Torque Quest</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Think of Adult Swim the whole channel, now make it into a game, then get drunk, then remake the game out of bits and pieces you find about. This is Torque quest an RPG text adventure with pictures that is also an object puzzle game. The
 game had me in stitches from the boatman to take you home to getting beat up by the barman who is also a demigod and dislocating the main characters shoulder by reaching for a key in a toilet a la silent hill, to then trying to have a conversation with the
 toilet. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Definitely not a game for the kids or grandma here, I’d even say its specialist, if you laughed at “Dude Where’s my car ?” then this game might well be for you otherwise the mix of slightly messed up vulgar humour might make you regret your
 purchase. Though for the moment hold off buying it as the game has more spelling and grammar issue than me in these reviews, which hopefully the developer will go back and correct.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Raventhrone</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b></p>
<p>Oh no another game by the Avatar farm guys already but I have to say they’ve done ok with this outing, making a very complex Hack and slash RPG adventure game. With a art style very much with the feel of Limbo but as a popup book about Norse mythology, the
 controls work and the spell system almost manages to be useful. My only major complaint is the game itself, I started on normal and for the style of game the enemies seem to take just slightly too long to kill to enjoy it. The game itself really has you working,
 with strong attacks weak attacks, combos blocking and a kind of parry a stamina bar which is drained by your attacks and by blocking a strong enemy attack but does restore (even if it is annoying running out in mid combo and standing there like a lemon waiting
 to be able to so much as block again). The game is a mashed up story with your hero having a helmet and hammer pretty much like Thor but following a slightly Hercules esc plotline. The basic plot is in the mortal coil someone tried to kill you the Sisters
 of fate find your fate strand is solid gold in this part of your life meaning you shouldn’t have died and as such the sisters of fate let you go to Valhalla to be sent back to the mortal world by the gods and to fight for the gods against an enemy presumed
 to have tried to kill you thinking you’d want to defend the gods anyway.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Not perfect and for all the issues it only just justifies the price tag, but its still better than parasites Ninja Zero from last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Attack of the Evil Androids</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240 MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> this game has you playing as an emoticon trying to take out the google mobile operating system mascot, the art for the game initially looks great until you start playing where you find rather than a player character you’re a smiley face
 emoticon who gets round by rolling, yet you can also shoot missiles and fire the near worthless bombs, most of the game is spent injuring yourself by rolling into walls and finding frustratingly you need to do a rolloing jump to get up some edges, this is
 made all the harder by a control scheme that is both tight and loose at the same time in a way you can only ever experience by playing the game, as your moment seems to carry on but other actions seem razor sharp.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> The game makes reference in the beginning to the Windows 7 phone and I can’t help but feel that’s where this game should have been released, for 240MSP it’s a joke at 80MSP it would have justified its price but for 240MSP it’s a rip off plain
 and simple the only time this game would be worth owning is on a windows 7 phone and only being played on occasion when you feel like hitting your head against a brick wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Cursed Loot</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> an old school dungeon crawler with more depth than most old school ones, infact more depth than most new age ones, the randomly generated dungeon is nice as is the sense of humour in the game as well as the fairly complex yet easy to Use
 RPG esc levelling and fighting system. Theres different classes giving replay ability as well as awardments which unlock extra stuff in game for future playthroughs and each class seems distinct enough from the beginning to make a difference. Add in more complex
 stuff like cursed armours you can’t remove unknown potions which might harm you, turn you to a ghost that can attack and not be hit, let you fly so you can hit and not be hit as much or give you a shield to protect from damage</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> justifies the price and then some. If they threw in online and offline co op play I think I’d even pay 800MSP for it as an arcade released, and if they gave it graphics that weren’t simply 8bit sprites 1200MSP. This is the dungeon crawler
 I’ve been waiting for and hoped Dungeons and dragons or that other game whose name I can’t remember should really have been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best game of the Week: A tough one this week but this weeks best game is Cursed Loot</p>

<p>Games to I bought: None yet though I have a feeling Cursed Loot and Torque quest might soon be taking some points off me replacing Blow me up on the list of games to spent spare points on.</p>

<p>This week also has an honourable mention for the game Pajamorama which if it were last week would probably have been top of my list of games but coming out in a very good week for indie games and for the fact I don’t want to forever play only bots on the
 game it just lost out. Still it is the best fighting game in the indie marketplace. Take heed indie developers, this is how you make a fighting game that works !</p>
