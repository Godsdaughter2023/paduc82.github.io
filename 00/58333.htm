    <title>Mouse left click SOMETIMES acts as right click - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noahellam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse left click SOMETIMES acts as right click</h2>
                    <p>So first of all I just want to make it clear that I know about switching which mouse button is the primary button and am 100% sure I'm on the right setting (left click as normal click and right click as open context menu etc) so please don't suggest that
 I check/uncheck the box in mouse properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So every 5-10 left clicks (it's completely random) my mouse registers a right click (I have done this very slowly to make sure I wasnt accidentally hitting right click somehow) so if I spam left click every so often the context menu appears as if I right
 clicked. Also before anybody suggests that I buy a new mouse I bought 3 (1 wireless and 2 wired of different brands) when I upgraded my PC last because I had another seperate but equally as annoying mouse bug and on ALL 3 this bug occurs, I have completely
 reinstalled windows on a fresh harddrive, none of my pc bits at all apart from the case are even the same as the last time I had a mouse bug (I replaced literally everything but case) and I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling mouse drivers countless times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scoured google for weeks and found nothing, I really am out of ideas. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

3. Type the three letters cmd into the Search box.<br />
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
5. Click "Run as Administrator".<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "Jack" xxyyzz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup administrators "Jack"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net users<br />
<br />
The above commands will create a new admin account called "Jack" with a password of "xxyyzz".<br />

<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            <p>I am having the exact same issue.&nbsp; I followed the advice given.&nbsp; After running that scan, I received the following confidence un-inspiring&nbsp;feedback:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Resource Protections found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.&nbsp; For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.&nbsp; Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing
 scenarios."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sound still continues to play through the laptop speakers, even though headphones that worked with this PC prior to the Win 10 upgrade do not get sound anymore when plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving on to your method 2, the troubleshooter admitted "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking in the Device Manager, I saw no sound-related (or any other items there, for that matter) marked with a yellow exclamation that there is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what seemed to work.&nbsp; I noticed in Control Panel under Hardware and Sound at the bottom of the page is a "Realtek HD Audio Manager".&nbsp; Just for kicks I opened it up, unplugged my headphone and reinserted it.&nbsp; Suddenly, that window opened up a smaller
 window asking me if I'd plugged in a headset or some other type of device.&nbsp; I clicked headset, and voila!&nbsp; I now have sound playing through my headset and not out of the laptop's loudspeakers.&nbsp; I hope this lasts.</p>

<h2>            No audio output device is installed&#63; &#40;Can&#39;t find appropriate audio driver from manufacturer&#41;</h2>
                    Recently, I accidentally cut off the power to my 32 bit Vista Gateway desktop computer. After turning the computer back on, I found that the sound icon had a red cross (No audio output device is installed). Here are the several things I tried to remedy
 this:<br />
<br />
1) Go to device manager to attempt to update the driver, but the "sound, video, and game controllers" tab was not there (anymore).<br />
2) Do a windows update (yeah I know I shouldn't have)<br />
3) System restore to the point before I accidentally cut off the power to my computer (still no sound)<br />
4) Go to the Gateway website to download the sigmatel audio driver, BUT when I downloaded the file and ran it, all I got was a text file stating the following:<br />
<br />
Installation instructions: c:\cabs\D00812-001-001\read_me.txt<br />
<br />
<br />
Las instrucciones de la instalación: c:\cabs\D00812-001-001\D00812-001-001_r…<br />
<br />
<br />
設置指示： c:\cabs\D00812-001-001\D0081…<br />
<br />
^This was completely useless<br />
<br />
So....where can i find the appropriate audio driver???? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback in advance.

<p>Good move however you need to find out for sure exactly what video you have in your computer.<br />
Have them work out checking for OnBoard&nbsp;Sound enabled in BIOS if that is what you have. If&nbsp;you<br />
do have a Sound Card then you need to ensure BIOS is set to allow that and make sure the Sound<br />
Card&nbsp;is seated properly and has no other correctable issues to make sure it is found. Of course it<br />
is possible that your Sound device has gone bad.<br />
<br />
Hope you get it sorted out.</p>

<p>If you can afford a 60 dollar game, and 45 dollars of DLC, there is no excuse for no mic.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Just like the others said, some people don't want to hear the whiny little kids, mouth breathers and other people. IMO with rotating spawns you don't need that much communication.
 Plus, I see you play Battlefield also. You should be use to not talking to randoms over there;)&nbsp; Also, between the two games I would think BF needs more comms between players than most of COD. The only exception to this would be objective game-types(S&amp;D, DOM
 and CTF). Anything else, you just run around with your head cut off spraying,<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> unless you are playing Hardcore</span></b>. Then I see your point.

<p>Navigate to the following folder and copy all the files in that folder to a separate folder on your netbook.&nbsp; Or simply copy the folder itself and transfer it to your netbook by using a flash drive or similar.&nbsp; Let us know if it works or not.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I have to think about that reply because I disagree on several points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These games (like Mahjong &amp; Solitaire, etc.) generally do NOT require any "installation" in the traditional sense that they write themselves into the registry.&nbsp; Simply copying all the files (in the previously mentioned folder) should work.&nbsp; As for updated
 support files - c'mon...when is the last time Microsoft released "Updated" support files for Mahjong and Solitaire.</p>
<p>seriously. And even if they did, the game would still work regardless of whether the user had downloaded the "updated help files". It's not like you're going to break the solitaire game just because you didn't download some update for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you're not aware, Windows 7 includes free games like Mahjong which was not included with previous operating systems.&nbsp; As far as I know, it's a part of the Windows OS and is covered by the EULA.&nbsp; I doubt Mike042 is in any danger of breaking any copyright
 laws or breaking Microsoft's rules.&nbsp; Secondly, Microsoft did not invent Solitaire or Mahjong.&nbsp; These games can be readily found on the internet for free.&nbsp; As long as Mike042 has a legitimate copy of Win7 on his laptop, he should be able to use them with his
 windows OS.&nbsp; It would be interesting to see if Microsoft specifically has a policy that prohibits people like Mike042 from attempting to do what he's asking.&nbsp; And even if there was one - how in the world are they going to police that? Impossible.</p>

            I'm seeing the same thing. I have 64 bit Win7 on my desktop and Windows Starter on a mini laptop. The 64 bit Mahjong, when copied over to the mini says that version is not compatible with teh Win version I am running. I copied the directory from my mother-in-law's
 computer (32 bit) and it tells me the same thing.
<div><br />
<div>Why would something like Mahjong not be included in some versions of the software?</div>
<div><br />
<div>How can I "legally" get a copy that will run on my mini? I can't find any free downloads, only the kind you have to play online. But I would like to have it to waste time in situations such as on an airplane...</div>

                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have reserved a free copy of Windows 10, and my friend did not. During the process of installing it, I read something that talked about being able to install it on multiple devices.
 My friend was complaining about how he wanted Windows 10, so I started to download a copy of Windows 10 onto a DVD for him to use to install it. Now that I have finished burning the disc, I have realized that, although he will have a product code, he may not
 be able to install it because we have different Microsoft accounts. Does anyone know if I will be able to give it to him, or will I get in trouble with Microsoft?</span>

    <title>Windows Firewall and Windows Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfresh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Firewall and Windows Updates</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
So I work as a tech in an enterprise,&nbsp;networked, environment and one issue I have to contend with quite often is our Windows Firewall being enabled.
<br />
<br />
Currently our image is set by default to disable the Windows Firewall Service, though no Group Policy is in place to prevent our users from turning it on should they want to.
<br />
<br />
The problem is that this happens on a lot of computers and for no particular reason. Our users are not ones that I would think would take the time to go through and check to see if Windows Firewall is on every single day :P.
<br />
<br />
So I've been thinking about it and the only common function that could possibly tie in with it is Windows Updates or perhaps the Malicious Software Removal Tool update that this downloaded monthly.
<br />
<br />
Out of curiousity, are there Windows Updates or is it a part of the Malicious Software Removal Tool to check to see if particular services (i.e. Windows Firewall Service) is enabled and if not enable them?
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time,<br />
<br />

<div>Hi JFresh,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Malicious Software Removal Tool and Windows Updates are not responsible to turn firewall on again and again.
<br />
In this scenario we can set the Windows firewall to manual and its status as stop.<br />
Here is how:<br />
1. Hold the Windows key and type R, enter "services.msc" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
2. Scroll down to the Windows Firewall service, right click on it and select Properties<br />
3. In the dropdown box that says "Manual", set it to "Stop" in the service status and then click on "Apply"<br />
4. Click OK to exit the dialog</div>
<div><br />
Hope this helps.</div>

<h3> pauld12065  say:</h3>
<h2>            Declined the Windows 10 EULA and Now Laptop has BCD 0x0000098 Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, my laptop decided to install Windows 10 on itself after months of clicking no to the annoying upgrade pop-up boxes. This morning when I opened the lid I got the standard "Welcome to Windows 10" message much to my horror and when the EULA
 came up I clicked decline. A message then came up that said "Ok we'll revert you back to 8 but this may take awhile."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great! It rebooted and I left it alone and when I came back sometime later the computer was completely off. So I took it to work and fired it up again only to be greeted with a blue screen saying that the PC needs to be repaired and that I should use Win
 8 recovery tools. At this point I'm extremely angry with Microsoft since I didn't authorize installation of this OS upgrade and now my computer is temporarily bricked which has cost me productivity.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried using one recovery program with no success and I know that all of my files and 8 OS are still on the HD but does anyone have any tips to get me back to where I was before this abomination? Microsoft, you have no business forcing this upgrade
 on us especially when we work with software that may not work fully with the new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<h2>            Some Windows 10 Store Apps crash a few seconds after launching</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue whereby some of the apps I've installed from the Store crash soon after launching. I get the splash screen for a few seconds, but then the apps just close with no error messages. Microsoft Solitaire works fine, but apps such as MS Mahjong,
 MS Sudoku, MS Minesweeper, MS Treasure Hunt all crash. I first noticed this right after the upgrade from Windows 7 to 10 (I'm on Windows 10 Home N). I've tried many things suggested on communities and the like (wsreset, sfc etc.), even down to doing a clean
 install of Windows 10, all to no avail. Looking at the Event log, I see the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: Treasure Hunt.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x536a246f<br />
Faulting module name: twinapi.appcore.dll, version: 10.0.10240.16397, time stamp: 0x55af0938<br />
Exception code: 0xc000027b<br />
Fault offset: 0x0001cab9<br />
Faulting process ID: 0x20f0<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01d0d0fa7595bef0<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.MicrosoftTreasureHunt_1.0.1405.747_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe\Treasure Hunt.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\System32\twinapi.appcore.dll<br />
Report ID: bd0137c3-9f2d-41cf-af14-67d6b9201452<br />
Faulting package full name: Microsoft.MicrosoftTreasureHunt_1.0.1405.747_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe<br />
Faulting package-relative application ID: App</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, all the apps that crash report&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\twinapi.appcore.dll as the "faulting module path".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone any ideas what I can try next???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p />

            I also get this error, but with Microsoft Mahjong app. If I reinstall the app, it will start normally after the first launch. Then when I close and try to re-open it, it crashes after a second.

            I'm currently working with MS Support on this issue - we are down to Tier 3 now, so it looks as though its not an obvious fix! I suspect it might be something to do with the "N" version of Windows 10 that I happen to be on, but I will update once we get
 somewhere. I have another call scheduled with them tomorrow morning.

            I have Windows 10 Pro, so I'm not sure that would help me. What I did try was start Media Player to do the initial setup for it, but at least that didn't fix the problem.

</p><p>Thanks mwild999! I also experienced the same&nbsp;problem ("N" version of Windows10, and Sudoku crashes upon startup, and Solitaire crashes when I dig through the menus to start a game). I followed your link, installed the Media Feature Pack, and now both games

<h2>            Custom Gamerpic not changing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with my gamerpic not switching to a custom gamerpic anymore. I have never had this problem before as it would always switch to another gamerpic once changed. This problem starting happening to me a few days ago. I changed my gamerpic to a drawing that I made and it switched, but the gamerpic wasn't positioned correctly. I decided to upload the gamerpic again with the correction, but as I switched it to the new one, it reverted back to an older custom gamerpic. The thought that was running through my mind was that it was bad since it happened to me before when I did switch it to a bad image. This time the image had nothing wrong with it, it was just a fox smiling. This is when the problem started. I tried to change my gamerpic to something different like a flower and nothing seemed to change, got the same old verify and ok message but nothing. I kept trying to change it but it never changed, so I decided to talk to a few friends about it and they seem to be having t

<h2>            Polk Audio 4 Shots Headset - Getting Your Money Back</h2>
                    
<p>* Email sent from me to Polk using the website <a href="http://www.polkaudio.com/support/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">customer support e-mail page</span></a></p>
<p>“Hi, my name is [REMOVED] and I'm a purchaser of the 4 Shots for the Xbox One. I want to start off with saying that the sound that comes out of these headsets is great for the price; however the microphone themselves, the one that is built in, is subpar
 and not worthy of the Polk audio name from my experience of your products. I understand a while back, when I had a chance to still return them we were told both publically and by e-mail that Polk audio were working with Microsoft to solve the issue and we
 would be issues a TEMPORARY replacement boom microphone, which I received. It works, although the cord itself, due to the flat wire design is an endless untangling mess that gets caught on everything – there is endless feedback whenever I talk or someone talks.
 However I, as the customer am feeling like all responsibility has been put on the customer and we have been pushed aside as I talked to a Polk audio representative, twice about a return and was told it was not possible. When I was told I would get a call back
 from a manager, two weeks later here I am and no phone call and a promise that has been pushed off to Microsoft. While Microsoft is known for not following through (ADDED: sorry Microsoft, it’s true, still love you better than Apple) and Polk usually does,
 and their promise for updates to fix this issue has not been addressed I didn’t buy the headset from Microsoft, I bought it from Polk audio. The microphone does not work the way it was intended for the device it was intended for and I would like to return
 my product due to false advertisement. If you could please contact me I would much appreciate your support. Thank you for taking your time to read this.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>* Email received from [Mod Removed] </b></p>
<pre><b><span>“[REMOVED],<br />
There was no false advertising when it comes to the 4Shot, or any of our products for that matter. The headset works fine, but the issue is with Microsoft designed puck adapter. The update at this point has no release date from Microsoft, which is why we were sending out the boom mics. We would be happy to send a replacement boom mic and puck adapter to you.”</span></b></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Email reply from me at <b>[Mod Removed]</b></p>
<p>“It was stated that the stow away microphone would work with the Xbox One; that IS in fact false advertisement. Last couple times I talked to a representative it was stated that the issue was left up to Microsoft and a TEMPORARY boom microphone would be
 issued. It has been months since its release and still nothing but false promises for a fix when it should of worked since the beginning if it was tested properly. As a customer who has bought Polk audio equipment in the past, I’m extremely disappointed in
 this product and the way Polk decided to take the blame game as an escape goat. I want a refund on a product that does not work as intended as I'm completely dissatisfied with the product... if you can’t provide me what in requesting then I want to talk to
 someone in Management about this.”</p>

<p><b>* Email received from&nbsp;<b>[Mod Removed]</b> </b></p>
<p><b>“As previously stated, the problem is a firmware/software issue that affects the Microsoft made puck adapters.&nbsp; This issue is mentioned on many different sites, and it causes different problems with all other headsets that require it.&nbsp; as a temporary
 fix until the Update from Microsoft for their product was released, we were sending out this alternate mic FOR FREE. The puck adapter itself has been flawed, and that is why no headsets were available until March of this year from any company, as opposed to
 the original launch date release expected.&nbsp; All headsets, especially ours, since it was designed with Microsoft, were designed to work flawlessly with the original puck concept, but the puck was altered, and was not available to anyone until the release date
 of the headphones.”</b></p>

<p>* Email reply from me at <b>[Mod Removed]</b></p>
<p>“So again, a promise that the headset would with the Xbox One and it does not. Like I said if I can’t get a refund through you I want to talk with your manager. If I can’t get through to him I want to talk to his manager, so on and so forth. If I do not
 get in touch with someone I will proceed in any way possible to get what was promised, a working headset without some forced solution/empty promise or until I get a refund. TRANSFER ME TO YOUR MANAGER...”</p>

So typically speaking when a customer needs to talk to a manager do they always get the run around first. Two promised phone calls from representatives over the past two weeks about this situation and no contact from a manager. I'm sorry if I don't believe
 it but given the last two weeks I'm calling [PROFANITY]. Send me his company e-mail address so I can ensure that I'm talking to him and not given false promises much like the 4 Shots. The whole reason I'm not talking over the phone is because it's near impossible
 to get anyone to agree to recording conversations, typically get hung up on so with this said I'm keeping records of all conversations between individuals. If you can't get me his direct contact information and or a promise/timeline on when he/she can reach
 me then I would like your direct number. When I call it will be recorded.”</p>

 point we would not be able to give you a refund though [ADDED: he really used though at the end of this conversation…]</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Email reply from me at <b>[Mod Removed]</b></p>
<p>“See that is where you are wrong. The replacement parts are a temporary solution until it was fixed by Polk and Microsoft. Neither of you have come up with a solution to fix the issue to use the original microphone nor is there a plan implemented to fix
 this issue or a projected date. False advertisement is a reason for a refund...”</p>

<p><b>“[Mod Removed],<br />
I am contacting you in reference to the 4 Shot headset which does not work as it was intended. Although a temporary solution has been issued to customers, there has been no update on the release for an update to fix this issue. Since its launch it has not worked
 for the Xbox One as intended and we as the customers have been provided false promises by both Polk audio and Microsoft in regards to this issue. If the device was truly tested then it should have worked as intended from the start. If it's due to Microsoft's
 schematic change, which shouldn't create issue, then you (Polk) need to make a better effort to work with Microsoft to solve this issue rather than using them as an escape goat because of their horrible business practices [ADDED: Sorry again Microsoft…]. While
 I do appreciate the temporary work around, Polk and Microsoft have not come up with a plan/timeline on when this issue would be fixed. With this said I am requesting a refund for my product which I will ship to your company once we figure out a solution for
 this problem. The reasons I'm requesting a refund is we were promised that the low profile microphone would work with the Xbox One, which it does not. The temporary solution you have issued gets tangled in everything because of the flat wire design. The headphones
 noise inside causes feedback to the issued microphone because of the horrible job done on keeping noise from escaping and because of this I have to turn down my volume to only 5 volume clicks out of 15. I CAN NOT enjoy my experience with this headphones and
 AM NOT satisfied with my experience. As a Polk audio customer in the past I have purchased products and have been a loyal customer until now due to the way Polk has decided to handle the situation after the fact of issuing the temporary solution. I have purchased
 just under $10,000 worth of home audio equipment which I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
LOVE</span> and have not had issues with in the past 4 years. With this said coming from Polk it's disgraceful that you would release a product as such.”</b></p>

<p><b>I’ve decided to call Microsoft in regards to this issue since it seems to be their fault, so this is how it played out. Even if it was Microsoft’s issue I bought the headset from Polk audio and they stated information that was incorrect. Discussed the
 4 Shot headset sold by Polk and the partnership between Microsoft and the development for this piece of hardware. During our discussion I asked if there is a known issue with the headsets, more specifically the 4 Shot headsets while connecting it to the Xbox
 One controller. She denied that the headset issue is due to a Microsoft Xbox One update issue; all while a Polk representative stated multiple times that the headset wasn’t the issue it was in fact an Xbox One “puck adapter” issue.</b></p>

 the chain e-mail I felt that this issue would be resolved. With this said, is this going to be an issue with the return as long as I have the original box and the receipt? Also what items are you requiring that I send out in this package if the above isn't

<p>Will update everyone on the true outcome of requesting the refund. I find it important that people get what they pay for. When you're promised a product that does not perform as intended I feel as if we're all being taken advantage of. Some of us feel as
 if we have no say in the matter, others do not know how to go about issues like this, so I've provided an example of how I did it. Don't get me wrong Polk audio is an excellent company and I've never had problems until today; do not let this deter you from
 buying products from them in the future as they usually have excellent customer service. This just happens to be one result of a bad business decision.</p>

<p>Meghann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; The first reply&nbsp;is incorrect&nbsp;but it is always wise to have a spare [i.e. unused] password-protected local Admin user account in case your day-to-day user account ever gets corrupted - you'll then be able to log in using the spare Admin in order to rescue
 the situation.&nbsp; I think you ought to make such an additional account now before&nbsp;doing anything else&nbsp;-
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Start</em> button, </li><li><em>Settings</em>, </li><li><em>Accounts</em>, </li><li><em>Family &amp; other users</em>, </li><li>[<em>Other users</em> section], </li><li><em>Add someone else to this PC,</em></li><li><em>I don't have this person's sign-in information,</em></li><li><em>Add a user without a Microsoft account</em>,</li><li>Write down the username and password that you are about to use [somewhere readily accessible yet secure from loss],</li><li>Enter a username, password &amp; password hint,</li><li>Back in&nbsp;the list of other accounts you can now see in <em>Family &amp; other users</em>, [<em>Other users</em> section],&nbsp;
</li><li>Click on the new account,</li><li>Click on <em>Change account type</em>,</li><li>Select the <em>Administrator </em>account type, </li><li>OK.</li><li>[Just in case you have heard of <em>Password reset disks</em> {for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
local </span>user accounts only}, note that they achieve nothing more than writing the password down achieves]</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; With that done, </p>
<p>
</p><p>2.1&nbsp; If your existing account is a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">local</span> one then you can change its name
<del>in Start menu, Windows system, Control panel, User accounts, Change your account name</del>.&nbsp; Use the improved procedure in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-winpc/how-can-i-change-my-user-name-on-windows-10-laptop/8f12caad-2457-4efa-839f-a6007488c620">
my post starting To change the username of a local user account without leaving behind remnants of the OldName</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.2&nbsp; If, as I suspect,&nbsp;your existing account is an MSAccount-linked one then you can only change its name online within the MSAccount concerned.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare in advance for any difficulties, download the MSAccount troubleshooter from
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13976.how-to-troubleshoot-microsoft-account-issues.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to Troubleshoot Microsoft Account Issues - TechNet</a>&nbsp;[don't worry about their reference to Windows 8, it is the same troubleshooter for both Windows 8 &amp; 10]</li><li>You might need to have several attempts at logging into your user account after changing&nbsp;your name [the login must be done whilst still connected to the internet so your computer can query the MSAccount servers] after changing its name for it to work.</li><li>[but my only experiment in doing this was very early in Windows 10 life so perhaps they have improved things now]</li><li>If it continues to refuse to let you log in then try running the downloaded troubleshooter.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Congratulations &amp; the best of luck,</p>
<p>Denis</p>

<p>I would suggest you to try the steps in the link provided and check if that helps:</p>
<p><b><span>Error message: "The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded”, when logging on to Windows 7

<p>Note: When you are trying to rename a key
<span>&nbsp;</span>take the ownership first and then rename it.</p>
