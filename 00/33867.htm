<h2>            Creaky controller</h2>
                    My controller is creaking.( not squeaky creaking). Like when I hold it hard it will creak. Sometimes normally. It does annoy me because before it creaks my left bumper is hard to push down. When it creaks its fine for like a minute. Plz help.

<p>Pretty much all controllers will creak if you hold them to hard.Sounds like the top half of the controller is slightly out of line with the bottom half which is why your having the problem with your LB button.</p>
<p>Not really a fix for this other than getting a new controller &amp; not squeezing it so hard.</p>

<h2>            WordPad saves as default</h2>
                    I have&nbsp;Vista. &nbsp;I was saving a document in WordPad&nbsp;and I accidentally clicked the box that says "save in this format by default" which is causing my document to automatically save as&nbsp;a text format.&nbsp; How do I set my default back?

            Open Wordpad, go to 'File|Save As', select "Rich Text Format (.RTF)" and click OK. &nbsp;When Wordpad opens, it will now default to .RTF instead of .TXT. &nbsp;Note that you can always use "Save As" to save a file in a particular format regardless of what the default
 save format is set for.

    <title>XBOX One External HDD Stopped Working &#42;FIXED&#42; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zhansen06  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX One External HDD Stopped Working &#42;FIXED&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all, first post.</p>
<p>Woke up this morning to find that my XBOX One was not recognizing my USB 3.0 500GB Seagate Backup Plus External HDD. It had previously been working fine so this was a surprise. Here are the steps I tried that did NOT resolve the issue:</p>
<p>1) Plugged the external into a different USB port on the XBOX.</p>
<p>2) Fully power-cycled the XBOX, even unplugging the power cord for up to 1 minute.</p>
<p>3) Noted that the external was able to be "seen" by Disk Utility on my Mac.</p>
<p>4) Swapped out a different USB 3.0 cable.</p>
<p>None of those steps worked as suggested by the XBOX troubleshooting article from Microsoft. After verifying that my data was secure because XBOX Live syncs and stores data in two places - the cloud and locally, on my device, then finally, as a matter of
 last resort, I did the following (THE FIX):</p>
<p>1) Performed a HDD diagnostic using Seatools to verify the disk functionality and that there were no bad sectors.</p>
<p>2) Used Disk Utility to completely format the HDD in MS-DOS FAT with an MBR.</p>
<p>Then finally, I plugged the external back into my XBOX One and it popped up and asked to format the external again. Now, I am able to use the external HDD as external storage - just as I was doing before.</p>

<p>This whole ordeal raises some questions and concerns:</p>
<p>1) Why would the external stop working, randomly? There was no system update that may have corrupted data, it had not been unplugged or even touched at all. The HDD tested in good condition by the manufacturers drive testing software, and the XBOX is behind
 a surge protector (the HDD is USB power only).</p>
<p>2) I now have to wait a full day for my XBOX Store purchases to re-download. Halo 5 by itself is about 55GB. Because I live in a rural area, it is going to take quite a while and I can't play any of the games until they are done downloading. This concern,
 in the future, will drive me back to buying physical copies of discs, which I had stopped doing because I wanted the ability to download my games on any XBOX console I signed in to. That benefit is not worth it if I ever have to go through this again.</p>
<p>Anybody else experience anything like this? Is there a bug or a fix in the work from those in-the-know? Thanks, and hopefully this post helps somebody in the future.</p>

            I am going through the same steps now. Mine worked for 4 days of play after plugging in the brand nee hard drive. I haven’t played for a few weeks. &nbsp;Went to play tonight and it would sometimes see the drive but would think its 100% full when it did. &nbsp;Tried
 all your steps but havent replaced cable or formatted. I gave up for tonight. &nbsp;Concerns me as well.&nbsp;

<div style="text-align: left">HI There&nbsp;zhansen06&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;j2sw, <br />
<br />
It's recommended you don't leave any external HDD plugged in even if the console is in rest mode (PS4) or sleep mode (Xbox) the reason for this is the HDD depending on what brand has a tendency to keep spinning for some odd reason even when its not being used
 you sometimes will notice this by the blinking light this would cause a huge amount of heat inside the drive causing it to do what it did. Also due to current issues at the moment with heatwaves and nice weather technology cannot withstand the pressure it's
 getting. It can also be caused by the console it self especially when the drive could be doing something and the console turns off making the drive corrupt but not actually its only corrupt in the xbox file system and nothing more that is why its best to check
 the HDD with disk utilities etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's also wise that after you have turned off the console or not playing it anymore unplug the HDD and store it in a safe location this way it wont be getting hot or used by the consoles behaviour pattens as both consoles can turn on randomly, this is also
 a good idea in case of a power surge or power cut.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind Regards</div>

            Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If none of the above work, check if its working in another user account:

    <title>Halo 4 Teaser Analysis - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xtremehivoltage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo 4 Teaser Analysis</h2>
                    
<p>Here we go...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am doing this analysis from when he opens up the Cryo Capsule to the end of the video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I believe &nbsp;a "Reasonable Explanation" for his armor changes is the Positive/negative pressure that The Chief underwent in space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cortana looks different. Did she do something with her hair? (No seriously, AI's can change their appearance.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jetpack!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pistol MC picks up looks to be either some entirely new weapon, or a heavily modded pistol. Clearly has an RPG style loading process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MORE jetpack!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice when the chief stops, his boots appear to be sucked onto the ground. MagBoots? It would be a way to get some stability in space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally I think the big... thing in front of the chief is a RingSphere. Who knows? it might repair his ship! (Unlikely) It Probably just wants to eat him.</p>

<p>What confuses me is how his armor changed, how he got the jetpack, how he got the new pistol, when he didn't have them in Halo 3...</p>

<p>Good point on the burning, thought that was hilarious. It might burn because there was fuel/flammable materials, but it would almost certainly be put out as soon as any fuel was burnt out, I'd guess.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Fuel tank catches fire.</p>
<p>Fuel tank ignites entirely in about a second, exploding.</p>
<p>Fuel tank is no longer a problem, fire isn't either?</p>

<p>And PS: Fire requires Oxygen. Even if there is fuel present, Unless it is Self-Oxydizing, no fire. They Could have entered the planet's atmosphere, thus activating the planet and proving O2.</p>

<p>why does all these questions matter? </p>
<p>the point is its a new halo game thats all i need to know. Im guessing it has to do with the book Ghosts of Onyx and they are fighting off the forerunners.Because this is the only thing halo fans are aware of during this time after halo3.</p>
<p>P.S. the fire was probably created from oxygen escaping the vessel.</p>

<p>C'mon guys, really? He doesn't have a friggin jetpack. Those are built in thrusters used only for zero-g environments *ahem... space*. He's never used them in the games because, well, he's always fought on the ground or somewhere where there's gravity. They
 aren't powerful enough to lift his suit of armor in gravity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason his armor changed is because 343i is trying to make him theirs now, not Bungie's. However, I strongly dislike the change. Weird looking shoulder plates, weird looking chest/stomach armor, no armor plate covering a very important part of the male
 body (which really stands out in the trailer for some reason), and his helmet seems to look more like a paintball mask now. Not a fan of these changes, and a lot of people have been complaining about it on the 343 forums. Hopefully we'll see classic MC in
 the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was just a CGI trailer. By the looks of it, they used a real woman to play Cortana and put some special effects on her. I don't think that's how she's going to look in game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "pistol" is not a pistol. Clearly it's a weapon we've never seen before, and it uses an explosive round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Magnetic Boots are a possibility. Either that, or they just didn't care enough to follow through with real life physics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing they're headed for is definitely no ring. In my opinion, it's either a shield world (like where some of the other Spartans were during Reach's fall) or it's a Forerunner planet.</p>

<p>
</p><p>a couple days i cannot login to my skype account. i recently changed password but cannot login with new password. backup email for password reset was created many many years ago only for skype, and now this email not accessible at all. so i tried to choose
 option "<span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">I
 don't have any of these" - after that system proposed me fill verification form with questions, birthday date, country, name, surname, 3 contacts from the skype list etc. - i did it but after i've got email that provided by me answers not correct and i need
 to do it again.. in this skype all my life, but stupid robots decides will i use this skype account or not. can some one from microsoft contact me and let me a chance to prove to you that i'm a owner of this account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">thank

<p>Dear Kenneth_F, thank you for reply.</p>
<p>Writing here again because access to this account is very important to me since this account was using many many years, where located many important contact for work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I several time answered on this forms with different answers, that&nbsp; would be correct by my opinion since i created this account long time ago and as i told don't remember exactly what was written there during registration. i was suggested i was using my
 laptop, that i was using to login in skype, but your bots/robots state '<span>we were unable to verify your ownership using the information that was provided.'&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1)i provided there many skype accounts that 200% are in the list of my lost skype account</span></p>
<p><span>2) i use the same laptop, same location to proof that i'm the owner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please give me a chance to proof you that i'm owner of this account! Can some one contact from Microsoft and ask whom i was chatting last time, may
 be was calling to some one. may be what i was writing to some one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As i told it's very important for me!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you in advance!</span></p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1ed39895-e200-44a7-8cc8-c4b04aad53f1" title="Artem Baykov">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know how important this is to you and how you feel in filling out the form multiple times and still not able to verify that you are the owner of the account. However, such form is established in the interest of data and account security. This means that
 the system will only grant access to the person who will be able to pass the verification process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll help you on how&nbsp;to pass the verification. The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful. The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name,
 Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity) and also, please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! </p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>May be the best way to start helping ask skype account and check what exactly going on with skype account at all?</p>
<p>I just found info from the web, that there is some similar examples of loosing skype due to merging skype and microsoft accounts, so this is problem not mine but of Microsoft. exactly they describe that skype automatically perform logoff and after that i
 was able to login back, tried to change the password but unsuccessfully.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>you advice "<span>The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)" - old password is provided 200% correctly, new one - i don't
 remember which i tried to put when was changing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. - as i told you i sure 100% of my old password, skype accounts from the list. even if you have an option to check the with
 i was chatting with, i would be answered correctly. </p>
<p>but in your verification form you have questions - 1) your country - i created this account many years ago and in that age i could put any country for example after watching Olympic games or what ever else.</p>
<p>2) you ask birth date - can fill also anything.</p>
<p>3) you ask First Name Last Name - as well same situation - may be i was playing some game and i liked one personage of this game and i decided to use his name and sure name and of course after for an instance 10 years i simply don't remember it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best way as i told - ask me another question - with whom i was contacting last time by skype, whom i was calling by skype, what i was writing there etc, just ask that thing that i can remember and it fresh for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>If you are unable to verify your account using the automated form, I can suggest creating a new Microsoft account and use it to log in to Skype for you to continue using Skype again.</p>

<p>Ok, so I have this big world with A LOT of signs....probably over 100 (all saying something). When I first load up the world, they ALL say Awaiting Approval. Usually takes 10 minutes for them all to load. Now, is the time of the signs loading depend on the
 internet connection...meaning...if I had a faster connection...would the signs load faster? Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Canon CanoScan 3000F Color Image Scanner</h2>
                    Now that I have Windows 7 I find that this scanner is no longer supported by Canon to update the driver. Is there any way to use this device or shall I have to scrap it?

Canon</a>&nbsp;officially stopped supporting many scanner products for Vista and Windows 7 in general and 64-bit in particular, there have been several&nbsp;<i>work-arounds</i>&nbsp;found that apparently work well in most cases. The most successful results seem to come from
 installing the&nbsp;<i>VueScan</i>&nbsp;drivers from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamrick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hamrick.com</a>.
 They developed their own set of scanner drivers for many models of scanners and All-in-Ones. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/vuescan.htm#canon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>VueScan</i><span>&nbsp;documentation</span></a>&nbsp;does

Note that after a&nbsp;demonstration&nbsp;period, there is an associated cost with the software. Without the software package, the drivers alone may or may not work long-term for your particular installation.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest that you boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Refer the link and follow the steps.</p>

<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>If the issue does not occur in Safe mode then perform a Clean boot to check if any service is causing a conflict for the issue to occur. Refer the link and follow
 the steps.</p>

            <p>If the new blank hard disk is in the same computer you should be able to install Windows 10 on it, but the free Windows 10 upgrade can't be transferred to a new Computer-you have to buy a license.</p>

            <p>A FPP "Retail" version can be reinstalled on a new hard disk and activated with your product key.</p>
<p>If you purchased Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store you should call them in advance as they have some special requirements which may impact you. If you purchased from a Local Store or Internet such as Amazon, just install and activate using your product
 key.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p><p><strong>One of the most common is a generic key associated with "Digital entitlement / License" computers.</strong> Digital entitlement / License is a new method of activation in Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key:

            <p>If you have Windows 10 that you purchased in a box or from the Microsoft Store either in a box that was shipped to you OR you downloaded Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store and the store sent you an Email which contained the product activation key then you
 have the Full Product / Retail version and yes you can install it on the new PC that you plan to build and it will activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same is true if you purchased Windows 10 from a local store or over the Internet and you received the "Boxed" version of Windows 10 (which contains a USB Flash/Thumb drive, then you have a Full Product / Retail version of Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Extremely slow start up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brookemorris1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extremely slow start up</h2>
                    I purchased my Surface book 2 in June 2018. Toward the end of July or beginning of August, my laptop started taking longer to come on. At that time it was taking about 3 minutes to come on. This problem has continually gotten worse and it now can take
 up to 10 to 15 minutes for my laptop to power on. This is really frustrating. I love my surface book but now I'm thinking I need to return it or contact someone about the warranty. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

    <title>Sony A55 vs Device Stage via USB, not quite working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davbol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sony A55 vs Device Stage via USB, not quite working</h2>
                    <p>The Sony A55 digital camera (or more properly SLT-A55V in US w/ GPS) has two operating modes for its USB connection:&nbsp; PTP and Mass Storage.&nbsp; This question is regarding its use in PTP mode with Device Stage.&nbsp; Compatibility Center lists the A55 as supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Device Stage does NOT&nbsp;recognize the camera when set to Mass Storage mode.&nbsp; On the other hand, Sony's bundled software only works with the camera's USB when in Mass Storage mode.&nbsp; This question is NOT about using the camera with Sony's bundled software.&nbsp;
 In fact, the real point of the question is:&nbsp; how to better use this camera with Win7 *without* Sony's bundled software.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two problems noticed so far when using A55's PTP USB mode&nbsp;w/ Device Stage:</p>
<p>1) the "erase after import" does not work, images remain on camera regardless of checked/unchecked (minor annoyance)</p>
<p>2) any videos on the camera&nbsp; (am using its MP4 format) are not found nor transferred (major deal-breaker)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device Stage has no such problems with several other cameras we own (mainly Point &amp; Shoot varieties, mostly Canon's), where it properly erases after import and transfers all media whether still or video.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the problematic behavior seems to be unique
 to the A55.</p>
<p>The A55 has the most current firmware (2.0), and Device Stage's behavior is unchanged whether or not the Sony bundle is installed (that is, the Sony bundle doesn't appear to install anything that either creates OR corrects the problem)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Q:&nbsp; is there anything that can be done/configured to Device Stage (and/or the A55 itself?) to resolve these issues?</p>
<p>TIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I notice that you said you already <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory reset</a> your Xbox One console. Did you do that using the option that allows you to keep your games and apps? If so, the next option to try would be the full factory reset option. I understand that it's totally not the ideal solution but it's worth a try.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>random programs opening at random times during the day and night - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            random programs opening at random times during the day and night</h2>
                    Over a 24 hr period random programs open by themselves, eg adobe photo shop, or Office Word; never the same program consecutively and not in any pattern. I have checked system logs to see if there are any causes to the problem but cannot find anything
 out of the ordinary. This has been happening since day 1 of setting the PC up. This PC is also stand alone and not connected to the Internet, so Windows Updates were disabled straight away.
<br />
<br />
Also after the program that has auto opened is closed, it is noticed that the icons on the desktop have moved to different locations. Auto Arrange is turned off, and Align To Grid is turned on. The icons change places each time as well, never in the same place
 twice.<br />
<br />
The only programs installed on the PC are Adobe, Office accounting&nbsp; and printing software's. The PC is occasionally turned off, usually left in Sleep mode over night. but even when turned off the icons move.<br />
<br />
The PC in Windows 7 HP 64bit running SP1.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, programs randomly open and close itself and icons will be moved to different position when computer will be turned off. However, I need
 some more information about the issue so that we can understand the issue in a better way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you set any task scheduler program on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Boot into safe mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Start your computer in safe mode</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove
 viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></b></a></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded.
 To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the
 scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</span></p>

            Thanks for you reply.<br />
<br />
There are no tasks scheduled to run on the PC, and it is not connected to the Internet, and has not been connected to the Internet since it was setup. Additionally no files have been transferred to the PC via flash drives, cd's etc. It is completely separate
 from the world, so there is zero chance of there being a virus or malicious software on it.
<br />
<br />
The issues have been happening since day 1 of setting the PC up. <br />
<br />
I will download and try the MSS program, this would be the first program installed on it in over 12 mths.<br />

So the PC was connected to the Internet for the initial setup. Unprotected PC's can get owned in a VERY short amount of time.<br />
<br />
Have a look at this site for some good information and instructions.<br />
