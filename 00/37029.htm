<h2>            Skyrim won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t load save</h2>
                    
<p>I had a copy of skyrim that cracked . So I went out and bought another copy . &nbsp;I try to play load my save on my hard drive . Went to continue and it says that the disc is dirty which it isn't . I can only start a new game and that works but other than that
 i'm screwed , I've tried basically everything uninstalling the game , clear system cache , uninstalling and reinstalling Dawnguard DLC . Still won't work . Even tried redownloading my profile , and even offline , but it wont let me do anything but start a
 new game .&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've never encountered such a problem with Skyrim before, I'd recommend contacting Xbox support (US phone number is: &nbsp;1-800-469-9269) and they should be able to help you out.

<p>i actually had this exact problem when i had a friend come over to my house with his skyrim data. This is probably the last thing you want to hear, but the resolution my friend and i came to is that the save corrupted. It worked again as soon as we removed
 the corrupted save. I would reccomend deleting (or at least moving off of the current device) the most recent save by going through</p>
<p><em>System Settings &gt; Storage &gt; [Device] &gt; Games and Apps &gt; Skyrim</em></p>
<p>This is the only way my friend got his device to load saves again and unfortunately this may be what you have to do.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT DELETE ALL SAVES, ONLY THE MOST RECENT ONE</strong>- <em>Try to just move the save to another device temporarily to see if it allows you to at least access a slightly older save first.</em></p>
<p>You will unfortunately lose anything you have done between the two saves, but with skyrim keeping three autosaves, it shouldn't be too much of catching up</p>

<h2>            DLC is corrupt and every solution I&#38;&#35;39&#59;ve been given hasn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t worked HELP&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so basically my brother bought a bunch of Mass Effect 2 DLC a while ago on his Xbox. He got a new Xbox, and now his old console is mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem is, whenever I go into Mass Effect 2, I'm met with a list of DLC that are corrupt and therefore unplayable. I contacted Microsoft support online, and a rep informed me I wouldn't be able to play it without his profile on my Xbox. So, we put his profile
 on my Xbox. Still didn't work. Contacted Microsoft support online again, and was given the instructions to delete the content that is corrupt, clear cache three times, and then reinstall it all through my brother's account. Did that, still didn't work. So
 I contacted them a third time and was told to delete my brother's profile, redownload it, delete the ME2 disc installations off the console, then reinstall them.</p>
<p>Still. Didn't. Work.</p>
<p>I went on various forums and was met with various answers, one of which said DLC is gamertag exclusive, which I know to be untrue as out of the thirteen DLC that my brother purchased for ME2, five of them work for me. It's just those specific eight I have
 problems with. Yet if I enter the game signed into my brother's profile, they work fine.</p>
<p><em>For the record, the DLC that don't work are as follows:</em></p>
<p><strong>Kasumi -Stolen Memory</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firepower Pack</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overlord</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zaeed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Normandy Crash</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cerberus Weapon and Armour</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firewalker pack</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cerberus Arc Projector</strong></p>

<p><em>The DLC that do work are:</em></p>
<p><strong>Aegis Pack</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alternate Appearance Pack 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alternate Appearance Pack 2</strong></p>
<p><b>Equalizer Pack</b></p>
<p><b>Lair of the Shadow Broker</b></p>

<p>This is really frustrating because my brother spent around 50 dollars all together on these and I can't even use them, the alternative being re-purhase the eight on my own, which I really do not want to do. I'm sure there must be an incredibly simple fix
 to this but so far, I have not been enlightened as to what that is.</p>
<p>For the record, the licences for the DLC are still on my console from when my brother originally purchased them, they were never switched over to my his Xbox. I really don't know what the problem is because all of the DLC for ME3 works perfectly fine for
 me. It's just those specific eight that aren't working.</p>
<p>Help would be much appreciated! This is also my first post on the forums so I've no idea if there is any etiquette this sort of thing. Apologies in advanced if I'm an idiot.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4, annoying noise from the back&#33;</h2>
                    Can someone explain why the back of my surface pro 4 (only when the brightness isn't 0% or 100%) makes a noise?<br />
For example, when it is on 25% of brightness it starts making a strange noise slight like a whistling...<br />
Can someone help me?

            <p>Presumably it's PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). The screen backlight is rapidly switched on and off rather than true dimming. The electronics tend to make a screaming noise as a result unfortunately. I've noticed the keyboard backlighting is even louder. 😩</p>

            <p>I've had my Surface Pro 4 for a couple of weeks and recently started noticing a screeching sound from the back of the device, more obvious from the top of the vents. It's a bit like a very high pitch modem noise. It's not hugely loud but quite noticeable
 in a quiet environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not due to wireless or Bluetooth as it continues when in flight mode. Neither is it affected by muting/unmuting the speakers. It's not affected by screen brightness either.&nbsp;It doesn't do it all the time but seems to now be more often than not and I
 can't be sure whether it's always been like it. When I drag the pen on the screen the noise is partially changed to a white noise sound but the modem-like noise is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else noticed this, or could my device be faulty? It's starting to be quite irritating. My wife's Surface 3 also makes a white noise sound when a pen is in dragged on the&nbsp;the screen but doesn't make a screeching noise.</p>

            <p>Well, I've done some digging and it seems this noise was reported way back on the first Surface Pro. It appears to be to do with when the CPU enters various c-states (when idle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro-surfusingpro/high-pitched-very-disturbing-noise-off-my-surface/c8b85adb-2316-4d8d-871d-4100f3022bc3">
thread here</a> about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of posts suggests the following workaround, essentially disabling the&nbsp;idle state:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>You can disable the ACPI C2-state and C3-state by setting a registry key. To do this, follow these steps:
</em><br />
<br />
<em>1. At a command prompt, run the following command:</em><br />
<em><strong>reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Processor /v Capabilities /t REG_DWORD /d 0x0007e066</strong></em>
<br />
<br />
<em>2. Restart the computer. </em><br />
<br />
<em>Note The computer idle power consumption will increase significantly if the deeper ACPI C-states (processor idle sleep states) are disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br />
<br />
<em>&nbsp; To continue to benefit from these energy-saving states, remove the registry key that you set in step 1 after you install the hotfix that this article describes. To do remove the registry key, follow these steps:
</em><br />
<br />
<em>1. At a command prompt, run the following command:</em><br />
<em><strong>reg delete HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Processor /v Capabilities /f</strong></em>
<br />
<br />
<em>2. Restart the computer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have found this improves the noise a lot but the question&nbsp;of course is what adverse impact this will have on battery use or heat etc. Time will tell I suppose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty annoying that this has been known about for this long and Microsoft/Intel have not addressed the problem properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'd like to know for sure one way or the other whether other Surface Pro 4 users can hear this noise from the back of their device (easiest to hear from the vents at the top near camera).</p>

            My SP4 M3 model has the same. Funny... if you start a watch panel (where you adjust time).. the noise will be modulated every second, every time second arrow is moved in the analogical watch on the screen. Definitely it has something to do with changes
 in the screen.. pen, content changes.. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            I want to point out that I started a separate thread about the modem-like screeching noise which may be related to c-state but which is not related to brightness level like this thread is. Someone has since merged my thread into this one but they are not
 the same issue!!!! VERY CONFUSING AND WRONG

            There is a leaf wallpaper and screensaver in Windows 98 Plus! software add-on package. I think the leaves blow around in it but it may not be the same one.

<p>That number is no longer a direct line to support and will only redirect to the support website. Phone/chat support are no longer able to handle refunds, so all requests have to go through the refund form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Samantha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you check your junk email folder? Right now if you request a refund the system would automatically reject it because it is past the 14 day period.&nbsp; I recommend requesting a call back from Xbox Support to see if they can help&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Option to disable tap to click in Synaptics Touchpad missing after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>With the latest update (about 1 week ago) that happened outside of the "Update Tuesday" update, the old way of disabling the tap to click for my touchpad is gone. The last "Device Settings Tab" no longer appears. There is no way to get to the one checkbox
 that I need to. Please tell me what I need to do to correct this? I hate the touch to click functionality being turned on!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that after an update the option to disable Tap to click for Synaptics Touchpad is missing. It
 could be possible that the driver would have been updated after the recent update that is why the option is missing. I suggest to you try rolling back the driver to older version and check if you get the option back.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the steps mentioned below:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press
<strong>Windows key + X</strong>, and select <strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Expand
<strong>Mouse</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the
<strong>Synaptics Driver</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Navigate to the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab and click on <strong>Roll Back Driver.</strong> </span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Restart the computer if prompted.
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, reply with the following details:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Which update was installed on the computer? To check go to
<strong>Settings &gt;&gt; Update &amp; Security &gt;&gt; Windows Update &gt;&gt; View update history</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the make and model of the computer?
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, we will be glad to help you further.</span></p>

<p>Hi, Nikhar.</p>
<p>Here I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was searching in update history, and I've found that driver has been updated on july 2nd, and from that moment the touchdpad lost that feature.</p>
<p>But I can't rollback de driver installation... The option is disabled. 😢&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?&nbsp;<br />
Maybe new version (1903) could fix the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Javier.</p>

<p>Update to the version 1903 brought me this problem. From this version Microsoft seems to bypass the original touchpad drivers and its settings and I have found basically NO settings with the MS way to do it. Neither have I found any way to get the original
 driver to work. Sad that MS seems to break functionality with new versions. Seems like the only thing to do is to revert the update 1903.</p>

            My particular laptop, is telling me that it is not ready for 19 0 3 yet. This may change tomorrow as tomorrow is update Tuesday. But as of yet I have to wait. So I'm not sure what internal Microsoft update occurred back in early June but it was not 19
 0 3

<h3> timothyvetovich  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB INPUT PORTS ON MY DELL INSPIRON 15</h2>
                    Hello I took the free upgrade from windows 8.1 to windows 10 when the updated was completed I ended up with "Lucky for me" 1 USB input that worked. Now before I upgraded I had 4 USB inputs that worked great. I ran Dell Diagnostics from My Dell and From
 My PC DR. for errors. All tests indicated everything Is OK? I looked deeper into the drivers installed For my USB Inputs and found &nbsp;(1) usb input was loaded for my BlueTooth hardware that never occupied a USB Input before the upgrade to 10. My Bluetooth is
 part of the hardware installed inside my dell laptop not occupying a USB InPut. Next I found UsB input belonging to Logitech (Download Assistant) and another 1 taken by a Wireless keyboard I never owned. So I tempted the logical thing to do "Delete and reinstall"
 the correct drivers, But the bad drivers keep coming Back an reinstalling them selves! WHY Help Its hard to work with only 1 of 4 USB inputs.....!!!!!

<h2>            My Computer started deleting everything I clicked on.</h2>
                    <p>So I was looking at some gameplay videos I had recorded. I opened one of the files and an error message appeared that the file was not located and it just deleted it. I tried opening another one and the same thing happened, it got deleted. I went to my desktop
 and tried opening a game and Windows just deleted the shortcut. After opening Chrome it looked like everything was fixed and I could watch the videos again without them being deleted. Thats when I noticed many of the video files had corrupted audio. What happened?
 Did I get hacked? Did my computer delete some of my HDD? I really need help because i dont want this to happen again and if it does I want a way to counter it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>You are running a 32 bit operating system, the ram limit in 32 bit is "supposed" to be&nbsp;4 gigs but depending on devices installed the amount you can actually use, even if the BIOS says it sees all 4 gigs, ranges from approximately 2.75GB to 3.5GB. You won't
 be able to use all 4 gigs on a 32 bit operating system. </p>
<p>But if you change to 64 bit, then you can use quite a bit more depending on which version of the operating system you get.</p>
<p>For example, Windows 7 home premium can see up to 16 gigs of ram, while&nbsp;Windows 7 Pro and above can see all the way up to 192 GB!</p>
<p>However, before just jumping into 64 bit you should first think about if you really need an extra gig of&nbsp;ram.&nbsp;You should be able to run pretty much anything you would need to in a home environment with 3 gigs. As well,&nbsp;if you are going to switch, make sure
 any applications you&nbsp;have work in a 64 bit OS,&nbsp;and any hardware like a webcam or something has 64 bit drivers, or else you won't be able to use them.</p>

            <p>In round numbers XP, Vista and Windows 7 32-Bit Versions of the Operating System can only address 4GB. Does not matter how much memory you have installed 4GB is the max. From that max your video card has XXXMB of ram on the card so that limits the operating
 system to 4GB minus the cards XXXMB of memory.</p>
<p>In addition other hardware also takes away additional amounts of memory (usually a small when compared to the video card)
<br />
and the remaining memory (address space) is available for Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 OS and your applications.</p>
<p>So that 4th GB thru 16 GB of ram you installed or will install goes unused on a 32-Bit OS. Does not matter what the BIOS reports or what the OS shows as installed memory it still limited to that 4GB address barrier.</p>

    <title>Privilege of a switched Microsoft Account in Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Privilege of a switched Microsoft Account in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi experts,</p>
<p>I switched to a Microsoft account from a local account (within administrators group) in Win10 OS, I can see this MS account is also of an administrator member, but when I install a software it reports failed to register a dll in C:\Windows\system32,</p>
<pre>09/18/15 01:40:21 Posting error message 28053</pre>
<p>whereas I can install this software successfully with the corresponding local account, I wonder if there is any difference between these 2 kinds of accounts?</p>
<p>When do this in a Win 8.1, I was prompted to input password (of the MS account I've already logged in) then I can start the installation and all the installation completed successfully. No this kind of prompt in Win 10.</p>
<p>Any idea on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jianjun</p>

            <p>Hi Jianjun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the link below for information regarding registering .dll files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/844592?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/844592?wa=wsignin1.0</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To register a .dll file, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on Start icon and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type the below command line and press Enter.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regsvr32 “path or file name of dll”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a Local Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've ever signed-in to a home computer running an older version of Windows, you’ve used a local account. Though the name may throw off novice users, it’s nothing more than an account to get into the computer in front of you. It works on that computer
 and no others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is a Microsoft Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft Account is nothing more than a new name for a Windows Live ID. If you've ever used services including XBOX Live, Hotmail, Outlook.com, SkyDrive or Windows Live Messenger, you've already got one. Microsoft has simply combined all of their services
 together allowing you to access them all with a single account. Just one email address and password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to write to us for any other assistance with Windows, we’ll be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original question concerned that the behavior is different between Win8.1 and Win10: given we've logged into our local computer with a Microsoft Account, when installing a software, Win8.1 would prompt us to input the pwd then the installation succeeded
 in the end, while Win10 failed directly with error message 28053. Would you please give us any idea or suggestion?</p>

            <p>I am trying to install a software which will register a dll to system but it failed for the first time, the installation is rolled back, I checked the system all the installed files are reverted. But when I reinstall the same software, it can register the
 same dll and and the whole installation succeeded. I wonder if this dll depends on another registration which is already done although the installation reverted, how can I detect which ones are already registered.</p>
<p>Strange enough I can install this software with a local account (both local and MS account are in administrator group).</p>

                    How do you change the color of the scrollbar from its normal grey, that is kind of hard to see, to a brighter color, like the old windows blue or even something in the red family? I have tried changing the color in the registry at Current User\Control

Family Safety: Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my childrens' accounts monitored with Windows Live Family Safety. For the last few weeks my son's browsing history has suddenly changed to nothing, when I know he has spent several hours a day browsing using Google Chrome on a Windows Vista PC. My
 other children are using Windows 7/8 laptops and I'm still seeing their browsing history. The PC has the latest settings loaded (refresh button at top right of Family Safety Filter box on PC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible he has managed to hack around the reporting? What about incognito, would this be visible via Family Safety reporting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Question to Micorsoft&#58; After Windows 8.1 - slow boot and very slow shutdown</h2>
                    <p><br />
It looks like a lot of people are experiences slower boot and shutdown times after Windows 8.1 update.&nbsp; I have been researching the problem since I am having these problem.&nbsp; What would help us out a lot and save a ton of work and frustration if you could get
 someone at Microsoft to tell us:<br />
<br />
<b>Is there a known problem with the update that causes Windows 8.1 to have this problem?</b><br />
<br />
I have read every response on this board and tried about every attempted fix and so far I have not seen an answer that works.&nbsp; If we know there is a problem, then we can wait until there is a fix.&nbsp; For example if the answer is that I must reinstall a fresh
 copy of windows 8 and before doing anything else, install the update to 8.1; then I would be OK with this.&nbsp; At least we would have an answer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
At this point I am trying to decide on a path forward; learn to deal with the slow boot and very shut down, reinstall back to Windows 8, or keep reading and reading looking for the magic answer.<br />
<br />
My system: Windows 8.1 Pro, 16 gigs RAM, i7 4770K (not overclocked), 240 gig SSD (passes all test), GIGABYTE Z87X-UD5H LGA1150, and GeForce GTX 670.&nbsp;&nbsp; All drives up to date as of 10/29/13, re-flashed bios on 10/30/13 up to date.&nbsp; This system was build 3 months
 ago; used for photoshop and photo editing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Scanned for viruses 11/4/13.
<br />
<br />
Boot/shutdown times:&nbsp; Windows 8 -15 sec, 6 sec respectively; Windows 8.1 - 3.4 min, 6 min respectively.<span>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>There could be several reasons which might slow down the computer such as unnecessary files on the hard drive or some application or programs running during the startup or shutdown process.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>However, let’s run the system maintenance troubleshooter and check if it helps to find the errors and fix the issue.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You can follow the methods:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 1:</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Please follow the steps to run System Maintenance troubleshooter on the computer:
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press <strong>Windows and X</strong> key together and select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 2:</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if you experience slow performance.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Refer to the link to do so:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Refer the section “<strong>Windows 8</strong>”</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Refer to&nbsp;the section <strong>“How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong>” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</font></font></font></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Thank you for the advice, but this is the same advice (copied and pasted) that has been given across the board, yet it has not helped. From what I can tell this is a problem with
 mainly Windows 8.1 Pro users. What I would like to know is if Microsoft understands that we are having these problems and can give us some sound advice (i.e., wait until we get an update). I have 10 computers running windows 7, three running Windows 8, and
 one running Windows 8.1. I am not going to invest in upgrades unless I know MS is going to fix this problem. So, is there a problem that MS knows of? If so I will wait for a fix. If not I will have to spend $$ trying to figure this out. If there is a problem
 and MS will not tell us, then I am wasting a lot of $$ for something that will be fixed in the near future; not good.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I will be upgrading these computers in the next year, should I go with Apple?

            I had upgraded my 3 month old HP ENVY to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Startup was still OK (10 to 15 seconds) but shutdown had gone to 4 to 5 minutes.&nbsp; Seems like there are different issues out there.&nbsp; Some are having startup AND shutdown issues and some of us just shutdown
 issues. &nbsp; I tried everything that has been suggested in the past, including disabling all possible programs.&nbsp; Nothing helped.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I decided to do a "refresh" and reinstall windows 8.0.&nbsp; After the refresh shutdown went back to 10 to 15 seconds.&nbsp; Made sure that all updates to 8.0 were applied before upgrading to 8.1.&nbsp; I wanted to ensure that my 8.0 install was "clean" and none
 of my programs were causing the issues so I did not reload any of my programs prior to upgrading to 8.1. After the 8.1 upgrade the shutdown was still at 10-15 seconds.&nbsp; Started installing "my" programs and at each install did a couple of restarts to make sure
 that nothing had changed.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that all is working fine now. Both startup and shutdown are 10-15 seconds.&nbsp; It was a pain to reinstall all my programs but it was well worth it.&nbsp; I suspect that a "refresh" will be the only way people will get rid of the slow shutdown / startup
 issue - unless of course Microsoft decides to actually "look" at one of the problem computers to see what is actually going on.<br />

            <p>Hello KenMcCarron,</p>
<p>I had a similar experience with my nearly 5 year old Hewlett-Packard Pavilion m8277c.&nbsp; I'd been running Win 8.0 Pro for almost a year, and upgraded to Win 8.1 Pro in mid-October.&nbsp; Everything was running smoothly until earlier this week when the Windows updates
 were released, and then everything slowed to a snails pace:&nbsp; It took forever to boot, there were long delays after a mouse click or a keyboard entry, and email, web browsing, or opening local documents were extremely slow.&nbsp; I noticed that the hard-drive light
 seemed to remain illuminated constantly, with hardly a flicker.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You didn't mention which security software you're using,&nbsp;but Norton Internet Security seems to have been the&nbsp;source of my problems.&nbsp; I&nbsp;upgraded&nbsp;from NIS2013 to NIS2014 (version 21.1.0.18) immediately following the upgrade to Win 8.1 (mid-October), and&nbsp;everything
 worked fine until this week's Windows updates.&nbsp; After unsuccessfully trying several solutions recommended on other forums, I started getting error messages related to NIS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After uninstalling and reinstalling Norton Internet Security, everything seems to be back to normal.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            I have this problem on a HP DC 5750 with 10-25 minutes boot times.&nbsp;I've also tried a clean install from Windows 8, but the slow boot problem remains after the Windows Store upgrade to Windows 8.1. I found&nbsp;the inbuilt Windows 8.1 Boot Repair does not&nbsp;offer
 a repair. I have also tried the&nbsp;BIOS factory reset and fast boot suggestions published on the Web. I've now downgraded back to Windows 8 to resolve this annoying problem. I've also asked Microsoft for their plans for a fix. No response to-date.

<p>When you say you did a clean install, did you go through the refresh process.&nbsp; If you did, did you make sure that everything was updated prior to upgrading to 8.1?</p>

<p>Also, what are the specs on your computer?&nbsp; Do you have enough memory?<br />

            Hi Ken,
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Yesterday, I upgraded my 8.0 Windows to 8.1 and started to seen the same issue as discussed in thread. I bought a brand new Laptop with windows 8 pre-Installed before one week but It was my worst decision to get updated my windows 8.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It doesn't take much time to start up (only 10 – 15 seconds) but shut-down takes a day which seems very bad for me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm very unhappy to have such experience with windows 8.1 and can understand easily why Microsoft is offering a free up gradation because they want to fix all the bugs and issue before producing in Market.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, I decided to go back and reinstalled my windows 8.0 and it was quite good then windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any quick solution for the slow shut-down.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please note as I didn't installed any other programs or games in my laptop as you suggested that it might be happening due to unnecessary files on the hard drive or some application or program running during the start up or shut-down.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I shall be waiting for your precious response on the same or you may send me your response on my email. (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Harendra</p>

            You S.O.B.s at Microsoft, should be taken out an horse wipped, for giving us this disaster 8.1, my 6 month old Toshiba is a useless box of plastic now, takes a full 10 minutes or more to boot up, your worthless Fixes don't work.  Do you think you Rocket Scientist can come up with a patch to fix this, or something.  I never thought that there was something worse than Windows 8, but I was wrong 8.1 the UPGRADE is worse.   What a disaster, who the **** is writing your programs, and who the **** tested it.  There are many out there with the same complaint, yet NO FIX, just more B.S. from you tech support.  I am one mad user, can you tell, and I'm telling everyone I can NEVER buy anything with the Microsoft brand on it.

<p><br />
It looks like a lot of people are experiences slower boot and shutdown times after Windows 8.1 update.&nbsp; I have been researching the problem since I am having these problem.&nbsp; What would help us out a lot and save a ton of work and frustration if you could get
 someone at Microsoft to tell us:<br />
<br />
<b>Is there a known problem with the update that causes Windows 8.1 to have this problem?</b><br />
<br />
I have read every response on this board and tried about every attempted fix and so far I have not seen an answer that works.&nbsp; If we know there is a problem, then we can wait until there is a fix.&nbsp; For example if the answer is that I must reinstall a fresh
 copy of windows 8 and before doing anything else, install the update to 8.1; then I would be OK with this.&nbsp; At least we would have an answer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
At this point I am trying to decide on a path forward; learn to deal with the slow boot and very shut down, reinstall back to Windows 8, or keep reading and reading looking for the magic answer.<br />
<br />
My system: Windows 8.1 Pro, 16 gigs RAM, i7 4770K (not overclocked), 240 gig SSD (passes all test), GIGABYTE Z87X-UD5H LGA1150, and GeForce GTX 670.&nbsp;&nbsp; All drives up to date as of 10/29/13, re-flashed bios on 10/30/13 up to date.&nbsp; This system was build 3 months
 ago; used for photoshop and photo editing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Scanned for viruses 11/4/13.
<br />
<br />
Boot/shutdown times:&nbsp; Windows 8 -15 sec, 6 sec respectively; Windows 8.1 - 3.4 min, 6 min respectively.<span>&nbsp;

<div>How are you shutting down your PC. By using the Shut Down option by right clicking the Start Button or By using the Shut Down option from the Charms Bar?? If you use the Start button option your PC will shut down slower and Boot up Slower. If you use the
 Shut Down option from the Charms Bar your PC will shut down and Boot Up Quicker.</div>

            <p>To KenMcCarron,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, but no real help - I can find&nbsp;- from Microsoft on this problem. I'm told that, as my HP5750 PC&nbsp;is old, there are no Windows 8 or 8.1 drivers issued by HP. This is correct, but Windows 8 runs perfectly using the formal Windows 7 64-bit drivers. Also,
 this problem is not recognised or acknowledged by the Windows 8 upgrade advisory prior to upgrade or setup. I also have a Dell OptiPlex 755 (of the same age) which runs Windows 8.1 without the slow boot-up problem, using Dell Windows 7 64-bit drivers. So I'm
 confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this problem is so widespread across different manufacturers and architectures, I believe this is a Microsoft issue, but they have (to-date) remained very silent on this matter.&nbsp;I agree, a&nbsp;statement, one way or the other, would be very useful, especially
 at the time of upgrade from earlier versions of Windows to 8.1. In the meantime I've reverted back to Windows 8 on my HP5750, but continue to receive automatic 8.1 update reminders from Windows Update. I hope support for Windows 8 is not to be withdrawn until
 this problem is at least acknowledged by Microsoft, if not resolved.</p>

<h2>            Download digital copy of age of empires 2 gold</h2>
                    i just so happen to have either broken or lost my age of empires 2 gold edition cds. but still have the cd key. i was wondering if there was a way to register online to be able to download a digital client because my cd is gone. or i could get a new one.
 but i was still wondering if there was a way to register online anyway just in case i break it again or lose it again.

<p><strong><span>Hi Shag Nasty,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></strong><span>There is no explicit way to remove an obsolete computer name from the network.&nbsp; The name might automatically go away after you restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>You may follow the below steps and check if issue resolves –</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start. Type<strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>At
 the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
ipconfig /flushdns (there is a space between ipconfig and / )</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It will show the message<strong>successfully flushed the DNS resolver cache.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>At
 the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
