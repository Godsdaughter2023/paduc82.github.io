<p>I using win 10 build 17763. When adding tags in file explorer to a photo, if you have details view enabled, file explorer will show metadata on far right of screen. if you click on Tags: you can enter a tag. While typing, there is an auto-fill list that
 comes up you can use. I have added names and places to this list, but only one or two show up when I try to use them on the next photo. I'm hoping there is a Master List somewhere that I can edit. I don't know if it has a max size, and that is why my new tags
 are not being shown. Plus there is a lot of them that I don't use.</p>
<p>

    <title>Sticky Keys and Filter Keys turn on every time I restart my computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james lynn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sticky Keys and Filter Keys turn on every time I restart my computer &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The title pretty much says it all. Every time I shut down my computer and then start it again, Sticky Keys and Filter Keys reactivates. I go to the Settings - Ease of Access - Keyboard area, and shut them off. Not a huge problem, but a bit annoying. It will
 also turn those back on some times if I use my PC past midnight. Oh, and under&nbsp;Settings - Ease of Access - Mouse, I also have to turn off "Use numeric keypad to move mouse around screen" every time I restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, it's a HP Pavilion Elite machine that originally ran Windows 7 64 bit. I installed Windows 10 about two months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I permanently turn off these three settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>James</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hijack this but I'm having the same problems as Shawn and James.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above steps do not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I restart my pc I have to turn off, "Ignore or slow down brief or repeated keystrokes and adjust keyboard repeat rates." &nbsp; To clarify, I want to be able to keep my finger on backspace, for example, to delete as many previous characters I want.
 I don't want to have to tap the key for each character. This is also a problem when I'm creating websites or drawing.</p>

            That's actually pretty easy, open a new window for 'Ease of Access' and look for a shortcut named 'log on settings' or something like that. You will find it to the upper left corner of the window, right under the folder destination and the file/edit/view/tools
 menu(s). Edit however you like.<br />
<br />
I know that I'm very late, but hope that helps. :)

<h2>            Windows 8 Laptop stuck in repair loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi my laptop is in a loop that keeps saying automatic repair and eventually brings me to the blue page that says it could not fix my pc. I've seen many threads and questions on this topic but none that applys to the situation I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an Asus laptop pre installed with windows 8 so it comes with no cd or disk. I have tried alot of stuff on the command prompt like checking the drives and doing the bootrec commands but it always brings me back in the loop. Also everything else dosent
 work such as the reset and refresh and safe mode and such basically everything in the troubleshoot options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything will help or even better if their is a fix.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur due to corrupt boot files required for Windows to boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven’t already tried System Restore, this is a good option to try as compared apart from other troubleshooting steps that you have already tried.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are able to reach Windows recovery options and Troubleshoot screen, follow the steps to perform a System Restore to restore the computer to a point prior to this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced options</strong> in Troubleshoot screen.</li><li>Select <strong>System Restore</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>If you still find the Automatic repair loop on the computer, I would suggest you to contact
<a href="http://support.asus.com/contactus.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Asus support</a> and collect the recovery disc or a Windows 8 installation media. Using this media, you can perform a Windows Refresh. Refer to the link to know how to perform a Refresh on Windows 8:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Refresh your PC without affecting your files”</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: By doing a Refresh, apps that you had installed from websites will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps which you have installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop
 after refreshing your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us posted. </p>

<h3> jersey-devil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Won&#39;t Pin To Taskbar</h2>
                    I just updated from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro and all seems well but one thing.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed Outlook.com, which seems to run well, bit there's no way to pin it to the Taskbar.&nbsp; I was able to pin Outlook to the Taskbar in Windows 8
 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro Preview.&nbsp; Also, I think I could run Outlook and Internet Explorer 11 independently of one another.&nbsp; However, now I have to put Outlook away if I want to run Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Did I download the wrong version of Outlook.com?&nbsp; If so,
 what is the proper download link for Outlook.com?

<p>Thanks for your response, but I found the or at least a solution.&nbsp; Internet Explorer 11 has a control&nbsp;that allows an app to be created after an application is launched using its icon, which is placed in the list of apps for the Start screen.&nbsp; That app can
 be pinned to the Taskbar.&nbsp; Perhaps I did it that way with Windows 8 Pro and 8.1 Pro Preview and forgot how clever I was.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a new problem.&nbsp; No sound notification occurs when new e-mail arrives although the setting for that function is active.&nbsp; I have the Mail app pinned to the Start screen of my Windows 8.1 Pro operating system.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the&nbsp; late reply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to make sure that you get the notification sound when you receive any app notification, try these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +C, click on settings.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on change PC settings and then click on “search and apps”.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on notifications and make sure the options “play notification sounds” and “show app notifications” are enabled.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the “show notifications from these apps” section, make sure the Mail app and news app are selected and enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to lengthen the time of the notifications, click on change PC settings option as mentioned above, select “ease of access”. Select other options and set the “show notifications for” option accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

Thanks for your response, but I made those settings long ago, and they didn't fix the problem.&nbsp; In addition to those settings, I've also made at lease one other setting with no positive results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the notification problem was caused by a flawed update
 from Windows 8 Pro to 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; Although, the update seemed to go smoothly, and there were no error messages.

Thanks for your response.&nbsp; However, I found a way to pin an Outlook.com icon to the Taskbar as described in a previous e-mail.&nbsp; However, I'll keep your suggestion in mind.

            hello ! try this ! right click on the computer icon and click manage, Click on disk management. Check here if you drive is shown. If it is shown then its getting detected, but for reason is not shown in partition table. If this external casing can be removed
 and you can access the internal drive, then i would suggest you to either take some other external enclosure and plug your harddrive into that or use the disk directly into a computer system and recover your data ! Regards Shantanu

            Open the Store app then check for updates.
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />

            Hi Illumin8r,<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;Are you using a disc or is it a download for Windows 7?<br />
•&nbsp;Are you performing Custom Installation or Upgrade installation?<br />
•&nbsp;If it is an Upgrade, what is the previous operating system installed on the computer?<br />
•&nbsp;Do you receive this error code or error message when you perform Windows Update?<br />
<br />
I would recommend that you disable Norton anti-virus on the computer temporarily and check, ensure to enable the Norton anti-virus on the computer.<br />
<br />
You&nbsp;may use Sigverif.exe tool to find all files on your computer that are not digitally signed.<br />
To use the Sigverif.exe tool, follow these steps: <br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Click Start, click Run, type sigverif in the Open box, and then click OK. <br />
&nbsp;2. Click Advanced, click look for other files that are not digitally signed, click Browse, locate the Windows\System32\Drivers folder, and then click OK two times.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;After Sigverif.exe is completed, a list of all unsigned drivers that are installed on your computer appears. Let us know the results. If at all you get any unsigned drivers you will have to disable them or try updating them to solve the issue.<br />
<br />
Refer the article for more information: <strong>You cannot install some updates or programs:

            Upgraded using HP-furnished HP Upgrade Assistant disc &amp; HP-provided Win 7 Home Premium x64 disc, and&nbsp;installed over Vista Home Premium SP2 x64...not a "Custom" or "Clean" install. A problem occurred when running the Upgrade Assistant Post-Installation
 Step 3 that required restarting &amp; re-running the Assistant disc. I'm not certain that it completed its post-installation updates &amp; driver installs. My Norton 360 subscription is current &amp; replaces Norton Internet Security 2009 60-day trial version which came
 with the OEM installation, but was removed using Norton's Removal Tool to clean the registry &amp; remnants. I was not having any problems with the PC or programs until after this botched Win 7 install. For additional information, search the Forum for my reply
 (still to be sent)&nbsp;to Swathi B who also responded. I look forward to your response.<br />

            Thank you for your response. The answers to your first three points can be found in my replay to PA Bear, above. To your 4th point, as previously stated, I receive Error Message #80070241 when attempting to install previously downloaded updates (2 "Important"
 &amp; 3 "Optional") either individually or simultaneously. I've also attempted to run MS Fix It Solution #50202 and received an "...unexpected error..." message citing Error Code #2882, then, after clicking on OK, I get another message stating that "System Administrator
 has set policies to prevent this installation." I'm the Administrator, or at least my original account prior to the upgrade was designated as Administrator. I am unable to verify that through Control Panel, User Accounts,&nbsp;Change User Account settings, nor
 turn UAC on or off through this same access point. Clicking on the links provides only a "dead" response and no action at all.&nbsp;(BTW, not that it has any bearing on this issue, I forgot to mention that&nbsp;this is a Home-based PC with an internet connection wirelessly
 provided by an 802.11n&nbsp;router connection networked&nbsp;to my primary PC in another area of my home.) My Norton 360 icon&nbsp;in the tray &amp; the sidebar gadget both say that my PC is protected &amp; my anti-virus, anti-malware &amp; firewall are all actively working OK. However,
 the Security Center doesn't recognize that and says that I have none of those active, installed or turned on. I can disable them through that icon in the tray. I've run<strong> sigverif.exe</strong> at your suggestion and it tells me that all files &amp; dll's
 are digitally signed. In an attempt check the status of my services, I'm unable to access or&nbsp;enable/disable them through the normal system management methods or through my Extensoft
<em>Free Extended Task Manager </em>which is my default Task Manager &amp; normally provides me direct access to those functions. An attempt to open the program with a right click on the Task Bar&nbsp;produces a small error box identifying the problem as an "ETML Error
 -9" &amp; the same occurs when Control-ALT-Delete, Start Task Manager is utilized. I hope this will give both you &amp; PA Bear enough info to suggest a way out of this mess.<br />

Had the Norton Internet Security 2009 60-day free trial expired <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
before</span> you&nbsp;replaced it with a purchased version of&nbsp;Norton 360 (N360)?<br />

<p>Please read &amp; reply to Swathi B's post above.</p>
<p>The above notwithstanding and assuming the Windows Firewall and the Norton Personal Firewall are not both enabled, give this a whirl:<br />
<br />
1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop: 
<span>ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</span></p>
<p>2. Close any open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall all Norton software (including
<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> and any <strong>Norton Add-ons)</strong> via <strong>
Control Panel | Programs | Uninstall a program</strong> (or <strong>Control Panel | Programs and Features</strong>, if using Classic view).</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Enable the Windows Firewall immediately after rebooting.<br />
<br />
NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING else online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.&nbsp; Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>=&gt; TIP: See if Windows Updates works now, before you proceed to Step #6?<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;Do a clean install of&nbsp;<strong>Norton 360 <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2010</span></em></strong>&nbsp;using your Product ID &amp; reboot:
<a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
TIP: Do not enable or install any Norton Add-ons (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.<br />
<br />
7. Manually and repeatedly run LiveUpdate until you get a "no more updates" prompt.</p>
<p>8. Test.</p>

            Cannot run Norton Removal Tool as it's an .exe file. It produces the same "...cannot verify the digital signature..." error message as described above. My reply to Swathi is already included in this thread. I wish I could attach the screenshots I have.

            Hi Ken,<br />
<br />
I'd like to confirm some details so I can further check, and for me to provide a more established workaround.<br />
<br />
Is this the first time you've tried to cast to your TV?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any recent changes made to the system that might have caused the issue?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, please note that as stated in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15053/windows-8-project-wireless-screen-miracast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support article</a>:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<em>"If you move your PC beyond the range of the wireless display (such as to another room), or if you make your PC sleep or hibernate, the two devices will disconnect."&nbsp;</em><br />
<br />
Normally, issues are sorted by installing the latest drivers for your PC and the latest firmware for your wireless display or Miracast adapter.<br />
<br />
To update firmware on your wireless display or adapter, go to the Support section of the manufacturer's website, search on your specific device, and follow their instructions to download and install that firmware. You may also check Windows Store to see if
 there’s an app from the manufacturer of your wireless display or Miracast adapter that updates firmware.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your response.<br />
<br />
Regards.

</p><p>I owned a previous Lumia 950XL and it did sync, however it is not syncing with the new Lumia 950XL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a Lumia 1520, and everything is syncing just fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have bought 2 songs from the Groove Music App on my phone, and I have downloaded (rented) 2 songs from my Groove Music App, and only those songs appear on my phone. The rest of my music library is not syncing with my phone. Strangely enough, those 4 songs
 I bought and rented from Groove Music App did sync with my laptop Groove Music app and are now on my Laptop syncing fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 950XL is up to date with the latest update .107. The Groove Music App on my phone is up to date from the store</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the Groove Music service is not recognizing my phone. When I log into my Microsoft Account, my device does not show up under Groove Music Pass, however it does show up under My Devices, under My Devices for Apps/Games and for My Devices for
 Movies / TV. It does not show up under Groove Music Pass, which must be the issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent over 10 hours trying to call different phone numbers from Microsoft, most people cannot help me, and just transfer me around. There does not exist a Groove Music Pass or One Drive support phone number I can call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated. I have been loyal to Microsoft products for over 15 years, and I must say, this is it. If I can't get help, I am done. I can't believe, there is no customer support phone number or Groove Music or One Drive. That is so unprofessional.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with my Lumia 950XL and Windows 10 has been horrific. I am on the edge of changing thousands of dollars of Microsoft products to apple, and over $100,000 in equipment and services for my company to apple.&nbsp; I am tired of the issues with Windows
 10, the 950XL Groove Music and One Drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help! </p>

            <p>Hi Ronniebruland,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the timing, I feel like this problem may have been triggered with the update to OS build .x.10586.107 since it did not affect my 640xl which I took out of the Insider program, nor Groove on my Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that you've already performed a soft reset, which didn't work for me either, initially. However, I was able to eventually fix this by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearing the OneDrive cache (located on a micro SD card) on my Lumia 950.</li><li>Performing a soft reset</li><li>Logging onto the Groove web player and playing a few songs and opening the Groove app on my phone again. This seems to trigger the Groove app to rescan OneDrive. It's adding songs as we speak (which will take a while).
</li></ul>
<p>I agree with&nbsp; you that there are just too many problems with this phone, the Groove app, and the OS. A lot of us really, really, want to support Windows Phone and the Windows ecosystem in general, but I personally feel like I'm constantly having to do a
 reset (usually soft, sometimes hard) whenever there's an update. Scanning forums, performing resets, clearing my OneDrive cache and then re-downloading from OneDrive all takes a lot of time. Yes, we eventually solve the problem, but, really: this shouldn't
 keep happening every time there is an update to the OS, app, or firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of us are experienced and loyal users. I got the first (then, Nokia) Lumia on pre-order back in 2012. I'm on my Lumia and my second Surface (Surface Pro 3). But I simply don't have time to deal with this stuff anymore and am seriously considering swapping
 to iOS or Android for mobile devices. Microsoft seems to be supporting those devices better than Lumias anyway.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Ronny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only do I feel your pain, but I am one with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have supported Microsoft in many ways, including also spending on my behalf and customers many hundreds of thousands of dollars, and to put it simply Microsoft is hopeless, particularly their support. It is nigh impossible to get through to the right person
 to look at a whole range of issues, you get shunted from one phone number and department to another, noone takes ownership of the issue you call back, certainly no support. One gets shuffled from business to consumer etc. So many woes I simply have no energy
 left to even write about it. You would additionally think that with Windows Mobile 10 they might have got it right. Other companies can make solid SmartPhones, but not Microsoft. Amongst other issues with the phone same as yours with Groove and there is absolutely
 noone to assist, I have now had to replace both a Surface Book and my Lumia 950XL Phone, I have had OneDrive Consumer issues (try getting hold of someone to assist with OneDrive Personal Issues) good luck. If you do via Chat or email rest assured you will
 be dealing with an incompetent individual, or maybe a better way of describing these people, is time wasters. They lost all my data from OneDrive, wiping all my devices locally clean after I stupidly having run out of space upgraded to 1TB. Can't even get
 a refund for a service that does not work. I have moved all of my critical data to other suppliers, of which there are many. I have used them all and they are ALL superior in every possible way to OneDrive. Arguably OneDrive was a better product when it was
 called SkyDrive, but anything that works has to be tinkered with by Microsoft and any successor is typically worse than its predecessor - one only has to look at the history of their operating systems. I am also heartily sick and tired of being, as in effect
 are all Microsoft's customers, their guinea pigs. Whether consumers or business users we all rely on our respective technologies and the bottom line is now very apparent that Microsoft's does not meet the standard and their support (or lack thereof) reflects
 that. Customers should expect better and if it is not there demand improvements - however, whom can you talk to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole setup of Microsoft is simply hopeless. One good sign is the Microsoft Sydney Store who in my situation have been more than helpful, but even they cannot get answers or know how to fix the issues I have experienced. If it wasn't so hopeless I could
 even manage a smile at what a joke it is. Microsoft may dominate in many areas of IT, but with my own experiences, let alone daily those I deal with on behalf of customers it simply is not good enough, and seemingly, as a generalisation Microsoft do not seem
 to care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be noted that these issues go well beyond a soft/hard reset of the phone. It is the Windows 10 Mobile system itself. Listening/syncing to your own music does not, nor should it, require a Groove Music Pass. No doubt Microsoft will make that day
 come! In the meantime I know that my OneDrive account where my music is stored has synced and does sync to Groove, so it is not an issue with OneDrive specifically, and if it is (always a possibility with Microsoft due to the inconsistency of their applications
 working) why is it, and how can it be fixed. Like you Groove Application is up-to-date, I have checked all settings, I have logged in and out of OneDrive (Live) account etc. Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added to that think of photos taken on these devices. You cannot share them via email except in original size. Never was the case in Windows Phone 8.1, nor is it the case with any other Vendor; rely on Microsoft to screw up something as basic as this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully I am not wholly dependent on the Lumia950XL - I would scream if I were. I use Google Play Music Manager to sync my music to my Android phone and iPhone similar via iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is at least warming to know that i am not alone in having such negative experiences but quite frankly how can any company in this day and age operate with such arrogance towards its customers, be they consumer or business (I am both), such unprofessionalism
 and bottom line such lousy products and associated services?</p>

            Having similar problems here. &nbsp;Have 950xl and Surface Pro 4. &nbsp;Groove Music Pass purchases initially wouldn't show up on either device. &nbsp;MS Support didn't know what to do after 4 hours apart from from removing both devices from associated devices list.
 &nbsp;Now (though don't know why) they have started showing up on 950xl, Xbox One and Web player but not a sign on Surface Pro 4 Groove app and genuinely nobody has an answer at MS. &nbsp;Really poor.

            <p>Hi, and thank you for responding. I think I had a virus on the computer - a computer shop service person had a look and did something to get the computer working again. I don't know for certain whether the disc drive was working before this or not, I'm not
 sure if I've used it since upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not happening with any other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop makes a noise when first inserting any disc (as if it's going to work), then goes quiet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you changed your account name on your computer from user account settings in control panel, but it did not get changed completely, task manager still shows the old name.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Changing the user name of the computer will reflect the changes on the logon screen. But, it won't change for other system files or settings for that particular user account on the computer. So, you will find the same user name under Task Manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, the name can be changed by making some changes in registry.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer the suggestions by Windows_Expert on May 14, 2011 in the thread below. This has helped some of our community members to get this problem resolved. This can also be a possible fix for the issue in question.</span></p>

<br />
<br />Can you try following steps:
<br />Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to open Task manager. Click the Services tab. Click Open Services link along the bottom. Right-click the Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service. Select Properties. In the General tab, change the Startup Type to 'disabled'. Click Stop to stop the service and Click Apply then OK to close the window. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.

<h3> richard sprague  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows 7 computer keeps shutting down</h2>
                    My computer which is running Windows 7 keeps shutting down. It usually happens when I'm running Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox but it's also happened when I'm running iTunes or browsing through folders. It also nearly always shuts down when I'm trying
 to run a performance check. It doesn't shut itself off over night but only when I'm actively using the computer and I'm typing, using the mouse, watching a video, etc. It runs fine in Safe Mode (as far as safe Mode allows). I've already tried re-installing
 windows 7 twice, running various malware-virus-security checks such as Microsoft Security Essentials, running the disc cleanup program, and unplugging the external memory drive and the cordless mouse in case there was an incompatibility issue causing my computer
 to shut down.

<h2>            Windows 7 Registry</h2>
                    <p>I hope somebody can help me.&nbsp; I work in a Hositpal in the IT department.&nbsp; We are trying to setup a reg hack to use to create generic profile for all the nurse.&nbsp; I manually type this in</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon]<br />
"AutoAdminLogon"="1"<br />
"ForceAutoLogon"="1"<br />
"DefaultUserName"="GEN7LAB"<br />
"DefaultPassword"="1test"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I log off it works just fine.&nbsp; When i reboot the device, Default Password gets deleted and AutoAdminLogon changes the value to a 0.&nbsp; I have to go back and manually do it again and then it works just fine.&nbsp; I can reboot and it auto logins just fine.&nbsp;
 I don't know why Default Password is getting deleted.&nbsp; Nothing else in the registry is changed.&nbsp; I exported the file and tried it on another machine and I get the same issue.&nbsp; If I run the hack again it works just fine.&nbsp; Can anybody explain to me why this
 is happening?&nbsp; thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to created a lot of these for different groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a standard image that we use.&nbsp; Our company took alot of features out of windows 7.&nbsp; I know that you can go to user accounts and do it that way but our company took out that option.&nbsp; thanks&nbsp; any help would be great</p>

<p>The default location of user profile in Windows 7 is still the same as Vista, in
<strong>c:\users</strong> folder, which I often find it seems quite dumb putting user profiles in the same partition as the system, especially when I store most of my day-to-day files in my user profile, rather than another folder in another partition. So my
 preference of the first step after installing the OS on my own computer is always to change the default location to another partition before I actually start setting up my profile.</p>
<div>Normally, you can do that by either using a pre-defined unattended install file, or moving the individual folders inside the user profile which also will update the registry keys accordingly to reflect the change.</div>
<p>However, here is what I’ve done normally.</p>

<p>If your are&nbsp;computer technician or some&nbsp;variation of&nbsp;and&nbsp;have been familiar enough&nbsp;with how to create a DEFAULT profile in Windows XP that contains the settings of your choosing&nbsp;so that anyone who logs into your configured computer, will have all of&nbsp;the

 they believe we should all know 100% how to use SYSPREP to create default profiles.&nbsp; This is the Microsoft supported way of changing the DEFAULT profile and if you feel this is the route you want to attempt then please refer too:</p>

8:46 PM Geraldine: Downgrading from windows 10 home will not fix the issue<br />
8:46 PM Geraldine: it will ask for a windows 10 home<br />
8:47 PM jonah: Okay. So whats the cost of a Windows 10 Key for both my laptop (the computer we're connected on now) and my desktop (with an active Windows 10 Home)?<br />
8:48 PM Geraldine: Alright, Windows 10 home is only for 189 CAD<br />
8:49 PM Geraldine: and and windows 10 pro is for only 259.99 CAD<br />
8:50 PM Geraldine: and since you have me on the line, I'll be the one who will install it on your windows<br />
8:50 PM Geraldine: shall we go ahead and process it?<br />
8:50 PM jonah: But will my new Windows 10 Pro key all licences on two separate computers?<br />
8:50 PM Geraldine: yes<br />
8:51 PM Geraldine: they will ahve separate key<br />
8:51 PM Geraldine: Windows 10 Home key and windows 10 pro key full version<br />
8:52 PM Geraldine: if you want we also have the replacement key<br />
8:52 PM Geraldine: the replacement key is for only 440<br />
8:53 PM Geraldine: $40*<br />
8:53 PM Geraldine: it is also a retail key<br />
8:53 PM jonah: I'm confused.<br />
8:53 PM Geraldine: Actually the full version is like you have purcahsed the whole windows 10 operating system<br />
8:54 PM Geraldine: and it has the preinstalled product key<br />
8:54 PM Geraldine: and the replacement key is that you'll buy the license key<br />
8:54 PM Geraldine: that is their difference<br />
8:55 PM Geraldine: In your case, since you have already windows installed on your PC, replacement will do<br />
8:55 PM jonah: So, if I purchase the $40 key, my laptop will be good to go. It will no longer prompt me for activation?<br />
8:55 PM Geraldine: that is correct :)<br />
8:55 PM Geraldine: shall we process the replacement key?<br />
8:56 PM Geraldine: and change the license inmstalled on your windows then<br />
8:56 PM jonah: All for $40, correct?<br />
8:56 PM Geraldine: $40 each<br />
8:57 PM Geraldine: so all in all $80 if you'll get a license key for your desktop<br />
8:57 PM jonah: Let's just do my laptop for now.<br />
8:57 PM jonah: A single replacement key for $40.<br />
8:57 PM Geraldine: Alright, let's prpcess it<br />
8:58 PM Geraldine: I will send a verification code on your email<br />
8:58 PM Geraldine: please check<br />
8:58 PM Geraldine: and verisfy it to me<br />
8:58 PM Geraldine: please check your email<br />
8:58 PM jonah: I see the verification code.<br />
8:59 PM jonah: 065737<br />
9:00 PM Geraldine: Thank you, let's add an instrumental payment on your account<br />
9:01 PM Geraldine: please add a patment option<br />
9:04 PM Geraldine: hi there<br />
9:04 PM Geraldine: do you have other card?<br />
9:05 PM jonah: Nope<br />
9:05 PM Geraldine: seems that the card is empty<br />
9:05 PM Geraldine: 0 balance<br />
9:06 PM jonah: False.<br />
9:07 PM Geraldine: let me check<br />
9:07 PM Geraldine: let's try to remove the payment instrument and then re add it<br />
9:07 PM Geraldine: one moment<br />
9:08 PM jonah: No.<br />
9:08 PM jonah: I'm losing confidence in this transaction.<br />

<p>It was a continuation from another chat log. It was captured after the tech support had remote access to my computer. The tech had closed the other chat which contained my case number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has been prompting me for my key (license expiring), but won’t accept it. The tech suggested a $40 replacement key and license update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

</p><p>I was nervous as there doesn’t seem to be an option to buy a replacement key through the Microsoft website. The offer came soley from the tech who could view my credit card info through the remote session.</p>
