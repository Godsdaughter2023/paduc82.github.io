<h2>            Printing on I E is cutting off 2&#34; right side of the page. </h2>
                    I recently Installed a new HP printer and it works great except when trying to print from IE. I downloaded IE 9 Beta and no help. I Would like to return to IE 8 and be able to access the various menus so I can correct the Problem. There are no action buttons
 on my version of IE. How do I do that?

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Were
 you able to print when you had Internet explorer 8 installed on the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the content is larger than the output paper size, Internet Explorer cannot put all the content on the output paper. Therefore, it clips off the content
 that is outside the printable area.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to reduce the page margins or print the page in Landscape mode to increase the printable area.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>§<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>To reduce
 the margins, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>On
 the File menu, click Page Setup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Under
 Margins, type 0 in the Left box and the Right box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Print
 the page again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>§<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If changing
 the margins does not resolve the issue, change to Landscape mode. To do so, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>On
 the File menu, click Page Setup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Under
 Orientation, click Landscape.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Print
 the page again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also print the individual frames separately from the printer. You can do this only to frame Web pages. To print the individual frames, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>On
 the File menu, click Print.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Under
 the Options tab, click All frames individually.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Print.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you want uninstall Internet Explorer 9, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned in the article given below.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How do I install or uninstall Internet Explorer 9?</span></span></strong></p>

<h2>            using word as a web editor</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is it feasible to use word 2003 as a web editor…
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a lot of text based webpages…
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is one - violenceinnewzealand.web.com/index.html</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I did have access to frontpage years ago but currently using komposer</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I cut and paste text into komposer I have formatting problems
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am currently experimenting with composing in word 2003 and saving as ‘web page’ thus using word as a web editor…

<p>It is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">possible</span> to use Word 2003 as a web page editor, but it certainly is not the best experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend the free version of Microsoft Expression Web, which you can download from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36179</a>.
 There are many other web page editors, and you can find reviews of them on the Internet, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-html-editors-for-windows-3471313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-html-editors-for-windows-3471313</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to continue using Word, it would be best to save your web pages as "Web Page, Filtered" instead of just "Web Page".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c13c6796-41f0-44b9-9cb3-edc16552cee1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c13c6796-41f0-44b9-9cb3-edc16552cee1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The difference is that "Web Page" saves tons of extra HTML tags that make it possible to reload the file into Word with all the Word-specific information. That makes the file several times larger and slower to load in the browser. The Filtered version omits
 the Word tags and just saves "normal" HTML. If you need to change the page, start again from the .doc file.<br />

    <title>Region on Child Microsoft Account incorrectly identified as United - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chadwickwaters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Region on Child Microsoft Account incorrectly identified as United States</h2>
                    The Region on my son's Microsoft Account is incorrectly identified as "United States" rather than 'Canada' and I cannot identify a way to correct it. I cannot complete the permission process because it attempts to force me to change (and incorrectly identify)
 my region to United States as well in order to proceed. The "Your family" page does not allow me to modify the Child account's Region. Attempting to sign in under the Child Account to change the Region does not work because parental permission has not been
 given. Since there appears to be no way to change Region on the Child Account, there does not appear to be any way to successfully complete the parental permission process. Existing KB articles assume the Region is wrong on the parental account, which is not
 the case here. Similar Community posts appear to be locked, and I cannot find any that indicate a solution. Please help me identify how the Region can be changed on the child account so parental permission can be granted.

            If you saw a response about support with a phone number, do NOT call that number. It is a SCAM. It will be removed from the forum by moderators but you may have received an email when the scammers posted it.<br />

<h2>            Mirrored Margins aren&#39;t displaying properly after Section Break</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04cd8b22-77ed-45ed-8ea1-b7dad78d7778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04cd8b22-77ed-45ed-8ea1-b7dad78d7778" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently formatting a book, and have ended my first chapter with a section break, "Continue on Next Odd Page." I'm doing this so that chapter 2 will display in the right-position of the book, with the gutter on the left side of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the gutter is showing up on the right side of the page. When I consult Print Preview, the section break isn't just adding a blank page, to serve as the backside of page 27. It's adding a full blank page, front and back, so that Word can ignore what
 I'm telling it to do, and continue to display the start of chapter 2 on that back of page 27. Which is NOT what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this? I have "Different Odd and Even Pages" enabled in the header. Mirrored Margins are set to apply to the entire document. I've enabled paragraph view to make sure I don't have any extraneous breaks. How do I fix this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>This has come up before, and it is connected to the peculiar&nbsp;"New Column" type of section break which I learned about just a few&nbsp;weeks ago.&nbsp;If you go to the Page Setup dialog box and change "Section start" to "New column" you will see "End of section" in
 the document.</p>

&nbsp; Hi - I am trying to&nbsp; a cover letter and a resume and a writing sample as part of a job application process. The instructions say that I have to upload all of the required documents as one file.&nbsp; I don't know how to do this. Also it says that it has to be
 in doc., pdf, rte., or text format. One of the documents I am submitting (the writing sample) is in pdf format the others are word files. Aren't both pdf and word files both in text format?&nbsp; Thanks.</div>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 &#40;64 Bit Version&#41; &#38; Sage Payroll cannot send an email &#40;I must be dreaming&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I would like to ask a <strong>Very Simple Question.&nbsp;
</strong>I have been running Outlook and Sage for the last 11 years with no problems generally.&nbsp; In an effort to get past the Microsoft end of life issues with SBS Server, I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1 Office 2013
 on a new Dell Laptop.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Installing Sage&nbsp; was simple and efficient until I tried to run a payslip to output to Outlook, whereupon I now get a Generic Com error, or it cannot resolve an email address for my employees.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">How is this possible?&nbsp; Surely two organisations the size of Microsoft and Sage&nbsp;would have tested this (wouldn't they)?&nbsp; then to publish on the Sage support website that Outlook 2013 64 Bit will not work with Sage is simply an unbelievable
 state of affairs, two mainstream applications that much of the UK business community rely on wont talk to each other, and more won't be fixed until
<strong>July 2015, surely cannot be right.&nbsp;</strong> My business, and I am sure others with the same support costs find this impossible to cope with.&nbsp; Is this a time to dump Sage and Microsoft altogether and go with an open office product or will both of these
 organisations see sense and communicate with each other to fix this?</p>

</p><p>There is nothing unbelievable about it - Sage is a 32 bit application and you have chosen to install 64 bit Office. You cannot mix 32 and 64 bit applications&nbsp;that are intended to&nbsp;interact with each other - applies to applications from any vendor.</p>

            <p>No, you are not dreaming, I am &nbsp;more than a little disappointed, especially having lashed out £1400 for the so called 'Accountants' Club membership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This just seems to me to be a TOTAL RIP OFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a work around for the payslips as they can be exported to a pdf and emailed, not elegant but at least it us usable after a fashion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However no such luxury with P60's which just won't email reliably, sometimes it works and (most) of the time it does not. Lots of year end's to do with multiple P60's for each and at this rate I am going to be hand writing them. Not quite but I really don't
 want to have to print them on to paper and send out manually!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVEN WORSE, I have Office 365, and can't export to Excel from Sage 50. Called up the very friendly but expensive Accountants Club to be told 'ooh, it doesn't work with Office 365'. and from waht I could gather, there are NO plans to get this fixed. Fortunately
 can at least output as a CSV, but lost an entire days work because the process destroyed my office installation and I had to install, re start and re-install Office several times!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, were it not such a pain in the A..E I would change to another product, but with the historic accounts in Sage this becomes a long winded and expensive option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, Sage 2015, now I have to re-equip my office and buy a Windows Server (and Windows 2012) because Sage insists on having the Window Storage Services (or something Windows) running, so my Linux Servers and NAS (also Linux) storage solution, which have
 been excellent suddenly become redundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WE ARE BEING MONSTROUSLY RIPPED OFF and I am seriously looking for a platform independent solution to keep me away from these corporate sharks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>There have been quite a number of posts regarding Sage and the enormous difficulties they are facing getting their products to do something that apparently everyone else can.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Diane Poremsky&gt; summed it up best (IMHO) in her Mar 31, 2015 reply in the following thread - (To save people time going through that lengthy thread - have included the relevant snippet from&nbsp;Diane's response&nbsp;below the link)</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sage does not support Outlook 2013 and it's their problem, not Microsoft's. Frankly, it tells me that they only want large corporations as customers or people who prefer to use older software.&nbsp; They don't want people who use current software as their customers.
 If they don't release a version that works with click to run soon, they'll be in a death spiral."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as for the "not being able to export to Excel is you're using Office '365 - some additional comments</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - There is absolutely no requirement to even have Excel installed to export to an Excel workbook. Can do it directly using the base system file drivers so that Office 365 argument (if there even was a remote reason for that being a factor) has no basis.
 This is not speculation on my part since ContactGenie programs&nbsp;export to Excel workbooks regardless of what is or isn't installed in terms of Excel so it obviously can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Even if Sage determined that there was a reason to actually use Excel for the purposes of exporting (only reason I could think of would be for &lt;formatting&gt; the output) - nothing has changed regarding invoking Excel programmatically so Office 365 isn't
 a factor BUT my guess is that they are using some unnecessary processes to determine what is or isn't installed on the system which is not required to simply invoke Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again - only a wild guess on my part but It sounds like someone at Sage seems to have a very misguided notion that the &lt;click-to-run&gt; versions of Office 2010 and Office 2013 (365) work the same way - not the case - in any way, shape or form. Time for the
 head of development at Sage to perhaps come out from behind their abacus for a few minutes and catch up with the rest of the world.

<p>
</p><p>Issue isn't whether or not it's a good decision for Sage - that's their call, &nbsp;but rather the incorrect presumption on their customer's part that the problems being encountered are the fault of Outlook or Office 365 in general. There's a world of difference
 between the two positions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as there being a "better new Office release" - there's nothing in the upcoming '2016 release that is going to make the least bit of difference to the issues noted in this discussion or that of the other topic I point to in my previous response. However,
 you are certainly in a position to correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, far too many people automatically assume that the problem lies with the "Microsoft" product when&nbsp;a vendor fails to take steps to upgrade their product. Also suggest you re-read the comment involving "abacus" - it related to "click-to-run"
 versions of '2010 &amp; '2013 which to state again, are completely different - unless you seem to feel that's not the case and/or&nbsp;there's a difference in what you yourself develop&nbsp;for OL'2013 when it's installed via .msi versus click-to-run.</p>

            <p>Chaps,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry&nbsp;for not keeping up with this thread but &nbsp;I have been out of the country</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just the kind of problem I am discussing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karl:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Unfortunately, far too many people automatically assume that the problem lies with the "Microsoft" product when&nbsp;a vendor fails to take steps to upgrade their product."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You seem as one would expect to uphold the position of Microsoft in that "it's not their problem it's Sage"</p>
<p>what you seem to misunderstand is that as a business user I am paying Microsoft for Product, Paying Sage for both Product and Support and all I end up with is an inability to run my business in a way that I have done for the last 11 Years, and paying for
 the privilege to boot!&nbsp; the recurring theme her is I am Paying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sage:</p>
<p>What you (SAGE) fail to realise is the number of wasted man hours I and my team of three have had to spend waiting on the phone (again at our expense) to be told that it's not our problem it's Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what happened to the good old adage the customer comes first?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very fortunate in that that one of my Group&nbsp;company's (Microsoft Gold Partner) stepped in, downgraded me to Office 2010 to allow my business to continue to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would anyone feel when faced with, they cannot be paid because we&nbsp;can't produce a payslip?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last straw for me was when having completed this exercise I then had to go into the registry to fix the Font's in use problem relating to the DPI that Microsoft introduced without any regard for the changes that this would have on 32bit applications
 running at 96DPI instead of 120DPI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sage who cannot "interfere" with my Operating System had to point me in the direction of the Microsoft article and I had to manually change this around.&nbsp; You would not believe the waste of time I had to go through to get this resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My final point on this is simple and I'd like to know what justifiable reasons there are that Microsoft and Sage who are both Market Leaders in what they do,&nbsp;fail miserably in communicating with each other when it comes to releasing / testing new products
 to the market?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else feel the same as me, in that paying for something usually means you expect it to work or as I started this off "Am&nbsp; I Dreaming"</p>

</p><p>There comes a point where I get seriously tired with this&nbsp;incessant reference that I or any of us here that answer questions "uphold the position of Microsoft". Just like&nbsp;anyone - we also work in a multi-vendor environment. Just like&nbsp;anyone - issues are
 encountered. Just like&nbsp;anyone - we need to get them resolved whether this involves Microsoft or not. There is a protocol to the problem resolution process regardless of which "multiple" vendors are involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we also understand where the onus and responsibility lies when a problem is encountered. if I buy a product from "Vendor B"&nbsp; (will call this vendor "Sage" for the sake of this response) which doesn't work with the product I have purchased from "Vendor
 "A" (We'll call this vendor "Microsoft") - I EXPECT that Vendor "B" will be in communication with "Vendor "A" to resolve the issue. Once Vendor "B" communicates with Vendor "A" - then the two work together to resolve whatever the issue is regardless of the
 source of the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell me any other industry where a single vendor assumes the responsibility&nbsp;for every problem that occurs just because they are a market leader or has the right to bulldoze their way into another company to make them do something - neither reasonable nor
 rationale (and quite frankly - not even legal). Microsoft does not have any access to another company's proprietary code unless they opt to share it with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps some better questions that should be posed to&nbsp;&lt;any&gt; vendor "B" would be</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Have you contacted Microsoft about "problem X" given that it is being identified as a Microsoft problem?</p>
<p>2) Since it is being identified as a Microsoft problem - what exactly is the cause? If one knows enough to state that it's "not our problem" then it is reasonable to expect that the person/company making that statement knows what they're talking about and
 can articulate the cause that needs to be "fixed" by Microsoft. The simple reason that something has changed from the way things worked before does not absolve any company from adapting their products. Using that logic - then everyone can demand that everything
 remain compatible with the way things worked in Window's '97 so that their products don't have to change in any way, shape or form should they so choose that approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally - am not responding&nbsp;here to "uphold the Microsoft" position but rather &lt;purely&gt; as an Independent Software Vendor in my own right (size of company is irrelevant&nbsp;as it relates to problem resolution). If a customer has a problem with one of our products,
 the onus is on us to isolate the cause and &lt;IF&gt; it's found that an issue is related to a Microsoft issue - it is up to us to contact Microsoft to either
</p>
<p>(a) get the problem resolved outright or </p>
<p>(b) try to determine if there is a viable work-around if no complete solution is available or
</p>
<p>(c) identify it as a "known issue"&nbsp;if for some reason the problem cannot be resolved</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>we can simply decide to &lt;DO NOTHING&gt; which does not&nbsp;suddenly make it a Microsoft problem to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A sidenote&nbsp;- Sage&nbsp;states that they do not support Office 365 (Outlook 2013) subscription (Click to run) but do support the .MSI version which I have to assume also involves their feature related to connecting to Outlook contacts. Funny thing, our programs
 written&nbsp;circa '2005&nbsp;still work "out of the box - UNCHANGED" without issue in terms of Outlook contacts right through to OL '2016 CP whether Outlook is installed via the&nbsp;standalone .msi installer or via subscription (click to run). Obviously it's possible so
 please don't anyone tell me that I am simply "upholding the position of Microsoft".
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>All&nbsp;any company in the position of&nbsp;vendor "B" &nbsp;has to do is contact Microsoft support to get the ball rolling - it's really that simple.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Politics aside - contact the vendor who has to resolve the problem. You are not sending statements &lt;from&gt; Outlook &lt;to&gt; Sage - it is the Sage application which is connecting (or supposed to) with Outlook and if that isn't working - they are the ones you need
 to contact. If they have an issue integrating with a Microsoft product, then it is "they" who need to contact Microsoft - just like any other independent software vendor (ISV) in the world - large or small. This has absolutely nothing to do with "politics".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an analogy - if you buy a computer and then purchase a 3rd party peripheral for it which doesn't work as expected - it's the peripheral vendor you need to contact - not the computer manufacturer.</p>

<h2>            finding a user in address book with only a user ID &#40;no name known&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Howdy,</p>
<p>On my old computer, in Outlook 2013, I could search in the global address list, on the "More Columns" tab, to find a user that I only had a user ID for.&nbsp; This is different than the alias.&nbsp; For example, user Joe Blow might have an alias of JBlow, but to log
 in his machine, he would enter his user ID, which is a string of numbers (i.e. 01068736).&nbsp; Sometimes all I have is that user ID, so to find the actual user, I used to be able to find them easily by entering that user ID in the More Columns tab.&nbsp; I just got
 a new computer on Win10 with Outlook 2016, and it doesn't work.&nbsp; My IT dept. doesn't know why it doesn't work for me because it works for them.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Jon</p>

    <title>How can I archive Outlook emails to server folders by date - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leapfrogging bombs  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I archive Outlook emails to server folders by date &#40;month&#47;year&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm migrating from Thunderbird to Outlook. In Thunderbird, while reading a message (or when selecting multiple messages), I could hit the 'A' key to "archive" the messages. This copied the message into a folder of the form Archive/YYYY-MM based on the
 year and month of the message. This was a great way to keep my inbox clean while keeping some structure in the archive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, for IMAP accounts the Archive/* folder structure was a standard IMAP folder structure, so these archive folders were available on the server.</div>
<div>Is there any way to achieve similar functionality with Outlook? In particular:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Archive to an IMAP server folder rather than a local PST file</li><li>Archive to a folder based on the year and/or month of a message</li><li>Archive with a single keystroke when reading a message</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks very much,</div>

            Thanks - I do understand how Outlook archiving works, but it's different in the 3 ways I list (and you confirm) from Thunderbird archiving - I'm wondering if there's anyway to get a behavior that's more similar to what I'm used to, either with out-of-the-box
 Outlook or with an add-in.
<div><br />
<div>(I'm sure it will be called something other than "archiving" - think of it as a quick and easy way to save a selected message(s) to a designated (IMAP) folder, preferably where that folder is automatically chosen based on the date of the incoming message.)</div>

            <p>An IMAP mail account is, as I'm sure you realise a copy of what is actually on the IMAP server, so whilst you can create a folder on the server, and move mail to it, it would not be a real archive.</p>

                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lost my PC to some bugger out there and Phobos .......&nbsp; Re-installed Office 2016 and Outlook .........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created a new IMAP account to my provider (it self populated a bit) and THEN tried to import a backup PST to that account.</p>
<p>It did it but now in the left pane I have a delightfully inconvenient set of bloody folders - all freaken 27 of them !!!&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Lord knows I'm not a greedy man - I just want something simple like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inbox</p>
<p>Outbox</p>
<p>Sent&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>Drafts</p>
<p>Deleted&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know - something simple !&nbsp; Not the bloody 27 I have listed below ..... any suggestions!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inbox</p>
<p>Sent Items</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>Drafts</p>
<p>Sent</p>
<p>Trash</p>
<p>Deleted Messages</p>
<p>Calendar</p>
<p>Calendar from iCloud</p>
<p>Calendar from iCloud (this computer)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chats</p>

<p>RSS Feeds</p>
<p>Tasks</p>
<p>Time Profile</p>
<p>Time Profile (this computer)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search Folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the link to the "Contacts" is the icon on the bottom that's the next one over after "Calendar" icon why in the hell is it there ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the hell is a "Time Profile" and why do I want two of them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is "Trash" some mac thing - I like a "Deleted Items"&nbsp; folder so what the heck is trash?</p>
<p>For that matter what the heck is a "deleted Message" folder - they should just go in to the Deleted Items" folder too!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't I just put the stuff from the 3 copies of calendar that are I that list in to one?&nbsp; I'm just me and hardly bi-polar anymore so
</p>
<p>one Calendar would be dandy !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway if someone can give me a hand with this crap it would be appreciated!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMAP allows you to access your email wherever you are, from any device. When you read an email message using IMAP, you aren't actually downloading or storing it on your computer; instead, you're reading it from the email service. As a result, you can check
 your email from different devices, anywhere in the world: your phone, a computer, a friend's computer.<br />
<br />
IMAP only downloads a message when you click on it, and attachments aren't automatically downloaded. This way you're able to check your messages a lot more quickly than POP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to verify if you've setup a third-party domain and not an Outlook email as IMAP in Outlook. If so, I would recommend that you sign in to your email on your provider's website and kindly check if the 27 folders you're seeing is there. Also, can you
 still remember how you've setup your email before prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest that you change all your passwords, for the security of your accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify me and have me get back to you, simply reply to this thread.</p>

    <title>WHY did Word change paragraphs into one letter per line when I tried - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gomer  say:</h3>
<h2>            WHY did Word change paragraphs into one letter per line when I tried to put the paragraphs into columns&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Please refer to <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-word/changing-to-columns-causes-one-letter-on-a-line/3f3669c3-c1f5-4bd6-b6c9-434d601c3323">
this exchange</a> for an understanding of the problem.&nbsp; Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have used the workaround of using a table as suggested by Doug Robbins, and I appreciate Suzanne Barnhill's suggestions, I have encountered the problem before and still wonder what causes Word to change a paragraph into a many pages of columns of
 one letter on each line?&nbsp; Is this something inherent in Word or is this something that is caused by my formatting?&nbsp; As you can tell, I like to understand what is going on so that I can eliminate the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input.</p>

            <p>Besides looking at the Columns dialog, look into the Paragraph dialog to see what the indents are set at -- particularly the right indent -- in the one-character column(s). It may be that the effective width of the paragraphs within the column is zero or
 only slightly more than zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how that happens, but I've seen it more than once. It could be an unhappy interaction among changes in column widths, page orientation, and text content.</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer Script Error&#58; Library not registered - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anastasianoel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer Script Error&#58; Library not registered</h2>
                    I'm trying to rip a completely legal CD to my new laptop, but when the auto-play window pops up (it's DRM-protected, ugh), I get an IE script error message that says "Library not registered." It lists the URL as&nbsp;file:///E:/CDS300/noflash/js/cds300_flash.js.
 Is this a problem with Vista or Flash or maybe both? I'm running Vista Home Premium x64. I know from the Adobe site there's not a Flash plugin available for IE8 x64 yet, but I use Chrome, so it hasn't been an issue until now. I can't find help anywhere on
 the MS site, grr. Any help is greatly appreciated.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: The CD works fine when inserted into my old laptop that runs Windows XP SP2.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi anastasianoel,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Answers forum,<br />
<br />
Vista included both 32 bit and 64 bit IE browser, you can safely download Flash for your 32 bit IE and view the content of your CD with it.&nbsp; The 32 bit IE will be default for your 64 bit system.&nbsp; IE 64 bit is there but it is optional whenever you want to use
 it or not.&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            Having problems with my omnia</h2>
                    Hi I recently baught this phone second hand and was told it was unlocked to all networks. I have a T - Mobile contract sim BUT THE PHONE&nbsp; SIMPLY WON'T WORK WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN VODAFONE. I have been told by someone who deals with phones every day (owns
 a perminent market stall) that the phone is unlocked but for some reason is blocking any other sim.&nbsp; The phone works fine with t mobile sim until i try to make or recieve a call or txt. I get call barred in tiny txt on the screen. The phone tries to make the
 call it attemps to dial but then ends the call and nothing. I have looked carefully through the mannual and the settings on the phone and nothing seems to work. What do I do? Attempt t getthe phone unlocked at a shop? Sell the phone on or chuck it in the bin?<br />
I'm really peeved as the phone is excellent other than this. It's really nice condition 16 gig without memry card. It's just useless to me as a phone?<br />
If anyone can help I'd be gratefull.<br />
Thanx<br />

 I need to call their PHONE from my Skype connection, because they're not online at the moment. Is there something I'm missing? Help PLEASE!

            <p>Hi, Dear Akheel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for an optimistic answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the reffering article is written about the need to install Language Pack.<br />
Mr. G. Aul reported in the announcement to build 14342 the following: «The Language Packs for this build will be live later tomorrow".<br />
Maybe update Adobe Flash Player will be updated after Language Pack receiving?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done:<br />
- Method 1: Windows Update – is not helps, I use automatically updating.<br />
- Method 2: Microsoft Download Center - not applicable to Edge browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Status of my question - I wait your reply and receiving of Language Pack, which is promised Mr G.Aul.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrey.</p>

    <title>Hidden even pages in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dougtw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hidden even pages in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've run into a problem with hidden pages after inserting page numbers for odd and even pages, even numbers to the left, odd to the right (here I am stuck in the middle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working on a multi-section document for a government customer. The document has several front matter sections and multiple chapters. Two of the document requirements are that each section/chapter will begin on a right-side page, and the above mentioned
 even pages to the left and odd pages to the right. The problems is that Word hides even pages if "Different Odd &amp; Even Pages" is selected. If text ends on an odd page, Word creates an even page without displaying the page. The page count in the lower left-hand
 corner will show a page skip, e.g. p. 51 followed by p. 53. As expected, if I print to paper or pdf, the hidden pages get printed.<br />
<br />
How do I make Word display that even page? I don't have an issue with the hidden pages, but I won't be the one revising the document in the future. At some point, others less familiar with Word will notice a "missing page" and add another even page, creating
 much havoc. I could simply add a page break to force Word to display the even page. However, the blank page will display a page number. And this customer wants blank pages to be literally blank, i.e. no oft seen, "This page left intentionally blank."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>In order to see the blank even&nbsp;pages you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have enabled either "Mirror margins" or "Different Odd and Even" (which you have done).</li><li>View the document in <strong>Print Preview Edit Mode</strong>. This is different from the Print Preview in the "backstage." You have to add the PPEM button to the Quick Access Toolbar.</li><li>Select a Zoom ratio that displays at least two pages. You will then see true facing pages, including the blank even ones.</li></ol>
<p>The alternative is to actually print the pages (with header and footer) as described at

            <p>Hmm, I see now that&nbsp;when I click the arrows to turn the page in the Print Preview, Word tends to skip the blank pages. What you can do is reduce the zoom; this will guarantee that all pages show up.<br />
<br />
Are you sure that all section breaks are Next Page? I wouldn't expect any filler pages with Next Page section breaks,
<strong>unless</strong> page numbers are restarted (to an odd number) in some sections, which makes Word add the filler pages (effectively treating the breaks as Odd Page breaks). Word always does its best to prevent odd-numbered page numbers from printing
 on left-hand pages (and Word also prevents even-numbered page numbers from printing on right-hand pages).</p>

            <p>I get annoyed when I have to 'fix' issues following an 'upgrade' for which I did not ask (and for which ... if I do manage to arrange a 'fix' ... will not appear much different to what I had before, or will not provide me anything that I will use in preference
 to what I had before).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I recently had an email telling me to reconnect my Outlook. &nbsp;So I dutifully did. &nbsp; All was ok until I had another email the same as the previous. &nbsp; So I did as I was told and reconnected ... all ok again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive now had a 'Final Notice' telling me my Outlook will no longer 'sync' unless I (you guessed it) reconnect. &nbsp;</p>

            The reconnect should bring you Exchange Server protocol instead of Exchange ActiveSync, so all of those nagging little shortcomings like not being able to copy a message to a folder or&nbsp;being unable to drag a message from a local .PST file into an online
 folder and a host of other EAS issues&nbsp;will all go away.

    <title>BSOD on Shutdown Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD on Shutdown Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I do not know if this was posted already and I can't find it or what.</p>
<p>I am running a Windows 7 PC that I upgraded to Windows 10 TP. Whenever I try to shut down, sleep or restart I get an NDIS_BUGCODE_DRIVER BSOD, however if I press
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">[SHIFT]</span> and shut down it does not happen. I do not know what it is and if I can get help really soon that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>_________________________</p>
<p>I have an Acer Aspire V3-571 laptop.</p>
<p>I originally had Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit.</p>
<p>I still have all the original hardware in it. I also have an external mouse for playing Minecraft. Could that be an issue?</p>
<p>I have not modified anything and do not know anything else.</p>
<p>__________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>P. S. I want the surface to go down in price <em>REALLY</em> soon.</p>
