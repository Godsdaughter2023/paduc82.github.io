            <p>Hi Sheela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to get to your Inbox. I’ll be glad to help you with this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you few questions to get better clarity on this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which browser are you using to access your Outlook.com account?</li><li>What is the URL (website address) you are using to access Outlook.com account?</li></ol>
<p>There is a possibility that you might be using a different URL which redirects you to manage your account hence I suggest you to login to Outlook.com account using the link below and check if you are able to access your Inbox.
</p>
<p>

            Hi AndyWalters2 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Check whether you copy of Office is activated or not. 
<br />
<br />B. Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Do this only if you have product key of Office 2010. If you don't have product key, skip this. 
<br />Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure that you and the person you're calling are using the latest version of Skype. Ensure as well that you have a strong Internet connection, if Skype detects a weak connection it will reduce the quality and drop the call altogether.</p>
<p>

<div>
<div>
<div>Thank you for your cooperation - Ive aleady chatted with the level 3 support - Let me share to you what the level 3 mention</div>
<div>1:43 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>one hour</div>
<div>1:43 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>wow</div>
<div>1:43 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>I am sorry if this take too long - Because we need to do some basic steps first before we can have a chat session with our level 3 support.</div>
<div>1:44 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>The level 3 mention -- ""was able to see that the account was closed due inactivity on 20-Jul-2015 and today it is more than the recovery period. Hence, nothing much can be done in this case.""</div>
<div>1:45 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>so it was inactive for 365 days? or less time?</div>
<div>1:46 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>accounding to level 3</div>
<div>1:46 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>according</div>
<div>1:46 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Yes - That was the level 3 mentioned - And I am really sorry to let you know.</div>
<div>1:47 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>is there a way to never lose emails from hotmail/outlook.com?</div>
<div>1:48 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>The way to not loose the emails from the server is to keep on going into the account periodically.</div>
<div>1:50 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>I know that this will really creates inconvenience at your part - However, this would be the least thing that we can provide for you.</div>
<div>1:51 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>can it be downloaded to my computer via a software program?</div>
<div>1:53 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>I just found this:</div>
<div>1:54 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Accounts become inactive if you don't sign in for more than 270 days VIA WEB BROWSER or within the first 10 days after signing up VIA WEB BROWSER for an account. IF you have a welcome email this has probably happened.<br />
<br />
After an account becomes inactive, all messages, folders, and contacts are deleted. Incoming messages will be sent back to the sender as undeliverable.<br />
Your account name is still reserved. During this time you wont be able to re-use the same email name.<br />
<br />
However, if the account stays inactive for an additional 90 days, the account name may be permanently deleted.<br />
If you don't use your Windows Live ID for 365 days, your Windows Live ID will be permanently deleted. Once the account is marked as in-active all data is purged so even if you could get the email account back the data would be gone....<br />
<br />
<br />
To recover your email do the following<br />
1. Sign in to your Outlook.com account (via a Computer/Laptop).<br />
2. Go to your Deleted folder (found on the left pane under Folders).<br />
3. Look for "Lost a message?", and click "recover deleted messages".<br />
<br />
You can also check out the following article for more information on how to recover lost/deleted messages from your Outlook.com account:<br />
What should I do if email messages are missing from my Outlook.com account?<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Outlook.com/how-recover-deleted-messages <br />
<br />
We can only recover recently deleted emails, specifically not more than 5 days old. Beyond that won't be possible.<br />
Outlook will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your Deleted folder. If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, it means they are permanently lost.</div>
<div>1:54 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>I am sorry - But that is already a third party program - And we are not supporting any third party program</div>
<div>1:54 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>That steps that is showing here is already the step that ive provided through a link a while ago</div>
<div>1:55 pm</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>just fyi</div>
<div>1:56 pm</div>
<div>

<h2>            Word 2007&#47;2010 Table of Contents Truncated and Not Updating</h2>
                    <p>.doc format document</p>
<p>Editing mostly on Word 2010 / Win 7 Pro (user 1) but transfer to/from Word 2007 / Win 7 Enterprise (user 2) for printing and some editing.</p>
<p>Styles setup and not changed.</p>
<p>76 pages</p>
<p>Change tracking on. 1018 revisions.</p>
<p>Lots of internal references for lists referenced in the document.</p>
<p>I am careful to not insert at the start of a heading reference - I've been bit there before :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I finish editing for the day, I do a Ctrl+A, F9 to update TOC, etc. before saving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has all been working fine until today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the document and noticed the TOC only had the first few entries. (1.0 through 1.6)</p>
<p>Tried updating - no change.</p>
<p>Verified style formats for headings. They are correct and include Paragraph Outline Level and Numbering Level.</p>
<p>Selected all Heading 1 instances and verified correct. Same with other styles.</p>
<p>Tried inserting a page break between 1.4 &amp; 1.5. Update TOC and page numbers updated for the items listed.</p>
<p>Tried copying 1.4 to a new entry between 1.4 &amp; 1.5</p>
<p>Update TOC. Page numbers for items already listed are updated. New 1.5 is not listed. Old numbers 1.5+ are not changed but page numbers did update.</p>
<p>Tried level 3-5 headings between 1.4 &amp; 1.5 and they also do not update TOC. (document did not have these until 3.1.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verified TOC code: { TOC \o "1-5" \h \z \u \n 5-6 }</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried deleting TOC and inserting a new TOC. Indicates No table of contents entries found.<br />
Noticed reviewing pane now shows deletions for 1.0-1.6 items that were in the TOC but shows Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.</p>
<p>Followed by Inserted, with correct heading numbers and TOC text for the entire TOC that should be in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrated and need a plan. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello...</p>
<p>i am having similar issues with my device...</p>
<p>i use windows 10 for my laptop but i take notes using onenote for iPad...&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am only having an issue with 2 PAGES not syncing... full notebooks and sections are unaffected, just the 2 lone PAGES. They both give this error E0001464 bxglm and say the pages has never been synced</p>
<p>no matter what i do, i cannot get them to sync... i have tried creating new notebooks and viewing them from there, logging out and logging back in, closing and reopening the notebooks all together with no luck.. i have been in several different places trying
 new internet connections and this has been an issue for several weeks.. i do not understand why it is STILL saying it cannot connect to the network. All the new notes and notebooks i have made have had no problems syncing or being viewed on my iPad, just the
 2 pages...</p>
<p>it is frustrating because i can view the note on my laptop, but i cannot see it on my iPad where i like to use my pencil to write and take notes.</p>
<p>please help!!</p>

<p>Yes, you have made changes to the configuration of Word that have to be saved in the NORMAL.DOTM file. Change to defaults somewhere, and you have the Word Option&nbsp;"Prompt to save changes to normal" turned on.</p>
<p>If you remember what changes you made to configuration that you get to decide if you want to keep them or not. If you don't remember what the change could be, you reject it.</p>
<p>Sometimes 3rd party addons, that add buttons/tabs will trigger the change also.</p>
<p>So what is the question?</p>

    <title>Mail not able to be accessed from Thunderbird. Error &#39;The server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dfree3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail not able to be accessed from Thunderbird. Error &#39;The server may have gone down&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I have Thunderbird setup the exact same way I have been using it for years but this entire week the server keeps disconnecting attempts to access any folder via imap-mail.outlook.com on Port 993 over SSL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SMTP still works fine oddly enough at smtp-mail.outlook.com on Port 587 over STARTTLS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Gmail account is also in Thunderbird and is still working fine so I know this is not a problem with networking. This seems to be a problem with a change to the Outlook servers within the last week. The last mail I've received to my account is on 11/30.
 Any other action keeps failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a custom domain with it's mail routed through outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error messages are as follows immediately upon login:</p>
<p>"Server has disconnected. The server may have gone down or there may be a network problem."</p>
<p>"The current operation on 'Any folder' did not succeed. The mail server for account responded: User is authenticated but not connected."</p>
<p>"The current command did not succeed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Jesinta - I am still able to access my mailbox via Outlook.com from any web browser, this was not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is IMAP access. </p>
<p>
</p><p>imap-mail.outlook.com seems to have been having problems for about a week now, described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have there been changes made to imap-mail.outlook.com that would prevent access via IMAP?</p>

            <p>Microsoft has cut off their own server with no notice to custom domain users. Here's the solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add an alias to your account:</p>
<p>https://account.live.com/AddAssocId</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the IMAP username to your new alias login. Then it will start to work immediately.</p>

<p>
</p><p>According to msinfo32, the Version and build is&nbsp; 6.4.9841.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That MSDN website only lists released versions.</p>

            <p>In Windows 8.1 checking the OS version has changed. You must explicitly state what versions of Windows you support in your application manifest, otherwise, Windows will lie to you and tell you you're on the highest version of Windows you state you support.</p>

</p><p>Apps with no manifest will see Windows Vista</p>
<p>Apps that have a manifest will see Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, or 10, whichever is the highest your app says it supports.</p>
<p>Apps that ignore the new methods, yet try to check OSVERSIONEX on Windows 8.1 and up will only see Windows 8. You

    <title>calculate beginning balance of CD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captcha  say:</h3>
<h2>            calculate beginning balance of CD</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to calculate the beginning balance of a CD using the rate &amp;&nbsp;the maturity date. The interest calculates daily and paid/compounded monthly. The Interest rate, ending balance, starting day/month, &amp; rate can change. I have created a sheet that calculates
 the monthly compounding interest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's kind of like calculating the Present Value of an investment, but that PV funtion doesn't take in account the number of days in a month. I appreciate any help you can give. Thank you!

<p>Excellent! An example ending balance would be $250,000&nbsp;after a three year term. Say it starts on July 1st 2011&nbsp;so it would&nbsp;mature on&nbsp;June 30th 2014. &nbsp;Interest accrues daily - but paid monthly; we'll use APR of 1.243%.

<br />
<br />
Please answer that if you have further questions.&nbsp; It is tedious for me and perhaps confusing for you if I must present solutions based on both assumptions.<br />
<br />
Suppose B1 is 250,000, B2 is 1.243%, B3 is 7/1/2011, and B4 is 6/30/2014.<br />
<br />
If "APR" is the APY or AER, the beginning balance ($240,896.39) can be computed by:<br />
<br />
=PV((1+B2)^(1/365)-1,B4-B3+1,0,-B1)<br />
<br />
If "APR" is the simple interest rate, the beginning balance ($240,845.64) can be computed by an amortization schedule constructed as follows.<br />
<br />
C2:&nbsp; =B2/365&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (daily simple interest rate in the US)<br />
A6:&nbsp; =B3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (starting date)<br />
A7:&nbsp; =EDATE($A$6,ROWS($A$7:A7))<br />
....copy A7 down through A42 (ending date+1)....<br />
B42:&nbsp; =B1<br />
B41:&nbsp; =B42/(1+$C$2*($A42-$A41))<br />
....copy B41 up through B6 (beginning balance)....<br />
<br />

Do you still have questions?&nbsp; If so, what are they?<br />

If you still have questions, you can either send the Excel file to joeu2004 "at" hotmail.com, or you can upload the Excel file to a file-sharing website and post the URL (http://...) here.&nbsp; Be sure to make the uploaded file shared or sharable.&nbsp; In either case,

<p>Small business owner with Office365, just installed new 2016 apps, trying to get OneNote set up again. But it's insisting that it send me a verification email to my onmicrosoft.com email address, and I have no idea how to check that. After searching the
 forums for a while, I've tried to get to Outlook web app, etc. with no luck. I tried to go into Office 365 Admin center and give myself email permissions, and I can't figure out how to do that ("You can't change your own permissions"!). So I'm locked out.
 Help!!!</p>

    <title>Issues with Custom Dictionary of FP2003 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with Custom Dictionary of FP2003</h2>
                    
<p>I have started noticing a new problem after installing Windows 7. When I run spell check I get an error message "could not add to custom dictionary".</p>
<p>I checked all menu items to&nbsp;find out where FrontPage&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;the dictionary file so that I can update it by using Windows&nbsp;Explorer. But I couldn't locate it.</p>
<p>Hoping someone can help me. Thanks.</p>

<p>"The spell check in FrontPage shares the same custom dictionary file as Microsoft Office. If you mistakenly put a misspelled word in there (EG: "spellling"), you cannot correct it through FrontPage. Either change it via another MS Office product (like Word)
 or edit the file directly. A typical path for such a file is C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Microsoft\Proof\CUSTOM.DIC."</p>

<p>FP 2003&nbsp;<strong>highlights</strong> many&nbsp;spellings as incorrect though same file when opened&nbsp;with SharePoint 2007<strong>does not</strong> show those spellings as incorrect which means FP is not reading from custom.dic whereas SP is reading it.</p>
<p>It is easy to find in Word, Excell, PP and SP where the custom.dic file is located but it is<strong>not so easy</strong> to do so in FP.
<strong>Hoping someone can tell me</strong> so that I can check where it is pointing to.</p>
<p>In SP 2007 go to Tools Menu &gt; Page Editor Options &gt; General Tab &gt; Spelling Options button &gt; Custom Dictionary button and I find that actual path is C:\Users\MaanojRakhit\AppData\<strong>Roaming</strong>\Microsoft\<strong>UProof</strong> (George Hernandez
 article may be outdated, Microsoft may have changed the location). Similarly in Word 2007 or Excel 2007 or Power Point 2007 &gt; go to Office Pearl &gt; Word Options button &gt; Proofing page &gt; Custom Dictionary button and again&nbsp;I find that actual path is C:\Users\MaanojRakhit\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UProof</p>
<p>There is yet another problem with FP 2003 + Windows 7 combine. When I run spell check,<strong>now</strong> (not earlier), it allows me to 'Add to dictionary' and
<strong>accepts</strong> it without complaining. At the end of the process all red wavy underlines<strong>disappear</strong> giving me the impression that now all these words are part of the custom.dic and they won't bother me any more. So, I close the page
 and then reopen it to test. Lo! all red wavy underlines<strong> are back.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone experiencing anything similar in identical setup</strong> of Windows 7 and FP 2003?</p>

<h3> -kizza-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Crashing. Have to keep changing Font Permissions every Windows update.</h2>
                    <p>Just going to start by saying I work in IT myself and have never come across an issue that has bewildered me so much. So much so, that this is my first question to the community in 8 years of my career in IT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A client of ours had a brand new machine built by us with Office 2016 installed, but since day 1 there have been numerous instances of this issue occurring. Essentially, Outlook crashes after every windows update, prompting us to carry out steps in this
 post&nbsp;https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/5d0cb1f9-d7ce-4ad7-b41f-e2e14e7c648a/outlook-wont-start-after-anniversary-update?forum=win10itprogeneral - this is now failing as a resolution as we now have to create a new profile every time
 (user has 10+ POP/IMAP accounts, it's painfully slow to re-add all accounts).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's bizarre that Font permissions would have anything to do with Outlook crashing, but there is definitely a connection as this resolution worked a few months back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EventVwr shows the same error as the above article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Faulting application name: OUTLOOK.EXE, version: 16.0.6741.2056,

<p>
</p><p>Steps tried to resolve:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Repair of Office</li><li>Repair of OST / PST files (SCANPST)</li><li>New Profile (Semi-Resolution)</li><li>Reinstall Office 2016</li><li>Roll Back Updates (Windows and Office)</li><li>Change Permission on Aerial Fonts</li><li>CHKDSK /F</li><li>SFC /Scannow</li><li>FORMAT PC and reinstall Win10 - surprisingly did not resolve either, even from a fresh build.</li></ul>
<p>Any help would be appreciated as this takes some serious time and is happening on a weekly / bi-weekly basis.</p>

            <p>Hi Kizza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on the description that you provided, we need to determine the cause of this problem. Before we proceed, may we know which version of Windows 10 are you using? If the computer is not currently in 1607 version, we suggest that you upgrade the computer
 to 1607. Once done, check if you will still experience the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us should you need further assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there any specific reason why you are still using the July 2016 release of Office 365 (Version 1602)? That version is no longer supported in any Channel release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 1605 is the minimal required version for the Deferred Channel with 1609 being the preferred one. Version 1702 is the Current release.</p>

<h2>            Using Subtotal Function - Excel 2010 doesn&#39;t Automatically Outline</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Excel 2010 after spending many years with 2003.&nbsp; I'm working with several large datasets that I need to subtotal and group.&nbsp; The subtotal function is working fine however it's outlining or grouping the rows together like 2003 did.&nbsp;
 Can anyone help me find the checkbox or hidden button I need to push to get this functionallity?

            You question is not clear. You state that "it's outlining or grouping the rows together like 2003 did". So what is 2010 doing that 2003 did not or vice versa?<br />

    <title>Access 2007-2010 &#34;Database cannot be opened because the VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pheonixfly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2007-2010 &#34;Database cannot be opened because the VBA project contained in it cannot be read&#34; error</h2>
                    <p>I have Access 2010 installed on my machine and made a couple of updates to a copied version of a split frontend Access file. I renamed the updated copy to replace the original Access file and placed the old file in a backups folder. I needed to make another
 update the next day but was using a VPN connection that made accessing the frontend file a pain, so I remoted into a server that hosts the file and used that server's Access 2007 application to make the update to a copied version of the current file. I renamed
 the copy and placed the copy in the backups folder.&nbsp;The file version is 2007-2010 therefore I did not think that it was going to cause any errors to update. However, it did and I am not sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When making these updates I never updated any VBA or received any kind of error apart from a SQL function error. The frontend was saved and compacted &amp; repaired successfully each time. Then my end users started receiving macro and VBA errors that prevented
 them from opening the file or entering any information. I discovered that the VBA modules were completely deleted from the file. Additionally, every single backup and copies of the original backup were becoming corrupted every time I opened the file on my
 own computer using Access 2010, even if I did not hit OK to proceed to delete VBA modules. I could not open a single file without receiving the VBA error. The users access the frontend file by downloading their own copy on an intranet site, so they don't corrupt
 the actual file. When I tried doing this as well the file was still corrupted and it even corrupted the original file as well. My coworker was able to find a clean backup and the end users were able to resume work, but I cannot touch the file or else it will
 be corrupted too. Even if I SHIFT + Open to skip the start code, I still receive errors. My coworker is running Access 2013 and does not receive any of these errors when opening copies of the backup file, but they do receive the errors after I open a file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact &amp; Repair</li><li>Decompile/Recompile</li><li>Access 2010 version is 14.0.7224.5000 (32-bit), so Office 2010 SP2 is already downloaded</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The decompile did not work because I would immediately receive the VBA error upon opening the file (SHIFT + OPEN as well). I have no new Access updates to download. I cannot revert to a previous build as that is not a solution my company is okay with. I
 have not tried importing objects into a new frontend file because I cannot import or export the VBA modules due to them always being deleted or corrupted whenever I open a file. I would lose all of the VBA modules and since I am not the original developer
 I have no idea what was included. I am in the process of trying to update Access to 2013, but that may take a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything I have read about this issue says that this happens when different versions of Access try to open the same file, but if I was using Access 2007 and 2010 to open a file whose version was 2007-2010, why would I still get that error? If it was an
 issue with 2007, why do I corrupt every single backup file made before using the 2007 software while using 2010 as well, especially if others are able to access that file just fine while using 2010, 2013, and 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help trying to figure out why all of the Access files are breaking when I touch them all of a sudden. I have checked my implemented updates from the past few days and have not noticed anything specifically relating to Access or Microsoft Office.
 Should I reinstall Access 2010? Should I update to 2013 or is having a newer version going to cause the same issues anyway?</p>

</p><p>So this is something I do every day for several years - I see an article in LinkedIn I was to keep. I choose share and select email. I send it to me@ onenote.com. I have a folder assigned in a notebook where the article usually appears. Instead I get this

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name's Vishaal and I work on the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing those Reference_Ids. Using them I was able to confirm that the error was that there were too many pages in the Section, which caused the "Section is too big" error you mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say that after clearing out this section, it still does not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try a few things for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Try saving to a different section with less notes in it and see if it works. If it does, then this is a temporary workaround and we can work on getting your old section working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It is possible it is still too big because of OneNote saving version history of those notes. To temporarily disable version history, there is a "History tab" at the top of the OneNote Windows client. Click it while in the section that you usually save
 your e-mails to, and then click "Delete all version in Section". Afterwards, empty the Notebook Recycle bin by clicking on the icon just to the right of the History icon. Here is an image:</p>

            Hi David,<br />
<br />
To further investigate the issue, here are some suggestions:<br />
1. How about creating a new empty section to save the article?<br />
<del>2. If you simply copy a few words then send to me@onenote.com, will the issue happens again?</del><br />
<del>3. Try a different network environment if possible.</del><br />
<del>4. After sending the email, have you checked the result in OneNote Online? This will help to determine if the issue is related to the client itself.</del><br />
5. Does the issue happen to other notebooks which located in another account? E.g. you were using user1@contoso.com and send to user1@contoso notebook. You can ask other users like user2@contoso.com and send to user2@contoso notebook.<br />
This will help to determine if it is a tenant wide issue or only happen to your account.<br />
<br />
In addition, we'd like to collect your tenant information so that we can take this back and work with the related team to move forward. I've send you a Private Message:<br />

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's all right with you, I'd like to open another thread with our Windows team to figure out why your OneNote is crashing when you move the pages or try and decrease the size of the section. Please let me know if this is something you are comfortable
 with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your e-mails, thanks for trying that out. That gives us some more information. I checked all the reference ids you gave me and they all seem to point to the same section with the same # of pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you go to www.onenote.com/emailsettings and change your default location to a different section in a different notebook. Then try sending an e-mail without any change of section in the subject line. There is a link at the bottom of www.onenote.com/emailsettings
 page, with the text "Try
 it now by saving an email to OneNote" that will do nicely if you don't want to invent one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can post the subject line and the content of any test e-mails you send that would be awesome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether or not this succeeds will be a big indicator of where the problem is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, try saving using a different section in that notebook. Just as a reminder, this is done by using @ in the subject line like "LinkedIn Article @LinkedIn" where LinkedIn is the name of the section in the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very interesting bug and I am excited to get to the bottom of this. Jim also has some great suggestions about account switching that could prove useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for using OneNote!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes please open another thread for the crashing problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Good News though the main problem is sorted. User error I'm afraid :-( </p>
<p>
</p><p>when the section was full and the email to OneNote failed, I knew I needed to send the new emails to a new section. I set this up and (mistake) changed the settings in the windows App in File | Options | Send to OneNote. Your email below &nbsp;told me to set
 this in&nbsp;<span>www.onenote.com/emailsettings. When I opened this, the section was the old one ! When I changed it in there to the new clean section it works fine.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the mix up and thanks for your help and patience,</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Glad to see your problem is solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get to work on OneNote crashing when deleting the history, we need to do something a little different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, mark this thread as "Solved" by clicking "Solved my problem (0)" on the appropriate comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, tracking down OneNote Client bugs is a little different than *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. We use something called "Watson" and we need to have a "Bucket ID" to find your issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would read this guide:&nbsp;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/johnguin/2014/07/09/how-to-get-a-watson-bucket-number-for-windows-8/ and then &nbsp;I would try and reproduce the issue (which might be easy enough if that large section is still lying around). Then, create
 another thread on this forum with the appropriate category (something like "Windows Client") and that team will be able to get back to you on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for using OneNote! Happy e-mail sending :)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            At startup new notification - OneNote shortcuts cannot be deleted.</h2>
                    <p>When I first boot into Windows 10TP a new notification appears immediately saying "OneNote shortcuts cannot be deleted." As I have not yet opened OneNote nor created or deleted any shortcuts this would appear to be a fault/problem?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if I click on search the web and windows I get " This is not available in your region." I'm in the UK.</p>
