<p>hi,</p>

<p>according to:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/sv-se/library/jj819267.aspx#bkmk_featuresonpremise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/sv-se/library/jj819267.aspx#bkmk_featuresonpremise</a></p>
<p>the&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/sv-se/library/b95d72bf-206f-4c26-a53d-ba61ff73605c#bkmk_wcmcontentsearchwebpart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">wcm: search web parts</a>&nbsp;is not available on o365 business premium</p>

<p>when i create a business premium trial:</p>
<p>i check my subscriptions:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=53f89971-c52d-4786-b03a-0dba53d70251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d53f89971-c52d-4786-b03a-0dba53d70251" /></a></p>
<p>it seems correct</p>

<p>then, in sharepoint online i can still find the cswp:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a8e9f79e-ffb4-45ac-81ae-4468c8b9bf58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da8e9f79e-ffb4-45ac-81ae-4468c8b9bf58" /></a></p>

<p>can somebody explain why it is like that? so what happens if i build content based on search, then we change the trial into a paid subscription. what will happen then?</p>
<p><br />
thank you</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>The Web Part is only visible in the editing mode.</p>
<p>After saving the page to leave the editing mode, it will not show up on the page. So, it is not feasible to use on Office 365 Business Premium.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Filtering&#47;Hiding Tasks in the entry table in MS Project 2013</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easy way to "hide" tasks in the entry table&nbsp;that I&nbsp;don't want to see in&nbsp;an MS Project 2013&nbsp;file?&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a requirement to&nbsp;only show a select few milestones in the project&nbsp;entry table, but I do not need to show all milestones; otherwise, I would
 just filter the milestones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do file "save-as," save the file as something else and then remove the tasks&nbsp;I don't want to show, that will mess up the predecessors and successors, so I don't want to do that either.&nbsp; I just want to show a select few milestones in the entry table,
 but not on the timeline view either.&nbsp; Just the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help as always! &nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can write a new filter for milestones which adds an additional condition, such as "name contains concrete".</p>
<p>But without knowing what is the criteria for the selection of just some of the milestones I cannot tell you what the additional condition should be.</p>
<p>You could use a spare flag field, manually populate with yes the tasks you want, and then make a filter for flag1 = yes.</p>

<h2>            Office 2011, Excel&#59; copy and paste hang, apparent crash, spinning beachball.</h2>
                    <br />
<p><strong>UPDATE 28 July 2015</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This issue is consistently resolved for me on all version of Excel since 14.4.1
</strong>(As summarised from the posts below.)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Each time you open Excel as a program do this:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>Open a blank spreadsheet. (If not already done automatically)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>Copy an empty cell to another blank cell in that spread sheet.
</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>Do this a second time. (Must be done twice.)&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>Then close (don't save) that blank spreadsheet.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Without quitting Excel now open the spreadsheet you want to work on.&nbsp; The copy paste spinning beach ball hang should no longer occur.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>You have to do this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
every time you open the Exce</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">l program</span>.
</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>** Microsoft please fix these major memory issues on the Mac **&nbsp;&nbsp; (
</strong>Over 600 hits on this post so far and rising .. <strong>. )</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>I have also confirmed in my case, after 100's of hours of lost time, that with other "run out of memory" hang and crash issue for larger spreadsheets, they simply consistently do not occur if I open the exact same files in
 Excel on a Windows 8 PC with less RAM, poorer CPU etc.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>These memory crash issues would appear clearly a software product coding issue with Excel 2011 for Mac on the OS X platform.&nbsp; From OSX 10.6 to 10.10.&nbsp; I highly value Excel and (Office generally) on the Mac.&nbsp; Please attend
 to these major coding memory issue bugs.&nbsp; (All my bug reports have been going in for over 12 months ....!!)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><em>Original post follows starting this thread .....</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I met this problem with three linked Excel spreadsheets of total combined size of about 50 to 60 MB.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full details of the original issue and the long process of resolution is contained in another post/thread:&nbsp;
<strong>"Document not saved" error</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reposting here the solution to the "hang on copy and paste" that was eventually resolved within that other thread. I felt a better heading and summary solution was called for.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In short, any copy and paste leads Excel to appear to hang, with a constant spinning colored beach ball, and Activity Monitor and Command-Option-Esc showing Excel as "not responding".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that if I left it long enough (in my case about 7 minutes) Excel would unhang, and letting this happen was part of the solution.&nbsp;However there was more to the solution than this.&nbsp; With Excel apparently hung you can not save your work anymore ...and
 force quite and reopen may lead you to the other problem of "Document not saved error" and hence that other thread.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The full solution found to the hang on copy and paste issue was:</strong></p>
<p>(** Update - if you do the two copy and paste blank cells in a new document, it is much quicker - see post lower down Cam [Aust] of this solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>(i) applying the update to Excel - 14.4.1.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>(ii) </strong><strong>saving immediately on opening each spreadsheet file, opening spreadsheet files in sequential linked order.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>(iii) </strong><strong>doing a copy and paste (even an empty cell to another empty cell) triggering the problem, then
</strong><strong>letting the hang resolve itself, and repeating this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
twice</span>. (Possibly waiting several minutes each time, so be patient and do not force quit.)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case this seems to solve the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp; If you are having crashes generally in Excel (without copy and paste) see post below re 'Problem Fonts'. This may be your issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another person posting found that using File&gt;Reduce file size, also resolved a similar problem for him.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>I am not sure this helps. Reduce File seems to reduce only picture files etc in the spreadsheet. It does not appear to process the Excel spreadsheet contents (cells, data, etc) in any way.&nbsp; Hence I am not sure this really helps with
 this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For more details, search for the post/thread/question "Document not saved" error, the go to my post on 23 July 2014. Work backwards if needed from there for more background.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you meet this problem, and the above 3 steps resolve the problem, please post to confirm.

            <p>I'm routinely (all the time) having this issue with Office Mac 2011 Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy any cell or cells and paste them - even in a very simple spreadsheet with no formulas - and Excel hangs, you see the beachball spin and eventually it recovers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes the program useless.</p>

            <p>Steve thanks. </p>
<p>Good to know I am not alone on this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>** To anyone else who has this problem, and tries the solution below, please post back to this thread of the outcome in your case. **--</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the following works for Excel 2011 (with update to 14.4.8 applied).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Open Excel</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">2. Open a new blank spreadsheet document if Excel has not done this already.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">3. Copy and paste a blank cell in that document to another cell. There will be a delay possibly, and possibly a spinning beach ball. It should only be a minute or two at the most to wait.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">4. Do this copy and paste of a blank cell to another blank cell a second time. Again a delay.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Having copy and pasted twice, this should have resolved the problem. Check: Before closing the new blank spreadsheet, try repeating a copy and paste a third time, there should be no delay.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">5. Click to delete this file, no need to save. </p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">6. Open the excel documents you want to use. Save each one immediately after it has opened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">7. Now try a copy and paste of one cell to another. There should be no significant delay now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Speculations and further comment:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems there is a fundamental coding issue and Excel needs to be cycled through copy and paste twice before the bug is resolved with every fresh opening of the Excel application.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for opening a blank excel sheet first is that the time delay with the two copy and paste's to remove the problem will be much longer for any significant sized spreadsheet file. It seems if the Excel file is big, what ever loop Excel has to go
 cycle through twice, it trawls through the all the open Excel files to complete the loop.&nbsp; So for a 150MB Excel file, it can be 10 or 20 minutes for each loop.&nbsp; Most people interpret this as a permanent hang. Opening a blank Excel sheet makes this workaround
 a lot quicker. Once done, the issue is resolved until you next quit and reopen Excel.&nbsp; In which case you have to do this again - each time!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible this issue is related also to other major memory issues. Excel reports not enough memory under various circumstances in various ways when there are some larger Excel files open (eg 100 MB's plus in original file size).&nbsp; For example, a message
 to effect that Excel can not proceed with a save or action without undo due to memory limits.&nbsp; These messages occur even though OS monitoring (Activity Monitor) reports no memory issues from the computer hardware level. For example, no RAM memory pressure,
 less than half of RAM used, no swaps from RAM to HD to manage an overflow, etc.&nbsp; While my Excel files are largish compared to what many light users may use, this occurs for spreadsheets still well within the size and other limits presented for Excel on the
 MS site.&nbsp; Like 1% of the limits in total row by columns basis.&nbsp; This would again appear an issue with Excel coding.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note there are other Mac users to myself and yourself that meet this problem, but searching more widely on the net, it does not seem that the problem is widespread across the full Mac and MS Office/Excel user community. If it were, I think there would
 be a lot more posts and fuss. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect hence that the issue may only effect certain Mac hardware configurations, for example possibly Macbook Pros with retina displays (as I use) and some other subset of Mac hardware. I have upgraded my OSX to 10.9 since meeting this issue and that
 made no difference.&nbsp; One Excel update, the 10.4.1 release, increasing some parameter, did halve the delay problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent possibly 50 to 80 hours trying to work around these issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using small simple spreadsheet files under 10 MB likely these issues will not be a problem, and likely such users will not have come here to find a solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure MS looks at these newsgroups and I am disappointed there has not been a more fundamental fix and address of this issue. I love Excel and Word, have always bought the MS Office suite, but the lack of response to these quite critical issues, ongoing
 now for several months does make projects very difficult and does in my case make the use of Excel almost unworkable.&nbsp; I have sent many reports under the crash reporting process. (I presume all those crash reports are not ignored where ever they go???)&nbsp;&nbsp; With
 these issues not addressed it makes the product "not fit for purpose". At least this is my experience and view.
</p>

Do post back here how my solution works for you. </p>

</p><p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Fonts as cause of other issues and crashes in Office 2011 apps. (Is this your issue?)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c56f0f55-e25e-474c-bd7c-f2e8ff4da767" title="Steve49589">Steve49589</a> this may be your issue???)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since writing the above post I came to the view that 'problem fonts' may be the cause of some of the other issues in Excel I am experiencing.&nbsp; I decided to explore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With reading various posts, it does seem that Mac users experience of Excel or Word crashing or having other issues can quite commonly be caused by the downloading of fonts that Office apps like Excel and Word can not handle. Office apps like Excel and Word
 for most users automatically seek to import all the fonts, including newer user downloaded fonts. Since most people have at some time downloaded some nice creative groovy fonts onto their Mac, this offers explanation for possibly a lot of the crash issues
 Mac users run into. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I encountered was the time involved with current solutions to test and resolve if 'problem fonts' are the cause of issues in Office apps. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I could find, the current offered solution to test for 'problem fonts' is to re-install Office 2011 so one can select in the instal set up, use MS Office standard fonts only.&nbsp; Then test to see if the problems continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the problems with this solution is the time it takes to re-install Office.&nbsp; If one just re-installs Office over the current installation, I am not sure this gives the user the option to have Office only use its standard fonts to enable a test.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To achieve this option effectively, I think one has to do a clean install, which requires first removing all Office 2011 files, then doing a fresh install, entering registration code etc. A further problem here re time is that there is no Office 2011 removal
 tool, like there was for Office 2008. Hence, achieving this kind of full re-install involves identifying all the Office 2011 files in many different places, including some out of the User's account.&nbsp; This is a potentially very long involved process to do right,
 and one possibly beyond some new Mac users. I estimated about a days work. This includes re-installing office and restoring user fonts after you have removed the problem fonts. So that is two re-installs to get back to work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings Mac users struggling with crashes and other issues to a dead end, unless they really have the time to put a day aside to do this, and with no guarantee that 'problem fonts' are in fact the cause of their issue.&nbsp; So it could be all for nothing!&nbsp;
 Very hard to justify when you have deadlines!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Good news - Better test solutions. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have found a quicker way to fairly confidently determine if 'problem fonts' downloaded by you, the user, are the source of your Office 2011 app crashes or issues.&nbsp; The solution I found takes about 30 mins or less, and does not require a reinstalling
 of Office 2011. (Experienced Mac users can probably do it in 10 mins.). It does involve removing your user fonts in the app Font Book for the testing, but you can put them all back afterwards.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is posted in another thread below.&nbsp; The post also comes with a fuller explanation of issues around use of downloaded, less common, fonts, and some more timely ways to identify the problem fonts if indeed this is your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution post is contained in the posts to the Question:&nbsp;Excel 2011 - restore standard fonts only.

<br />
To clarify the situation, please share more detailed information, such as how you saved the document (e.g. from a browser or Office application), and a screenshot where the document is not displayed.<br />
<br />
To access your files offline, you can consider syncing the OneDrive for Business library to the local disk with

<h2>            Remove or delete an email account from Outlook app on ios</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am have been on the phone/chat with Microsoft and Apple trying to figure out how to remove an account from the Outlook iOS app. I use to work for a company and no longer work there. The account is still trying to login and I want to be able to delete it,
 but for some reason the Outlook iOS app does not have that option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done so far is&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have go through all the settings on my iOS phone Mail and Accounts, General...etc. The Outlook account is not there. The app is but there is no settings to remove the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I have spoke with both Apple and Microsoft support, which they have not been able to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; -Apples final solution is just wipe the entire phone, do not restore from backup and manually input everything back in. Contacts, applications, data...etc. I said no way that should not be the only option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Microsoft had me go through all the settings and their finally solution is call Apple there is nothing we can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is what I am trying to do below. You can can see by the screenshots that there is an account listed on the left on my Outlook iOS app. That email account which is the second screenshot I am not able to delete it from the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a simple way to delete it from the app, I am not understanding why this is so hard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else run into this situation and if so were you able to resolve it?</p>
<p>

            Hello Brandon,
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />As already lot of troubleshooting has been done, have you tried to re-install the outlook iOS app and check? it seems that mobile or the app has some kind of cache with your old account details which have not been deleted once you removed the account from the device.
<br />
<br />please try to reinstall the app and see if it works. Please let me know if, you have any other queries. 
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

<p>Hi Parmi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the additional troubleshooting steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) It's not cached in the iOS, I tried that and with Apple Support. For some reason it is stored in the Outlook iOS someone how&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Yeah it was added/Linked to my outlook.com account for *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but because the company disabled my access I can not login to delete the account from the iOS Outlook application. That is where the issue is. Microsoft
 has not configured a way just to delete an account listed that someone can no longer access. From what I have seen you need to be able to login to it and then delete it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) This appears to be an older option because in the settings now of the iOS app you can only get access to the settings of the app of the account you are login into. When I click on settings it will not show me the *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 settings so I can delete the account.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Brandon, 
<br />
<br />as per this article, it says, it is recommended to sign-in but not a necessity. It can be still removed from outlook.live.com from connected mails and deleted from there. 
<br />
<br />Tip: Before you remove a connected account from Outlook.com, we recommend that you sign in to the account via the original email provider and make sure your email messages are there. If they are there, after you remove your account you can delete all the account's email messages from Outlook.com and you'll still have a copy of them at your email provider. If they aren't there, after you remove the connected account, you might want to archive your email messages in a folder in Outlook.com instead of deleting them.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove-a-connected-account-from-outlook-com-0b9a6b95-ff1b-46c1-bf60-d6b3b82c5ac8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove...</a>
<br />
<br />I think, once you can delete the connected account from outlook.live.com from web browser from a laptop, it will not try to sync that account on your iOS device. 
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

<p>Hi Parmi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read through the comments again. The article stats that you need to login to outlook.live.com to be able to remove the account. I do not have access to the account to be able to login to be able to remove it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again remeber this is only for the Outlook iOS app and my iphone because I am not able to login to the account anywhere else desktop/web ...etc. The issue is removing the account from my Outlook iOS app on my iPhone.</p>

            Hi Brandon, 
<br />
<br />I see, my bad. Sorry for the misunderstanding. 
<br />
<br />You have an hotmail.com and your old company account connected to iPhone. Your old company account seems to be an O365 exchange account. 
<br />
<br />If, you Go to Settings (iPhone) &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars. The Accounts screen will open.
<br />i am assuming you will not see your old company account there right?
<br />
<br />Sorry, for the same steps repetition, but could you please share a screenshot of the accounts you see in your settings?
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

<p>There are no accounts there. I haven’t used the accounts on the iPhone for email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above Microsoft support tried all the iPhone settings trying to find the account listed in the iphone setting. But it’s not there. It is stored somewhere in the Outlook iOS app not sure if it’s locally stored or if it’s pulling from Microsoft
 servers and that is why there is no local way in the Outlook iOS app to remove the account.</p>

            Hi Brandon, 
<br />
<br />as you mentioned you have already uninstalled the app and installed it again, it is not getting the account details from the app. it could be somehow stored in the mobile cache, I can't tell. 
<br />
<br />sorry, I am not able to help much here as you have also tried the steps with MS support and there are no accounts visible in the settings of the phone. 
<br />
<br />Did you use Onedrive as well with your old company account? it could be cache entry of that account which some other app is still using? I know it does not make sense, but just a thought. I found below article for something similar.

    <title>UI problem - Win 10 9926 on Dell Venue 8 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            UI problem - Win 10 9926 on Dell Venue 8 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I heard that a Dell Venue 8 Pro was used on stage to demonstrate Win 10 (as I still yet to have time to revisit the 2.5 hours long presentation), but given my normal use in the last two weeks, I found that compared with Win 8.1, currently Win 10 is very
 user unfriendly on my Dell Venue 8 Pro, or maybe it's my problem that I don't know how to use Win 10::</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Login</span></strong></p>
<p>I used password to login a Microsoft Account linked to my Windows. When I touch the password field, a keyboard will pop up which is normal. (p.s. The font of the &amp;123 on the left bottom corner seems to big, therefore the &amp; and the 3 are out of button border
 and are cut away half. This problem doesn't happen after I've login)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if I accidentally touched somewhere else on the screen after the keyboard pop up, the keyboard will hide himself. In Win 8.1 I can simply touch the password field again and the keyboard will pop up again, but not with Win 10. I have no way to get
 the keyboard to pop up again. So far what I can do is to restart Win 10&nbsp;from the right bottom power button so I can touch the password field for the first time again. Am I doing anything wrong? How to call the keyboard out again? (p.s. This problem will gone
 if I've type something in the password field... Weird)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">On-screen Keyboard</span></strong></p>
<p>In non-tablet mode, previously in Win 8.1 when I was using say Metro IE when I touch a field the keyboard will automatically pop up. However since Win 10 get rid of Metro IE (for the time being, maybe), I can only use desktop IE, which when I touch a field
 the keyboard won't pop up. In landscape mode it's still ok, but I usually have to touch the keyboard twice or three times before the keyboard pop up for unknown reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in&nbsp;portrait mode there's a problem. As the taskbar is too short to show the keyboard button on taskbar (nor&nbsp;a any one of&nbsp;the taskbar button because the Cortana search field takes up too many spaces), I can't call out the keyboard by using Charm Bar as
 I was in Win 8.1. Is there a way to do so in Win 10 non-tablet mode just I don't know? Or is there a way to make the Cortana search bar shorten like that in the tablet mode because in Tablet mode I also can't see any task bar icon on it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Metro app&nbsp;top window bar</span></strong></p>
<p>Take Mail as an example as this is where I have the problem.&nbsp;When I swipe top&nbsp;down the&nbsp;Metro app&nbsp;window bar appears, but it won't go&nbsp;no matter where&nbsp;I touch. Sometimes&nbsp;it will suddenly hidden&nbsp;itself, but most of the time (particularly when the app is not
 in full screen mode) it will just sit there and covered&nbsp;the top portion of the screen and&nbsp;part&nbsp;of the&nbsp;back button, reply button etc. If I clicked the control menu, it's worse. It will just sit there and won't go away and covered a portion of the&nbsp;top left corner&nbsp;of
 the window no matter where I touch and whether it's in tablet mode or not. So far I can only get it closed by touching a command in the control menu, or the full screen mode button. Is it also my problem that I don't know how to control the top window bar
 properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Cortana</span></strong></p>
<p>1. How to ask Cortana to save my preference to display weather in Celsius? If I speak she can response properly, but I can't make it save my preference. I've set the same in the Weather app but this doesn't affect Cortana. Anyway to do so?</p>
<p>2. The Cortana understand when I say "Can you display weather in Celsius?" and get me the correct results (current weather in&nbsp;Celsius), but when I&nbsp;typing the same question in, she went to search for this statement. How to tackle this?</p>
<p>2a. When I was typing questions in Cortana, the onscreen keyboard covered the question field i.e. I can't see what I am typing in the field.&nbsp;Anyway to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Start menu</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there a way to call out "All apps" other than touching the small "All apps" words on the bottom left corner of the start menu / screen? I still keep swiping up like that in Win 8.1 when I want to see all apps....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long list of questions. Thanks for answering in advance~</p>

            This is a very well put together post and it mirrors the majority opinion that build 9926 was just not ready to be released as even a preview. It seems the best we can do is just wait and see what MS has in store in the upcoming builds. I for one went
 back to 8.1 on my Asus T100 because Win10 is just too difficult to use on a tablet first device.

            Excellent post. The UI in portrait is a mess. On HP Stream 8, the start menu in particular, is useless in portrait mode.

<p>1.&nbsp;Login to&nbsp;<strong>Outlook.com</strong> through&nbsp;the web browser and click on the
<strong>Gear</strong> icon on the upper-right corner of the outlook.com&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>3. On the left pane, select<strong> Light Version</strong> and check the box for&nbsp;<strong>Use the Light version of Outlook on the web</strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Now, click on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer the picture below.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Onenote sync between desktop and mobile device via a usb connection vs cloud</h2>
                    Is this available via settings in onenote or the only way to sync is being forced to send all information via the web first?

Or close a notebook on your computer (look at its location before that !), move its folder (!) to your USB stick using Windows explorer. Then re-open it from there.<br />

    <title>Dual Partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petert_e16  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Partition</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Win 8.1 (update1) Ideapad Z580. I also have a surface Pro 3. I want to take part in the Windows Insider Programme and install Windows 10 Technical Preview on the Lenovo. I understand I would need about 16GB and have enough space on the hard
 drive. So would I be able to do this by creating a dual partition, install Win 10 on there and still run Win 8.1? If not, I am happy to do a clean install as I will have the Surface to use as my main computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The Windows 8.1 Disk Management app in the Control Panel allows you to shrink partitions non-destructively so you could reduce the space that main drive&nbsp;uses on the IdeaPad and then use the remainder of the space for your dual boot with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install process will setup the boot selection menu for you and of course those options (which OS to boot by default, how long the OS selection menu stays on the screen) can also be modified from System Properties in either Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 TP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This site has a good walk through of the process - http://blog.laptopmag.com/dual-boot-windows-10-preview</p>

    <title>OneNote for Android does not auto-sync in background - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herrherrmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote for Android does not auto-sync in background</h2>
                    <p>Hi, the <a href="https://twitter.com/msonenote/status/662361886017630208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneNote Twitter team</a> sent me here, so I'll post this issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OneNote Android app only syncs when it has started and when I am trying to access my synced notes. It does not sync automatically in the background – that would be a huge improvement though because I don't always want to wait and hope that I've got a
 stable connection to let OneNote sync in just the moment I need my notes. It would be far more practical to keep the notes in sync constantly (the same way Evernote is doing it).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This auto-sync could happen via push (whenever there are updates on the notes from other sources) or periodically every 5 to 120 minutes or maybe daily (should be a user setting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this feature gets implemented soon because it is very tiresome to not be sure whether notes are currently in-sync and up-to-date or need some time to update.</p>

            <p>Android (5.1.1) and the OneNote app are up-to-date and I recently updated/re-installed both – so that's clearly not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt there is auto-sync implemented in the Android app since there are no settings indicating such feature.</p>

<h2>            New start menu in latest tehcnical preview - Windows 8 style only&#63; &#40;From January 23rd preview&#41;</h2>
                    <p>"My" Windows 10 technical preview just updated itself to to the latest version. Nice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu has changed a lot, and I am not yet sure if I like it more than the previous "Windows 7 style". I like the "Expand" function, but I miss the Windows 7 style of the left part of the start meu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the "Start menu" page of "Taskbar and start menu properties", the "Customize" button is greyed out and nothing happens when I click it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to customize the start menu to behave more like it did yesterday (before updating).

            <p>As per my response in a different thread, the latest windows blog (relating to this release) has a clear statement about personalization in the start menu(s) being a work in progress with more to come in future builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not overly pleased with the current state either, but at least they've publicly acknowledged the unfinished state of the menu.</p>

            <p>I was excited about windows 10 until this latest iteration landed on my vm. &nbsp;Something microsoft needs to learn is that the pc's that I manage are not social media consumption devices, ebook readers, facebook game players, etc etc. &nbsp;They are tools to get
 WORK done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had hoped that Microsoft realized the error of their ways when they brought back what I thought was a nice compromise with the TP1 start menu. &nbsp;I guess I should have voiced my opinion when I was pleased with it. &nbsp;Now this vm will just stay shut down until
 you have something better than windows 8.2 to shovel out to the masses. &nbsp;What a disappointment.</p>

            That's the key. They are tools to get work done. If MS is going to pander to those who want social media, readers, games, etc., then it should make things completely customisable, or else provide different windows environments for different purposes. There
 is no way a single configuration is going to please everyone, especially if they want to attract those who use computers for business purposes, so they either make it customisable, provide different configurations, or lose market share. If they're not going
 to continue support for Windows XP and Windows 7, nothing since then really qualifies, and so far, the trend with Windows 10 is towards the "computers as game consoles" and social chit-chat users. Get rid of the silly Metro interface for everyone except those
 who choose it, and only if they choose it. Make a Professional Windows that doesn't pander to that kind of user. And get a bit of imagination. Some people might like the minimal look and the clunky typeface, but don't count me in. I find that Windows 10 is
 going in the same dead-end Metro direction. Giving Windows 10 away free won't help. They'll have to pay me to adopt it, if the deadly Redmond lack of imagination keeps showing itself.<br />

                    <p>In testing the Insider previews I have found that sometimes you stumble across a feature that you never knew existed. For example last night while messing around with the desktop, I found that if you drag a folder to the taskbar it offers to add that folder
 to the File Explorer jump list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you found a hidden feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the problem with hidden features is that users may not aware of them. Almost no one provides manuals and for many of these hidden features there is no visual clue that this feature exists - Look at the back arrow in Edge and why would you guess
 that right-clicking reveals a history jump. Not everyone knows that clicking on the letter in "All Apps" jumps you to that letter in the list of programs.</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />Here is a link that has the information I think you are looking for:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/export-or-import-data-to-another-file-format-6e6e581f-a580-4f04-aa87-9b6552143d9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/export...</a>
<br />
<br />Specifically this information from there:
<br />
<br />
<br />Choose File &gt; Open &gt; Browse.
<br />
<br />(In Project 2010, choose File &gt; Open.)
<br />
<br />In the Files of type box, select the file type that you want to import data from.
<br />
<br />Navigate to the folder that contains the file you want to import, and then select the file in the file list.
<br />
<br />Choose Open.
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions in the Import Wizard to import the data that you want into the proper Project fields.
<br />
<br />On the Task Mapping, Resource Mapping, or Assignment Mapping page of the Import Wizard, verify or edit the mapping assumptions of Project:
<br />
<br />    To import the data from a field in the source file to a different Project field, select the field in the To column, select a new field, and then press ENTER.
<br />
<br />    To change the name of a field in the destination file, select the field in the To column, and then type a new name.
<br />
<br />    To delete a field, select it in the From column, and then choose Delete Row.
<br />
<br />    To insert a new field above another field, select a field in the From column, and then choose Insert Row.
<br />
<br />    To remove all task, resource, or assignment fields from an import map, choose Clear All.
<br />
<br />    To add all task, resource, or assignment fields of the destination file to the import map, choose Add All.
<br />
<br />    Tip: On the Task Mapping, Resource Mapping, or Assignment Mapping page of the Import Wizard, under Preview, you can preview the layout of the import map.
<br />
<br />To change the order of the fields in the destination file, select a field in the To column, and then use the Move buttons to move the field to the position that you want.
<br />
<br />On the last page of the Import Wizard, choose Finish to import your data.

<p>jvidas1,</p>
<p>To start with, you have to be very clear what kind of .xml file you exported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P6 v8.4 is capable of creating a number of different .xml file types - one native to P6 and one for each version of Project - e.g.&nbsp; 2002/3,2007, 2010, and maybe 2013.&nbsp; After confirming a) that the xml is targeted for Project, and b) which version of Project
 is targeted, then you can import the file to that version. (I'd expect to be able to open 2010 and 2013-targeted .xml files in Project 2016, but I can't confirm.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, tom</p>
        </p>

<p>Personally I've given up. P6 v8,11,17 and now 18 have all failed to export a project xml file successfully (fatal error or file unreadable by Project) for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried today exporting in Project 2003, 2010, 2013 and 2016 format. All failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project's format is easily seen and created.</p>

<h2>            Notebooks won&#39;t appear in &#34;My notebooks&#34; section</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing a problem in my organisation : my boss uses OneNote online, and it considers he has no proper notebooks.<br />
He can open many notebooks in the "recent" part, but it can't find anything in "my notebooks", which is strange because we checked and he actually have notebooks stored in the good folder ("notebooks") in his OneDrive storing space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he click on "my notebooks", he gets the error : "We're having trouble getting your documents". It is a real problem because many applications (like rocketbook) need to have access to this section to synchronize to the notebooks and upload files automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is impossible to reproduce the bug for us, so I am asking you if you have a solution.<br />
</p>
<p>The user uses Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS, and his browser is Google Chrome 75.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

</p>
<p>Are yo using an application or through OneNote online? In this case, I would suggest that you log in your Microsoft Account on OneNote online then check if the notebook were visible from there. If the notebooks were still there try accessing your notebook
 on OneNote application. Also, please make sure that you have you a strong internet connection when doing this process.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Sherry,
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the user is using OneNote online. While being logged with his Microsoft account, if he searches he can find his notebooks, like the one named " [username] @ [corporation name]", which are stored in his OneDrive.</p>
<p>But he can open them only from the OneDrive, or from the "recent" part of OneNote and not in the "My notebooks" part. It seems these Notebooks are not considered as "his" notebooks (<a href="https://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2019/29/1/1563190391-microsoftteams-image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a>),
 which is a problem for synchronisation with some applications like rocketbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also an error message when he want to access "my notebooks" from OneNote online on his Iphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected his account on a OneNote application for tests, and we can find his notebooks from his OneDrive, but I didn't see an equivalent of the "my notebooks" part on the application...plus the user does not want the application installed on his computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He is the Informations System Director of my company and he is not a big fan of OneNote, so please help me fix this bug to make him like your products better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>

            I see. Thank you for getting back to us, Yacine. Are you using the same browser when accessing Onenote Online on your phone? When did the issue started? Also, is this a shared notebook or are you the original author? I am not able to see the screenshot
 you provided. Can you try to send it through private message? In this case, can you try to create a new notebook and see if the same issue persist.

<p>My ISD (it's about his use, not mine) is using OneNote as an application on his iPhone, and it doesn't work as well : he can't find his default notebooks in "my notebooks".</p>
<p>It is his original notebooks, they are not shared.</p>
<p>We tried to create a new notebook, and it went the same : it was stored in the right place (the OneDrive "Notebooks" folder), it can be opened with "Recents" but it is not considered as a default notebook, and doesn't appear in "My notebooks".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concerning the screenshot, i went to your profile and I couldn't find how to send you a private message. The function "insert Image" doesn't work as well.</p>
