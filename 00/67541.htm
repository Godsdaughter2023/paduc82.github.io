    <title>Windows 10 update- PDF and no sound problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bartclark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update- PDF and no sound problems</h2>
                    <p>Last night I had some automatic update on Windows. When I turned the computer it took 10 minutes with Microsoft telling me about "new features". The first two "features" are my PDF are being open in Microsoft Edge, why would I want that when I have Adobe
 Professional. I am sure I can find a way to change the default so they open automatically with Adobe... but why should I have to. I didn't ask Microsoft to change this setting on my computer when they did automatic updates. The bigger issue is my computer
 has no sound. I don't have any special sound drivers I have the basic Microsoft "High Definition Audio Device", no my mute is not on... no the sound is not turned down. The computer worked fine even last night as I played Christmas songs on Air1.com &nbsp;Yes I
 tried updating the driver and it said I already had best version. Yes I even restarted my entire computer and still no sound. &nbsp;I can't wait to see what else is broken... thanks Microsoft wish I had stayed with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on my volume icon is says Headphones (High Definition Audio Device) although I don't have headphones plugged in nor do I ever if that makes a difference.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the internal speaker is not working then I suggest you to plug in an external speaker to check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further, I suggest you to run a troubleshooter on the system and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Audio Troubleshooter on the system</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Sound. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your Audio
</span></p>
<p><span>Refer these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X,</strong> select
<strong>Control panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Change the <strong>view by

<h2>            How to fix memory-leaks from unwanted device-driver updates in Windows 10 &#40;&#35;1607&#41;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I have a 2-year-old Lenovo G50-70 laptop...came with 8.1, now has Win-10 (#1607).<br />
<br />
A couple of weeks ago, along with the usual KBnnnnnn (knowlege-base) update(s)<br />
from Microsoft, I also received 6 driver updates labeled as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Intel - Other hardware - Intel Watchdog Timer Driver (Intel WDT)<br />
&nbsp; Intel - Other hardware - Intel Management Engine Interface &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; AMD - Other hardware - PCI bus<br />
&nbsp; Intel - Other hardware - Intel 8 Series LPC Controller - 9C43 &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; Intel - Other hardware - Intel 8 Series PCI Express Root Port #3 - 9C14<br />
&nbsp; Intel - Other hardware - Intel 8 Series PCI Exoress Riit Port #4 - 9C16<br />
<br />
One (or more?) of the above drivers has a non-paged pool MEMORY-LEAK, which<br />
was freezing the desktop-UI (busy-cursor (spinning donut)) was over the taskbar<br />
and mouse clicks would do nothing anywhere!) &nbsp;Thus, I had to hold power-button<br />
down, to shutdown and reboot. &nbsp;This UI-freezing would happen after<br />
every bootup, at about 25-30 minute point. &nbsp;(Running any CPU-intensive app,<br />
such as video transcoding, would hasten the freeze-up significantly.)<br />
<br />
So, after extensive googling and learning, and reproducing the<br />
leaks even in 'safe mode', &nbsp;I used a Recovery ('Reset' keeping user-data)<br />
three times, and was FINALLY able to block all subsequent updates, after<br />
re-installing Windows the third time. &nbsp;To block them, I used the new 'wushowhide'<br />
utility (aka "Show and hide" troubleshooter package) described here:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930<br />
<br />
[ Note: In Win-7, there is a builtin method of disabling updates, but in Win-10,<br />
Microsoft made the *BIG MISTAKE* of removing this ability, so now<br />
the only method is via their special package mentioned in the link above. ]&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This was a very painful and time-consuming problem to find and fix.<br />
(I spent roughly 30-40 hours, before I had achieved a stable system again.)<br />
<br />
Microsoft: &nbsp;Do more THOROUGH testing of this stuff before shoving it down our throats !<br />
<br />
[ I hope this unpleasant experience will help others. ]</p>

            <p>Ok, I thought this issue really WAS 'Resolved', as I said in the subject. &nbsp;But, no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the pool-exhaustion WAS due to one or more of those 6 drivers that I had</p>
<p>put into status of 'do not install' in Windows Update. &nbsp;Things were rock-solid</p>
<p>for over a week, until the next update (KB3200970) came along. &nbsp;I still had</p>
<p>NOT check-marked any of those drivers for installation, because I hadn't narrowed</p>
<p>down which one was the culprit, and I hadn't seen anyone else posting </p>
<p>anywhere with symptoms at all similar to mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, the new rules of Windows Update, here in Windows-10, are being kept</p>
<p>as a 'secret'. &nbsp;In fact, when you use the special 'tool' to flag updates as</p>
<p>"do-not-install", you'd probably never guess that it meant "...until the next</p>
<p>update cycle, when we'll drag those 'held' updates in and just silently</p>
<p>install them for you the next time other new updates get installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And break your system again, if it really WAS one of those drivers that</p>
<p>had a leak.) &nbsp;Bang...oops...your system is freezing...we broke it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wonder whether I was mad and frustrated, you'd be correct!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeez, Microsoft, get a clue! &nbsp;Just put a one-liner into your &nbsp;'wushowhide'</p>
<p>tool, above the list of hidden updates, that says "Installation of hidden updates
</p>
<p>will be re-applied when the next future update is processed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, the story has an extra twist! &nbsp;So, I undo that new&nbsp;KB3200970, but I'm</p>
<p>still seeing pool exhaustion, so I walk thru device manager, and go into</p>
<p>each of those six drivers, expecting that 'Roll Back Driver' button will be</p>
<p>armed. &nbsp;Wrong again. &nbsp;Anger flares again! &nbsp;No way to undo the damage</p>
<p>caused by (presumable) re-installation of those drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say 'presumable' because when new DRIVERS come along in the</p>
<p>updates, the do NOT get put in the list that shows the KBnnnnnnn</p>
<p>updates that were installed. &nbsp;(I guess they don't want us to be able</p>
<p>to see/debug what has gone wrong.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, maybe since 'Roll Back Driver' option wasn't armed, maybe they</p>
<p>did NOT install any of those 6 drivers. &nbsp;So, with that as a possibility,</p>
<p>I did a fresh reboot, and then once again fired up the MEMORY </p>
<p>display of Task Manager, and watched the leaking as it progressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had NOT started any of my own programs, so the system was</p>
<p>mostly idle...only the background system tasks were going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The leaks seemed to be happening each time I also saw some</p>
<p>activity in the wifi-interface. so I disabled its driver, and</p>
<p>sure enough...the visible leaking stopped!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, no newer wifi driver had been installed. So, finally, as a last</p>
<p>resort, I did a complete REMOVAL of the wifi-driver, planning</p>
<p>to then do an automatic-search and see if maybe mine was</p>
<p>'corrupted' or whatever. &nbsp;(Sigh...now the wifi-device had</p>
<p>disappeared, so there was no way to navigate to it, to</p>
<p>do the search for its driver via the device manager.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got lucky here. &nbsp;I happened to see the option in device</p>
<p>manager to 'scan for hardware changes', and doing that</p>
<p>caused the wifi-device to reappear, so I installed its</p>
<p>driver. &nbsp;(It installed the same driver as I had before. I</p>
<p>knew this, because I had jotted down the date and version</p>
<p>number of the one in place before I did the removal.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result: &nbsp;(another surprise!) &nbsp;I didn't expect this</p>
<p>to solve the problem, but it did. &nbsp;The leak was gone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I rebooted, and did some more testing. &nbsp;Yes, rock-solid</p>
<p>again. &nbsp;And, I remained rock solid for at least another</p>
<p>full week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[But, can you believe this??? &nbsp;After a week or 10 days</p>
<p>of rock-solid, yesterday I had another of these desktop</p>
<p>freezes...had to hold-down power button and reboot.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, this one freeze-event seems to be a "lone wolf".</p>
<p>I can't reproduce it, and it hasn't happened again, in</p>
<p>the last day or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: &nbsp; In all honesty, I can't explain why I have</p>
<p>not just said "I don't need any more of this happy horsesh*t"</p>
<p>and installed one of my favorite Linux distros over the</p>
<p>top of Windows-10. &nbsp;I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.</p>
<p>Now, I'm curious just how many MORE chapters to this</p>
<p>horror movie there will be. &nbsp;And, I'm considering it a&nbsp;</p>
<p>bit of a challenge to see whether my patience and skills</p>
<p>will be up to the task of finding/fixing the next</p>
<p>pool-exhaustion. &nbsp;So, I'm gonna play along some</p>
<p>more, before I treat Win-10 as I did to Windows-Vista</p>
<p>( i.e. abandon it and go back and use Linux for another </p>
<p>5-year stint).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>Wow...this story keeps getting weirder and weirder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, during the last week, this laptop ran near perfectly. &nbsp;[Well, actually,</p>
<p>there were maybe two 'isolated' events where the desktop froze and</p>
<p>I had to hold-down power button and reboot. But, those were bearable,</p>
<p>because they were few and far between.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then, this past Sunday, iirc, this same freezing desktop began</p>
<p>happening again. &nbsp;This time it was the worst it ever had been, in that</p>
<p>a fresh bootup would only last maybe 2 or 3 minutes before the</p>
<p>desktop froze. &nbsp;( I could feel it coming...mouse-clicks would behave</p>
<p>strangely, but within another 30 seconds, it would freeze solid. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, this time, the root cause seemed different. &nbsp;I was able to</p>
<p>get the task-manager up, to watch memory-pools (expecting</p>
<p>to see the nonpaged pool usage count up, from some memory</p>
<p>leak, as before). &nbsp;No, the pools were fine...yet the desktop was still</p>
<p>freezing. &nbsp;And, this time, unlike the clear memory leaks of the prior</p>
<p>week(s), when I booted into 'safe-mode', the freezes still happened !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now wondering if maybe there have been two different</p>
<p>but related bugs...earlier memory leaks (from drivers other than</p>
<p>the graphics driver) and also a desktop freezing due to a bug</p>
<p>in the graphics driver. &nbsp;(Because there HAVE been reports from</p>
<p>others over the past six or more months, with very similar</p>
<p>symptoms. &nbsp;The conclusion in those cases has been that</p>
<p>they were caused by faulty graphics drivers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once again, I did the 'Recovery' thing, and spent about an</p>
<p>hour watching Windows-10 get re-installed. Bottom line was</p>
<p>that after all that, upon the first boot, once I logged in, I quickly</p>
<p>learned that the freezing was still happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ For the record, this was the 5th time in total, that I have</p>
<p>re-installed Win-10 via the 'recovery' option. &nbsp;] &nbsp;During an</p>
<p>earlier episode, I had taken the time to build a bootable</p>
<p>DVD of Windows PE (Pre-installation environment), so I</p>
<p>booted up that DVD, and did a more thorough backup of</p>
<p>some more data files, to an external USB-connected 'Passport'</p>
<p>drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I've been spending a 'cool-down' period, using my</p>
<p>'plan-B' laptop (a nice Acer ChromeBook 13), which</p>
<p>can do maybe 80% of the work that I do with a laptop.</p>
<p>[So far, I'm still fighting off the urge to just wipe the</p>
<p>disk on the Windows-10 laptop and install Linux. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, stay tuned, for the (last?) chapter in this saga. &nbsp;I'm</p>
<p>almost ready to make a final decision in how to</p>
<p>resolve this issue.<br />

<h2>            &#34;defaultuser0&#34; created on clean install of Anniversary Update</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p>Hello community,<br />
<br />
Yesterday I performed a clean install of my Windows 10 laptop (64-bit, Pro version) to get the Anniversary Update (#1607). I reformatted the partitions and everything, and went through the OOBE without any problems. But when I logged in with my local user account
 I noticed something very strange: Under C:/ Users/ there is now an additional user profile called "defaultuser0." I tried doing another format followed by a clean install, and again it was there.<br />
<br />
Now here is where it gets really weird. I decided to go back to the previous version of Windows 10 (#1511) and again did a full format with clean install, using the Windows Media Creation tool I made a few months ago. It installs fine, but when I log in, guess
 what I see? This darn "defaultuser0" account! This was never here before. And yet, it somehow survives the whole process. Now today I have gone back and once again formatted the partitions of my laptop and have clean installed the Anniversary Update (#1607).
 STILL THERE...<br />
<br />
What causes this? I am completely at a loss. I have spent well over a dozen hours trying to figure this out, and I have even called Microsoft's Tech Support, but so far I haven't found a satisfactory answer. I can still log in and use my laptop, but the rights
 and permissions on some folders belongs to this "defaultuser0" which is why I want to eliminate it. The whole purpose of a clean install is to avoid issues such as these. I did some research on Google, and have only found one or two results in German written
 by the user "M.Ziegler" but even these don't really solve the problem. A few users give some tips on how to delete the account through editing the registries and whatnot, but that's not really what I want. I know that one cannot simply erase every single trace
 of an account once it is created, and so I am trying instead to find a way to prevent it in the first place. How and why is it created? Am I just stuck with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, can somebody help me? I thank you in advance!<br />
<br />
UPDATE on August 5th, 2016: This appears to be a bug which is only affecting some users. I spent more time testing it today, and even after deleting the account keys from the registry (as someone had suggested below) and completely removing "defaultuser0",
 it comes back is you ever run the DISM command string "Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth". What this seems to imply that this is actually a problem with the ESD/ISO, where it treats this as necessary even though it obviously isn't. Hopefully somebody
 will have a REAL answer for me soon.<br />
<br />
UPDATE on August 6th, 2016: Microsoft's Level Two Technical Support called me back today. But even the elevated tech support staff has no clue on what causes this issue. The man I spoke to told me that because build 1607 is brand new, their manual doesn't have
 any details on this issue yet. Apparently they're researching the problem, but it could be weeks before a solution is found and put into their manual. I'll continue to post updates here when I have them.<br />
<br />
UPDATE on August 27th, 2016: A quick shout out to the user "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6723c6e0-be1a-44b1-bf07-0cfb865dce73" title="ChristopherButterfield"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">ChristopherButterfield</span></a>", who in the comments
 below posted this link: <em>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/3e7d85e3-d0e1-4e79-8141-0bbf8faf3644/windows-10-anniversary-update-the-case-of-the-mysterious-account-sid-causing-the-flood-of-dcom?forum=win10itprosetup</em> While the link unfortunately
 does not contain a fix for the issue, it does highlight some aspects that I had previously missed, and thus confirms my suspicions that this "defaultuser0" negatively impacts system performance. Of particular note is an invalid SID that seems to be linked
 to defaultuser0: "...almost all the core components, have an Unknown Account with SID&nbsp;<em>S-1-15-3-1024-1065365936-1281604716-3511738428-1654721687-432734479-3232135806-4053264122-3456934681" and, "</em>All the core system COM objects seem to have this Unknown
 SID. And it seems that's the source of all the DCOM errors in the event logs." which is referring to&nbsp;Event ID 10016. More updates to come.<br />
<br />
UPDATE on August 29th, 2016: I spoke to a man named Jeffrey today, who is another one of Microsoft's Level Two Technical Support staff. &nbsp;Unfortunately, there are still no known resolutions for this issue. I allowed him to remote access my laptop so I could
 show him exactly what I'm dealing with, and he made detailed notes which he promised would be passed along to Microsoft's technical engineers. He scheduled me for a callback on September 7th, and hopefully their team will have discovered a resolution for this
 error by that time. That's all for now. <strong>And please, if you have this same issue, click the "Me too" button, so they can see that it's affecting a lot of us and that it's worth their time to fix!<br />
<br />
</strong>UPDATE on September 9th, 2016: Microsoft's Level Two Tech Support staff called me back on the 7th, as promised. However, the woman I spoke to was very dismissive and seemed to not know what I was talking about. As far as I can tell, nothing had been
 done. She told me to go see a specialist at the local Microsoft store, so I made an appointment for the following day so I could physically meet with one of their staff. So yesterday (the 8th) I went in and explained everything to "Andy B." and showed him
 exactly what was going on. He did a clean install with their own ISO, and surprise surprise, there was the dreaded defaultuser0. On a hunch, he went to go check something in the back. As it turns out, they have it on their OWN computers also; they just didn't
 realize it! With this knowledge in hand, he promised he would submit a full bug report using their own Microsoft Insights forum. Apparently, this is how they are able to communicate directly with Microsoft's software developers. Hopefully a patch will come
 from this, but who knows. The fact that Microsoft's own staff have this on their computers might encourage them to fix it sooner.&nbsp;More updates when I have them.<br />
<br />
UPDATE on March 29th, 2017: My apologies for the long absence. To those of you who asked,
<em>yes</em>, I eventually did just give up. I've had personal concerns to deal with, such as having to relocate to a new city and the death of a family member, and those things took priority. And honestly, I became so invested in trying to solve this issue,
 that it made me miserable and I had to stop for my own sanity. On the positive side, I've read that this issue should be resolved in the next major update, which is coming on April 11th, 2017. However, I haven't seen or heard
<em>official </em>confirmation of this, so I would appreciate it if anybody could confirm this information from an official source. Additionally, I would love to know if this fix will be applied regardless of whether we upgrade to the Creator's Update from
 within the Windows Activation menu (that is, if we choose to keep all our files and programs), or if we will be forced to once again perform a complete clean install in order for the fix to really take effect. Thanks.</p>

            Thanks, but this isn't the solution I'm looking for. First of all, this doesn't get rid of it completely. If you go to command line and type "net user" this "defaultuser0 still appears. You also completely ignored my primary questions, which are: "Why
 is this account being created" and most importantly, "How can I prevent this account from being created in the first place"? I would appreciate it if somebody &nbsp;could answer these questions. This problem never occurred before the anniversary update.

            <p>I am getting this also. Even on a clean Anniversary install. I have managed to permanently delete it but It also leaves "unknown Account SID's in certain permisssions in the Registry. Everyone will have these leftovers even if you delete Defaultuser0.</p>

<p>Hello community,<br />
<br />
Yesterday I performed a clean install of my Windows 10 laptop (64-bit, Pro version) to get the Anniversary Update (#1607). I reformatted the partitions and everything, and went through the OOBE without any problems. But when I logged in with my local user account
 I noticed something very strange: Under C:/ Users/ there is now an additional user profile called "defaultuser0." I tried doing another format followed by a clean install, and again it was there.<br />
<br />
Now here is where it gets really weird. I decided to go back to the previous version of Windows 10 (#1511) and again did a full format with clean install, using the Windows Media Creation tool I made a few months ago. It installs fine, but when I log in, guess

What causes this? I am completely at a loss. I have spent well over a dozen hours trying to figure this out, and I have even called Microsoft's Tech Support, but so far I haven't found a satisfactory answer. I can still log in and use my laptop, but the rights
 and permissions on some folders belongs to this "defaultuser0" which is why I want to eliminate it. The whole purpose of a clean install is to avoid issues such as these. I did some research on Google, and have only found one or two results in German written

<p>Hi Steven, </p>
<p>In the future please do not post personal information on these forums, as these are public.
</p>
<p>I am sorry you're having this issue with updating your phone number. The error you're getting is due to account protection. In witch, the system limits the amount of changes such as Phone numbers on the account to protect you. If you try to change it to
 quickly, the system recognizes that and limits the change to a time frame. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no direct way of escalating the time to change your phone number on file for your Security profs. If you would like, you may contact Xbox Support (
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a> ), and have them create a case for you to have it escalated to the Advocacy team if found eligible, who do have access to change account information/system
 information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

            <p>Sachin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; Neither option worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further detail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the UPDATING WINDOWS screen Coping Files completes.&nbsp; INSTALLING FEATURES AND DRIVERS gets to the 23% number, which is 40% of the UPDATING WINDOWS operation and I get the error :&nbsp; 0xC1900101-0x30018&nbsp; "The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase
 with an error during SYSPREP operation".&nbsp; Further investigation provides "NVIDIA driver update for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 550Ti failed install on 2/9/16."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest NVIDIA graphics driver install.&nbsp; Is it possible that the error is caused by Windows trying to install an older driver?&nbsp; Can this part of the installation be bypassed?&nbsp; The driver I have installed is working fine.&nbsp; Do I need to wait for
 the next major release?&nbsp; I am not willing to try to remove the new driver for NVIDIA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Thank you for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: found no issues.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Method 2:&nbsp; I have not had a chance to try due to its complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may not be with the Nvidia drive.&nbsp; Is there a way to determine which driver is causing the issue?&nbsp; When the computer restores after the failed attempt, the Ethernet connection does not seem to work at first, but since I also have wireless, the
 wireless connects.&nbsp; After a re-start or two the Ethernet (Realtek USB GBE Family Controller) works.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 doesn&#39;t recognize display driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dougewell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t recognize display driver</h2>
                    My desktop machine has an Acer S200HL LCD display with native resolution of 1600 × 900. The existing driver worked fine with Windows 7, 8, and 8,.1. When I installed 10, this driver was replaced by the generic non-PnP driver, where 1600 × 900 is not an
 option. Windows won't let me install a driver from the folder on my disk, insisting that the generic driver is the best fit. Acer doesn't seem to have any drivers for this monitor, which they still sell, on their site. Right now I'm slumming at 1024 × ​768.
 Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the same drivers which&nbsp;was&nbsp;working with the previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to uninstall the generic drivers then install the drivers what is available from the manufacturing sites.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 drivers available, you can download it and place the driver in compatibility&nbsp; mode&nbsp; and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow this link below: </p>

            <p>I found a way to fix this if your computer has the AMD Catalyst Control Center.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>1. Open the Device Manager (right click on Start-Icon in left corner)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Then click Display Adapters and click your display card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click on "Search for a driver on the computer" (second entry)</p>
<p>4. Click "Select driver from list"&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Pick the newest one you have</p>
<p>6. Restart your computer and it should work.....mine did</p>
<p>

</p><p>It is NavyLCDR's Post......the second from the bottom if it doesn't bring you there automatically...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When the AMD Catalyst Control Center works go under My Digital Flat Panels and from there to Scaling Options......scale it as needed</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps!</p>

<h2>            LG PC Suite iv Not Responding</h2>
                    <p>I have LG PC Suite iv on my Pc - however the programme has become unresponsive - When activating the programme it just hangs and does not open. I have tried removing and reinstalling the programme, plus using compatibility mode &nbsp;Windows 8, plus increasing
 the Cache, &nbsp;I have also tried fixing any DLL corrupted files and completed a clean boot, I have even tried stopping my anti virus checker to see if this was causing the problem (defender virus checker) &nbsp;but still the programme is unresponsive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently found out that&nbsp;Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. It states The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39) - Tried to reinstall driver but get the same message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Window 10, with</p>

<h2>            Green Screen of Death</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>my Xbox One won't start. It gets to the Xbox logo loading screen with the three dots. At that point it's just loading and loading. I've tried that user comment, where I had to download a patch, put it on an USB device, put it in the USB port, hold BIND and
 EJECT, turn the Xbox on and wait till the sound of boot comes up twice. It's just ringing once, then a screen with an Xbox and a loading bar appears and the turn-off sound rings. After that, there's an error screen and it turns off. Don't know what to do,
 please help!</p>

<p>I am running into the same issue. I have tried the hard boot, the pulling the power letting the pcu discharge and the &nbsp;emergency offline update but still hit the same screen. I have been hitting this since Friday, is there a fix in the near future.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The title pretty much describes my issue: I'd like to install the Movie Maker from Essentials Package 2012. The installer would like to update my Live Mail from 2011 to 2012, which I don't like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Short answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't possible. If you update Windows Essentials, all components are changed to the 2012 versions. It isn't possible to do a piecemeal installation.</p>

</p><p><span>I understand that you are trying to install Movie Maker from Windows Essentials 2012. You have to first uninstall the Live Mail 2011 or update to 2012&nbsp;before you go ahead with installation of Movie Maker as suggested by

            Hi wals4
<br />Greetings! I am Andrew M, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Send Email command can be found by clicking on File &gt; Share &gt; E-mail, by then Windows attach your current file to an e-mail using Microsoft Outlook as long as you have it configured as your default e-mail software manager. Now, as you claim that you can't close Microsoft Word until you perform that action, I can recommend  you to switch a new message first (new Outlook e-mail) and either you can send or close the message. 
<br /> 
<br />If you try to quit or exit Microsoft Word before sending your email with the Word document attachment, you will receive this error. To send your email, ensure Microsoft Word is still open in the background.
<br />
<br />Any further doubts you might have, please let me know.
<br />Best regards,
        </p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>From where did you download the Windows 7?</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have access to any other computer at home?</span></p>
<p><span>You can use Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool through which you can create an image on a DVD and then use it for installation.</span></p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, version 1511, 10586 - Error 0x800703ed in dual boot system</h2>
                    <p>I currently run Windows 7 and Opensuse 13.2 on separate drives in a dual boot environment. I want to upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10 and tried the following procedures:</p>
<p>1. Selected Upgrade in place which downloaded the installation, ran it which started, went through checking for updates, started checking PC and gave an error "Something happened. Sorry, we're having trouble determining if your PC can run Windows 10. Please
 close setup and try again". Trying again gets the same error. The system log shows an error for WindowsUpdateClient "Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x800703ed: Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, version 1511,10586".</p>
<p>2. Downloaded the Media Creation Tool, ran it and put the install on a USB drive. Ran setup from the USB, which started, went through checking for updates, started checking PC and gave the same error as 1 above.
<br />
3. I then ran the Media Creation Tool again and created an ISO installation DVD. When I mounted the DVD, ran the setup within it, I got the same results - errors.<br />
3. I then rebooted the machine from the DVD which started a setup then displayed:<br />
&nbsp;"The computer started using the Windows installation media. Remove the installation media and restart your computer so that Windows starts normally. Then, insert the installation media and restart the upgrade. [Do not select |Custom {[advanced]| to perform
 an upgrade. |Custom [advanced] installs a new copy of Windows and deletes your programs and settings]"<br />
I removed the DVD, restarted the machine, mounted the DVD, ran the setup inside the DVD and got the same results as 1 and 2 above.<br />
I have spent days reading other threads, trying diagnostic tools but no joy. I've run out of options. What can I do next other than pay for a fresh install rather than an upgrade?</p>

            Problem solved. I disabled all but the Windows hard drive (I run dual boot), ran the install which got past the 0x800703ed error but then got another Something Happened error. It said "We can't tell if your PC has enough space to continue installing Windows
 10". After trying a number of suggested fixes that didn't work, I booted with a System Rescue disk, told it I wanted to repair, it found a problem with Windows Startup, fixed it, I rebooted, ran the upgrade from a USB and it ran to end. I have to do some configuration
 cleanup but I've now got a functional system.

<h2>            &#34;It looks like someone else is using your account&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have had my Xbox account setup with my work email and phone number ever since i have had an Xbox. I have recently changed jobs so updated my phone number and email address which is linked to my account to my new email and phone number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since doing this when i log into my xbox it says "someone else might be using your account" and says fix it now which just offers to send an email with a verification code to my old email which i don't have access to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the xbox support line and they said that it was due to critical safety information being changed on my account (me updating my email and phone number) and i needed to wait 30 days until my new email and phone number would be accepted. Only then
 would i be able to log into my account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this? I can't understand how my account with my information, credit card and every one of the games i have bought has now locked me out because i updated my information, and i need to wait 30 days before i can use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What frustrates me the most is the only reason i changed my email and phone number, is because i just bought Battlefield V and thought i better update my details otherwise i may lose a $100 game because I'm locked out of my account. Turns out Microsoft does
 that for you anyway. Should of just left it alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've changed my email address and phone number without being locked out from my account. Maybe it is the way you did it, IIRC, I added my new contact info and verified them before removing the old ones. Have you tried going to the web site to check and/or

<p>[...]</p>
<p>I'm locked out of my account. Turns out Microsoft does that for you anyway. Should of just left it alone.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This only happens, if you didn't have security info on your account (i.e. a phone number or secondary email), or don't have access to the existing security info to confirm ownership or the change of security info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft were able to send you the verification code for the change to a working email or phone number that was present on the account before you changed emails and phone numbers, then the change would have been done immediately after you could confirm
 the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For security reasons, if *all* your security proofs are changed, and the old ones aren't confirmed, Microsoft will stall this change for 30 days. Just imagine the following scenario: A hacker got access to your Microsoft Account, but does not have access
 to your phone or secondary email. They add their own phone and email, to be able to recover your account eventually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will get a message to your email informing you of the change. Unless you confirm that change, the hacker is still unable to use his own security information to completely take over your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you might be on vacation or other reasons prevent you from immediately reacting on that change, the 30 day waiting period is there to hinder account hijacking. So you'll get a full month of time to act against a hacker taking over your account.
</p>
<p>Since this is all automatic, the only way the computer system can differentiate you from a hacker is by confirming your old security info. Also, in the past the support agents were (ab-)used by account hijackers that wanted to speed up the take over, so
 the support can't help you speeding up the change, otherwise they might also be helping a hacker to hijack your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for future changes: Make sure that you still have access to your "old" security information,
<strong>before</strong> you add new security info. That way your changes will be immediate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I'd recommend you enable Two Step Verification and set up the free Authenticator App on your smartphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That way you have a third way to authenticate yourself to the service and make security changes on your account more immediate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set up and change the Two Step Verification setting at <a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
