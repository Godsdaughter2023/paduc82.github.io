<h2>            Controle do Xbox One fica desconectando do PC enquanto estou jogando via cabo usb padr&#227;o.</h2>
                    <p><strong>[Title - Translation] - Xbox One Control gets disconnected from the PC while I'm playing via standard usb cable.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meu controle fica desconectando enquanto jogo no PC via cabo USB padrão. Tem horas que consigo jogar com certa dificuldade, mas tem horas que nem jogar eu consigo, desconecta de 5 em 5 segundos. Já troquei o cabo várias vezes, e cada cabo funcionou até que
 bem nas primeiras horas de jogo, mas depois deram o mesmo problema, sem falar que também parece que alguns simplesmente perderam a funcionalidade, "estragaram". Já verifiquei se tem atualização no controle e também verifiquei os drivers, parece tudo certo.
 Qual o problema???</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Edit - Translation] - <span>My control gets disconnected while playing on the PC via the standard USB cable.</span></strong>
<strong><span>There are hours that I can play with some difficulty, but there are hours that I can not even play, disconnects every 5 seconds.</span></strong>
<strong><span>I've changed the cable several times, and each cable worked until well in the first few hours of play, but then gave the same problem, not to mention that it also seems that some simply lost functionality, "spoiled."</span></strong>
<strong><span>I already checked if there is an update in the control and also checked the drivers, it seems all right. What's the problem ???</span></strong></p>

<p>Olá Pedro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Você tem disponibilidade de outro controle para testar no seu pc? (Tipo, emprestado de algum amigo, etc.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Se não for possível testar outro controle em seu pc, você ainda pode utilizá-lo sem fio. Se seu controle for das versões Xbox One S ou Xbox One X, você pode conectá-los sem fio através do bluetooth. Se for da primeira geração do xbox one, é necessário um
 adaptador.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Espero ter ajudado.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-[Translation - <span>Hi Pedro, Do you have availability of another control to test on your pc? (Type, borrowed from a friend, etc.) If you can not test another control on your pc, you can still use it wirelessly. If your control is of

<p>Hello Pedro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We appreciate all of the troubleshooting that yo have tried out already. There are a few factors to take into account here. It is possible that the micro USB port on your controller is damaged. Have you tested
 other controllers on your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB port on your PC could also be causing this issue. Have you tested out different USB ports on your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results!</p>

            <p>Hello Tom or Pat!</p>
<p>You've discovered a long-standing problem with Windows 7. To fix this, I recommend a program called FileMenu Tools. You can download the freeware portable version from&nbsp;here:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/System/System-Enhancements/FileMenu-Tools-Portable.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">
 http://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/System/System-Enhancements/FileMenu-Tools-Portable.shtml</font></a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After downloading and installing the program you'll notice that by&nbsp;default every option is checked. I'd be a lot more selective about it, otherwise your right-click menu will be a full page long! When the main window opens you'll see a list on the right-hand
 side&nbsp;of all the items that can be added to the right-click menu. Start weeding through the list and take out all the one's you
<em>don't</em> need by <em><strong>un</strong></em>checking the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you're done making your choices (de-selections) make sure you click the green checkmark in the row of icons in the top left-hand window&nbsp;of the interface to "Apply" your choices. The program can do much more, but that answers your specific question.
 I'm told the program has a good help file, so try there if you're interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            <p>Hi Ruosen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) When exactly do you get this error? Is it at the startup after booting the computer?</p>
<p>2) If this issue has started recently, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>3) Did you update to Windows 8.1 or is it a brand-new computer that came with Windows 8.1 preinstalled?</p>
<p>4) If you have updated to Windows 8.1 from a previous Windows operating system, then did you install all the latest drivers for all the devices on the computer from the Lenovo website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and let us know the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 1: Run an SFC Scan</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us first run an SFC Scan to check if this is caused by any corrupted or damaged system files on the computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The “<strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong>” command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from that menu.</p>
<p>b) On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, you may refer to the article given below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</em></strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn’t help, then let us check if this issue is caused by any third party software conflicts on the computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Thread 2: Check the issue in Safe Mode and perform a Clean Boot.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 1: Boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In Windows, we can start the computer in different advanced troubleshooting modes to find and fix problems on the PC. One of such troubleshooting mode is Safe Mode. Here we start Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. Please refer to the steps
 given in this article to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</em></strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not occur in safe mode, then you may boot the computer back to the normal mode and perform a clean boot to check if it is caused by any software conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2: </em></strong><strong><em><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<strong><em>How to perform a clean boot</em></strong>” and follow the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows
 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” given in the
 section “<strong><em>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</em></strong>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above
 link.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the troubleshooting results.</span>

<h2>            Someone else has linked a profile to my account</h2>
                    
<p>So as usual, it is litteraly impossible to contact microsoft for support, as their support submission page crashes, in 8 years I have never actually been able to contact them, thanks for treating your loyal customers so well Microsoft.</p>
<p>Somone has created a new xbox live profile and linked it to my microsoft account, so I am receiving emails regarding their purchases etc. &nbsp;What I am really worried about is how this person was able to create a profile and link it to my microsoft account,
 as I have one (based on my hotmail address, which as far as I know technically doesn't exist anymore) and one (based on my outlook address) that both link to my gmail account as an alt, they can theoretically pull my CC and other info.</p>
<p>So A) How the hell could microsoft left this happen and</p>
<p>B) how do you un-associate a gamer tag with a microsoft account? &nbsp;I dont' need to receive the billing info for this person and have personal skype contacts and CC info stored in this account, while they cannot possibly have my password, the fact they were
 able to associate their account to it means I am less than convinced microsofts security won't allow them to see it anyway, and charge to it.</p>
<p>So if anyone has an idea on how to actually get a hold of this company that would be great.</p>

<p>EDIT: My actual gamer tag is op3peat, I have no idea how PursuedPants85 or whatever it is linked to my microsoft account.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Tried looking up the billing / profile info for PursuedPants184 that is associated with my microsoft account and SURPRISE the billing page is down, what the hell.</p>

<h3> trevorgmail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba Laptop loops to startup repair</h2>
                    One day after leaving my Toshiba Satellite laptop running Windows update with the lid closed overnight, I woke up to find the screen grey, with no mouse pointer or anything else, forcing me to have to turn off my laptop by holding the power button. After
 this, Every time I rebooted my laptop it would go directly to startup repair with no results. I have both Windows and Ubuntu installed on my computer so there is an eight second pause between the BIOS and booting into Windows, where normally I could press
 F8 for advanced boot options; now when I do this, pressing F8 will bring my laptop directly to startup repair. It would claim to have fixed the problem, saying the following;

</div>
<div>I had created a Ubuntu image on a USB drive so I was able to back up all my files to an external hard drive through this.</div>
<div>I had a Windows repair disc (not the instillation disc because my computer did not come with one) through which I tried running the bootrec.exe commands. However, running /FixBoot, /ScanOS, or /RebuildBcd will say something about completing successfully
 and then it will say that it found 0 Windows&nbsp;installations. Just to make sure, I scanned my computer for viruses using Norton bootable recovery, which returned my computer as being clean and virus free. After that, I booted with the windows repair disc again
 and used the command prompt to do these commands, as stated on this website&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392</a></div>

<div><span>Nothing appeared any different so I restored the BCD files from the backup I had made. However, this gave me an even worse error about not being able to verify the digital signature of something and pressing enter to continue booting, which I pressed.
 This brought me to the select operating system screen, where I selected Windows 7 which only brought me back to the previous screen. Once again, I tried using the repair CD, this time selecting to restore to a restore point. When doing this, it will say that
 is restoring then briefly echoing that the operation completed successfully before telling me that the restore point is missing or corrupt and that I can try another restore point. I tries multiple, all giving me the same error. Like I said, I have all my
 files backed up so if i needed to use Toshiba recovery options to restore my computer to its out of box state, but I would prefer to avoid that if at all possible. Sorry this is so lengthy but I wanted to report everything. Please help if you can!</span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Do you remember the name of the update, which may have caused this issue?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to go through startup repair and successfully boot to the desktop. Once at the desktop, restart your computer and select Last Known Good Configuration.</p>

            If you are gonna run it in a virtual machine, VMWare Workstation would be recommended and a copy of Windows XP. VMWare seems to have the best 3D support, especially for a game as old as Halo CE. VirtualBox is a bit buggy based on my research. You can always download trial versions to see how they work.

    <title>Unable to reset&#47;use PIN after HDD swap - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris_allennc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to reset&#47;use PIN after HDD swap</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix another unrelated issue, my IT team swapped out my laptop's HDD with another laptop of the same make/model. After this occurred I am unable to enter my PIN whenever it is requested. For example, the Mail app is now requesting it for confirmation to
 "Fix account", the Store app requests my PIN to install or update apps... etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all posted recommendations to correct this to no avail as I cannot enter my "original PIN". The following is the only "error" message that I have been able to receive beyond the "Please try later" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52adfca1-0669-4c94-9243-caab75fd27ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52adfca1-0669-4c94-9243-caab75fd27ba" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure this is because I have swapped my HDD out with another computer but unfortunately no longer have access to the old device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to reset my PIN using other authentication methods&nbsp;besides entering my current PIN or reinstalling Windows?</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

            You can try performing a repair upgrade, yes, this technically reinstalling Windows 10, but it should repair permission issues while preserving your personal files, apps and settings.

    <title>Teredo Tunneling Adapter is missing&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwiersma1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Teredo Tunneling Adapter is missing&#33;</h2>
                    So for the longest time I've been having issues on the Xbox app with getting continuously disconnected due to Teredo not being able to qualify. I have searched through forums high and low to try and fix it; which only made me discover that the Teredo driver
 isn't even installed on my computer. after discovering this i have spent numerous hours trying an insanely large number of fixes from forums I've seen and my driver is still no where to be found. The only thing i can think of is that i don't know what programs
 might be interfering with Teredo and force hiding it (even with viewing hidden devices in the manager). Any form of help would be greatly appreciated!

<p>
</p><p>In regards of this matter, please try the following:<br />
<br />
<span>1. Open </span><strong>Command Prompt (Admin).<br />
</strong><span>2. Type the following command to verify the Teredo state.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>netsh interface teredo show state</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. If the state displays </span><strong>client</strong><span> or
</span><strong>dormant</strong><span>, means that Teredo is working normally. If the state displays
</span><strong>Offline</strong><span>, then give the following command to enable Teredo on your machine:</span><br />
<br />
<span>netsh interface teredo set state type=enterpriseclient</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. </span><strong>Restart</strong><span> your computer.</span></p>

<p>You can also try performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Begin by typing “msconfig” in the Cortana Search Box and then click on MSConfig (Run Command)<br />
Or on your keyboard press the Windows + R key at the same time and type Msconfig in the run window, then click on OK or hit enter.<br />
2. Now choose Selective Start-up<br />
3. Remove the check from Load Startup Items<br />
4. Click on the Services tab<br />
5. Check “Hide all Microsoft Services” and then click on Disable All<br />
6. Click on Apply and then on OK.<br />

    <title>Add the ability to tag clips in Movie Maker 2012 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrykav  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add the ability to tag clips in Movie Maker 2012</h2>
                    I was very frustrated to find out that I can't tag, title or otherwise add some descriptor to film clips. &nbsp;How can I keep all the different clips I use organized if I can't store some description about them? &nbsp;A little simple meta data attached to clips,
 pictures, etc., would be enormously helpful to organizing and assembling my movies.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This isn't a question, really, but wanted to post this with the hopes that MS might see this and appreciate the need to include something like this in their next version.</div>

            <p>Apparently the place to provide feedback is via this <a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.&nbsp; In prior versions of Movie Maker there was a concept of a Collections area where you could organize clips into folders, rename them, etc.&nbsp; You could then use items from this collection in different projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The newer versions of Movie Maker don't have a collection since all your work is done within the project area.&nbsp; I can see that there might be some benefit to being able to attach a note/tag/name to various clips so it is easier to then rearrange&nbsp;things without
 having to rely on just the thumbnail or to preview the clip.&nbsp; However, because edits don't transfer to the next project, I'm thinking this usefulness might be limited.&nbsp; In any case, do suggest it via the link I provided above.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue can be software or hardware driven. If you've already tried restarting the device, reattaching the keyboard and updated the drivers, we suggest that you force shutdown you Surface device. To do that, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</p>
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Poor contacts between the connector can cause the keyboard not to work. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Detach the Clipboard from the keyboard.</li><li>Wet a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol. (Use 95% isopropyl alcohol or higher if possible.) Clean the silver pins on both faces of the three connectors located on the top middle surface of the keyboard hinge. Rub the cotton swab back and forth vigorously
 to clean the pins. Use a fresh swab surface to clean each of the connector faces (six in total).</li><li>After you're done, make sure the pins are dry and that there are no cotton fibers on the connector. Reattach the Clipboard to the keyboard.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If your keyboard still does not work, bring your Surface device to a<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Microsoft Store near you</a> and have it assessed by one of our personnel. You may

            Hi Larry
<br />
<br />If you are getting a prompt by Windows 10 on startup to enter a BitLocker key.
<br />
<br />It might be stored in your Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Sign in <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/devices</a>
<br />
<br />Under your device, click 'Get Bitlocker Recovery Keys' 
<br />
<br />You will likely have to do this from another working computer then enter the key on the other computer.

<p>I took out internal drive (4TB WD) before I sent Dell desktop to repair.</p>
<p>They repaired on warranty and sent computer back.</p>
<p>They'd replaced motherboard but C drive is there with Windows 10 I updated.</p>
<p>I put my 4TB drive back in and get this Enter the 48 key etc to unlock, with Key ID number, And Load key from USB Drive, a valid usb key wasn't detected. Maybe the key was on the old motherboard.</p>
<p>I'm bewildered.</p>

            Did you try all suggested methods to unlock?
<br />
<br />We see many reports of drives locked by Bitlocker which owners say they never did.  
<br />
<br />Did you search your Microsoft Account to see if there's a key listed there you might not know about?  
<br />
<br />See this Dell forums thread where you can access more direct help from Dell:  <a href="https://www.dell.com/community/Windows-10/BitLocker-need-a-key-but-I-never-installed-it/td-p/6019486/page/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/community/Windows-10/BitLo...</a>
<br />
<br />If you're still under warranty I'd also ask Dell why you're being prompted for this key after they changed your hardware.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Alienware Laptop running Windows not recognizing hard drive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flarev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alienware Laptop running Windows not recognizing hard drive.</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has been having an issue lately where sometimes when it boots up, it fails to recognize its internal hard drive, (which it has never had trouble with in the past) giving me a black error screen, (which I’m sure has nothing to do with windows) and
 then going around in a loop like that. Through extensive trial and error, I’ve realized that shutting it off and closing it for 15-30 minutes usually resolves the issue, but it’s something which has been getting worse and may continue to do so. (The black
 error screen started popping up only a few days ago. Before then, for about a week, a blue error screen was popping up describing tne fact that my drive had run into an issue and had to be repaired. (This usually resolved itself fairly quickly however, so
 I assumed it would go away after a while) I’ve run every virus checker than I have on the computer and come up with nothing, (AdAware and the standard windows defender) tried using the clean up disk application, and it’s had no effect. I’ve also made a point
 to not go on any questionable websites or download too many applications from questionable sources. However, I have had the computer for &gt;3 years. What’s the issue and how do I resolve it? Thanks.</p>

            Hi  FlareV,
<br />
<br />Boot up your system, on the Alienware logo, repeatedly press the F12 key
<br />
<br />From the resulting menu, choose Diagnostics
<br />
<br />Run that diagnostics test - if at the end you are asked to perform an extended memory test, don't bother
<br />
<br />Does your hard drive pass that diagnostics test?

            I tried that yesterday and the hard drive failed, but then later, i was able to access what was stored on the hard drive. I’m running the diagnostic again now, and my jard drive hasn’t failed yet.

            Hi FlareV, then this is more than likely caused by a Windows Update . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the Batteries section
<br />
<br />For each device in that section:
<br />
<br />Right click and choose Disable
<br />
<br />Then right click and choose Enable
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Run these troubleshooters
<br />
<br />Hardware and devices
<br />
<br />Power
<br />
<br />
<br />Then, check the Dell website for a Video card device driver and install the version they recommend - it may well be older than the version you are running!

<h2>            skype update</h2>
                    Hi, I'm a little confused because i've been using Skype for many years. And suddenly it says my password is incorrect. I've tried every possible password I've ever had. So I tried to change my password, and all it did was change my outlook password, and
 still not allow me to log into skype. So I tried to unstall and reinstall Skype, and although my Mac software is up to date, it's telling me I don't have the current update to run Skype. I'm about to lose my mind! please help!&nbsp;

</p><p>For us to further investigate the case, please provide the Skype version and Mac OS of your device. You could be on a different account since you said that when you tried to change your password, it change the password for your Outlook account. This shouldn't
 happen unless your Skype and Outlook accounts are updated into one. <em>See </em>

<li>Go to the <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Accounts Diagnostic</a></strong> link.

<p>
</p><p>After you have successfully reset your password, sign in to your account on both the application and the Skype website. Let me know what happens after.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Driver Verifier totally destroyed my windows 10 after showing a screen which told that it found something (and I do not remember the exact words). After that point I couldn't boot. While starting up my pc always restarted showing some repair options.
 After trying several of them without any success I reinstalled windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling windows did not fix my problem. And I will not try this Driver Verifier again without a detailed description what to do so I won't destroy my system again.</p>

    <title>Why aint digital games cheaper than retail&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why aint digital games cheaper than retail&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone looked at the marketplace? I hear publishers talk about digital downloads being cheaper and a good thing for consumers because they can pass on the savings in manufacturing and distribution to the customer. So why are the digital games priced so highly?
 Why is retail (2nd hand market) cheaper still?<br />
<br />
This is exactly why I will never have sympathy with Publishers. They simply don't have our interests in mind at all, they can solve the 2nd hand market issue quite easily but they refuse to adapt their failing business models and instead opt to blame gamers.
<br />
<br />
The way I understand it is Publishers actually need retail to sell their games yet they complain about retail for basically selling games, but they cant reduce digital prices because that would upset retail.
<br />
<br />
What a complete load of nonsense, but that is not the gamers fault. I have yet to meet anyone who has had to pay a fee to Honda for selling their Honda Civic car, and I have not heard of any builders threatening not to build any more new houses because they
 do not receive a fee for every house sold and/or brought after the initial first sale.
<br />
<br />
Reduce digital prices and dont tell me how to consume my media. Give me the choice and benefits of both worlds. If you want to convert me to digital then I will say it again.....<strong>REDUCE DIGITAL PRICES</strong>.</p>

<p>1) They can't undercut retail prices of games that are being sold in stores. The only PC games sold in stores have total publisher control over distribution on PC, i.e. you have to use Origin, Battle.net or Uplay, and those games are never cheaper on PC
 download than they are at retail either.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2) There is one source of distribution for Games on Demand, and that is directly through the Microsoft Marketplace. Therefore there are no competing distributors and they can set whatever price they wish knowing that you can't go somewhere else and get it
 cheaper.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>3) Because they simply don't want to reduce prices. As you said, any other market or business model would follow a different track. I think you are quite right to say they could compete directly with the second hand market, but obviously competition is not
 their goal. Their goal is control. Why compete with the second hand market when you can convince consumers to buy products that can't be bought or sold without your implicit approval and regulation?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If they wanted to go digital then great. They could have stifled any moaning and sent waves through the gaming industry by announcing that they were slashing retail prices... but they didn't. They let the old One fail before they did that. They have shown
 no intention that they were going to adapt to market forces. What any of these sad sack DRM apologists refuse to admit is that in the end, what they were doing wasn't about advancing the medium, it was about controlling prices, period.</p>

<p>Wether the DRM restriction was or wasn't going to be implemented, prices for games on demand were not going to be changed. What was interesting in that Angry Joe interview with Major Nelson, this question was asked and the major didn't have a answer in regards
 to cheaper games in digital form, nor making disk form digital media cheaper. Knowing by Microsoft's track record with the 360 and games on demand they would of charged a lot more money. The ability to have a choice on where we shop is fair for the consumer.

<p>Frankly, if Sony didn't drop its digital prices, Microsoft wasn't going to either. xP Only thing that would have convinced either side was if they wanted to one-up the other. By the way, did you know that a lot of this talk came up because of a completely
 anonymous text dump on Pastebin by a guy who was claiming to be an X1 Engineer? Surprising number of people don't seem to. Everyone says 'Yeah, there could be cheaper digital games!' Only one who hasn't? Microsoft.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And come on. If they had any plans to do so, they would have said so while most of the Internet was spewing hate, and the pre-orders were slumping waaay behind PS4. Instead, they decided to abandon the DRM entirely, so I doubt that cheaper digital games
 were ever on the table.</p>

<strong>which is one of the main problems with the 360 marketplace, if arcade games dropped in price like retail does it would be awesome, games that were on the arcade in like 2009 and before should be $1-$5, sometimes less, but they are STILL going for their

            <p><strong>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:</strong></p>
<p><br />
Note: If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking or power saving BIOS features, start out by disabling them: Intel EIST, Turbo Mode, Cool and Quite&nbsp; and drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p><br />
Disconnect any other (additional) internal hard drives and external USB devices.<br />
Check for any loose hard drive power or SATA cables, Graphics card or other power cables.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>First run Memtest86+:</strong>&nbsp; <br />
This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory<br />
sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<p><strong>Hard drive Testing:</strong><br />
If you don't know your drives make and model, Try "Speccy",<br />
it provides System/computer Information in detail:<br />
OS, CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Graphics, Hard Drive, Optical Drive, Audio, Peripherals, Network.<br />
Note: RAM option will show number of slots, DRAM Timing,<br />
The speed (Frequency) your memory is running at. The rated frequency for your memory.<br />

<p><br />
<strong>Test your drive - Create a Bootable CD:</strong><br />
Anywhere from 5 to 25%, (depending on the manufacture and model) of new hard drives are defective.<br />
Note: Hard drive reliability has gone way down in the last 18 months.</p>
<p><br />
Test your drive using the drive manufacture's utility. <br />
If you have a new Seagate hard drive the very next thing would be to download Seagate's Seatools<br />
(the bootable CD) and check for bad sectors.<br />
