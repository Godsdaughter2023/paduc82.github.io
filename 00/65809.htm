<h2>            family safety maximum child accounts per parent</h2>
                    Is there a maximum number of "child" accounts per parent? Is it possible, for instance, to have 1 parent with 150 "child" accounts each of which can use any of 5 different PCs?

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. We apologize for the delay in response. As for your inquiry, I understand that you want to know the limit of child accounts that can be associated to a parent account. We consulted our support specialist, and would
 like to inform you that the s<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">upported limit is 10. You can add more than 10 accounts but, it will not be supported. Family Safety should not be used in a deployment scenario. We advice that organizations should
 implement group policies rather than to leverage the features of Family Safety as a consumer-focused feature.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>In case you have other inquiries pertaining Family Safety, please let us know. We'll be here to provide assistance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

<p>I have 4 children, and I am the Administrator account. Three children have been added. One didn't require an email invite. Two other children have accepted the email invite, and days later, the Administrator account (me) still shows the children have not
 accepted the invite. Yet, I have logged into their accounts, since I set them up, have accessed the email invites, accepted them, logged out, rebooted, logged back in the Administrator account, all the while, the master/admin account, shows that 2 children,
 who have accepted the invite, are still pending. It seems stupid that this Family Safety has been in affect since Windows 8, and here we are on Win 10, and it is still fkt up and doesn't work. I want to add my last and youngest daughter, child #4. But the
 Admin account tells me I have too many children, and need to delete one of the other three (3) children, if I want to add a fourth (4th), or in this case, just a different #3 (third) child. As I read here, I see I admin/adult account can have 6 children's
 MS accounts associated with it. When the hell can I NOT add a 4th child then???? This seems stupid that MS even tries to implement something that doesn't even function. I have read comments by people who are on the "team" that come up with this crap MS Family
 Safety stuff. The obviously don't have their own family or children, or they would actually make this work after how many years of working on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that for $100/year or so, I can use QUSTODIO, to monitor and limit accounts on computers, phones, and other devices. But our stupid school districts give our children IPads, with a so-called admin account on it, with crap limitations, so we,
 as parents, can NOT install QUSTODIO or some other powerful program to watch/monitor/assist our children in maintaining order and obeying rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, I will obviously install QUSTODIO to monitor and limit my children, since MS cannot get the basic premise of family safety, or anything like unto it to work half way normally. I will these MS hacks would get off their duff and do something to
 help so many families who obviously want and need their help, yet they cannot do it, with lack of understanding, lack of know-how, or just lazy crap attitudes and don't care, just like so many MS products that suck. And I'm a so-called MS fan boy, who despises
 using apple products, yet MS can't even come up with help for us, regardless of desire, need know-how, or any other factor.</p>

    <title>will windows ever work right&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            will windows ever work right&#63;</h2>
                    <p>No matter what and no matter how you defend windows, it is a poor excuse of anything and I will never understand how 100k employees at MS can make such a crappy product that does nothing for no one and never works at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just looked at my mother's PC, little red x over windows defender, click on it and it says virus service has stopped. How long has it been like that? Real nice of windows to turn it back on. Proof they do not care. It is only just more and more proof that
 shows windows is designed like crap, made like crap and no one cares at all. I bet you can get every single MVP in here to try to find out why that service stopped and no one, no one will be answer as to why, but those same people claim that MS cares so much,
 they worked with the engineers or they network over 100,000 PC's, which is all lies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the networking does not work at all, ever not once and I do not care if any one on here wants to contest this, networking does not work. It is a joke I click networks and it says file discovery is off turn on? Want to make this private? No s&nbsp; h&nbsp; i&nbsp;
 t sherlock. Duh? More proof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when you get the networking going and it asks for a name and a password, god knows what you put there because it is not the username and password of the computer you are connecting to or maybe it is but it is just another thing that does not work. More
 proof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single windows computer is dying or having a very hard time installing 1803 or 1809, I've seens PC's blue screen trying to update, seen many people have to reinstall and seen many people spend hours and hours on it trying to fix it. Look what comes
 in 1803 and 1809, nothing but useless crap that no one wants but for some reason MS thinks people want all this crap but no one does and all this crap nowadays with windows is totally useless. Why does windows, the MVP's or anyone think they are doing a good
 job. Can any one just name a few things they windows actually does for them other than nothing? MS is an embarrassment of a 40 year old billion dollar company with 100k employees and anyone volunteering their free time and services to this farce is literally
 the reason behind what's wrong with MS. They can do what ever they want because they a have a free army of slaves to do their bidding, however if windows did work for once then that would ruin the economy. If windows worked for once like they say it does then
 all the PC techs, mom and pop repair stores and the like will be shut down; no one brings a mac or linux to the store, they only bring windows to the store to get fix so if windows worked, for once, then what would they bring to the store to get fixed. Proof
 that all this is on purpose and they are using all of you.</p>

<p>I make a certain folder view, click apply to all folders, hit yes to confirm and none of my settings stick and they always revert back.</p>
<p>Now I noticed my drives are moving slow so I go to check the defrag status that I had set to daily on 3 PC's. As usually my settings chnged to two being weekly and one being off. Once again, gather all the MS professionals and answer has to why they all
 went from daily to weekly and one being off, you will not come up with an answer. More and more proof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More proof? okay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hide folder merge conflicts enabled by default, do I need to say any more?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many developers in the MS company and not one of them knows how deadly this being on by default is? Why. I'll add more proof tomorrow, I can literally keep going nonstop until I find one useful or working feature in windows, one of these days I will
 been nearly 4 years and I yet to find any usefullness but there is hope.</p>

<p>Did the new release for Windows 8.1 not come to Enterprise? I have Windows 8 Enterprise on my PC and I found that Enterprise cannot take the update. Why is this? Where is the update for Enterprise!? Will I need to leave Enterprise and buy the pro or normal
 8.1 to get the update? Could someone please help me out.</p>

                    <p>Já faz 10 dias que tento baixar o jogo de Xbox 360 e sempre tenho algum problema. Vou viajar e ficar fora até o dia 16, ou seja, se nao conseguir resolver o problema, vou perder a oportunidade de pegar o jogo. Quando tento acessar "Consulte preço" recebo
 a mensagem "<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Sorry, we had trouble loading some details. Please try again later.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">". Antes o problema era o jogo que aparecia para eu pegar, que não era o jogo certo, agora o jogo certo aparece e
 eu não consigo pegar por esse motivo. Já tentei acessar pelo site e dá o mesmo problema. O que posso fazer pra resolver esse problema?</span></p>
<p>Edit: uma outra coisa que esqueci de mencionar, estou tentando fazer isso por um Xbox One.</p>

<p>Hello filosofrog!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having problems with the store and downloading your games with gold through the 360, then I would go ahead and start off with trying to delete and then redownload your account via the steps outlined here at
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-profile-xbox-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to add or remove an Xbox profile on Xbox 360</a>&nbsp;and see if that helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't the I would next try Solution 7 (it's the fastest)on our page <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/console/system-update-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot problems with an update to your Xbox 360 console</a>&nbsp;and see if that helps out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give that information a look through and let us know how it helped</p>

            Every time I open my Google browser I get hijacked to http://yahoo.genieo.com/?v=w3i8 . I cannot for the life of me get rid of this nuisance. I can then click on home button, and go to home page, but it's a major inconvenience. It buries itself and replicates in the registry. It is a trojan virus and windows defender does not recognize it. PLEASE update Windows Defender to eliminate this unwanted hijacker! Thanks.  



Also: 



The "We are sorry to hear that you want to uninstall Genieo" garbage is a load of ****. It is unwanted by everyone. EVERYONE. The "Support" comment below appears on boards across the Internet where people are discussing how to get rid of the deep rooted hijacker.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hello Jon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description I understand that the Buslink USB external disk not recognizing in Windows 7. This issue can be caused due to driver or hardware corruption.
<span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Did this problem recently begin? If so, do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What is the exact error message you receive, when you try to connect the Buslink USB external disk on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Have you tried to connect the Buslink USB external disk on a different USB port?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Are able to see the Buslink USB external disk in device manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Are able to use the Buslink USB external disk on a different computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Diagnose and fix Windows USB problems automatically</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Windows_USB_diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Windows_USB_diagnostics</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above step does not help us to diagnose the issue, uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow the steps to uninstall &amp; reinstall the USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller from device manager.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on <strong>Start </strong>and in <strong>Start search box </strong>type in "<strong>Device Manager</strong>" (with quotes) and press<strong> enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. <strong>Device Manager</strong> Window will be open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Look for the <strong>device under USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller, right click</strong> on it and select
<strong>Uninstall.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp;Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. On restart, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>If there is a yellow question mark on any device in device manger, please repeat the Steps from Step 4.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may access the link below and follow the steps to update drivers on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly.</strong></p>

<h2>            Microsoft, Absolutely Disgraceful.</h2>
                    <p>It's impossible to imagine that in 2016 MS Australia will block every single attempt to be able to lodge a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will always get a 3 Rd world person whose only gift is to repeatedly say. I so solly! I apoleegise. I will get your request for
 a Email / phone number @ Sydney Head Office. I am emailing you a reference number and someone will help soon.... never a call back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just a outright lie. (Tech Level 2 destroyed my files, and then told me to buy a New Win 10 to replace an existing Win 10. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From there, the flood gates of incompetence and intentional deception opened. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They could not even do a clean install! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$180.00 / 1/3 of my weekly pension money. Cry me a river, but it is big for me.</p>
<p>MS store will only give you customer support number. Many many hours later, it is clear there is a ban of contacting anyone who has English as a mother tongue, lives in Australia and will direct where to call to make a formal complaint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my intention to lay a complaint with Fair Trading Australia. I will further seek to find a willing person working close to &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No: 1 &nbsp;Epping RD., Macquarie Park. Sydney NSW. 2113. &nbsp;To call round to reception and get a PH. number.
 It is a magnificent building with many fat cats within, I am sure. </p>
<p>If you are in the industry and know a solution how to contact / lodge a complaint, I will never forget you. I am over 53 hours of Offshore stupidity and probably at least 15 hours in active pursuit of finding a Complaints Dept.
</p>
<p>I'm an old guy and have really bad issues with MS, a disgusting company with no respect for the consumer.</p>

<h2>            Spyro Reignited Trilogy, Avatar Prop, Christmas gift, please help</h2>
                    <p>hello! I'm messaging today because my wonderful dad bought me an Xbox One X for Christmas alongside the "Spyro Reignited Trilogy" he said he bought the game in the disc form between the 27th-29th of November so since the guideline for the promotion says
</p>
<p><span><span><span>"Pre-Order or Purchase the Spyro Reignited Trilogy
 by December 1st and receive a bonus*: Spyro Companion - Xbox One Avatar Prop *Item will be available 7-10 days after the promotion’s end. Promotion ends 12/2/18 at Midnight PST."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/11/13/visual-storytelling-spyro-reignited-trilogy-xbox-one/</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I should qualify for the adorable prop as it states
 "pre-order OR PURCHASE before December 1st"</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>my dad gave me it for Christmas so the "</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Item
 will be available 7-10 days after the promotion’s end." has become a problem as with it being a Christmas present I could not login to receive the goodie...(not that I even HAD the Xbox one X to even login on)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>just to clarify I have:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>1: contacted the retail store (they sadly could not help)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>2: spent 2 hours on the Xbox support phone number getting hung up on constantly
 while trying to talk to a real person (that system sucks...might want to look into that</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>3: chatted with a super kind Xbox live agent about the situation where he
 agreed I qualified but said I should talk to Activision</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>4: contacted Activision (super nice lady agreed that I qualified but sadly
 could not help as she doesn't work with Xbox stuff and said I should chat with Xbox)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>5: chatted with another super kind Xbox live agent who agrees I qualify
 and kindly showed me this forum so that I could message here and hopefully get some help!</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>can anyone help me to please get the adorable Spyro Companion avatar prop?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

            Those items are typically digital promotions unless stated otherwise (such as information on where to send a copy of the receipt and UPC from the physical item). Or a code would have been included in the box, which there have been promotions where codes
 were in a box version but not offered when purchased digitally.

<p>Well thats a real kick in the teeth!</p>
<p>had i known sooner what was really going on behind all this idve never wasted the entire day looking for answers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>you see i only saw the promotions ON microsofts site... and nowhere in there does it state the the promotion is digital only</p>
<p>
</p><p>only once you go offsite does that show up</p>
<p>very inconsistent/false advertising if you ask me... heck even what activisions support team sent me in regards to the promotion earlier today doesent stipulate that it HAS to be digitally purchased as the word “digitally” doesnt show up at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>false advertisings not cool guys... specially over something as simple as this... not like it was a discount or anything of that sort so why all of this?</p>

    <title>Windows 7&#58; Hacked Through Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pat2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Hacked Through Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>I have experienced hacks on my computer running Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hacker managed to transfer money from with Paypal, but I was able to stop the payments by blocking my bank account. &amp;nbsp;I have since changed the built-in admin account name and password for my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is still something that bothers me... I actually let the hacker in because their request for access showed as a Microsoft Update. I don't have automatic Microsoft Updates on my computer as I like to know exactly what Microsoft wants to install
 on my computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In this instance, I didn't get too much of an explanation, but I clicked on the certificate, and it looked as it was genuinely issued by Microsoft. So, I accepted the update. Next, the hacker created an admin account, and started making the Paypal transfers.
 I shut down the computer, and I called my bank to lock my account for transactions until all this is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the next day, my computer was showing a Windows Security Alert saying that a feature was blocked for KMS Server Emulator (XP) by Publisher MDL Forum, by Ratiborus with Path: C:\windows\files\bin\kmss.exe. &nbsp;I cancelled the request, and I also changed the
 name and password for my Router admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on how to secure my computer further would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 laptop turns off when in sleep</h2>
                    <p>I have a Thinkpad T450s, and I just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 a few days ago.</p>
<p>Now, when the computer is running on battery, and I put it into sleep, it may turn off automatically. This normally happened when the computer is on battery (there is enough power in the battery though). Also, realize that this pretty much happens every
 time when I put it into sleep for several hours, but will not happen if I put it into sleep for just a few minutes. This was not an issue when I was using Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hello Kiran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried it, and will see how it goes. However, I do not believe the issue is on these settings. The system crashed during sleep. In Event Viewer-&gt;Windows Logs-&gt;System, I can see today at 4:04, there's a Critical Level Log, saying the system has rebooted
 without cleanly shutting down first. Right before that, I pressed the power button tried to wake the computer up from sleeping, but Windows was crashed some point before 4:05 during sleep.</p>

            Well, I took a look at Event Viewer, and it looked like the networking adapter had problem right before shutting down automatically. Upgraded the driver for adapter, and now works fine.

            <p>isaacjing, I'm having very similar issues&nbsp;since upgrading to win10 on&nbsp;my t450s. I've tried to reinstall the Intel WIFI drivers (downloaded from here:
<a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t450s/20bx/downloads/DS103663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t450s/20bx/downloads/DS103663</a> ) but that doesn't really seem to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ICan you plz let me know what build of the wireless and ethernet driver are you using now? You can find the driver build # in the Device Manager app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>WIFI: 18.11.0.8</p>
<p>Ethernet: 12.12.218.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you happen to be using Hyper-v on your machine? I've noticed that the laptop suffers from various network related issues in particular when I configure the WIFI adapter as a shared, external device on the Hyper-V switch...</p>

<h2>            Cortana hears but only responds to about a third of my questions</h2>
                    <div>As the title says, Cortana only responds about 30% of the time when I request help. Rarely does it "voice" respond but at least it will sometimes open a browser window. My microphone works fine. It can hear me because I see it typing out my question but
 then it doesn't respond by voice or browser. After asking, it just sits there. Even simple questions such as "Hey Cortana, show me McDonald's nutrition information." or "Hey Cortana, find the nearest supermarket"...then nothing. Can anyone tell me why this
 might be happening or is it just that the technology is too new and I'm expecting too much? By the way, I'm using it on my laptop and only recently installed Windows 10 if that makes any difference. Thanks for any answers.</div>

            I really appreciate your time to try to help resolve things regarding Cortana but having it learn my voice was one of the first things I did. I went through all of the sentences, etc. I've tried speaking slowly. I've tried to pronounce words clearly. I
 have no speech problems. It simply doesn't work very well. It's amazing for what it is but&nbsp;maybe it&nbsp;needs a few years of tweaking. Or possibly someone else has a different suggestion. Regardless, thank you again.

            I agree, it's not you, it's her, and I went through all the same steps you did with&nbsp;even worse results.&nbsp; Consider yourself lucky.&nbsp; I have a nerve disorder, so my speech isn't great, and several times I responded to her answers with, "Thank you, Cortana",
 and she would reply, "That wasn't a very nice thing to say", or "That was very rude", and then would not respond to anything for a long while.&nbsp; She was obviously mistaking my pronunciation of "thank" with another word that starts with "F".&nbsp; Who knew I could
 actually offend my laptop?!&nbsp; You're right, she needs some work, and she'll stay turned off until then.&nbsp; Oh geez, I hope she's not reading this, I'm afraid of upsetting her any further and I don't know she's capable of...

<h3> geoffrey-p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Backup application could not start &#40;0x80070005&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Win7 Pro x64, recently had to do a repair install due to some components SFC could not fix nor update. Windows Update works and everything is up to date as of 2016-01-26.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on the user's main account (member of 'Administrators' group), Backup &amp; Restore just opens an empty window with the title, and Action Center reports "The backup application could not start due to an internal error: Access is denied. (0x80070005)".
 Backup &amp; Restore was functioning correctly prior to the repair install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd thing is, under the Administrator account, as well as with a freshly-created account in 'Administrators' then Backup &amp; Restore launches and executes without error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else in Windows appears to work as intended, on all accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I should add that all the relevant services Backup requires are correctly enabled and set (same on the two working and one non-working Administrators accounts), and SFC /verifyonly reports no problems, no missing/damaged files and no integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CHKDSK also passes clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a Clean Boot does not change behaviour, one account cannot launch Backup &amp; Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've examined many other 80070005 related messages here and elswhere and applied whatever was non-Update relevant, even using SubinACL to reset ACLs (although there seems to be a lot of registry values it could not modify). Frankly, I'm now at a loss of
 where to go next!</p>

            <p>Hi Geoffrey,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with using backup and restore settings on Windows 7. I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could occur if there is change in permission for accessing certain files due to malware or virus. It could if the user account does not have a administrator privilege to perform certain task.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, please provide us&nbsp;the below&nbsp;information:</p>
<p>What is the type of account where you are having issues while using Backup&nbsp;and Restore functionality?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: I&nbsp;suggest you to&nbsp;scan the Computer with Windows Defender or with any other antivirus for&nbsp;virus.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not&nbsp;have any antivirus software on the Computer, then you can install the Microsoft&nbsp;Safety Scanner and scan with it.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>:&nbsp;I&nbsp;recommend you to login to administrator account and then try to change the account type of user account&nbsp;as administrator. Check if you are still facing&nbsp;the issue or not.</p>
<p>1. Click on <strong>Search bar</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Then User Accounts.</p>
<p>3. Then click on <strong>Manage another account</strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;user account.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Change the account type</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Click on <strong>Administrator&nbsp;option</strong>.</p>
<p>7. Then click on&nbsp;<strong>Save Changes</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Login with the user account and check if you are able to launch Backup&nbsp;and Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reply to us with the information, so that we can assist you better.</p>

            <p>The system had been using Microsoft Security Essentials since original installation. A full scan with MSE, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and Anti-Rootkit, and even Symantec Endpoint (when connected to a second system as a slave drive) show no malware of any
 kind to be present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main user account is an Administrator and member of the Administrators group. The main Administrator account (once enabled) can use Backup &amp; Restore perfectly, as can a second freshly-created Administrator-group account. It is only the original account
 which generates the 80070005 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Approximately ten months prior, the system had lost power due to a blackout whilst installing a batch of updates. SFC reported that some files relating to the IE-HTML Core and the help system were damaged and could not be replaced. IE would work, but opening
 a .CHM file would just give a blank window. As the user was relying on Chrome as their main browser and did not need access to Help files, it was not considered important, however the growing number of Windows Updates which were failing to install finally
 prompted a repair re-installation (launched from the main Administrator account as per instructions) from original media at the end of December.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until the repair re-installation, Backup &amp; Restore was working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the repair re-installation (and subsequent full set of Windows Updates) IE and the help system were functional, but Backup &amp; Restore was not working only on one account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you be able to point me at any logs that may help provide further information?</p>

<h2>            windows 7 64bit dlink dwl 510 driver problems</h2>
                    As it goes, windows 7 doesn't support my wireless card, without one I cant go to the internet to search Microsoft online driver database. The card in question is Dlink DWL-510... The card manufacturer isn't going to publish 64bit drivers and I don't know
 what to do?<br />
<br />
The windows 7 driver database don't have my driver, although I had some success installing other drivers with similar chip-set and passes instal process (realtek), but card simply doesn't work, even when&nbsp; windows say that card is installed successfully.<br />
<br />
Please help anyone....<br />

            If the manufacturer has no plan to support the card, the best suggest is the acquire one that does.

<p>Thanks Sumit</p>
<p>I have created a USB drive with and put this in the computer.</p>
<p>I need you to explain next steps please as I am that knowledgeable on computers.</p>
<p>It says Install Now - I click this and it says set up is starting.</p>
<p>I accept terms then type of installation - I click Upgrade - install windows and keep files etc.</p>
<p>It then says the upgrade option is not available if you start your computer using windows installation media.&nbsp; If a copy of windows is already installed on this computer and you want to upgrade remove the installation media and restart your computer.&nbsp; After
 windows has started normally insert the installation media and run windows set up.</p>
<p>However I can not do this as the computer keeps going back to Automatic repair mode.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            Hi,
<br />1. System Recovery would restore the system to factory settings. Go by it if you want to afford.
<br />&gt;I have created a USB drive with and put this in the computer.
<br />&gt;I need you to explain next steps please as I am that knowledgeable on computers.
<br />&gt;It says Install Now - I click this and it says set up is starting.
<br />Do not select Install Now, select Repair your computer.

            <p>Hi Saswat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately the feature is hard coded within the operating system and you cannot disable&nbsp;it. The concept behind this is that you would click on the CD/DVD drive only when you need to access it. As such it auto ejects the drive if it’s empty so that
 you can insert a disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disabling the device or the burning feature can eventually prevent you from doing the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are two ways of getting around the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Always leave a disc inside the drive permanently so that whenever you accidentally click on the drive, it opens the contents of the drive rather than ejecting it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>As a sidenote, you can configure the folder options to respond to a double click and not to a single click. The odds of accidentally double-clicking on a CD/DVD drive are far less compared to a single click.
 Do this in case you have single click configured for Folder Options.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go to&nbsp; <strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>Folder Options</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select the option&nbsp; <strong>Double-click to open an item (single-click to select).</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Apply</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Ok</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 freezes after downgrade from 10</h2>
                    <p>Good morning, I use an Asus N550JV laptop computer. Yesterday I decided to upgrade to Windows 10. It seemed to work well but after a few minutes it started freezing in a strange way.. At first the wi-fi, then the folders and then nor the Task Manager was
 working. Given that, I decided to downgrade again to Windows 8.1 but the problem of freezing happened again and again. (Before the upgrade it was working very very well).. Can I have a solution to my problem which wouldn't require to format my pc? It would
 be very hard to re-install all the software I use to work on my Designs, I don't have enough time!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much,</p>
<p>Fabrizio</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simple fact is that in a lot of cases rolling back from 10 to 8.1 results in corrupted 8.1 system and program&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>Use the information below to fix corrupted system files.</p>
<p>For corrupted 3rd party Apps/Programs uninstall/reinstall them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you read this Microsoft information about&nbsp;repairing corrupt system files and errors?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files"</p>
<p><a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/929833?wa=wsignin1.0#manually repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/929833?wa=wsignin1.0#manually repair</span></a></p>

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </span>

</p><p><strong>Repair-WindowsImage -Online -CheckHealth<br />
<br />
Repair-WindowsImage -Online -ScanHealth<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

    <title>2nd display not detected when Laptop Lid is Closed. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            2nd display not detected when Laptop Lid is Closed.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an external monitor together with my laptop and I usually will extend the display to the external monitor. Usually when I want to watch videos or anything, I will bring the specific window to the extended display and close my laptop lid, and the
 computer will still recognise that there are 2 displays . But recently when I close my laptop lid, the computer does not recognise the multiple displays (only recognises my external display), and merges all the windows / the main screen to the external monitor.
 Only when I open my laptop lid then the computer will extend the displays. I've tried setting it to "Do Nothing" when I close the lid in the power settings, but it is still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can help with this problem? Thanks.</p>
