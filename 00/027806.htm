<h2>            Access 2010 Creating relationships</h2>
                    Hi, I had a small database which recorded what books (products table)&nbsp;were sent to a particular training institution (customers table).&nbsp; Two tables, one for the books and one storing info on the training institution.&nbsp; I have now been asked to create an
 employees table, which I understand is to be the employees of the store itself.&nbsp; I have done this, but am having trouble in creating the relationship so that I can get a meaningful report from it.&nbsp; The way I did the relationship was to create an additional
 lookup field in the customers table and called it salesman and got the lookup from the surname of the employee in the Employees table.&nbsp; I then had to manually populate the salesman column in the customer's table, which I selected from the drop down list.&nbsp;
 That was okay, but from there on, somehow, it just is not working.&nbsp; I have tried to do a report that will show me what salesman sold what books to what organisation but it just seems to indicate

            I'm missing something here because you seem to be missing two tables. How do you record a shipment? The products table is fine, the employees table is fine (except you should be using an autonumber as the PK in that table). But the customers table should
 just be info about the institutions you send books to. You need a Shipments table to record each shipment and a shipments details table for each item shipped (unless you only send one book per shipment).&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Products and customers should NOT be directly related. They should be related ONLY through the shipments tables. The salesperson can be related directly to a customer (if a salesperson always deals with the same customer or with the shipment. That's a
 business rule that you need to answer.&nbsp;</div>

            I too am having some difficulty understanding just what's being asked of you here.&nbsp; The Products table more or less makes sense, though why Competency Number should be chosen as the name for its primary key I can't imagine.&nbsp; Why not just BookID (note the
 lack of a space in this BTW; spaces in object names, while allowed in MS Access, are frowned upon by experienced developers).&nbsp; Anyway, that's not the real issue.<br />
<br />
The inclusion of a foreign key Competency Number column in Customers makes no real sense at all.&nbsp; It assumes that a customer can be related to only one product (book).&nbsp; This is known as a unary relationship type.&nbsp; I'd have expected the relationship type to
 be many-to-many, i.e. each customer can relate to one or more books, and each book can relate to one or more customers.&nbsp; This is known as binary relationship type.&nbsp; For this there would be no Competency Number column in Customers, but the relationship type
 would be modelled by a table with two foreign keys, each referencing the primary key of the two main tables, e.g.<br />
<br />
CustomerProducts<br />
....CustomerID<br />
....Competency Number<br />
<br />
The Customers table would include a CustomerID column as its primaty key.&nbsp; For convenience this can be an autonumber.<br />
<br />
When it comes to Employees, like you, I'm assuming this will relate to the Customers table, i.e. will record each Customer's employees.&nbsp; This is a genuine unary relationship type (one-to-many), assuming no body can be an employee of more than one customer simultaneously,
 so simply needs a CustomerID foreign key column in the Employees table, referencing the primary key of Customers.<br />
<br />
There is another possible interpretation, however, which is that Employees does not relate to Customers, but is a distinct entity type representing the employees selling products to a customer.&nbsp; The relationship type would then be ternary (3-way) between Customers,
 Products and Employees, so Employees would not have a CustomerID column and instead of the CustomerProducts table you'd have as follows:<br />
<br />
ProductSales<br />
....CustomerID<br />
....Competency Number<br />
....EmployeeID<br />
<br />
There could well be other columns in this table such as SaleDate, Quantity (the number of copies of the book sold) etc., i.e. these columns represent attributes of each sale<br />
<br />
The important thing is to understand just what in real worlds terms you are being asked to model,&nbsp; even though the real world is a hypothetical one here.&nbsp; The whole basis of the database relational model is that it models a part of the real world in terms of
 its entity types and the relationships between them, with each table modelling an entity type ( a relationship type is just a special kind of entity type, so tables modelling relationship types are in fact modelling entity types).&nbsp; Columns in each table model
 the attributes of the entity type.&nbsp; One you have a good mental picture of how the part of the real world with which you are concerned is made up in this way, the process of translating this into tables and relationships in the database is a relatively straightforward
 one.<br />

            I have tried Edge, Chrome and Safari. None of them work. Not only that, when I use Edge and click on "other email accounts" to add one, I then type in my Charter email address and password and get the resulting message that it couldn't connect and asked
 me to check my settings. I click o.k. and then start to fill in my settings but the page won't let me scroll down to where I type in my server information. It's as though it is locked and I have to close the browser or it the back button to get out of it.
 This does not happen with Chrome on the same computer. &nbsp;I tried rebooting the computer and the same thing happens. It is clearly a problem with Outlook mail!....and also with Edge!

    <title>Cannot send mail through outlook.com - several accounts and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonhintersteiner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot send mail through outlook.com - several accounts and devices&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Over the last several days, first my wife and now I can no longer send email through our outlook.com email accounts. &nbsp;This happens on multiple devices (including Outlook 2013 on Windows 10, an iPhone with the iPhone mail app configured for Windows 10, the
 outlook.com app for iPhone, and the outlook.com website under both Chrome and Edge). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my wife, this started as emails three days ago showing as sent (including showing up as sent in her outlook.com sent box) but not actually sent out, because I never received them. &nbsp;Now, her account won't even get that far, and my account had been working
 fine until mid afternoon today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the website I get a "outlook.com was unable to complete this request". &nbsp; On my iPhone, I get "Cannot Send Mail. &nbsp;The message was rejected by the server." &nbsp; &nbsp;Screenshots are below. My Outlook 2013 is the most onerous, as it doesn't actually give you any
 error when you click "Send/Receive", but the message just stays in the outbox and doesn't actually send out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also mention that we've had these accounts set up and working fine for months and nothing on our end has changed. &nbsp;I have not made any changes to account settings, SMTP servers, or anything else. &nbsp; I did try with my wife's account to delete and
 re-sync the account on her iPhone, along with loading the outlook.com app to her phone, but have the same issues. &nbsp; There does not seem to be any issue on the account side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise, and please do not give me a canned level 1 response either about what programs I'm using or any such nonsense! &nbsp;Either your servers are corrupted or the accounts are corrupted - either way just fix it!</p>

            <p>i'm having the same issue. &nbsp;are you using aliases with your emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have aliases set up for outgoing mail only and i just noticed that if i log in to outlook.com, disable my aliases and send out with my .outlook email everything goes perfect. &nbsp;as soon as i try to send with .gmail email address it can not contact server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've re-signed into gmail from outlook and linked both accounts and it's still giving me this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i suspect microsoft is being scummy and is eliminating aliases in order to drive people to use the .outlook address as opposed to your .gmail or whatever alias email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it would be great if someone from microsoft could answer this.</p>

            <p>It looks like you MUST have the primary account set to be @outlook.com in order for sending mail from any platform. &nbsp;Thank you Microsoft for fixing what wasn't broken and introducing yet another "undocumented feature". &nbsp; Since "reply to" is also broken in
 Outlook 2007 (and not even available in Outlook 2013) for outlook.com accounts, it is not like I can work around the wrong reply-to address that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To complicate matters further, all of my multifactor authentication emails from @accounts.microsoft.com went into my outlook account's junk mail folder. &nbsp;I find it strangely appropriate that Microsoft considers email from itself to be junk mial.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I unlink my Microsoft account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I unlink my Microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I need to log in to Skype, I always have to restart my password for some reason lately, ever since I got office. And now, since all my accounts are in one thing, whenever I change it on one, it messes up the other, and for some reason, it just
 forces me to restart my password because it claims I can't remember it (even though I'm copying and pasting the one I use every time). I'm just stuck and annoyed, can someone help? Thanks in advance.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c141870c-7917-43e0-bfab-377feed265df" title="AbdullahX">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to unlink Skype from your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>If you have a specific Skype Name/Username, I suggest you use that to sign in to Skype instead of your email. Although they are linked, logging in using your email and Skype name is still different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you will reset your password to any of your Microsoft account, that applies to all services linked to it. including Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which Skype app version are you using or are you logging in to the Skype for Web instead?</p>
<p>Please make sure to specify the <strong>version number</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>7650 startup&#58; no 0 or C keys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> messidor  say:</h3>
<h2>            7650 startup&#58; no 0 or C keys</h2>
                    Hello everybody,<br />
here's the problem with starting up my Nokia 7650.<br />
<br />
When I power on, and the PIN dialog appears, the C(ancel)<br />
and 0(zero) keys do not work.<br />
<br />
All the keys worked fine until yesterday, so I'm thinking<br />
this is too much of a coincidence.<br />
<br />
Also, when I try to power on in "safe mode" (ABC+on), it<br />
ignores it and asks for the PIN. Without the SIM card,<br />
it ignores it as well. No safe mode.<br />
<br />
I got to the point where it asked me the PUK (no zeroes...),<br />
I inserted it, it asked for a new PIN, to which I gave a<br />
new one without 0s, but to no avail, "invalid code".<br />
<br />
SIM is ok, I moved it to another phone, and after unblocked<br />
via PUK, it works fine.<br />
<br />
The question is: is this c/0 behaviour something someone has<br />
seen before, or have both keys chosen to fail<br />
simultaneously and, well, I simply have to take my unit<br />
to the nearest NSC?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Rui

            Sounds like a classic keyboard connector failure to me, although I would expect 2 other keys not be working as well. Could be the dreaded "liquid ingress", take it to a service centre for confirmation.

<p>The "generic" answer is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Mobile Outlook </li><li>Go to&nbsp;the Inbox of the e-mail account in question. </li><li>Select "Menu" </li><li>Select "Tools" </li><li>Select "Manage Folders..." </li><li>At this point you should be looking at a tree-based diagram of your folders.&nbsp; To create or modify a folder, simply tap and hold a folder.&nbsp; You can either tap &amp; hold on your account name (e.g.,*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)
 or one of the existing folders (e.g., Inbox).</li></ol>
<p>If this did not work for you, I will need the following to further troubleshoot the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone manufacturer / model (e.g., HTC Touch Pro 2) </li><li>eMail Account Type (e.g., Live, Hotmail. Yahoo. etc.) </li><li>eMail type (POP, IMAP, Exchange) </li></ul>

            The two are not the same.&nbsp; Defender is purely anti-spyware.&nbsp; MSE includes this functionality and also includes full antivirus protection.&nbsp; If you have other anti-virus software installed there is no compelling reason to switch to MSE.&nbsp; If you don't have
 other antivirus software installed, get MSE installed pronto!&nbsp; Installing MSE will uninstall or disable Defender, depending on which OS you are running.<br />
<br />
Typically MSE + Windows Firewall + anti-phishing capabilities in IE8 will provide all the protection you need.<br />

<div>I have a copy of Office 2010 Home and Student that I have a legitimate CD Key for(running Win Vista). &nbsp;Originally, I had installed Office 2003(the complete suite)and then when Office 2007 came out, I installed that over 2003 and it upgraded everything
 that I had to 2007. &nbsp;Now I installed Office 2010, which upgraded everything as before, but now it keeps asking me for the CD key every time I open up something, and has a status of unlicensed even though I have a valid CD key. I mean, it still works and everything,
 but I would really like to know what I can do to straighten this out, as I heard if the software is unlicensed I am not getting all of the features that I should be getting. &nbsp;Also, I have three licenses, so has Office Anytime Upgrade been counting all of the
 attempts as activating the product, seeing as I have a valid key?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            The message is talking about&nbsp; Office Pro Trial, and your license key is for Home and Student.&nbsp; So you probably did have the trial clicked during 2010 install.<br />
<br />
2003 Home and Student does NOT include Outlook, Access and Publisher. You may have had student discount deal for Office Pro 2003, called Office Academic.<br />
<br />
If you want Outlook 2010, you should simply buy Office Home and Business 2010, or Pro.&nbsp; The 2010 anytime upgrade program allowed you to pay the difference between the list prices of your existing bundle (Home and Student) and the upgrade to bundle.&nbsp; BUT, I
 don't think MS offers it any more for 2010 because MS is no longer selling 2010. You would have to contact a MS sales person directly to confirm this.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can run Office 2010 and Outlook 2003, but there is no integration between 2003 and 2010.<br />
<br />
So the first thing to do is get rid of all of the unactivated 2010 programs to hopefully get rid of the message.&nbsp; Then boot the computer and do an Office Repair of your 2003 installation, followed by a Repair of your 2010 installation (if you want to make the
 2010 apps to be the defaults when you double click on their files).<br />

<p>Hi Techsol,</p>
<p>From my experiencing, there is no change required for the email account.<br />
About the impact after an email account is configured for SMTP replay, it depends on the methods you set up it, such as SMTP client submission, Office 365 SMTP relay or direct send.<br />
About the settings for these three methods, please refer to:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn554323(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn554323(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is recommended that you use a separate account to configure SMTP Relay.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

            YES you can install both at the same time. Yes there are a few issues, but they can be dealt with for the most part. There are 2 main remaining issues. One is that you can only have one version of Outlook installed at a time. The installer will NOT allow
 more than one.&nbsp; The other is a windows limitation. You can only assign program to be default for a file type. So you have to chose.&nbsp; Not a biggie.<br />
<br />
If you want two copies of Outlook you would have to install one in a virtual computer running on your system, ie Oracle Virtualbox.<br />
<br />
The main extra step you have to take is add "NoReReg" registry keys as described in the following tips:<br />

<span>Dual Install - Working with Multiple Versions of Office<span>&nbsp;
</span></span>

</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>This tip describes the specific steps and choices during the 2010 custom install. After you have the multiple versions installed you still have some additional steps to do. They are described in this tip:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=762</a>
</span></p>
<p>With multiple versions installed, there is one issue you can’t avoid, Default Windows File Associations. Only one app can be used to open the files by double clicking in Windows Explorer. You have to pick which one.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<span>Personal Supplemental instructions</span>
<p>MS tends to put everything in separate folders and with long wordy names.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I decided to consolidate things somewhat.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I navigated to the “Start” menu and edited folder and shortcut names to be more concise.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created a single “Microsoft Office” folder and migrated all of the shortcuts into it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created shortcuts to the 3 “2003 to 2007 Interactive Command References”. Then I started renaming the shortcuts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In my case I had Office 2003 and Office 2007, so I renamed them as follows:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>“2003 Excel”<br />
“2003 PowerPoint”<br />
“2003 Word”<br />
“2007 Excel”<br />
“2007 Excel 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
“2007 PowerPoint”<br />
“2007 PowerPoint 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
“2007 Word”<br />
“2007 Word 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
etc…</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Word 2003<br />
Word 2007<br />
Word 2010<br />
Word 2003 to 2010 Mapping<br />
Excel 2003<br />
Excel 2007<br />
Excel 2010<br />
Excel 2003 to 2010 Mapping<br />
etc…</p>
<p>As well, I decided to keep both sets of ``Office Tools`, so I kept one folder and renamed the shortcuts using the same pattern, ie starting with the year.</p>
<p>I also do custom installations, specifying unique installation folders to further separate the installations. It isn't completely successful, some common folders are still used, &nbsp;but it seems to help.</p>
<p>Microsoft's recommendations are incomplete regarding Word - see
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm</span></a> for further recommendations with regard
 to shared resources that are better not shared.</p>
<p>Office apps also work better also if their startup folders are not shared.</p>
<p>In the case of Excel I would relocate the contents of the (Excel 2003) XLSTART folder to a new sub folder of the existing XLSTART -The start-up folder location is stored in the registry at<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common\Xlstart</p>
<p>Set the value to match the sub new folder name e.g. Office11XLSTART. That should sort out Excel 2003. Create a similar sub folder and registry entries for Office 2010 i.e.Office14XLSTART and at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Xlstart</p>
<p>The same idea applies to Word’s startup and template folders.</p>

<p>Microsoft Office Outlook 2010 cannot coexist with any earlier version of Microsoft Outlook. When you install Outlook 2010, the Setup program removes Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, Microsoft Office Outlook 2003, and Microsoft Outlook 2002.
<span>The Setup program removes these versions of Outlook even if you click to select the Keep these programs check box in the Removing Previous Versions dialog box</span>.</p>

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just purchased a product key for Microsoft Office 2016 Professional Plus, but the one in my computer is Microsoft Office 2013. Is there anyway I can download Microsoft Office 2016 or upgrade my current one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>As Palcouk is trying to point out, Pro Plus is a very LIMITED distribution bundle.&nbsp; IF you bought it (paid for it) any other way (say an online store), it is an illegal resale.&nbsp; Contact your credit card company to cancel the transaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a legal copy, the place you bought it from should have provided you with a download link for the installation file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are seeing Office 2013 on your computer, that is almost certainly a factory installed free trial.&nbsp; You will have to uninstall it before you can activate your purchased copy of 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try these MS sites to get the installation file. I don't know if they will have Pro plus:</p>

    <title>Outlook bug with CC and BCC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rethinking2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook bug with CC and BCC</h2>
                    I just opened an Outlook account and sent 3 test messages. Each message contained a TO, CC and/or BCC addresses to different domains:<br />
<br />
myname.yahoo.com<br />
myname.gmail.com<br />
myname.uc.edu (my university address)<br />
<br />
There was only one address in each of the spaces (TO, CC and BCC).<br />
<br />
After sending, all 3 copies of the message arrived at the address of the TO mailbox, and none were sent to the CC and/or BCC addresses. i did this three different times, changing the combination of addresses each time the test message was sent. I have 3 copies
 of the first message sitting my my Yahoo mailbox, 3 copies of the second message sitting in my Gmail mailbox, and 3 copies of the third message sitting in my university account. None of those mail accounts have a copy of the other two messages.
<br />
<br />
I created all three messages in Outlook while online. I downloaded the messages using Eudora 7.1 (paid). The mailboxes in Eudora have worked for many years, and have never failed to correctly sort the messages to where they belong. They still work for everything
 except messages sent from my new email address on Outlook. Consequently, I don't think Eudora is the problem.
<br />
<br />
I can't understand how messages sent to different email addresses at different domains would receive all the messages sent to the TO address, and none sent to the CC or BCC addresses. Any helpful suggestions or comments would be appreciated! Thanks.
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've simulated your concern and it is working at our end. To isolate the issue, do you receive any bounced message? Do you encounter this issue when using other Outlook.com accounts? Does the issue happen in different email addresses or recipients?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            fwiw, I tried doing the exact same thing (no Eudora though) and all my emails were sent fine and received fine.<br />
<br />
I am not clear how Eudora is coming into the picture.&nbsp; Did you send the messages from Outlook.com or from Eudora?&nbsp; Have you tried from a different machine and also tried leaving Eudora out of the picture altogether for the time being?<br />

            My response was to the original poster who mentions they are using Eudora.<br />
<br />
When you say you use MS Outlook, are you talking about the application (part of the office suite) or the Outlook.com website?&nbsp; This forum is for the outlook.com website.<br />
<br />
Either way, I am not sure what the issue could be if this was working for you a few days ago.&nbsp; I can only relay (while I appreciate it is of little help to you) that cc and bcc are working fine for me on outlook.com<br />

            Sorry I see that now about Eudora. But sounds as though we have the same problem. I switched to Outlook.com from Hotmail to see if that would sort but no the same problem. So have now switched back to Hotmail

            I suppose the one difference could be that you migrated from Hotmail and I created a brand new outlook.com account.<br />
<br />
What if you try create a new account and see if it works.&nbsp; Not that this may be an acceptable workaround for you, but it may help narrow down the problem area - if it does in fact work from the new account.<br />

<p>My situation is that I have Office 365 (corporate). I am able to change the photo via&nbsp;outlook.office.com and it updates in Skype, Sharepoint, etc immediately, but I cannot get the Outlook photo to change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It did work as of last week (before a recent Office 365 update, but now Outlook is the only app that is using a cached version of the photo.</p>

            <p>Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I certainly do appreciate your trying to help me with this problem, and when you mentioned getting help from somebody that is computer literate I contact the Dell folks, the ones that help me out occasionally. They did a lot of looking around and they finally
 got back to me and told me that the Windows 7 Home Premium InPrivate Browsing cannot be turned off. I find that a little bit strange, but since I not a very computer literate guy then I think I'll just let it go and forget about. However, like I said, "I really
 do appreciate your attempt to help me out with this problem." </p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GPEDIT instructions didn't work for you because GPEDIT.MSC isn't included in home versions of Windows. It's in Professional and Enterprise versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Closing all instances of Internet Explorer should take you out of InPrivate Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting the computer should also do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Another option:</strong></p>
<p>It's possible that one or more of your IE shortcuts have been modified to open in InPrivate Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On every shortcut you use to open IE (Start, Desktop, Taskbar, etc.) right-click the icon&gt; Properties&gt; &nbsp;Target. Has "-private" been added to the Target field?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either of these would be a normal Target:</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been modified:</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" -private</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of yours have been modified,&nbsp;edit the Target by removing the </p>
<p><strong>-private</strong></p>

    <title>Marking tasks complete for Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rainer f  say:</h3>
<h2>            Marking tasks complete for Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>In Outlook 2013, it seems the behavior for marking tasks as complete has changed. I am connected to both an outlook.com account and a corporate Exchange account. For the Exchange account everything works as usual, compared to Outlook 2010.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, something has change for the outlook.com account. If I look at the To-Do list in My Tasks, it shows me all tasks for all accounts, and I have two options Mark Complete and Remove from List in the Manage Task group on the Home ribbon tab. Mark complete
 works fine in this view. However, when I look at Tasks for each account separately, Mark Complete disappears for the outlook.com account. I have also created a custom
<br />
Favorites" tab that includes the Mark Complete command, and it is grayed out for the outlook.com account. With Outlook 2010, I didn't have that problem, Mark Complete was always available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts? I'd much rather look at tasks from each account separately (home vs work) instead of having them all lumped together in To-Do List.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove and re-add the Outlook.com account from the profile.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then you may create new Outlook profile following the steps from this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add only the Outlook.com account into new Outlook profile and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>If you are able to use the Mark complete option on Outlook.com account in new Outlook profile, setup the exchange account and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply with results to assist you better.</p>

            Thank you for your suggestions. Not surprisingly, neither re-adding the account to the current profile nor creating a new profile solved the problem. Mark Complete continues to be grayed out.<br />
<br />
The ability to sync tasks directly is new. Quote from a Nov Office blog entry<br />
<a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2012/11/15/put-the-power-of-outlook-behind-your-outlook-com-email.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2012/11/15/put-the-power-of-outlook-behind-your-outlook-com-email.aspx</a>:<br />
"Outlook 2013 uses newly-added support for the rich Exchange Active Sync (EAS) protocol that has become the gold standard used by smartphones and other mobile devices. EAS will sync mail, calendar, contacts and tasks from your Outlook.com account! We've heard
 many requests from users who want to sync their tasks from an Outlook.com account, and now you can. "<br />
<br />
I suspect the problem I noticed reflects some inconsistency/incompatibility/bug in the implementations of EAS on the outlook.com and the Outlook 2013 sides of the interaction.<br />

<h3> david inns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 create groups greyed out still&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Why is this still missing in Outlook 2016?&nbsp; It worked in 2010 version not in 2013 with a Hotmail/outlook account, I had hoped that with the number of comments in 2013 version relating to this matter, Microsoft might have employed someone who could sort it.
 Microsoft wants us all to have an account and 9 times out of 10 this is either a Hotmail or Outlook account, so why make this simple, but much needed productive feature not available to those users? I know of the workrounds using Quick Steps and categories/view
 people in lists. However if you change a category it does not sync with Quick Steps, with Outlook being marketed as a productive tool, this does not seem very productive!</p>
<p>Microsoft please change this.</p>

 and add it back (so it gets converted from EAS to Exchange), you'll be able to create contact groups in Outlook and they'll sync up. &nbsp; I have no idea when the account will be migrated - should be within the next 6 months or so. They are supposed to send out
 emails either before or after, so you know, but you can check by logging into outlook.com and seeing if the banner above the inbox &nbsp;says outlook.com &nbsp;or outlook mail. "Outlook mail" means it was migrated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Good, however why has it taken so long to do when the problem was noted as soon as 2013 arrived?</p>
<p>I have an office 365 home subscription, I assume the migration will apply?</p>
<p>Even home users belong to or run social activities, whereby they need to communicate with the whole membership. This was precisely the reason I took out a subscription and I am sure I am not alone.</p>

            <p>They've known about this problem&nbsp;since before the release of Office 2013&nbsp;but they couldn't fix it because the old outlook.com handled groups differently than outlook.&nbsp; They didn't think it would affect a large number of people as most people read mail in
 the browser. It would be a major rewrite to fix it. The migration a huge undertaking, but in the end it will be worth it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The changes will apply to all outlook.com users, whether you use the home subscriptions or not, outlook or the web interface. They are retiring the old mail system.

            I think Microsoft should take the lead and post simple work around videos on Youtube and their own site, not everyone, including me is a 'super user' and knows every function of outlook. I run a local football club and need to send group emails, I don't
 need to spend 3 days searching or learning how to do a 'workaround', Microsoft need to make the answers simple, clear easy to find and understand. I'd rather learn from Microsoft directly than from a guy with an action cam strapped to his head posting a video
 on Youtube about how to create a group email in Outlook 2016. As a world leader of office and pc operating system software who's known about this issue for years this is unacceptable.

            <p>Absolutely agree with you.</p>
<p>Why is it that software can be sold with parts inaccessible and greyed out and we are expected to tolerate it?</p>
<p>If I buy a cooker I don't expect the grill to not work and be told "we knew about that and are working on a &nbsp;solution".</p>
<p>In that instance the goods simply would not sell or even be marketed. But different rules seem to apply to software.

            <p>I also agree -- I am a senior and although it is probably easy for today's tech savvy kids -- they continually change things and us old guys are so frustrated trying to learn new tricks that most of us just give up. Consequently I have trouble convincing
 our 55+ community to get computerized! We are not up for learning something new every few months or whenever they put out an update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am setting up a community email group and have already said it is so easy to set up a group. Of course it was back with 2010! Now we have gone backwards!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus why not tell people that there is a problem. I spend days -- if not weeks trying to figure this problem out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of frustration I finally found this site and eventually this particular problem.&nbsp;Having me and everyone lose to me thinking I don't know what I am doing -- then finding out that it's the pro's that don't!</p>

            <p>Unbelievable!!&nbsp; Windows Live 2012 worked great, Hotmail was terrific with group email catagories - both set-up and ease of use.&nbsp; Just type in the group name and off you go ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a car club website and have 90 people on the roster.&nbsp; Now with Windows 10 and the latest Outlook email program, I can't communicate with anybody, there's apparently no way to re-create my group email lists, and no help that I can find.&nbsp; A first-rate
 disaster for me!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to create a group email category of all my car club people, then allow me to just type in the car club's name in the "To:" line, which then auto-fills the group addresses (like it used to work with Live mail 2012)??</p>

<h2>            Missing SharePoint OpenDocument Class</h2>
                    <p>I feel like I am going round in circles with this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am IT support for a customer who had Office 2010 H&amp;B (32bit) installed and for his 3rd party software needed the "SharePoint OpenDocument Class" to be enabled. Which to my understanding is an add on in IE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He is running a Windows 10 pro machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some googling I have come across solutions which say to repair office, and then after a restart the add on will appear (under show all add ons) in IE. But I have had no luck with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We signed this customer up for Office 365 Business Premium and installed Office 2016, still no add on. (Tried with both x86 and x64)</p>
<p>I spoke to Office 365 support who said to use Office 2013 32bit which comes as part of O365 BP. So I installed this, rebooted etc. Still no add on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found a solution advising to use 32 bit IE. I have tried this, still no add on. (IE 11)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else advise on this issue?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi NyckieD,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The add-on may be related to the SharePoint and you have the Office 365 Business Premium subscription, I suggest you try the following to see the outcome.<span><br />
</span><span>1. Navigate to a library in SharePoint Online.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Return to classic SharePoint.</span><span><br />
3. Open a library with an Office application such as Word.</span><span><br />
4. Close IE and then reboot IE to check if the add-on appears.</span></p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 Question regarding Date &#38; Time differences.</h2>
                    <p>I am coming to understand how one can calculate the difference between two dates and times, and then display the result in hours.&nbsp; What I would like to know is how do I approach the task of taking the out the number of non-working hours, including lunch
 breaks?&nbsp; For example; A job started on the 14th of October 2017 at 10:00 and finished on the 15th of October at 12:00.&nbsp; Lets say that the total number of actual hours was 26.&nbsp; I would like to allow for the fact the Office hours are 0900 to 1700 with a lunch
 break at 1300 till 1350. How do I work out the actual hours spent on the job taking out the non working hours?</p>

<p>A lot depends on how you have set up the worksheet and whether the set up is flexible. I don't know if you have a separate sheet for each job or if you have multiple jobs on one sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally would set it up&nbsp;something like the example&nbsp;below with a separate sheet for each job. The worksheet could have other data also but the following example only includes the relevant data to perform the&nbsp;calculation as per your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the Break hours are left empty where the job does not go past the break on any particular day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you have quoted the date 14th of October 2017, I am assuming that you are probably in a d/m/y date format area same as I am so have set up the example with that date format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer the method of including the Break Start and Finish times and then it can be adjusted for each day so say someone only has 30 min break then can insert 13:00 to 13:30. Of course you could just use one row and insert the length of the break rather
 than start and finish times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not help then really need to see a copy of your workbook. Upload a copy to OneDrive. (See below for guidelines to upload a copy of your workbook)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4007042c-0103-4982-969b-3438433031b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4007042c-0103-4982-969b-3438433031b5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Guidelines to upload a workbook on OneDrive. (If you already use OneDrive and your process for saving to it is different then you can probably start at step 8 to get the link but please zip the file before uploading.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Zip your workbooks. Do not just save an unzipped workbook to OneDrive because the workbooks open with On-Line Excel and the limited functionality with the On-Line version causes problems.
</li><li>To Zip a file: In Windows Explorer Right click on the selected file and select Send to -&gt; Compressed (zipped) folder). By holding the Ctrl key and left click once on each file, you can select multiple workbooks before right clicking over one of the selections
 to send to a compressed file and they will all be included into the one Zip file.
</li><li>Do not use 3rd party compression applications because I cannot unzip them. I do not clog up my computer with 3rd party apps when there are perfectly good apps supplied with windows.</li><li>Go to this link.&nbsp; https://onedrive.live.com</li><li>Use the same login Id and Password that you use for this forum.</li><li>Select Upload in the blue bar across the top and browse to the zipped folder to be uploaded.</li><li>Select Open (or just double click). (Be patient and give it time to display the file after initially seeing the popup indicating it is done.)</li><li>Right click the file on OneDrive and select Share.</li><li>Select "Get a Link" from the popup menu.</li><li>Click in the field displaying the link and it should highlight and then Copy and Paste the link into your reply on this forum. (I suggest that you avoid the "Copy" button on the "Get a link" screen because it introduces additional steps that are not required.)</li></ol>
