<h2>            How do I fix user name in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have two laptops side-by-side, both Windows 10 Home, whatever is latest build since they are both on auto-update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On both laptops, I am an administrator and I sign in with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one laptop, my user name in applications that display it is essentially correct - it's my first name.</p>
<p>On the other laptop, my user name is ugly - it's the first five letters of the Microsoft account email address, followed by 000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Bob and my MS account email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. On laptop 1 (one), my user name shows up as Bob. On laptop 2 (two), my user name shows up as georg000. I want it to show Bob.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 re-image has corrupted BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 re-image has corrupted BIOS</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just been given three new HP Laptops with Windows 10 Home - Build 1703 on them. I tried to re-image them with the clients Windows 10 Enterprise - Build 1607 &amp; it's corrupted the BIOS &amp; "bricked" two of them. HP have agreed to replace them under warranty
 but have said they're advising all users to stay on 1607 until further notice (Not helpful when they're shipping with later versions on them!!!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've re-imaged hundreds of laptops from Home to Enterprise &amp; NEVER had any issues, so this is a nightmare!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is... How do I get the clients Enterprise image onto a new Build 1703??? Will it work if I upgrade the image on another PC to 1703/1709 or how about installing a fresh Windows 10 Enterprise - Build 1607 &amp; then re-image them? I need some help
 with this as I don't want to destroy any more laptops!!! HP certainly don't have any answers for me sadly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I've tried to reinstall the BIOS using HP's tools &amp; instructions but that's failed too, the laptops are 100% DEAD thanks to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-T.I.A. :)</p>

            Have done that now, however it's disappointing Microsoft isn't being more helpful with ALL users/forums during this Fall Creators Update DISASTER!!! ...or perhaps they just don't know or don't care? :(

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I am not sure how you the scanner is connected to the computer. If it is a USB connection, try and plug the connection to another USB slot.
</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 update and the &#34;All your files are exactly where you - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 update and the &#34;All your files are exactly where you left them&#34; message scared me so much. Not even a year ago I lost all of my files, photos, writing, artwork</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: New Windows 10 Update&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got the new Windows 10 update and the "All your files are exactly where you left them" message scared me so much. Not even a year ago I lost all of my files, photos, writing, artwork... basically everything to a ransomware virus and this looked exactly
 like it was happening again. Especially seeing as the update happened in the middle of using my computer, it didn't even wait until I shut down.</p>
<p>During this update I lost an icon on my desktop that I can't name, I cannot turn off cortana, and my volume is now uncontrollable by the button on the computer keypad. The button on the keypad shows that my volume is on mute and I cannot change it to any
 other option but noises are still coming out of the speakers and the only way I can control the volume is on the screen by using the volume icon in the bottom right corner. This is very inconvenient. I'd really like this basic function of my computer back
 and I'm not sure what is going on. If somebody could explain this all to me and how to fix it, that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update - it's worse than I thought. I can't even turn off my computer anymore. The shut down options on the screen just take me back to the login screen and holding the power button on the keypad only puts it into sleep mode. It has also been turning back
 on from sleep mode for almost 10 minutes now just so I can try shutting it off again. It is 6am and I have been dealing with this for hours. I would just like to get some sleep.</p>

                    <span>

<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>What
 are the complete list of services that must be enabled to provide file sharing (not simple file sharing) on Windows XP Pro?</span></strong></p>
<p>Some time ago one of those registry cleaner programs disabled a bunch of standard services, and now file sharing doesn't work. "Sharing" doesn't even appear when I right-click on a folder.</p>
<p><strong><span>I've
 enabled "server" "net logon" and a few others, but it still doesn't work.</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Alex</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The Sharing should work with the Default setting of the Services.</p>

<p>Then.</p>
<p>Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the
 Trusted Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>

            Hello, this issue happened after upgrading my computer from win 7 to win 8 on 10/28/12.<br />
<br />
1. The only drive that shows up under my computer is the internal disk drive (drive c:).
<br />
<br />
2. When I insert a flash drive into the USB port, the drive is recognized (it shows up under device manager and disk manager) but it doesn't show up under My Computer, so the drive cannot be used.<br />
<br />
3. The same thing occurs when inserting a flash card in the computer's card reader.<br />
<br />
4. The same thing occurs when inserting a CD or DVD into the optical drive. The optical drive shows up as installed and working correctly under device manager and disk manager, but doesn't show up under My Computer, which makes it unusable.<br />
<br />
Also, even though the optical drive is showing up as installed in device manager and also in disk manager, it isn't being recognized at all by the system as a whole. Windows says there is no optical drive installed.<br />

 stumbled upon "tdrdelay set to 8". It worked for 2 days then that error showed up. Deleted tdrdelay, error went back to "driver stopped and recovered". What is this? Any fix? You might wanna check the updates recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>80% of the solution is for intel HD graphics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any recommendable programs for registry fixing? For AMD graphics?</p>

            <p>I was able to solve mine a few days ago with the following...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Used DDU to uninstall graphics driver then installed new drivers with "windows 10" compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Updated Win10 up to the LATEST. It restarted for about 20-40mins installing new updates as well as a driver for my "AMD HD5000/6000 series"(this driver was included in Update and Security and not from AMD, so I am assuming it was from Microsoft)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Cleaned my CPU. Wipes, Blower, Disassemble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it works fine again!</p>

<h2>            Non genuine Windows 7 copy upgrading to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi, last week, I bought a desktop computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit key, so I was planning on installing the OS to my new desktop.
</p>
<p>(And any other PC or laptop didn't use that Windows 7 key)</p>
<p>But for some reason, Windows said that my key is used from somewhere, so I thought it was just a bug.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I searched up Windows 7 Home Premium iso files, I found it on this site.</p>
<p>http://getintopc.com/softwares/operating-systems/windows-7-home-premium-free-download-iso-32-bit-64-bit/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I started to install it, and when I got into the key validating section, it said that my key was expired. So my key is not working.</p>
<p><strong>But the problem is that my Windows 7 is also non genuine "COPY."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I promise, I don't want to be an illegal user. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I searched up Windows 8.1 Pro, and I decided to buy that.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Microsoft had offered Windows 7 upgrade tool for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's my question.</p>
<p><strong>Will non activated &amp; non genuine copy of Windows 7(possible software counterfeiting) BE a genuine copy of Windows 8.1 AND not infected from the software counterfeiting if I use the upgrade tool right and activate it?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the support! Have a great day to all!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><strong>P.S. I ran full scan from "Norton Security" and I had no viruses.</strong></p>

<p>Is it a Full Retail Win8.1 Pro disk or an upgrade disk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From whom did you purchase it? cf. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3107057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>You won't be able to upgrade to Win8.1 - but you should be able to format the hard-drive &amp; then do a clean install of Win8.1 or Win10...as long as it's a Full Retail version.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning to buy my Windows 8.1 Pro CD key from here digitally. (not disk)</p>
<p>http://www.bonanza.com/listings/Microsoft-Windows-8-1-Pro-OEM-Key-32-and-64-bit-Digital-Delivery/274717829</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Microsoft is not providing Windows 8.1 ISO files, I am planning to upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 using this upgrade tool from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-from-windows-7-tutorial</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have downloaded Windows 7 from here (that I found this Windows is not genuine)</p>
<p>http://getintopc.com/softwares/operating-systems/windows-7-home-premium-free-download-iso-32-bit-64-bit/</p>
<p>
</p><p>But heres the question,</p>
<p>Is it okay to upgrade Windows 8.1 from A NON GENUINE Windows 7(Possible infected by virus)?
</p>
<p>Will the virus still be in my PC after the upgrade?</p>
<p><strong>Also, I have ran full scan using Norton Security and I had no virus found.</strong></p>

            <p>Again, your best bet would be (a) formatting the hard-drive (thus eliminating any infections) and then (b) doing a clean&nbsp;install of Windows 8.1. Once you've Validated the clean install of Windows, you'll be able to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot upgrade a "Windows is not Genuine" install of any Windows version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: When you get to the "Buy&nbsp;Windows8.1" step, the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant will point you to
<em>Windows 10</em>, not Windows 8.1, now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: I would NOT recommend purchasing or downloading any software from or&nbsp;via bonanza.com, getintopc.com, eBay, craigslist.org,
<em>et alia</em>. Try a legit site like <strong>tigerdirect.com</strong> or even&nbsp;<strong>microsoftstore.com</strong>.</p>

<h2>            surface dock is garbage - external monitor issues</h2>
                    <p>A sure sign of something being garbage is when it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. The pitiful Surface dock fits that bill. Its ability to recognize external monitors is intermittent at best. Generally when I connect to a 20" monitor I only have to
 unplug everything a few times before it realizes I want to use that monitor. Sometimes though, it recognizes the monitor but not the scaling required so I end up with a giant task bar and oversized windows. Connecting to my 32" monitor.is a total cr*p shoot.
 Clearly the thing is not built properly. Msft knows this because of the huge number of complaints about it, and yet they do nothing to recall it or fix the firmware. How the dock ever got out of the lab escapes me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would N E V E R personally buy this garbage and only have it because my employers decided to spend a ton of money on an overpriced product made by a company that has no track record in hardware.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for dropping by at Surface Community. We totally understand your concern, for sure Microsoft don’t want you to have this kind of experience. Especially for your colleagues who are also experiencing this problem.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you don’t mind, we do have some questions to further isolate this concern on your Surface dock.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>May we know on what troubleshooting steps that you’ve already tried to fix this concern of yours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do have suggested monitor for our Surface, may we know also on what model and brand of external monitor that you are using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the current OS build and OS version of your Surface?</p>
<p>(You can check it by going to <strong>Cortana Search box</strong>&gt; Type there <strong>
“Winver”&gt;</strong> Press <strong>Enter</strong>.)</p>
<p>

<p>I've done everything suggested here and on the other forums where people are complaining about this product,&nbsp; including updating firmware.</p>
<p>The product should work with any compatible OS version but mine is:</p>
<p>Win 10 1703&nbsp; 15063.1746</p>

            Surface is supplied by my employer so they manage updates etc. I was able to update the firmware - made no difference. Plus it's the same old Msft story - "we didn't make it properly but here's a few updates to fix things". Why isn't it made to work with
 most common environments out of the box? <br />

    <title>Win 10 Pro upgrade using Win 8 Pro product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robcoxxa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Pro upgrade using Win 8 Pro product key</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new computer running Win 10 Home. When I went to upgrade to Win 10 Pro using my Win 8 Pro product key from my old computer, the upgrade wouldn't activate.
</p>
<p>Now I'm stuck with a bunch of error messages (mainly 0xC004C003) and am being told windows isn't activated. I can't seem to get my activated Win 10 Home back.</p>
<p>I don't have a product key for the Win 10 Home because it came pre-installed. There's no product code recorded on the packaging or labelling on the device.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>How do I either</p>
<ul>
<li>activate the Win Pro upgrade, or</li><li>Get my activated Win 10 home back?</li></ul>

<h2>            I was playing the game &#34;9 Clues 2&#34; from Artex Mundi, and it crashed</h2>
                    I have Windows 10, fully updated, hardware and software drivers also fully updated. I was playing the hidden object game I got from the Windows Store called 9 Clues 2 from Artex Mundi software developer company. It crashed right in the middle of a scene
 from the game. I could not use task manager, and I had to hit the reset button on my desktop to force reboot. This is frustrating. Please look into this issue.&nbsp; This happened one other time when I tried to power down my computer and I had to force reboot,
 and another time playing Bioshock Infinite.

            <p>Hello Ernie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts or corrupt Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check if it helps.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a><br />
(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, <strong>run system file checker(SFC)</strong> and see if it helps.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Child&#39;s Account&#47;Profile won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>My child was unable to open their profile/account as it stated there was a failure in the Group Profile Service and to contact the system administrator. I opened my account on the PC and received the following Error loading Form:</p>

</p><p>Unable to load Form Comrade.MainForm due to the following:<br />
<br />
- A generic error occurred in GDI+.<br />

</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if you still get that Error loading Form. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs
 that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the game. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p><span>You may create a new child account and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<p>^isn't that what people are doing here on the support-forums?</p>
<p>Chat function doesn't work in my country, twitter support &nbsp;took 10 hours to tell me to try phone, phone wasn't available yersterday, nor now for that matter, heck I even tried on Facebook with no luck..</p>
<p>In short I have been trying since sunday to get some kind of support out of Microsoft in many ways now and all I have gotten out of that is advice to try one one of the other ways that isn't available for me in Denmark..</p>
<p>It's amazing that such a large company with so much revenue pays so little attention to their customers when they are in need of help, because the service we pay for isn't avaible to us

<p><strong>Hi Itsallzen,</strong></p>
<p><strong>What I can suggest you do is</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>Disconnect your router or modem
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>Make sure your Xbox 360 console is turned off</strong></span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>Keep all 2 or 3 devices turned off for 5-10 minutes
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>Try signing back in</strong></span>
</li></ul>
<div><strong>Now if the above does not work I would suggest waiting mabey 12-24 hours. There may be an issue with the Xbox Live servers and will be back shortly. If you are still experiencing some issues again please call up your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
 and talk to them. There may be an issue with your internet. Hope this helps out for you.</strong></div>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to give advise Budder. &nbsp;It didn't actually work out though. &nbsp;I still can't get access. &nbsp;I have also re-checked / re-set static IP and port forwarding which hasn't worked either. &nbsp;I am now getting a new error code of 80151909......the
 search continues. &nbsp;Thanks again for trying.</p>

<p>Error code 80151909 occurs when you try to download your profile</p>
<p>Error code 8015190E occurs when you try to connect to Xbox Live on a different console</p>
<p>What you would want to do is go to account.live.com and sign in to your account once your are there click on "edit security info" and verify your security proofs and turn on the two step verification. Once it is on click on App password you will want to
 create an app password so that you can use it for the password on your Xbox console. What the app password is.. It is a password generated from the computer to over through hackers from trying to hack your Xbox console and profile. Once you have created it
 write it down go to your Xbox console and go to your storage device and delete your profile only off the console once you have delete it clear out the system cache 3 times and then click the guide button on your controller and re-download the profile using
 your email and app password for your account and that should fix the problem.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion Flintstone. &nbsp;Generated the password, deleted the profile and cleared the cache x 3. &nbsp;However, it is still not able to connection to Live and so I can't re-download my profile and don't have access to Live. &nbsp;Any other suggestions
 would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Many thanks for your help.</p>

<p>ok what u want to do is go to your network setting and if your are connected wired or wireless click on it then go to configure network&gt; additional setting&gt; restore to factory defaults // then go back and disconnect for the internet if its wired unplug it
 from the box and then go to the hard drive and clear the system cache 3 time and then shut it off once it shut down unplug from the wall for about 30 sec and then reconnect everything back to the Xbox and connect back to the internet and test the connection
 and you should be connected back the Xbox live</p>

            <p>Greetings Itsallzen1504!</p>
<p>Appreciate if you could post up the make and model of your router and your modem as well (if this is not a single device).<br /><br />Does your console terminates directly to the router?<br /><br />If its possible, with your console powered off, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safely remove the hard drive</a>. Plug in a USB flash drive (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">configured for use with the Xbox 360</a>) into a USB port on the front of your console. Power on your console (with the hard drive removed) and try download your profile from LIVE to USB drive.<br /><br />Post back and let us know how that goes and we'll go from there.</p>

<p>Hi taidara. My router is a Netopia 3347NWG - version 7.8.0r2. &nbsp;The link with the console is wireless. &nbsp;Moving the hard drive sounds very scary to a non-techie like me! :) Theconsole linked fine with Live until a few days ago. &nbsp;In that time I reset the router
 to sort out a general internet problem,but nothing else. &nbsp;Since then I re-set the port forwarding for ports 53, 80, 88, 1863 and 3074</p>

<p>All. &nbsp;Many thanks for your help and suggestions. This has finally been resolved. After resetting the Xbox to factory settings, I was unable to download the most recent update as I couldn't access Live so I burnt it on a cd and ran it from there. &nbsp;From then
 on it seemed to be a router problem which was odd as I had previously had good access to Live and had not made any changes. &nbsp;However, after messing about with some settings what seemed to impact was setting my router to G-mode only and removing the firewall
 on the router - I run Norton security on my pc anyway and have gone through the two step verification on Live. &nbsp;Can't say I really get what happened as I am not a techie, but am back in business with Live and very much appreciated all of your input in helping
 me resolve this. &nbsp;Regards.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 freezes and blue screen</h2>
                    I have a windows 7 home premium and logging on seems fine but will freeze at very erratic times and sometimes when it does not freeze I receive a BSOD and it says interrupt exception not handled I believe that is what it said and I have tried to run the
 built in test for the hard drive but it is having problems with that and I have tried to run a memory test and it will freeze up and all the text will disappear and leave a solid blue screen I also have tried to run the launch startup repair and it also freezes
 up and I have no clue what to do I had AVG that has expired and tried taking it off and thought it might be the problem and can not get it to uninstall completely I have tried manually and with norton 360 to uninstall and the avg removal tool and still nothing
 because it will freeze up and also when it freezes up and BSOD sometimes it will just have lines all over to where you cannot see nothing but like a zebra pattern and it has video on board any help would be greatly appreciat

            <p>I have finally gotten AVG of the computer but I tried running the memory test one more time and it froze once again but this time it made it all the way to 99% and I have left the test up for going on 4 hours now and nothing and the troubleshooting that
 you asked me about does not show any problems at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>bccode: 3d</p>
<p>bcp1: FFFFF80000B9C090</p>

<p>bcp4: FFFFF8800375A23C</p>
<p>
</p><p>that is the code that had popped up after the computer had gotten rebooted i hope this is what you was asking because I have ran out of ideas besides trying to reinstall the OS but really that is a last option because after getting AVG uninstalled I had
 tried viper rescue portable and it found about 10 threats before it froze booted back up into safe mode and try running again and this time got the blue screen again</p>

<h2>            Xbox one Fifa Points issues.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello to anyone that can help, hope everyone had a good xmas,</p>

<p>On to more important issues, EA is total BS, i have a nice shiny new xbox one and have done for over 3 weeks now, and for the last week i haven't been able to buy fifa points to take advantage of the 100k promo packs, needless to say im furious because i
 got bought some microsoft money for xmas and cannot use this in game currency because ea plain and simply put this *** excuse of a message up: There has been an error with the FIFA store checkout, please try again later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now going onto several days later not one person has helped this issue and also, EA have been amazing in relating myself to their more than useless webchat teams, "sorry are teams are on holidays at the moment"</p>

<p>It's because you're trying to use the Prepaid Microsoft cards. Many of us cannot use the $ redeemed from using those cards. Call xbox support and if you don't have a credit card and really want to buy FIFA Points, go buy a Visa gift card (preferably a reloadable
 one) until they fix it. I got one for Xmas and was able to buy stuff with it. </p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have configured a Windows Server 2012R2 Certificate Services computer and created a template to issue certificates and checked the box to allow the private key to be exported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the certificate manager on my Windows 10 tablet the option to select and export format that allows exporting the private key is not selectable. it is grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

    <title>Disc Region Code Error &#40;When there shouldn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t be - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disc Region Code Error &#40;When there shouldn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t be one&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having some trouble with my refurbished XBox 360. After Christmas holidays, I returned to my place and started up my xbox with a few new games to find that it was unable to read some of them. I tested more games and found that a lot of my old games,
 including ones I had already tried on this console, were getting region code errors too.</p>
<p>I'm using a variety of discs, all with an NTSC region code. The issue is that many of them trigger the error "Wrong Region: This disc's region code is incorrect for this console." And simultaneously, others don't. It'**** and miss with no discernable pattern.
 I have ensured that the discs are clean and scratch free. What should I try now? I'll provide any other necessary info if requested.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the help.</p>

<p>This use to happen to me occasionally on my old first year box before I replaced it. &nbsp;The DVD drive was worn out and I figured that this may be the cause, as it was not able to read the tiny region code file on the boot sector. &nbsp;Getting a refurb does not
 mean they repaired or updated everything. &nbsp;When they did the repair, they probably didn't even touch the DVD drive. &nbsp;Which version is it and does it have any kind of guarantee?</p>

<p>If it has a guarentee, I'd recommend sending it in for repairs</p>
<p>As Photon said, it's probably the DVD drive. </p>
<p>Tell Microsoft support about the problem and ask them to fix it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the person that refurbished the xbox used parts from a console from a different region thus making one good console out of two other consoles not realising that the major component from the other region console would affect yours.
