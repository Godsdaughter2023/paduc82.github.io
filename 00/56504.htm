<h2>            How do I to turn on Norton Security after recent update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Lately I've been receiving messages that I need to turn on my virus protection and firewall. I normally use Norton Security. Sometimes it will recognize Norton automatically, other times I will have to turn it on manually through the Control Panel. However,
 after a recent update, Windows Defender automatically comes up and begins scanning, but because it's out of date, it doesn't go past that. I also still get the VP/Firewall notifications, but when I go to turn Norton Security on in Virus Protection, it doesn't
 let me click on the "Turn On" button, when I go to turn it on in Firewall, nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>

            Uninstall the Norton software completely using <a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v60392881_EndUserProfile_en_us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
their removal tool</a>, then reinstall it.&nbsp; Better yet, just ditch the awful Norton software after uninstalling it and use Defender and the Windows Firewall.&nbsp;

<p>Best way to get help for anything like this is try youtube - there are many tutorials for Windows projects (of varying quality!) but a video can show you much more than anyone can write...</p>

<h2>            Elite Controller - Slow Turn</h2>
                    
<p>Today I have just noticed that my Elite Controller has Slow Turn on my Right Thumbstick. It only happens when pressed up and then rotated to the right. It will not turn to the right at full speed unless I let go and go from Center to Right.</p>
<p>Center/Rest position to Right has perfect turn speed. Going from Top/Up to Right has slow turn. I've been able to duplicate the issue 100% of the time by moving my right thumbstick from up &gt; right.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have this issue?</p>

    <title>SSD drive as primary drive&#40;250gb&#41; and HDD as storage hard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henrysteinberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD drive as primary drive&#40;250gb&#41; and HDD as storage hard drive&#40;500gb&#41;, but system does not boot.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took my old HDD from my broken computer and inserted it to my new one as storage drive. My primary drive is SSD and windows boots from it every time, but first time I inserted HDD, the computer booted up with no problems, but after a second restart, my
 computer is stuck on the HP loading screen when I turn on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it related to the system choosing the bigger drive? HDD is 500gb and SSD is 250gb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to change HP boot up, but I only found boot up queue which is just booting from drive and not from usb or any other port.</p>
<p>or is it related to the system trying to boot up different computer windows from the HDD and it would not work because the computer hardware is different from the old one?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have important data in my HDD and I would not want to reset the drive and erase everything on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found some other posts and I can not find alternate way to keep the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/want-to-make-ssd-primary-boot-drive-and-move-hdd/36af89a7-bcae-47f2-b7ad-b5619f5df81b</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although some answers I am looking for is in the link, but I would like to ask my own question just to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT Problem Cause :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem occurred when I tried to access 500 gb HDD user files, the user is not from this PC , and PC asked about administrator permission and I gave the permission to access the files. After that PC loaded about 5 minutes and didn't open the files. I cancelled
 the access and tried again, after 5 minutes my PC froze after explorer.exe crashed and i had no other way but to force shut down and restart. After the restart PC is now stuck on the boot up screen and endless loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>computer is HP Probook 430 G4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please some advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 1</p>
<p>I tried to go to disk management. it shows only SSD drive and shows nothing related to the HDD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connected the drive to the computer and it doesnt work also. only when restarted, but the catch is that when i restart my PC then it wouldn't boot anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This picture shows the place where the HDD is placed. inside the PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7da8c8ff-9580-4196-bc37-282fea9e4317?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7da8c8ff-9580-4196-bc37-282fea9e4317?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2</p>
<p>I tired to access windows recovery. I received this screen. pressing any key would just show the same picture.</p>
<p>After that i inserted a another HDD and it worked. but it is 50 GB only and then PC booted from the SSD as it should.
</p>
<p>To the point. PC automatically tries to boot up OS from the HDD when its memory exceeds SSD and OS is not installed on the HDD and it that's why PC wouldn't boot up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>how do i solve this issue ? only just downloading media creation tool and use that way or should I clone my windows to hdd? but how should I clone it when PC would not read the drive. only after restart computer reads it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a useful link&nbsp;https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-a-drive-letter-2626069 which shows how to change drive letter. I noticed that PC have automatically changed the partition names to the drive. when SSD is drive C://, then the newly installed drive
 is E:// and F:// .&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed i haven't. old drive had a C drive and the same is with SSD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marking the HDD partitions as "inactive" should fix the problem. You can do this by using a Windows 10 bootable repair flash disk to boot the machine into Repair Mode, then running the command Diskpart.exe from the Command Prompt. Please post again if you
 need detailed instructions.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and ocx controls not registering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rod_stone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and ocx controls not registering</h2>
                    <p>Problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing a program that was designed in Visual Studio 6 and running&nbsp; it as "Run As Administrator" you receive issues that various OCX controls are not registered.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most common ones is mscomctl.ocx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not receive these messages when you do not "Run as Administrator".&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your windows 10 was an upgrade you will not receive these errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If,&nbsp; after you install your program,&nbsp; you create a new windows local user, then login to that user,&nbsp; you will also not receive the error when you select "Run as Administrator'</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been verified on Windows 10 Pro and Home,&nbsp; Retail and OEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will also happen if you do a Reset/Refresh of Windows 10 and have it erase all files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One Solution:</p>
<p>You can run two simple commands at an elevated command prompt to resolve the issue (I do not recommend doing this unless you are on a clean install. Doing so may impact other programs that run 32bit OCX's)</p>
<p>
</p><p>for %f in (c:\windows\syswow64\*.ocx) do regsvr32 -u -s %f</p>
<p>for %f in (c:\windows\syswow64\*.ocx) do regsvr32&nbsp;-s %f</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will unregister all ocx controls in the syswow64 folder and then reregister them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another Solution:</p>
<p>If you do not feel that you wish to un-register / re-register your ocx's,&nbsp;simple create a new "LOCAL" user in windows 10, log into it.&nbsp; This will fix the issue that is mentioned here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have seen many posted issues related to OCX's and Windows 10 not registering with MVP's and other telling you to reregister your ocx.&nbsp; This may resolve an issue with that single OCX, however, the next program you install may need another.&nbsp; I hope that
 someone at Microsoft will actually read this, look into it and post a fix.&nbsp; Since there are still many&nbsp; companies that user VS6 applications that rely on these ocx's , this will save many hours of troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other suggestions that may assist with this, or know of a fix that can be applied to resolve this,&nbsp; Please post your solution.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen with the bugcheck 0x00000133</h2>
                    <p>From last month, when I opened Rstudio, or update a software called&nbsp;Fiji, my computer would have a blue screen with stop codes: dpc watchdog violation or&nbsp;irql_not_less_or_equal. Then I checked event&nbsp;viewer,&nbsp; there was an error in windows logs:</p>
<p>The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x00000133 (0x0000000000000001, 0x0000000000001e00, 0xfffff80393269378, 0x0000000000000000). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 3cbb3377-0780-4729-927d-09a50c57e476.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my&nbsp;memories and hard disks, and they were no problem.</p>
<p>So I don't know what's wrong with my computer.</p>

            Hi ChangLu2, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

                    Using Windows Live Mail 2009 running on Windows XP,&nbsp;we have our server configured to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;POP3 email.&nbsp;This is also not the first time this has happened:

</div>
<div>After a restart of Live Mail, we have had several folders go completely missing, I have checked the location C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail, and cannot find any trace of the emails that were
 moved to these folders before the entire folder disappeared, all the other folders are correctly listed in there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been able to restore some of the emails using Piriform Recuva, this also confirms they were deleted, but why? What's going on? Is there anyway to prevent this from happening again?</div>

            Thanks for the reply, only one slight issue with that; I was trying to be as informative with my question as possible but it seems I should have been slightly clearer with "we have our server configured",&nbsp;our email accounts are server&nbsp;created. i.e. they
 are not hotmail/live accounts, they are part of our e-commerce website and configured via CPanel.

<h3> cjc120  say:</h3>
<h2>            Choose your keyboard layout - Stuck after upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and every time I turn on the computer it takes me to a screen that says "Choose your keyboard layout" and I have no mouse or keyboard control. I have a Windows 10 bootable USB and a Windows 7 installation
 CD. This is what I have tried so far to fix it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Reset PC (failed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Startup Repair (failed on both Win 10 and Win 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- System Restore (again failed for both)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- System Image Recovery (failed for both)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Safe mode (goes to choose your keyboard for Windows 10, black screen and no mouse or keyboard control for Win 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Command prompt:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- sfc /scannow /offbootdir=D:\ /offwindir=C:\Windows (failed - resource protection could not perform the requested operation)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- chkdsk (no problems detected)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would really like to resolve this issue without having to do a clean install. Any help is appreciated.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To assist you better, share the information;</div>
<div>- Is the keyboard and mouse getting detected in BIOS?</div>
<div>- Did you check the date and time of the computer in BIOS? Is it correct?</div>
<div>- When the startup repair failed, did you get any error?</div>
<div>
<p>- What is the make and model of the computer, mouse and keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you<strong> </strong>to disconnect the mouse and keyboard from the computer and then reconnect it and check.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest you to create a new Installation Media by referring the below link and then try to perform Automatic Repair and check if&nbsp;it helps..

1.Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key F12 to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM.</div>
<div>2.After you boot your computer using Windows 10 DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text Press any key to boot from CD or DVD. Press any key.</div>
<div>3.Select the correct time and&nbsp; Keyboard type. </div>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, the BIOS does detect the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the time and date are correct in the BIOS.</p>
<p>This is the error log startup repair gives me - &nbsp;http://pastebin.com/J0e9ERCL</p>

    <title>X1 chirping sound and spontaneous shutoff - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            X1 chirping sound and spontaneous shutoff</h2>
                    
<p>I am having an issue with my XBOX One, wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar problem and fixed it. I will be playing a game or watching a show and the console will sporadically "chirp", sometimes this is all it does,
 a chirp (like the sound it makes when you manually press the white button on the front of it to turn it on). Sometimes however this chirping will be followed by immediate shutdown, no other warning than a chirp. I have not noticed ANY pattern, it seems to
 be completely random and generally the console will not boot back up, I will have to wait, sometimes unplug it for a few minutes and plug it back in. Last night I COULD NOT get the unit to turn on, period, I left it unplugged and it booted this morning but,
 chirped and shutdown several times before finally staying on for a good 2 hours, then abrupt shutdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I will probably contact support, I purchased it from Amazon and (of course) it was un-eligible for exchange just 2 weeks ago so that's out. Seeing if anyone has some ideas!</p>

<p>The chirping sound could be an internal fan having trouble spinning which maybe why it shuts down and wont boot up for some time. If its over heating it may shut itself off as a precaution and wont turn on again until its cooled down enough. I hope that
 is not the case though as I don't know how easy that would be to solve other than replacing the fan.</p>

<p>I had considered that, but it doesn't quite seem to fit. First off I haven't noticed any abnormal fan noises and or any excessive heat, the unit is very well ventilated, as is the power brick. But more importantly, this morning for example I turn it on,
 it booted right up, but was on for less than 2 minutes and immediately shut itself off. I rebooted it and it stayed on for oh, maybe 10 minutes, then shutoff. Then reboot again, it stays on for 2 hours. It would seem that if there was a heat issue it would
 be related to a) how long the unit was on, and b) how hard it is working. It seems to shut off just as often sitting on the home screen as playing a game.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem with a graphics card on a pc. It would do all the things you have just reported it wouldn't need to get that much hotter for it to switch off. You probably wouldn't notice any difference in temperature by feeling it yourself. It seems
 weird and you would think it would be consistent that it would shut off after a certain amount of use. But all sorts of things can effect it, from how long its been turned off to what your doing/playing on it. If it has a memory issue then you could get all
 sorts of strange symptoms. I'm not an expert by any means, but as I said it does sound very similar to a problem I had with that graphics card on my pc.

<p>It could also be that the fan has an intermittent problem which means it'll work sometimes and not others which would make the issue seem random.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need an up and running Windows 7 to do a Repair Upgrade Install.</p>
<p>It has to Boot up to the Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft stopped doing Repair Install by booting from the disk after XP.</p>
<p>Vista onwards is from within&nbsp;the up and running&nbsp;Desktop/Operating System.</p>
<p>

<p>There you have it: your personal files and installed applications are preserved. I found this especially handy for fixing corrupt operating system features. For example, I had disabled some features in Turn Windows Features on or off. When I
 tried to re-enable them, they would not work. Repair upgrade was able to fix this.</p>
<p>Of course, this means you will need to reapply any updates, since it basically replaces certain applications. It is an inconvenience, but achieves a functioning system if all else fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the above does not work, you might have to seriously consider doing a custom install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
<br />
Click Install Now<br />
<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the detailed response, but most of the things you list here I have already tried.&nbsp; I will try two console commands you list here that I have not yet tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In detail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: sfc /scannow doesn't execute and appears to be stuck in an infinite loop.&nbsp; When I run it, it immediately tells me a change must be made to my computer and that I need to restart and scan again.&nbsp; Restarting results in the exact same thing, it never
 actually scans anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: I have tried this command already, it doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: I have tried the last console command here but not the first two.&nbsp; When I get back from work today I will try them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One&nbsp;more thing of importance:&nbsp; I have tried startup repair and it never works.&nbsp; It always fails with a "startuprepairoffline" error.&nbsp; I have searched online quite a bit online and no one seems to understand what this error means...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried restoring to an older restore point, which completed successfully but did not help me boot into windows, I can't even get in with safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is something with drivers.&nbsp; Either I don't yet have the right drivers for my new motherboard (even though I tried to install them all ahead of time) or they are conflicting with the drivers for my old motherboard.&nbsp; I&nbsp;put in the driver
 cd included with my new motherboard and tried to install every driver on it that was applicable&nbsp;(for windows 7 64 bit) using the add driver option in windows recovery&nbsp;but it didn't help.&nbsp; Some of them failed to install which is peculiar because the same drivers
 failed to install when I tried to preinstall them on my old motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other advice?&nbsp; Would it help if I hooked up my old motherboard and uninstalled some old drivers?&nbsp; Would it help if I went into more detail about the new drivers that fail to install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated, I have almost a<strong> full terabyte </strong>
of programs and games installed and I really don't want to lose them because of a new motherboard.&nbsp; I have read online that a fair amount of people have been able to change motherboards and still keep their programs.&nbsp; I didn't even switch chipsets, I'm disappointed
 I can't get this to work.</p>

            If you know the name or names of the generic drivers, you can physically delete the files from C:\Windows\System32 and C:\Windows\System32\Drivers&nbsp; Their extensions will probably be *.inf.<br />
<br />
If you do not know, you could System Restore to just before you installed them.

            <p>The Microsoft engaged Support Engineer alleged "expert" is sending you on wild goose chases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That DISM command will not work on Windows 7 and starting the Windows Modules Installer Service will not make it work - that command will never work on Windows 7.&nbsp; There is a DISM on Windows 7 but that is not how you run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Modules Installer Service gets installed as a Manual start.&nbsp; That means it will start when it needs to start and stop when it needs to stop.&nbsp; There is no need for it to be running all day and night with nothing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you start it then restart your machine it will go back to the way it was (not started) so you have really changed nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when you get done, the DISM command still will not work.</p>
<p><br />
This should tell you that the alleged "expert" is not even trying their own ideas to see what happens.</p>

<h2>            Is it necessary to uninstall drivers before upgrading them&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I did a Windows 7 upgrade and had a second CD from Sony that had all the drivers I needed.&nbsp; I tried to manually install the drivers I need, and long story short, I didn't get all the funcntions I had before upgrading.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then used the CD to upgrade everything,
 including all the drivers I manually upgraded.&nbsp;&nbsp;How necessary&nbsp;was it to uninstall all the drivers before upgrading them?<br />
<br />
Will I notice any difference in performance?</p>

<span>Hi Jwblue,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>You need not uninstall any drivers for the devices before performing an upgrade.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In case some of the drivers are not compatible with Windows 7 it can pose an issue during the upgrade, hence we have to run the upgrade advisor and remove the drivers and software
 that are not compatible with Win 7 and need to reinstall it after the installation of Win7</span></p>
<p>
<span>After upgrading the Operating System, the devices require an update for the latest drivers. So an update for the drivers has to be performed, sometimes the drivers are updated
 automatically after the upgrade; sometimes they require manual upgrade from the manufacturer’s website.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Updating to the latest drivers for the devices is nothing but making the devices compatible with this Operating System.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 desktop icons not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sig rosenthal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 desktop icons not working properly</h2>
                    When I double-click a desktop icon windows explorer opens instead of the program pointed to by the icon(shortcut).
<br />
The properties on the icon are correct - it is identified as a shortcut and the shortcut points to the correct program, for example:<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Restore the .exe file association in Windows Vista, after incorrectly associating it with another application<br />
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/165/1/Restore-the-exe-file-association-in-Windows-Vista-after-incorrectly-associating-it-with-another-application.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/165/1/Restore-the-exe-file-association-in-Windows-Vista-after-incorrectly-associating-it-with-another-application.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Basically you need to restore the default File Associations.<br />
<br />
<span>When you double-click an .EXE file, the program may not launch, instead it may open in Notepad<br />
(displaying the .exe contents), or may launch in any other application.<br />
</span><a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/exeasso.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowsxp.mvps.org/exeasso.htm</span></a></p>
<p>When you run an .exe file on a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer, the file may<br />
start a different program<br />
