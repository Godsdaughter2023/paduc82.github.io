            Resetting windows or rolling back removes all installed programs. It's very time consuming to reinstall all programs. is there an alternative solution were the programs need not be reinstalled.

<p>The problem is evolving!!<br />
I did a windows reset and removed everything! now the windows is not responding at all. i cant access start menu, any settings window, not even the control panel window.!!<br />
I'm using a connected mouse as the screen issue is still there.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Monthly Security Roll Out Updates for Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> headdog1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Monthly Security Roll Out Updates for Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have a computer equipped with a AMD processor running Windows 7.&nbsp; For more than a month I've been working with several Microsoft Technicians (including a level 2) in trying to resolve the problem of the many Monthly Roll Out Security updates failing to
 configure and locking my computer down requiring me to kill the power and reboot.&nbsp; The technicians have tried many fixes including a complete re-install of Windows 7 all to no avail.&nbsp; I'm to the point where I'm concerned about the security of my computer and
 I'm reluctant to use it, especially involving financial matters.&nbsp; I'm continually told that they're working on a resolution and to give them time to resolve this matter, "Call in a month" is the standard answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:&nbsp; Since Microsoft has been, up to this point, unable to solve this problem that they seemed to have created and my computer has become practically unusable to me&nbsp;
<strong>WHAT DOES MICROSOFT PLAN TO DO ABOUT IT?!!!!!&nbsp; SHOULD I HAVE TO BE WITHOUT THE USE OF A SECURE COMPUTER FOR AN EXTENDED LENGTH OF TIME?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have released updates since January that address some concerns to AMD based computer builds. It should be applicable to your computer and we need to find out alternative ways to install recent updates. We would also want to know some information that
 will be helpful in resolving the issue. Kindly provide the information needed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the KB number(s) of the update that are failed to install?</li><li>Which build, version and edition of Windows 7 are you using? (<strong>Win+R &gt; winver &gt; Enter</strong>)</li><li>Specifications and model of the computer.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For us to proceed, we would like to ask for the Service Request Number that was created when you contacted our Level 2 technicians. This is for us to find out what was done and execute other alternatives to install the failing update(s). Please check your
 Community Forum Inbox as we've sent a Private Message so you can provide us the said Service Request Number(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>While waiting for the information we're asking above and as you've mentioned that your computer has been completely re-installed, please ensure that your computer is running the Windows 7 Service Pack 1 that can be downloaded from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15090/windows-7-install-service-pack-1-sp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Please download and install the version applicable to be installed in your computer. We need to install
 the Service Pack 1 to ensure that your computer is ready for any Security Updates that are being offered from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, kindly download and install the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 from the link(s) below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>For 64 bit System: <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/download/details.aspx?id=20858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB947821) [October 2014]</a></strong></li><li>For 32 bit System: <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/download/details.aspx?id=3132&amp;751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 (KB947821) [October 2014]</a></strong></li></ul>

 This tool checks your computer for such inconsistencies and tries to resolve issues if found.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm very aware of the updates that have been issued to try and resolve this issue.&nbsp; All have been tried along with numerous other solutions, by Microsoft tech support and myself many times with no positive results.&nbsp; Considering the length of time it has
 taken to resolve this issue and the many problems it has created, and also being concerned about how secure the computer in question is I've decided and been advised by others to completely disconnected it and take it out of service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to answer the requested info to the best of my ability in a response to the private message you sent.</p>

<p>We've confirmed with the information you've provided through private message that your computer has been experiencing a reverting changes issue upon installation of updates. This is caused by duplicate updates or information within the file system that hinders
 the update to be installed. We need to remove that file that is affecting the Windows Update installation to be completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, we need your to computer to booted to <strong>Safe</strong> <strong>Mode</strong>. Follow the steps on how to boot your computer to
<strong>Safe</strong> <strong>Mode</strong> in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your computer is on a <strong>Safe</strong> <strong>Mode</strong> environment, it is not connected to any connections outside of it. Let's delete the system file called
<strong>pending.xml</strong> which holds the information of the failed installation of Windows Update by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open you <strong>File</strong><strong> Explorer</strong>. On the address bar, type or copy-paste

<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Security</strong> tab, click on <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>
Add</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Enter the object names to select</strong> box, type <strong>Everyone</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once added, select <strong>Everyone</strong> on the list and ensure to tick the
<strong>Full Control</strong> check box and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced</strong> button. On the upper-middle part of the window, select
<strong>Change</strong> beside <strong>Owner</strong> section.</li><li>On the prompt window, type <strong>Everyone</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>At the bottom-left part under <strong>Permissions</strong> tab, click <strong>
Add</strong>. Click on <strong>Select</strong><strong> a </strong><strong>principal</strong>. Type
<strong>Everyone</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once <strong>Principal</strong> is already tagged as <strong>Everyone</strong>, ensure to tick the
<strong>Full Control</strong> check box under <strong>Basic permissions</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Then, select <strong>Auditing</strong> tab. Click <strong>Add</strong> at the bottom-left part. Click on
<strong>Select</strong><strong> a </strong><strong>principal</strong>. Type <strong>
Everyone</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once <strong>Principal</strong> is already tagged as <strong>Everyone</strong>, ensure to tick the
<strong>Full Control</strong> check box under <strong>Basic permissions</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Advanced Security Settings for pending.xml</strong> window, click
<strong>OK</strong> located on the bottom-left part. Select <strong>Yes</strong> when prompted.</li><li>Lastly, click <strong>OK</strong> on the <strong>pending.xml Properties</strong> window.</li><li>And now that the <strong>Properties</strong> windows is closed, delete the <strong>
pending.xml</strong> file.</li><li>Once the it's deleted, restart your computer to <strong>clean boot</strong> state by following the steps in this

<p>Robelene, no luck with latest suggestion.&nbsp; HotFix KB947821 will not download by any method suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that all fixes, both by me and Microsoft Techs are not working.&nbsp; I don't think this problem can be repaired remotely, if there is even a fix .&nbsp; The HotFix (KB947821) will not even download from the Microsoft download site.&nbsp; I was able to download
 this KB the first time but when I ran it it just locked and I had to invoke the Task Manager to end the process.&nbsp; I deleted this download and have tried to download it several times without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'm done with any efforts on my part to fix this problem.&nbsp; If Microsoft wants to try something on their behalf without involving me I may be open to that.<br />
</p>
<p>Since I've spent an unbelievable amount of time trying to fix this problem please don't offer any more "experimental" repair suggestions to me unless you're sure they will be a sure fix.&nbsp; I'm open to any other suggestions other than me having to try these
 frustrating, time consuming and non-successful repairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've left you additional information in a private message.</p>

            I briefly read through this thread and it reminded me of what I had experienced nearly three-(3) years ago.&nbsp; A lot of strange things can happen with technology's convergence of firmware, hardware and software.&nbsp; I agree with "Robelene Win" you must have
 Windows 7 Service Pack installed onto your computer; however, the updates specified as "KB?????????" must be installed in a specific order.&nbsp; I was fortunate that I was friends and associates with both smarter and very savvy technical people than I:&nbsp; I picked
 up a lot of tips, but I still have to research a lot of sources whenever I have issues and problems that I need to solve with my computers and 3D-printer.&nbsp; First, I recommend that you visit the Microsoft Community Forum Contributor by&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5b51cb03-aa78-44a4-950e-21fdb07d9686">Contributor
 ElderN</a>.&nbsp; It was in ElderN thread&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-7-update-problems-read-this-first/28147a5f-b0b0-480b-bed9-834a2da7a375">Windows 7 Update Problems</a>&nbsp;and then you
 visit the Microsoft Update Catalog and download Windows 7 Service Pack One (SP1)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=windows+7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Catalog Update Microsoft</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;search for the correct KB&nbsp; ******************************************************************************************************************************************
 I found my input describing my Windows 7 nightmare during the first month after the "free upgrade to Windows 10", I hope this thread by ElderN helps those who need assistance with their Windows Seven ***************************************************************************************************************************************<span>I
 like this whole post&nbsp;about this topic. Thank you to ElderN for reminding me about the catalog and for his&nbsp;instructions and also thanks to others for their feedback.&nbsp; I had long ago turned off automatic updates after suffering problems with post-Microsoft updates.&nbsp;
 I initially thought "I will update everything because I wanted my machine to be running smooth", then I learned the hard way that not all updates are good for my pc, so I started to only update critical and mandatory updates and sometimes recommended updates
 and I had a better experience.&nbsp; Last year I&nbsp;switched to "never update" because of Microsoft's&nbsp;covert Windows10 upgrade campaign.&nbsp;</span>
<p>
</p><p>I have been guilty of blindly downloading and installing updates:&nbsp;I followed ElderN's instructions and the updates just didn't install; I searched the internet and also learned that the&nbsp;"Windows 7 Update Agent" is being switched to a monthly patch
 rollup.&nbsp; I revisited the Microsoft Update Catalog and search for windows 7 64bit - "1000 updates" was the resultant search, so I looked for updates&nbsp;dated after ~ June&nbsp;20th because my last successful update was in June 2016 -&nbsp;I selected only 4 updates&nbsp;for 64-bit
 based systems.&nbsp; I noticed the name of these updates and I thought something was a little peculiar, but I proceeded with the downloads and "double-click" to install each of them.&nbsp; I thought the update was taking too long because it was searching for "updates
 on my computer"; I opened up the&nbsp;Task Manager and killed each attempt because it was taking too long.&nbsp; I then searched on the names of the updates and viewed the "more details about this update" note&nbsp;- they&nbsp;are identified as "AMD"&nbsp;for "AMD Architecture".&nbsp;
 The windows troubleshooter also hangs!&nbsp; My pc is Intel architecture, so I am back to "never update windows" until&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3108407/windows/windows-7-and-8-1-updates-switching-to-cumulative-monthly-rollups-starting-in-october.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">October
 2016&nbsp;</a>or I can figure out to get&nbsp;Windows 7 updates for my&nbsp;64bit Intel architecture computer.&nbsp; Besides updating my computer has been broken down into&nbsp;hardware parts and software parts i.e.,&nbsp;Intel utilities, NVidia updates, HP Solution Center, etc., &nbsp;more
 often than in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;IMHO I think&nbsp;the vendors and Microsoft suppliers are having a tissy-fit with each other due to last year's FCC Bill passing into law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I appreciate the input.&nbsp; As you can see I've tried everything Microsoft has suggested.&nbsp; The Microsoft Techs didn't have any luck either.&nbsp; The system I have is about seven years old and until last December (12/17)
<strong>I've never, repeat, never had any update issues on my system</strong>.&nbsp; The update titled, "Monthly Security Rollup for Windows 7 64x Based Systems" is what has caused the problem.&nbsp; One Microsoft tech stated that this update corrupted some files which
 apparently is what is causing all the problems.&nbsp; That is why the level 2 tech did a complete re-install of Windows 7 SP1, which hasn't worked either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the input from ElderN was interesting but having to pick and choose which updates to install and which order in which to do them shouldn't be necessary.&nbsp; The above mentioned update was marked as "important" so, naturally, I installed it.&nbsp; Bad mistake!!!&nbsp;
 &nbsp;For the basic user like me things are too complicated.&nbsp; &nbsp;As users of a product from Microsoft we should be able to use this product in a reliable and trouble free manner.&nbsp; This includes all updates that are supplied to support this product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I don't think I'm the only one having this problem.&nbsp; I think Microsoft has created a big mess and is scrambling to try and come up with quick fixes and patches.&nbsp; So far, at least from my experience, I don't think they've been too successful.</p>

<p>I completely understand your frustration: I recently experienced a hardware &amp; firmware problem with my LG G4 and mobile telecommunications provider; I am experiencing a hardware and software problem with my GMC truck; the most devastating experience was
 in the healthcare industry.&nbsp; I am convinced that most companies across many industries "DO NOT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY"! They point the finger at the other company, but usually it boils down to getting the right person [remember there
 is always a witness] whom will go above and beyond to help someone in need.&nbsp; Over the past couple of years through my persistence to solve maintenance problems I have learned that I am more knowledgeable than most the help the company sends to our home.&nbsp; The
 irony for me, I have a lot of time, but I have pittance of funds - I have been unemployed since May 17, 2013; therefore, I have no "income stream".&nbsp; No, I am not on welfare nor am I receiving any financial assistance from our government at any level from the
 Fed to the SLED!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 7 desktop computer was built by Micro Center in December 2012, so it is close to the age of your computer. For the time being if you don't have a laptop visit one of your local pawn shops to see their stock.&nbsp; I got very lucky I found a Lenovo
 ThinkPad E540 with Windows 10 Professional, so I purchased it in July 2016 for $225.00 - it is still working great.&nbsp; The model was still selling from $700 upwards! Besides I haven't thrown away any of my computers since my first desktop in 1997: it is better
 to practice on a old computer than a newer computer that you need operating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember if a man built it then another man can repair it!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be frustrating, but if you want to get your computer operating again then you will have to painstakingly do the research and eventually you will solve the problem.&nbsp; Read through the ElderN thread because if I recall his instructions were spot on
 and he tells you which KB###### to install and in the proper order.</p>

    <title>Windows Movie Maker Crash, Blank Recovery File - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joycee07  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker Crash, Blank Recovery File</h2>
                    <p>I've re-made my video three times because Movie Maker keeps crashing. The first time it crashed, the program just ended, then I re-opened movie maker and was able to recover my edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second and third time, my laptop hanged altogether. Not even the start key, Alt+tab, Alt+F4 or CTRLALTDEL worked.that I had no choice but to turn it off and boot again. When I open movie maker, it gives me the option to recover my edit, which I did,
 but the file recovered does not have my video clips. It only shows the duration of each clip on the preview pane, and also plays the title/caption, but no video or audio. Just black screen playing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried not recovering the file upon opening move maker and opening my last saved work instead, but it gave me the file corrupted message and won't open the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really annoying since I tried everything, knowing that the program keeps crashing. I save my work every 10 minutes or so, but once it crashes, not even my saved edit is recovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would likely switch to another editor but I need to recover what I've finished first. I've been working on it for two days and I really don't want to start from scratch again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Windows 10. All my source video clips are intact, not moved nor deleted. No triangles and exclamation points. The clips simply do not appear on the timeline, but the preview pane with black screen shows how many clips and minutes there supposedly
 is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>Hi Joycee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To get better clarity on the issue, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did this issue start to happen?</li><li>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Are you getting any error message every time the Windows Movie Maker crashes?</li></ul>
<p>You may run your computer in clean boot to isolate if there are programs or applications that may be causing this issue. To do this, kindly follow the steps provided in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Hi Monica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started working on the project three days ago and the crash happened two days ago. I have not changed anything on my laptop. I recently installed other video editing softwares but none were open or active while I was editing. I also did not get any error
 message before, during, or after crash. It just stops responding and the laptop freezes after five minutes of waiting for it to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only message I got was when I chose not to "recover" the project after crash and tried to open my last saved project. It said the file is corrupted or incompatible. Whenever I reopen movie maker after crash, it just asks if I want to recover the last
 project I was working on, but like I said, the recovered file is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try the clean boot, but I'm not very sure it would make much difference. I was able to use movie maker for a whole day without any problem and did not make any changes, install or run any program but it started crashing on the second day. I was thinking
 maybe the crash was because of the large file since I imported many clips with varying formats, but that wouldn't explain the blank recovered file.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for the response.<br />
<br />
During clean boot state, create a video on the Movie Maker and see if it will crash or freeze. If not, then the possible cause of that are the programs that you install on your computer that may complicate the function of the Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
With regard to your issue with corrupted files, you may run the system file checker on your computer. To do this, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Press Windows key</strong> + <strong>X</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>Select<strong> Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>".</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It would help us better if you could also provide us the specification of your computer.<br />
<br />
We'll look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Near as I can tell, you seem to be running Malwarebytes Premium alongside Kaspersky AV, andthis seem to be causing a conflict issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall MBAM completely and see if that resolves the issue. You may reinstall the free version(without, RTM) Real time monitoring, to avoid this issue in the future.</p>

<p>Oh how did you figure that out Rocker? What makes you think that? I'd maybe like to ask about this on the MWb forum, I'd like to keep MWB but will remove it in a heartbeat if it is causing the conflict.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You can't tell from the Product Key.</p>
<p>It is trial and error until you find the right edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BUT as you have a laptop the chances are that the operating system on it was preinstalled and as such you can NOT transfer it to another machine.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Read this information as you are the only one who know what type of license you had:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>

    <title>Option to turn off blue light filter&#47;&#34;night light&#34; in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lachlanlw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Option to turn off blue light filter&#47;&#34;night light&#34; in windows mixed reality&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using my HP WMR headset to play Beat Saber after dark, it's very clear that a heavy blue light filter is automatically applied. This is a problem as beat saber mainly uses the colours red and blue, and because of the blue light filter, the blue blocks
 become black and blend in with the background, and in some expert+ levels it can get confusing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your goal might be to reduce headaches with this feature, but the blue light filter actually gives me a headache for some reason. I can adjust to a blue light filter on my screen but I simply cannot adjust to it in VR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried closing f.lux and I've tried messing around with the night light feature in windows to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;LachlanLW,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's narrow down your concern. In order for me to have a better understanding your what you experience, I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the version&nbsp;and build of your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?
<ul>
<li>You can have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box, then type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li><li>Have you tested other user profiles if the issue is the same?</li><li>Have you checked if do you get the same issue when reinstalling the game?</li><li>Are you experiencing the same issue with other <strong>Mixed Reality enabled apps</strong> installed on your
<strong>Windows 10</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that you've already performed a restart on your <strong>
Windows Night Light</strong>, and yet to no avail, I would recommend that you run first the
<strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">app troubleshooter</a></strong>. This is just to ensure that the integrity of the apps that you use specially for your
<strong>Mixed Reality</strong> is intact. If the issue still persists, I recommend that you reinstall the game app. This is to ensure that you get the latest app version released by the developer from the app store. You can uninstall thi by doing these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>Select the&nbsp;</span><span>Start</span><span>&nbsp;button, then select&nbsp;</span><span>Settings</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Apps</span><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Choose the program you want to remove, and then select&nbsp;</span><span>Uninstall</span><span>.
 Some apps&nbsp;built into Windows&nbsp;can't be uninstalled.</span></span></li><li><span><span>To remove an app you got from
<strong>Microsoft Store</strong>, find it on the&nbsp;</span><span>Start&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;menu, press and hold (or right-click) on the app, then select&nbsp;</span><span>Uninstall</span><span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li></ol>
<p>If the issue still persists, please don't hesitate of keeping posted with the results.</p>

            Hi Joseph.
<br />this may be malware. Please look where is it stored. if location is Temp folder, delete this program and run thorough malware scan.
<br />And you may open resmon to view a connection this program establishes - this may be helpful for diagnosis. See Network tab.

<h2>            Netgear AC1900 R7000 and Xbox One Disconnect Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I am new to the forum, I didn't originally think to post here, but I have exhausted all options with Netgear.</p>
<p>I am experiencing Intermittent Disconnect Issue on the WIFI ONLY to the Xbox One, all other devices in the house are fine.&nbsp; I have two R7000 units, One is the main router the other is set up as an access point.</p>
<p>I have Comcast ISP&nbsp;get &gt;100Mbps on the hardwired computer all the time when connected to the Router. (The wireless is obviously much slower, best device gets around 50-60&nbsp;Mbps on the Xbox) &nbsp;I have already Turned WMM and QoS OFF, as that was giving issues
 when the AP was connected to the Router, drastically slowing speeds down, but with them off - All is well.</p>

<p>I have tried All Netgears suggestions, and what I could find online.</p>

<p>Then Last Night I disabled the IPV6, because I saw some postings on that..&nbsp; At first it seemed to resolve it, I was online for 45 minutes with no issues.&nbsp;(At least I was able to get on for more than 5 minutes)</p>
<p>So I thought I may have been onto something&nbsp; when I disabled IPV 4.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tonight it Worked for about an Hour and a half, then it Disconnected me. When I exited to check the connection, Multiplayer all was good this time.&nbsp; Pressed the four top buttons and NAT was Open, behind closed cone, 0 Packet Loss, 60 Mbps Down, 6 Mbps up.&nbsp;
 Yet I could not get into Titanfall Multiplayer or Halo Online.</p>
<p><br />
I then tried to set "Respond to Ping on Internet Port" ON. And will see if that helps,&nbsp; I rebooted everything in the proper order (Modem, then router, then Turned on Xbox)&nbsp;&nbsp;it connected right away, and has been good for about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>It just seems I can't get better than an Hour to an Hour and a Half out of it NO matter what I do. The Router has a Rock solid connection, at 100% Strength, and then just Kicks out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would try a hardwired connection, but the location just doesn't give
 me that option....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>disable your SIP ALG! that always screws up the internet for xbox live. I also disable IGMP proxying, but that doesn't always work. also, make sure your settings are back to what they were before. when you first booted up your router. make sure the sip alg
 is disabled.</p>

<p>OK, Thanks. &nbsp;I just Disabled SIP ALG, IGMP proxying was already disabled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say go back to the way the settings were, Do you suggest enabling IPV6? &nbsp;Disabling it was the only way I could get it to somewhat work. &nbsp;Tonight with 3 hours of use I had 2 disconnects, again when I went and checked the network settings, all was
 fine, and it left me restart a new titanfall game without doing anything, no rebooting, etc....</p>

<p>OK, I will give it a test tonight, Do you recommend leaving &nbsp;"Respond to Ping on Internet Port" ON? &nbsp;I am just concerned because it says that it could be a security risk...</p>
<p>I' not sure what the SIP ALG does, but I can say it made HUGE Difference on my laptop speed tests, Before I turned that off I would get 30 to tops 50 Mbps Download, now the speed test is 80 to 100Mbps down.</p>

<p>So the &gt;90Mbps was short lived, I got home and it was back to prior speeds. &nbsp;After Updating the Firmware on both routers, which obviously reboots them, the speeds were back to &gt;9m Mbps. &nbsp;I'm guessing that had more to do with the reboot than anything, I have
 seen others complain about speed degradation over time with the R7000, but 1/2 in 10 hours?</p>
<p>On the IPV6 Topic, when you enable it with Comcast, what option should you pick, Auto?</p>

<p>because i'm with Comcast, I use the 6to4 tunnel option. it screws with my internet the least. please remember, you don't always need ivp 6 for your xbox one to access the internet. I've used ivp4 and turned off ivp 6 and my xbox one worked fine. depends
 on who your carrier is..... auto detect also works as well. my netgear r8000 does a hell of a job what will all the walls between my router and the bedroom which is over 50 ft away.

<p>make sure that you also turn off 20/40 MHz coexistence. that will bump your speeds back up. I've NEVER had that enable and never will because it cuts your speeds in half.

<p>OK, Thanks for the Help, so After 50 Minutes of Play I was Booted Off Tonight.</p>
<p>I went to check Internet connection for Xbox and it said I was not connected to a network.</p>
<p>I checked the UPnP and my Xbox was not on the list, funny thing is neither was my hardwired Desktop.</p>
<p>The only thing that was shown on the list was my laptop, that is connected tot the attached AP.</p>
<p>After about 5 minutes, the Xbox reconnected on its own as did my desktop, and both showed up on the UPnP list again, and everything is working as it should????</p>
<p>Settings During this were UPnP On</p>
<p>Disabled SIP: ALG</p>
<p>Enabled IPV6</p>
<p>Respond to Ping on Internet Port ON</p>
<p>IGMP proxying was disabled</p>

<h2>            PNP DETECTED FATAL ERROR when connecting anything USB Windows 10  and not with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please allow this discussion to be a learning experience for us all and more so a rant. Windows 10 has been a double edged sword of benefits and headaches. Somehow making so many changes just to make things LOOK aesthetically better, so called easier to
 troubleshoot, function period has proven to be a nightmare for some of us in the IT field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 can't seem to handle anything coming over USB/USB3.0/USB C these days. This PNP FATAL ERROR when someone wants to add dual monitors or use anything over a port is the most silliest, roll up to 1803 or whatever number Microsoft puts in front of
 a so called "Update" does nothing but create hypertension, frustration, discovery of what else does not work in a domain environment. Windows 7 however has never had these problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it isn't broke don't fix it is something that does not exist in the developers minds. I can go on for days discussing the stupidity of the very fundamentals that are lacking and what seems to continue lacking with the updates. But I won't. How can some
 spend so much money investing in forced upon us Microsoft products when the updates do not install so now uninstalling updates several times over while taking over hours to even get to the failed install? And why so much over a short span of time hijacking
 a machine (even though there is specified times we want updates to install) it will do it when someone has been working for hours and suddenly, windows updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost every windows 10 machine brand new out of the box is guaranteed to Blue Screen with a damn PNP DETECTED Fatal Error even with the most recent update. Plugging in something as simple as another monitor or plugging in period produces this stupid error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't link me to KB databases that do not resolve this issue. Put in place an option to roll back to Windows 7 if the ones spending money to buy the product wants to. Put in place a damn fix or don't shove down everyone's throat updates that don't
 address underlying problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<strong>2</strong>. Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and<br />
ask in their forums about any known issues. Also do the same at Nvidia.<br />
Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and <br />
separate device drivers (see driver update methods below).<br />

<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Run the memory&nbsp;tests (see methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>As needed use ALL the methods in the&nbsp;troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. </strong>After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to&nbsp;see if it can indicate a<br />
CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

For the Windows&nbsp;Memory Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;&nbsp; Windows Memory Diagnostics&nbsp;<br />
at top&nbsp;of list&nbsp;- click it. <strong>in Windows 8/8.1/10 the&nbsp;name is "Windows Memory
<br />
Diagnostic".<br />
</strong><br />
================================================<br />
<br />
After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />
DriverVerifier.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p><br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If Driver Verifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.</p>
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

Look for each of my bsod errors and search the microsoft solutions page. I do not remember all the ones I did already, I looked for error for example: error bsod ntoskrnl.exe 0x0000003b and it helped me like for example this https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/blue-screen
 -error-0x3b-systemserviceexception / 7eeea12d-a97a-477b-b4c3-1fda74a7315e<br />
I use Windows 10 Education (the serial is original from University)</p>
<p>Windows 10 education can be the problem? sometimes it happens to me in games or just to be surfing the bsod.</p>

If you have updated all you can then run Driver Verifier and post any links.<br />
<br />
The memory test results should be posted on the memtest86 forums/community.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
DriverView is a utility to help you update drivers - please run it as indicated in my original reply. And I do not need images from it.<br />
<br />
After you have done all you could run "<strong>Driver Verifer</strong>" and post the minidumps it creates. How to run it also in my original reply (the last section).<br />

<p>the truth that my notebook worsened, since I did the <strong>"Driver Verifier"</strong>, I loaded the minidumps that I had never commented on that, the driver verifier followed a guide that you never gave me, so I never get the minidumps.<br />
The truth that I think it can be the windows 10 education problem, able to use window 10 pro that recommends asus, and if not return to the factory that is windows 8.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
How to use Driver Verifier is in my original reply.<br />
<br />
No help in the minidumps.<br />
<br />
Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Update the
<strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and <strong>the major on-board and
</strong><strong>separate device drivers</strong> (see driver update methods below).<br />
<br />
Intel Driver Update Utility &lt;-- also run this after checking with Asus<br />

<h2>            Anyone setting up a Guild for xbox one Australian players ,or in need of gaming friends, for Elder Scrolls online &#58;Tamriel Unlimited &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Wondering whether anyone is setting up a guild for aussie players or in just getting more friends who play , for cooperative play , to take on 4 player dungeons and other events needing a band of players. I am new to mmorpgs so not really sure what to expect
 from eso : tu but loved skyrim and oblivion and can't wait to get going in Tamreil come June 9th . Would like to find a bunch of&nbsp; other players who might be playing on fri , sat , sundays in daylight hours , eastern coast time zone&nbsp; . Not particularly interested
 in taking over Cyrodil right away ,&nbsp; or pvp for the sake of it , but helping each other out with leveling , crafting , taking on&nbsp; dungeons and bosses. More into the exploration&nbsp; than kingdom conquest . Anyone interested in similar and playing around the same
 time&nbsp; , friend me gt- malc303, I'm thinking of going daggerfall covenant .&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love oblivion and skyrim as well and was pumped about this game until i heard there was a $15 a month subscription charge. I recently heard that the fee has been waived and you can play for free. Is this true because it sounds like a great game and something
 i would spend loads of time on?</p>

<p>no longer subscription , have to buy the game however for a &nbsp;flat fee so its not free to play &nbsp;, about $100 as a preorder on &nbsp;xbox one here in australia , with a explorer pack allowing any race except imperial in any faction , there is i beleive a eso plus
 subscription &nbsp;$15/month for access to various vanity items in the crown store &nbsp;- pets mounts costumes and faster exp gain , but this certainly isnt needed , &nbsp;and isnt something i'd be getting , imo a flat fee for something that will entertain me for at least
 a year (given i put in about 250 hrs into skyrim ) &nbsp;is a bargain and i've been losing sleep over the anticipation of this game, like a 6 year old before Christmas -sad but true ! &nbsp;</p>

 online for invite if you think suits - they are into helpful mature players who don't leave there coms on all the time with random noise ) &nbsp;hope you are enjoying tamriel !

    <title>Skype or Microsoft Interference - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dabens2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype or Microsoft Interference</h2>
                    I had used Skype until April 2019. In June I had to replace my computer so today I decided to download the Skype software, only to find that it apparently cut off non-MS&nbsp;games I had been playing on my desktop. When I deleted the Skype software, the games
 worked perfectly. There were other problems between Microsoft products &amp; rivals like Google since I got the new computer. Each continually tries to sell me their versions of such things as a browser or search engine. Is there a conspiracy with Microsoft to
 cut out all competitors by causing problems with&nbsp;other software so it doesn't work with Win 10? Does anyone realize how annoying it is to constantly click "Not interested" when an offer pops up after opening a function or application? I intensely dislike pressure
 to buy a competitor's product with these popups. Does anyone else have these same problems with a Win10 O/S?

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.

            Hello tushar_gamer,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try setting your connection as Metered. Windows 10 won't download automatic updates on Metered connection.
<br />
<br />1. Right click Start Button or press Windows + X keys and click Settings.
<br />
<br />2. In Settings app, select Network &amp; Internet entry.
<br />
<br />3. Then click Status option under Network &amp; Internet.
<br />
<br />4. Moving on, click Change connection properties link on next screen.
<br />
<br />5. Finally, toggle the Set as metered connection option to On. This should set the connection as Metered one.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>
</p><p>Also, rename them and add a new extension just for good measure. Ideally, you also want to delete the /Windows/SoftwareDistribution, as well as any UpdateAssistant folders within the Windows folder. As the other answers said, it is also good to disable the
 windows update service afterwards (although doing so alone will not prevent windows from updating). After doing so, it shouldn't update again. If it does (probably due to residual files), start it in safe mode, then delete folders within Software Distribution,
 as well as Update assistant folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this method on two computers. Update works again when I move the files back and change them back to their original names.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Changing permissions:</strong></p>
<p>The permissions are tricky. To get possession of the files, go to
<em>Properties </em>&gt; <em>Security</em>. Click <em>advanced</em>. Change <em>change
</em>at the top of the Advanced Security Settings dialog to change ownership. Type in your username into the blank box that appears and hit enter. Now click
<em>OK </em>until you exit. Now go back into the Advanced Security Settings dialog. Now the options to
<em>edit</em> won't be grayed out. Click on <em>administrators</em>, and click <em>
edit</em>. Make sure it is in <em>allow </em>mode, which it is in by default, and check the box that says
<em>full control</em>. Now click <em>OK</em> all the way until you exit. You can now move and rename this file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Alternate method (new)</strong></p>
<p>StackExchange's SuperUser site has some really high quality answers on this topic too.
<a href="https://superuser.com/a/1191538/610242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
One answer</a> recommended an external software which sets up a fake WSUS server, which essentially make Windows try and download the updates from a fake update server. This is way less intrusive than the method above.</p>

    <title>Windows Mobile 10 Full storage issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnedinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Mobile 10 Full storage issues</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;a Blu windows phone.&nbsp; It was running windows 8.1 just fine, last week the Windows 10 update came out for them and I was overjoyed.&nbsp; Unfortuantely after the upgrade my phone storage (not sd card) is full to the max and even after uninstalling anything
 or moving anything that was on the main storage it filled up again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing things like Edge or texting to not work properly or at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I assume maybe the old installation files from windows 8.1 are still resident in case of wanting to restore to the previous version, which I don't.&nbsp; Is there a way to clear up these seeminly locked files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

During the reset you will see gears rotating on the screen for up to 5 minutes, after which the screen goes blank for ~30 seconds and then your phone will restart.</li><li>Go through the initial phone setup. Make sure that you have the date and time set correctly. Select
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Time &amp; language </strong>&gt; <strong>Date &amp; time&nbsp;</strong>(Lumia with Windows Phone 8:

<h3> beach guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless mouse interferes with a nearby wireless mouse</h2>
                    
<p>My wife and I both use computers w/ wireless keyboards and mice. Our desks are right next to each other and our systems' wireless receivers are picking up each other's mouse actions no matter how far apart we place the receivers.</p>
<p>Is there some way to change device communication channels or frequencies so that the mice will stop interfering w/ each other?</p>
<p>Alternatively could you recommend a wireless KB/mouse product we could purchase that would not interfere with one of our existing wireless devices?</p>
<p>Currently I am using a DIY desktop running Win7 Home Prem 64&nbsp;with a Logitech MK300 KB/mouse and my wife is running a ThinkPad X201 running Win7 Pro 64 with a Microsoft Desktop Elite KB/mouse.</p>
<p>Appreciate your help.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello</span><span><span>Beach Guy,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>How
 far have you moved the mouse on both the computers to check if the signals are still interrupting?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you try to reinstall the software for the mouse on both the computers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can follow this order to reinstall the software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Turn
 off both the computers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Next,
 boot up one of the computer and, uninstall and reinstall the software for the mouse.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Make
 sure that the device is working,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Shut
 down the second workstation. Perform these same steps on the other workstation and reinstall the drivers.</span></span></p>
