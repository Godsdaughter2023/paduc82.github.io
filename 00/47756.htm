 doesn't give me any options except for 2 things ... A long cd thing with parentheses and a disabled option. I've tried about everything I could and the computer still will not boot up. Everything is plugged in correctly and everything should be working together

    <title>Microphone Stopped Working After Windows 10 Update &#40;Version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windows 10 is annoying  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone Stopped Working After Windows 10 Update &#40;Version 1803&#41;</h2>
                    As the title says I have encountered this problem once I had to get this mandatory update. I did a rollback the previous build I had and the microphone (detachable microphone for headphones) was working fine. Nothing wrong with the cable and drivers are
 up to date. The headphone/microphone is already the default device. So again, this mandatory update happened and well the microphone stopped working again. Any help would be appreciated.

            Hi WIndows.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try these fixes next:  
<br /><a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br /><a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recognize-headphones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recog...</a>
<br />
<br />Some report that what worked is turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt;  Change Settings Currently Unavailable &gt; uncheck the box for Fast Startup, Save Settings.  Restart and then disable Hibernate file to clear it, restart PC again and enable Hibernate again:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hiberna...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a> 
<br />
<br />You might also be able to System Restore back to a point where this worked:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Various Microsoft services and programs stopped working </h2>
                    
<p>original title: Various Microsoft utilities that I have wont work.</p>
<p>Someone please help!!! Woke up this morning turned on my computer and my Windows Vista stopped working properly. Various windows services just stop working including: windows live one care, windows firewall, windows connection status, windows photo viewer
 I can't even access my own files. I tried to troubleshoot and use system restore but that does not work either. I need some help.</p>
<p>P.S. I t should be known that I just ran a full virus scan on my computer yesterday and absolutely nothing popped up. So I am pretty sure it's Vista</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what
 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />

    <title>Check File History Drive Error Message - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Check File History Drive Error Message</h2>
                    <p>When operating my Surface Pro 3, which is running Windows 10, I repeatedly get a message directing me to check my file history drive for errors.&nbsp; But, when I run the scan that Windows 10 advises me to run, I get a message reporting that no errors were found.&nbsp;
 Can this be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I, too, am getting a notice saying there are errors in my file history. I found nothing at either of these links about checking file history for errors. &nbsp;If it is under some other topic, then I'm sorry but I don't know how to find it. &nbsp;Totally unhelpful.
 &nbsp;Windows 10 is a total disaster that was forced on me and now I have two laptops, both with multiple problems and my tech is out of town for 2 weeks. &nbsp;I'm becoming more and more frustrated with Microsoft. &nbsp;None of my programs are compatible and it's going
 to cost me a lot of money to buy new software. &nbsp;Total rip off.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>There is NO LINK under any of the topics in these links to repair my drive! &nbsp;Give me a valid link and I'll try!</p>

<p>I'm not an expert!&nbsp; However, I went to Cortana and typed in:&nbsp; chkdsk e: /F &nbsp;</p>
<p>Translated:&nbsp; I used an old DOS command that asks the computer to do a "check disk" analysis of the E Drive (you can change to check any drive you need to check) and a forward slash F tells the computer to fix whatever segments, clusters, etc. it finds are
 causing the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used this solution to resolve an error message for Windows 10 to do a Check File History Drive Error on my thumb drive I was using for my back-up.&nbsp; I ran the chkdsk e: /F command twice and then ran my back-up program.&nbsp; The problem had been corrected and
 the back-up program was able to rerun a full back-up without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not at all sure what the problem was or why such a simple thing resolves the issue, but it does and I've made a note to self: how to resolve the problem in the future in my OneNote Computer Notebook so I don't forget!</p>

<h2>            Mouse Periodically Doesn&#39;t Cooperate</h2>
                    <p>'bout once a day for about 15 minutes my mouse doesn't work properly. I need to click 3 times to get something selected or run. The movement of the pointer starts and stops. It's as if there is some program eating-up all my resources but at the time there
 is nothing open except for the Processes.<br />
This probably can mean a million things, right?</p>

            I have 6 GB&nbsp; of RAM. The mouse isn't very old. It is a wireless mouse and keyboard. I just changed the batteries in both. Now that I think about it there are times when the keyboard acts strange, also.&nbsp;When it happens,&nbsp;I'm unable to move the cursor with
 the left or right arrow keys. I&nbsp; moved the reliever close and checked the plug.. I'll see if that helps.

            I've had the same issue. &nbsp;Bought my xbox one x in November and started doing this. &nbsp;I couldn't progress in the game because i would get that message to delete saved games. &nbsp;So I would and it would reset but just a black screen. &nbsp;I had to manually hold
 the button or unplug and then when I would start up again I'd get the E105 error and have to reatart again. &nbsp;So any game I would play I couldn't save. &nbsp; Lost count of the factory resets I've done too, with and without game saves. &nbsp;I've seen forums online also
 like Reddit where people talk about this. &nbsp;Some have sent in for repair and same thing happens or exchanges it and get a bad one again. &nbsp;I was out of my 30 exchange since I didn't get the warranty because Ive never had issues with any xboxes before. &nbsp;I'm thinking
 it's the hard drive that's screwed up from what I have read. &nbsp;Thinking about maybe buying and external drive and hope for the best.

            So... this problem is affecting hundreds (maybe thousands?) of xBox One X owners... but no one seems to know how to resolve it? My console now crashes every session, and the error codes are no help at all. How many time do I need to delete my local saves?
 It does NOTHING to fix the issue! Can anyone help?

On my IPhone 8 the Skype app. has me as my brother this is also happening with my sister on her laptop windows 10. How do I delete my brother without deleting on my contacts? Skype is showing that I tried to contact myself! Just let me know how I can wipe everything
 off Skype and start again. this should clear my sisters system. My sister or myself are not seeing any profiles despite me putting a new profile picture to my name. I came out of the app then when I went back in a few minutes later my picture was nowhere to
 be seen. So its advice on how to clear everything and start again.&nbsp;

 server was given a 169.x.x.x IP address by the built-in resolver in Windows and you HAVE NO NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. You will need to launch a console session from vCenter to update the network adapter to the previously set static IP address, subnet mask, and

            You need to use advanced restore (as if it was from another computer).<br />
<br />
Here is an article on advanced restore procedures: <a href="http://www.mayankraichura.com/post/2009/08/06/Avdvanced-Restore-via-Windows-Vista-Backup-and-Restore-Center.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mayankraichura.com/post/2009/08/06/Avdvanced-Restore-via-Windows-Vista-Backup-and-Restore-Center.aspx</a>&nbsp;that may be of help.&nbsp; Here's a brief basic article on how to do a system restore (you need to do it like it's another computer - meaning advanced):
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Restore-files-from-a-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Restore-files-from-a-backup</a>.&nbsp; Here's an excellent article on how to backup and restore in Vista:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx</a>&nbsp;(I suggest you read this one in its entirety).<br />
<br />
There is no difference in the procedure from 64-bit to 32-bit - they are exactly the same.<br />
<br />
If you can't restore your files, what error messages are you getting?&nbsp; Where is the process stalling?&nbsp; Do you have the external drive plugged in and powered up when you begin the restore?&nbsp; Can restore see the backup file but can't restore it or can't it see
 it at all?<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps.

http://www.mayankraichura.com/post/2009/08/06/Avdvanced-Restore-via-Windows-Vista-Backup-and-Restore-Center.aspx</a>&nbsp;I already did step by step, but:<br />
when I select restore file one window with a note ¨there is not backup available on this computer,
<br />
then I cancel because no options, and select advance restore<br />
and new windows with some options where the only I can select is FILE FROM A BACKUP MADE ON A DIFFERENT COMPUTER,<br />
then I select next and new window with two option I CHOOSE HARD DISK, CD OR DVD and next new window with a warning WINDOWS WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND ANY BACKUP SET ON D.<br />
<br />
If I check my hard drive&nbsp; there is a folder named Backup Set 2009-10-26 184958, where inside there are four folders 1.Backup Files 2009-10-26 184958 2. Backup Files 2009-11-01 190005 3. Backup Files 2009-11-09 142113 4.Catalogs, in this folder there is a file

            You're doing the restore procedure correctly as far as I can tell.&nbsp; I don't know why the restore system is not recognizing the backup (especially since a review of the files shows that they are there).&nbsp; Perhaps someone else will reply wirh a suggesrtion
 as to how to get it to recognize the backups (not only should they be recognized, but you should have options to select which one you want to restore).<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I was unable to help you wirh this problem but it seems like you're doing everything right but it just isn't working.&nbsp; Perhaps the backups didn't backup properly in the first place - though I doubt it if you're seeing the backup file information.&nbsp;
 Hopefully someone else will reply to this thread with some answers (and I'd like to hear them as well).<br />
<br />
Good luck!

    <title>No RFU upgrade downloading to HP LaserJet in windows 7&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unruh55  say:</h3>
<h2>            No RFU upgrade downloading to HP LaserJet in  windows 7&#33;</h2>
                    Ok, apparently there are a lot of problems out there with windows 7 and Vista and printers I see after finally coming here for advice.&nbsp; And the answers don't look all that great....contact HP?&nbsp; From Microsoft?<br />
<br />
My very old but perfectly fine Laserjet p3005x is so old it's not on the HP site with a specific name.&nbsp; And if course I plugged it into the usb, downloaded the Universal Driver PCL 5, and voila it's been working for a year!&nbsp; So, I invested the MEGABUCKS required
 to get the new ink cartridge (about $200 cheap...enough for a new printer but not the ink) and a month or so later the printer stops working!<br />
<br />
I tried everything and have worked on it for weeks....and of course this all occurred during preparation for a TRIAL!&nbsp; That's why I keep a second inkjet printer connected, too.&nbsp; Well, the inkjet has had problems lately (do not buy lexmark....thought it was
 great for about a year and then nothing but issues) but while messing with the HP driver the Lexmark wireless connection suddenly downloads and works perfectly!&nbsp; Has a weird name in the devices but it WORKS without the usb, which the computer stopped recognizing.<br />
<br />
So now I have a working wireless inkjet and a hardwired laserjet that my computer says is just dandy and working properly.&nbsp; The HP dialogue box says "<br />
"Download File now<br />
SEND RFU UPGRADE"<br />
<br />
So I figured on the hp site, maybe it's the firmware update.&nbsp; Tried to download it and did actually download it numerous times but it won't seem to "send" to the printer????&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now downloaded and uninstalled so many attempts at the software and the firmware
 that I'm ready to buy a new printer and throw away the old junk, even though I have so much money recently invested in it.<br />
<br />
Anybody have an answer?&nbsp; And "go to hp" is not an answer.&nbsp; First it's an old printer with no support from hp and second, windows 7 tells me everything is just perfect with the connection!&nbsp; I did delete the hp "finder" from my windows, as I didn't want it "interfering".<br />
<br />
And no, I have no idea what I'm doing.&nbsp; Just that it's all stopped my work in it's tracks and gives me one more reason to rethink Mac again!&nbsp; If I buy HPs new e printer, will it have the same issues with Windows 8?&nbsp; I WANT GOOGLE!!!!&nbsp; Maybe with the e print
 I can compute from my android?<br />

<p>It makes no difference as to which printer maker, or whether you use a mac.</p>
<p>There are numerous results on HP forums pages for "SEND RFU UPGRADE" problems.</p>
<p>If you have followed all the MS support/help suggestions, and assuming you havent installed any third party maintenance utilities, probably your best option is the HP forums, as others there will have this printer</p>

            RFU errors seem to indicate a problem with the printer's memory.&nbsp; It could be fixed by replacing the bad RAM module, if you have added more RAM yourself.<br />
<br />
Other possibility:<br />

<h2>            Banned for Writing &#34;Idiot&#34; in an 18&#43; Game</h2>
                    <p>I've just had my account banned for sending a message saying "Idiot" on the game "For Honor", I believe this is an 18+ game so therefore surely curse words should be allowed - and "idiot" is not even a curse word, yet I'm still banned. The enforcement team have done nothing to help me at all and have not responded to my case review so I am assuming they do not care, is it possible for me to speak to a real human who won't just copy and paste the link for the enforcement team's website? I want to know if I can do anything to lift this incorrect ban. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi William,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are&nbsp;a few steps you may try and check if it helps to increase the Internet Speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make sure you have the latest network drivers installed on the computer.&nbsp;Visit your computer manufacturer website and download the latest drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Uninstall the current network drivers from the computer. Go to Device manager with the help of Start Search box.</p>
<p>- Browse Network Adapters, right click on the Network driver and click on uninstall.</p>
<p>- Restart the computer and install the latest drivers that you have downloaded from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If you are using a wireless connection, switch to wired connection and check if the speed varies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Try the troubleshooting steps mentioned in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/why-internet-connection-slow#why-internet-connection-slow=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Something similar happened to me a few years ago.&nbsp; I originally has purchased the 1.5 Mb/s service but after a while, wanted faster speeds.&nbsp; I upgraded to the 3 Mb/s service and went on my merry way.&nbsp; I notice much change, however.&nbsp; The router said I had
 the 3 Mb/s service, so I thought it was the best I could do.&nbsp; However, the router's own built-in speed test wouldn't ever get above 1.2 Mb/s.&nbsp; On a couple of occasions, I tried to pursue it, but I never was able to reach a native English speaker.&nbsp; Finally,
 after four years, I decided to spend the time to really get to the bottom of it.&nbsp; Persistence paid off when I finally was put in contact with a technician in the local main office.&nbsp; He said to wait a few minutes, he wanted to check something&nbsp;and when he came
 back, he said to try again.&nbsp; Lo and behold, the router's speed test showed a 2.7 Mb/s speed.&nbsp; I asked what he did, and he said there was a switch in the certral office that no one had pressed that would allow the higher speed.&nbsp; So, it turns out, I had been
 paying four years for a speed I had never received.&nbsp; He documented the situation for me, I went to AT&amp;T's billing with it,&nbsp;and they put a $400 credit on my bill to make up for the four years I paid for something I didn't get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, even though the router said I had the higher speed, I didn't.</p>

<h2>            System restore with keyboard and mouse not working and don&#39;t know admin password</h2>
                    I recently decided to update my drivers on my 9 year old gateway. Apparently the program I was using to do so didn't realize a bad driver when it sees it...Any way My keyboard and mouse stopped responding while windows was loaded. They work enough for
 me to access the bios, get into the boot menu and also when I hit enter to boot from a windows cd.
<br />
I am trying to access my restore points to get rid of the driver that was installed. Unfortunately when i put in the windows cd and try the repair option i can't log on to the volume because it asks for an administrator password. I've tried Admin admin administrator
 Administrator and leaving it blank. I've even run a program to reset the passwords (That i don't use any way.) still can't log on to the volume. I have also tried to go past the repair screen and install windows to repair that way. I can hit escape and pgup
 and pgdown but not f8 to accept&nbsp; the agreement. <br />
When i boot into safemode with command prompt it still requires me to click on an account to log on. Which i can't do because the mouse and keyboard don't work when windows is loaded.
<br />
I can't get to the command prompt to bring up the restore points can any one help??<br />

            I would not try that advice to use KB307545 yet - there are too many other things that are easier.&nbsp; That is the classic "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it" advice and it will not undo your driver snafu or replace your original drivers
 either.&nbsp; There is a small hope for it I suppose, but you are going to have to get into the Recovery Console first, or boot on something else, like a
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hiren's Boot CD</a> where you will not have this issue of Administrator passwords.<br />
<br />
That idea really doesn't make sense anyway if you can't get into the XP Recovery Console, right?<br />
<br />
If you installed a new driver and your system malfunctions on the next reboot, you should choose from the F8 Advanced Boot options menu:<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what that boot option is there for, so I would use it.&nbsp; Depending on what all has transpired since this issue started, LKGC may or may not work for you.&nbsp; It may not help you at all if you downloaded a bunch of driver that are incorrect for your system<br />
<br />
When you chose to update your drivers, did you get them from the Gateway WWW site, or did you use some Internet tool to scan your system for outdated drivers (if yes, what did you use) and did you let it update your system?&nbsp; That is usually not a good idea
 to use those kinds of tools.<br />
<br />
What program did you use to reset the Administrator password?&nbsp; You can find reliable tools on the Internet if you do a little Googling for phrases like "clear xp administrator password".&nbsp; You don't need to "hack" your Administrator password - you need to "clear"
 it so it is empty.<br />
<br />
Are you running XP Home?&nbsp; Not being able to get into the Administrator account from the Recovery Console is a very common issue with XP Home.<br />
<br />
Since the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system (except it is some kind of 9 year old Gateway).&nbsp; That makes troubleshooting very difficult - unless you like trying
 things.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can and maybe the Microsoft Support Engineer will have some other ideas:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />

</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow steps from the Microsoft Knowledge Base article and check if it helps.</p>

<p>Regarding the administrator password there are chances that you must have set and now you does not remember or if Gateway keep some default password. You may also contact Gateway

            <p>Several work colleagues &amp; I have the same issue - as soon as the Windows 10 Anniversary Update hit, Citrix apps interpret single left and right mouse button clicks as double clicks.&nbsp; This becomes a work stoppage - our workaround for now is downgrade to Windows
 7 instead of using Windows 10 with Citrix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We upgraded to the latest Citrix Receiver app, but no change.&nbsp; Our admins suggested enabling seamless mode for Citrix Reciever, which I did in the registry but the double click issue persists in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MT - thank you for the mouse driver suggestion, unfortunately no luck.&nbsp; My machine is a Windows 10 desktop, so no touchpad.&nbsp; I have "HID-compliant mouse" listed with driver date 6/21/2006, and rollback driver option grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Citrix has not acknowledged this issue yet, which is about as severe as it gets.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;I work with don't have the option with their company to use a different machine, and have been unable to work normally for days.&nbsp; I would feel better if Citrix at least
 acknowledged it here:&nbsp; <a href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX216312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX216312</a></p>

 me to roll back the Windows 10 Anniversary update.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only people who reported any type of resolutions are ones that were given Windows 7 machines to work with to replace their Windows 10 machines.&nbsp; I don't have that choice.&nbsp; I'm stuck here and really need
 this issue to get resolved.&nbsp; Please...can anyone help?

            <p>Change your Citrix connection settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue occurs when the user experience is set as SEAMLESS. change it to any other option. This is the only workaround now. It worked for me.</p>

            <p>Thanks dineshbv.&nbsp; This unfortunately did not work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Citrix Receiver 4.5.0.10018, and saw this workaround mentioned on other forums but could not find any Citrix settings dialog containing that setting anywhere.&nbsp; I finally ran across a forum somewhere that indicated which registry settings modify the
 Seamless mode directly.&nbsp; I tried a couple settings, which Citrix Receiver definitely understood - I could see a visual difference in the way apps launched - but the double click issue remained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, one of my 2 machines which have this problem is a Surface Book; the built-in touch-pad produces the issue, along with any other mouse I've plugged in and tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Mel Tar - could you kick this up the Microsoft chain of command, maybe see if someone can try to reproduce in-house with Windows 10 anniversary + Citrix Receiver?</p>

            Has anyone been able to solve this problem? Microsoft? Citrix?
