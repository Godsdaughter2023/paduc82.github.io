<h2>            Windows 7 keeps losing internet connection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so, since yesterday, I noticed my internet connection went on vacation, so I did the usual: Unplug modem and router for 30 seconds. (Maybe more). However, this happened around 3 times in the same hour. It then worked fine for the rest of the day. Now
 today, it's happened about six times. What I notice, is that it does fix itself when I unplug, but every time there's a new problem.
<br />
<br />
There was a "The DNS server is not responding" one that came up 3 times though. <br />
<br />
But just now these happened. <br />
<br />
I'm not a tech person or whatever you call them. <br />
<br />
So naturally I don't understand what any of this means. What is the DNS server? <br />
What does all of that in the screenshot mean? <br />
<br />
And how can I stop from loosing internet connection? </p>

            <p>Hi Freddy,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span><span>Manually assign the default gateway and the IP address and check if it works fine.
</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Before assigning the IP address and the Default gateway, make a note of the IP address on the computer. To do this open Command prompt and type
<span><strong>ipconfig</strong> and press enter. This will display the IP address, make a note of it.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><span><br />
<strong>To assign the IP address and default gateway manually, follow the steps below:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<span>a. In system tray, right click <span><strong>network</strong> icon. Choose Open
<strong>Network and Sharing Center.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span>b. Right click on <span><strong>Local Area Connection</strong> and click on
<strong>Properties</strong></span>.</span></p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>c. Double click<strong><span>Internet Protocol Version 4</span></strong> (TCP/IPv4) and assign the IP address manually.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<span>Example: Old Ip address is 192.168.0.1<br />
Change the IP address to 192.168.0.50</span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span>d. Let the <strong><span>Subnet mask</span></strong> and default gateway be the same.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Default gateway, usually would be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1</span></p>
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<p><br />
<span>e. Click on Apply and Ok and restart the computer and verify if it helps to fix the issue.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Method 2:</strong> </span></span><strong><span>Temporarily disable the Firewall on your machine and check if it makes any difference.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You should not turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall enabled. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your computer

<p>Many issues are due to current macOS permissions or other faults that are negatively affecting Skype and other programs (lag/improper execution); not necessarily Skype itself. Here are a few possible solutions that can resolve this type of issue
 and other issues.&nbsp;<span>Many people are successful with #2.</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1. Create a new macOS user, log into that account, try to use Skype. If this works, this proves an issue exists with the other account, possibly permissions or a startup program.</p>
<p>2. Attempt to repair any permission problem in the failing user's account home folder.</p>

<p><span>Once repaired, try to use the latest version of Skype.</span></p>

            The new account did not fix the issue, but the Terminal based permissions reset for the full hard drive did.

<h2>            Error at startup&#58; &#34;Drag-to-Disc could not start because components necessary to run are missing. Please re-install Drag-toDisc&#34;</h2>
                    
<p><strong><em>Original Title: Drag-to-Disc error</em></strong></p>
<p>My notebook computer (Inspiron 6000 by Dell) has a problem with Drag-to-Disc.</p>
<p>Please allow me to explain what happened.&nbsp; I recently had to re-install Windows due to a display problem (i.e., the screen goes completely black after showing the Windows logo during the start-up and Windows fails to launch).&nbsp; After talking to the Dell Tech
 Support, I re-installed the display adapter driver.&nbsp; And when it didn't work, I used the installation disk to repair the installed Windows.&nbsp; The repair seemed successful, except I received&nbsp;error messages during the Windows setup that had to do with&nbsp;"GetRequestedRuntimeVersion,"
 "not found in dynamic link library," "mscoree.dll," and "mscorwks.dll."&nbsp; I repeated the repair twice just in case, but I received the same error messages.</p>
<p>Well, after the repair, the computer seems to be working (, although I still have the same problem with the screen going dark during the start-up occasionally).&nbsp; But now,&nbsp;right after the successful(?)&nbsp;start-up,&nbsp;the Windows&nbsp;pops up a warning&nbsp;message: "Drag-to-Disc
 could not start because components necessary to run are missing. Please re-install Drag-toDisc."</p>
<p>I tried to look up how to re-install Drag-to-Disc, but I could not find any info.&nbsp; Can anyone help me, please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Loading BIOS into external screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mihir jog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loading BIOS into external screen</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if this in the wrong section; if a moderator is here please move this in the correct field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop I am using has a broken screen. While I have set my external monitor (aka TV) to primary, the OS first "boots" to the broken screen, rather than the external monitor. So when I try to load BIOS (Shift-clicking the restart button to find the blue
 screen of options), any button I choose loads to the broken screen, not to the external monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer: A sony VAIO (not sure of model but &nbsp;has 4gb of ram and an i3 processor....do not know the generation ) with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Solutions I HAVE TRIED:</p>
<ul>
<li>using Fn+F8, Fn+F2, while having selected a option from the blue screen</li><li>using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.boyans.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Visual BCD, a freeware</a>&nbsp;that claims to be able to edit the boot order from a GUI (I am aware it says not fully tested)</li></ul>
<p>Solutions I am NOT WILLING to try</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnecting internal screen</li></ul>
<p>A solution I am willing to test is disabling the internal monitor via device manager, but seeing that the "Monitor" section gives two identical monitors (by name at least), I did not pursue that any further. If you know how to disable the internal monitor
 even with these conditions, post please. I will provide screenshots as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feedback for my first post in this community?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for time and patience!</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that in order to make any changes as to which video output the BIOS uses, you first need to get into the BIOS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no settings in Windows that have any effect when in BIOS...</p>
<p>Windows hasn't loaded yet at that point...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your machine has UEFI BIOS, it is sometimes possible to change it's settings from within Windows...</p>

<h2>            Missing local computers when viewing the network but can access them</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 computers. My main workstation (win 7), my htpc (win 7) and my server (vista). I use a wired network setup and all machines have a static ip.</p>
<p>I was previously running xp on my server but upgradedit last week.</p>
<p>This morning all other computers went missing - although they arent missing.</p>
<p>I'll explain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on the "Network" icon on my win 7 workstation desktop, the workstation is the only computer visible in the list.</p>
<p>But if i type \\SERVER i can see all the shared folders on my server. I can view and copy files as usual.</p>
<p>Its just that main overview page that isnt showing other computers all of a sudden. Ive tried refresh but it makes no difference</p>
<p>Edit: I am also experiencing Remote desktop connection issues to the server. Often I get the "Configuring remote session" message for ages, other times RDC connects but i get an endless logging on message on the vista machine - other times it just wont connect.</p>
<p>This all started a few hours ago - previosuly it was all running great.</p>

<p>Well it was just a thought...</p>
<p>Not sure what to look at now except for your Firewall. I had some problems a few years back with ZA, and haven't used it for a very long time. I do seem to remember it being hard to get rid of, and I ended up doing a clean install to do so...</p>
<p>It certainly looks like maybe Vista isn't the best choice for that particular machine. You may be better off reloading XP to see if the issue goes away... What I would probably do myself is reload Vista one more time without ZA, so as to rule that out...
 and if it is still problematic, even without ZA, then back to XP, as you know it is reliable...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before that though, I would check the firewall settings in ZA, or even temporarily turn it off to see if your Network browsing and RD connectivity issues goes away...</p>

            <p><span>Hello Hope,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for replying. We apologize for the delay in response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply, which was the update installed prior to the update?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Since the issue persists after an update was installed, I suggest you to perform
<strong><span>System restore</span></strong> by following the steps from the link below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> If you think an app, update, software or a driver that you recently installed or uninstalled caused problems with your PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a
<strong><span>restore point</span></strong>. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to <strong><span>Restore from a system restore point </span></strong>from the link below:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system
 restoring. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>After performing system restore, install all the pending updates on your PC by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>Settings</strong> and select the top most search result.</span></li><li><span>Se</span><span>lect <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> and select <strong>
Windows Update</strong> from the left side panel of the screen.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Check for Updates</strong> and wait for the update to download.</span></li><li><span>Close the window after the updates are installed and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persists, share the update you suspect is causing the issue by following the steps below:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows </strong>logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>settings</strong> and select the top most search result.</span></li><li><span>S</span><span>elect <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> and click on <strong>
Advanced Options </strong>from the window.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>View your updates history</strong> and check the recently installed update.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Write to us with the status of the issue for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p>

 have been different reasons stated on the blue screen. Here are a few that happened today;

            SP1 isn't installed, please do the following:<br />
[quote]<br />
1.&nbsp; Visit the PC manufacturer's website and update ALL drivers.&nbsp; DO NOT use Windows Update or the "Update drivers" function of Device Manager.<br />
2.&nbsp; Check Device Manager for any unknown/disabled devices - if there are unknown/disabled devices, fix them with the latest drivers from the device manufacturer's website (not the PC Manufacturer)<br />
3.&nbsp; Visit Windows Update and get all updates (may take repeated visits)<br />
4.&nbsp; Visit Windows Update and get Service Pack 1 (usually under Important Updates).&nbsp; Read these notes for installing SP1:&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505743</a><br />
5.&nbsp; Visit Windows Update and get any other available updates.&nbsp; May take repeated visits, but keep it up until you get several "Windows is updated" results.<br />
If you're having difficulties with installing a Service Pack, please use the SURTool from this link:&nbsp;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-System-Update-Readiness-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

http://windows.microsoft.com/troubleshootwindows7sp1</a><br />
<br />
I have had limited success in installing updates/Service Packs when using a "clean boot".&nbsp; I suspect that I'm just bypassing the problem - and that it can come back to bite me in the butt later on.<br />

<br />
The memory dumps seem to blame mouseim.sys - a driver program associated with Blue Eye Macro.&nbsp; It appears that they have a number of issues with driver installation - so I'd suggest uninstalling it to see if that helps you out.<br />

            Well, I don't know which one it was but I installed SP1 and uninstalled the BlueEye Macro and the problem seems to be fixed! As soon as you mentioned the BlueEye issue, I was convinced it was that as you mess with virtual driver and input things for the
 mouse during setup. Thank you very much for the assistance, I much appreciate it :)

    <title>1 monitor going blank in dual monitor setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            1 monitor going blank in dual monitor setup</h2>
                    <p>so i have this problem where one monitor is blank (ill use this term instead of black because there is still light coming through, its not off and not showing no dvi connection, its just blank).</p>
<p>
</p><p>im using windows 10, with amd bulldozer cpu, a gtx590 graphics, solid state drive.</p>
<p>i have one aoc 24inch and one philips 23inch in portrait mode. both on dvi. one monitor is plugged into the left bank of the graphics card and one monitor is plugged into the right bank of the graphics card (it is a dual gpu card, the top row of dvi is one
 gpu and bottom row of dvi is the other gpu on the same card).&nbsp;</p>
<p>i never had this problem on windows 7, upgraded windows about a year ago, &nbsp;and havnt had this problem until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i boot the images boot on my portrait monitor (which is my secondary monitor) sideways which is fine because that then normally changes to windows starting with my task bar being on my landscape monitor (my primary monitor). lately however, my primary
 monitor is staying blank and my secondary monitor is staying on with nothing but the 4 icons i have on it, and some pinned items on the task bar (not the full task bar) as i have an extended desktop set up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i change primary monitors to my portrait monitor it instantly fixes it, but it changes the background on the blank monitor from windows 10 logo to woman running on beach which seems strange enough. and this is all at no easy feat, i have to open display
 settings which opens on the blank monitor then click randomly to try find the window on a monitor i cant see anything on, then drag it to the working monitor to change it. it makes the uninstall and install noise and turns on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>after a shut down or restart, it goes back to being one blank monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i log out (mine is the only user anyway) then both monitors go blank and i cant see anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i change the resolution to a lower resolution it sometimes turns off and sometimes turns on, no resolution fixes it or breaks it necessarily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i unplug my portrait monitor the single monitor works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i start in safe mode it only allows one monitor and both work fine either way with safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did have f.lux running ( a program that takes the blue out of the monitor at night ) and unintalled it today with no progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ive gone into device manager and uninstalled both the monitors and unplugged them, turned one off started the pc and turned it back on just to have the same problem. most of the time i think i may have fixed it but i shut down or restart and it undoes the
 fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i updated nvidia drivers a few days ago. the monitors are both generic pnp monitors and drivers cant be upgraded according to windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i tried changing to 3 different power saving options and also went into trouble shooter which restarted my sleep mode settings. win+ctrl+shift+b also doesnt work. neither does win+p.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ive had this problem for a week, ive tried everything short of reinstalling windows which i want to avoid at any cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem i suspect has come from a windows update, the only other change i made around the same time, was removing the password from my user (it never used to have one, i just put one on temporarily while i was on holiday).</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help or experience with this problem would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that some settings were affected by a recent Windows update, causing the blank screen in one of your monitors. We'd like to learn more about your concern so that we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which build version of Windows 10 is currently on your computer? To check, click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. For example, 14393.1066.</li><li>Are you using a third-party antivirus program?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As initial troubleshooting, since you've already tried safe mode, perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> while you have both monitors connected to see if the screen still goes blank while Windows is operating with minimal drivers and programs. If both monitors work properly in a clean boot environment, check the section
<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong> for what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: To return your computer back to normal, check the section<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account &#47; Multiple Devices - Help</h2>
                    <p>Hi i need help working out what to do...and how Microsoft accounts work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 Microsoft Accounts (are these the same a live accounts?)...</p>
<ol>
<li>Created one way back on home pc as casual user (no Office 365 link)</li><li>Created another account as i ventured into creating my own business (Office 365 Personal a/c subscription)</li></ol>
<p>On my home desktop i use the (1) account to login. &nbsp;My business laptop i use (2) to login with (i'm self-employed, but also work a paid job). &nbsp;So for the paid job - i use another login specific to my paid job (an enterprise E3 licence which gives me all
 MS Office desktop applications).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased another desktop pc...and am now faced with what i consider to be confusing. &nbsp;What account do i use to login with on the new desktop pc? &nbsp;Do I use (1) which is the same as my old (still current) desktop pc or do i use (2) which is same
 as my business laptop login?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've actually used (1) - so I have the old desktop and this new desktop using the same login details - does this cause conflict anywhere - can both desktops be running at the same time without conflict or issues? &nbsp;Was that the right login to use? &nbsp;So confused!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I essentially want this new desktop to be tied to work-related (on my self-employed business) - so i guess i should have used (2) account to login in with?? &nbsp;If so - how can i get the new pc to use the (2) login details instead of the (1) login details.
 &nbsp;Do I have to create a new user account in control panel &nbsp;- then delete the old (1) login account (what happens to all the applications i've downloaded on the (1) profile - do i have to redo this all again for (2) account login? &nbsp;Can you copy from one user
 account profile to another?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other confusing part is the Office subscriptions involved here: &nbsp;on login (1) - i have no Office 365 subscription, but as any user can get free Office apps online (not desktop apps). &nbsp;on login (2) I have purchased the Office 365 Personal subscription
 for my self-employed business (£79 or something like that per year). &nbsp;Then for my paid work role I have Officer 365 Business Enterprise E3 plan - which gives me pretty much anything and everything. &nbsp;So am I paying for something I don't need for (2) login as
 i get the Office applications with the paid work subscription already - or do i need to keep that separate from the self-employed element?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess i'm just trying to get my head around how this all works and inter-relates...can someone help break this down in simple terms for me please?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First off there is no problem if you share one Microsoft account across multiple devices.</p>
<p>That is in fact what you want in most cases so that you can sync some of the settings and files between devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft account isn't as much connected to the device though as it is to the account.&nbsp; You could have multiple accounts on your machine all connected to different Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change what Microsoft account your account on your machine is connected to, by just first changing it to use a local account and then reconnect to the other Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Sign in with a local account instead</p>
<p>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Sign up with Microsoft account instead</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on the Office subscriptions.&nbsp; These are associated with your Microsoft account.&nbsp; I'm not sure if you can transfer them to another Microsoft account, but in your case it sounds like they are in the right place anyways.&nbsp; If that isn't true you would have
 to contact Microsoft support to see if they can change them to another Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main thing here is to see that if you are log into the Microsoft account that has no Office subscription, you are not going to be able to install Office on that machine without paying for it (or transfer it from the other Microsoft account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Past that what happens is going to depend on the subscription.</p>
<p>For instance the Home subscription allows using Office on up to 5 PC and 5 tablets/Phones.&nbsp; So with that one you wouldn't have to do anything other than install on the second PC and use it.&nbsp; You have the personal version though, which is for one PC and one
 Tablet/Phone.&nbsp; So if you are using that license you would most likely have to upgrade to the Home subscription (I'm making the assumption that there is no problem doing this as an upgrade).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the business license.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure on your exact subscription, but in the cases of the business ones I see, there doesn't seem to be any (reasonable) limit on the number of user, but you tend to pay per user.&nbsp; You might want to contact Microsoft
 support to see what best fits your needs.</p>

            <p>The more I think of this.&nbsp; There has to be a way that while installing Office you can tell it what subscription to use no matter which one the account is associated with.&nbsp; That is the only way it can support multiple users.</p>
<p>I have only done this for one user account and that is why I don't really have all the details.</p>
<p>Check with Microsoft support for the details.</p>

                    <p>I would like to alternate my file history drive daily between two 1.81 tb Passport drives to facilitate off-site storage. I can start file history over on the substituting drive, but I wish there was a better way. Also, in the process of starting over file
 history, I have had subsequent problems accessing file history files on the off-site/not-current file history drive. Is there any way to do this somewhat seamlessly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I have found great benefit from file history - just leaving a single file history system online and "on" all the time. Another major reason to want to do the daily swap is that it might be possible for malware to destroy both my active files and file
 history if all history is online all the time.</p>

            <p>Hi Atlanta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that there is no other way to perform the actions other than what you are practicing on alternate days. As you have more Hard disk space available on both the drives, you can continue the same to create backup/recovery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when you say “<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">off-site/not-current file history drive</span>”, are you connected to a network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert with necessary information for better assistance in this regard.</p>

            <p>&gt;when you say “<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">off-site/not-current file history drive</span>”, are you connected to a network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am connected to a LAN but I purposely store the off-site drive disconnected from everything and off. Backup and recovery files are on both alternating file history drives but with different backup dates.</p>
<p>My biggest concern is why when I bring the offline drive online, I sometimes fail to find that drive's file history files. Are there conditions when Windows 10 deletes the second file history structure?</p>

            <p>I continue to alternate drives, but it is very cumbersome and so I now do it monthly. It could sure work better for those of us that wish to have off-site/off-line storage. The problem with missing file history has not happened twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there not a way to do this more easily? There is good reason to want to have backup offline where malware cannot wipe out both the active system and the history. I wish you could have both drives online briefly as you switch backup drives so that file
 history could be updated from the old to the new prime backup drive. As it is, you need to do a complete new Backup and Restore (Windows 7-type) each time. It takes me 9 hours computer time in order to have a backup drive contain history from a backup and
 I have a 3Gh, 8 GB ram, 64-bit machine.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Enterprise upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise without product key</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company previously used the old MS MAK licensing however, about 6 months ago we moved to Windows CSP licensing. We were originally told that machines using the old MAK keys won't be effected and will continue to work. Just over a month ago machines started
 to pop up with the counterfeit message saying that it is no longer activated. Our plan moving forward is to install Exchange and begin using Azure AD with CSP licensing.&nbsp;I need to start upgrading our&nbsp;machines from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and then enter a trial
 key (for 3 months which will cover us for the period of moving to Azure AD), I've successfully upgraded about&nbsp;6 machines so far and entered the key after it had upgraded to Windows 10. I have one machine however, that won't accept the trial key and continues
 to return the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows reported that no product key was found on your device. error code 0xc004f213"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will not let me activate it which is becoming very frustrating, I've read in some places people saying it's not possible but the fact I've already done this on a few machines makes me believe it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run&nbsp;"slmgr /upk" from an elevated command prompt followed by "slmgr -ipk trial-product-key" it claims to be activated but the actual activation window through Start &gt; Settings &gt; Activation still remains inactive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody shed some light on this please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

<div>My car radio can read a cd of mp3's, i chose it specifically for that reason.</div>

<div>I still think finalising is your issue. Did you try CDBurner XP ? This software (free) actually asks you if you want to finalise the cd before burning process starts.

<h2>            Recover Data from NTFS Drive From Old XP PC Which Has a Recovery Device Attached to USB3&#47;eSATA Port on Windows 10 Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;am trying to recover data from an old XP machine that died a few years ago. I have the old NTFS hard drive in a recovery device attached to my Windows 10 USB3-eSATA port. Windows recognizes it and I can read the data fine, but when I try to copy it I first
 get, "You are not authorized to open", then when I try to look or change ownership of the file I get, "File could not be decrypted." I have no access to the old encryption files or key. Is there any way to get this data on my Windows 10 NTFS drive?

<p>As I clearly stated, I have no access to any encryption data or encryption key. The process you point out is based on "<strong>the predication [is] that encryption password must be known or SAM database must be present (Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008,
 Windows 7, 8).</strong>" Could you please remove your response so as not to cloud the issue/question. Thanks.
<br />
<br />
On second thought, I should say that I don't know what a SAM database is or where it might be, or if the encryption password is something that is lying around on the old drive that easeUS&nbsp; might be able to find. I deleted everything I could delete except personal
 with and have no trust in if it didn't have a fairly good chance of finding what it needs to function. Would you think these requirements might be in files that could not be deleted. It sounds unlikely since the process insinuated that the SAM database and
 password could be missing. </p>

<p>Oh, sorry but I'm just trying to help in here. It's not about <strong>CLOUDING</strong> the issue or question, it's us,

<p>At least someone is trying to help you than just wait for sometime for an answer, you know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, <strong>Windows XP is already not supported up to Vista</strong>, so you really NEED an ACCESS..</p>

<p>Just saw your other response.. Sorry for that..</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;SAM database are the ones that stores the
</span>encryption password of the file/s you want to recover or to get from Windows XP, you can able to access it if you have the admin rights or access on the said machine..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this is just a third party application to recover or to get the files from XP since I mentioned that it is not supported anymore, however I do understand that there are files stored in XP that you still need and needs to run in compatibility mode
 to Windows 10 (because that's what happened to me before honestly, by&nbsp; jumping to Vista to 7, 8 and so on..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't trust the said app that's pretty fine, it will be your decision and if you feel that it is not safe, then don't do, we can figure out what other things that can be done (which includes on the other link I gave because you said you don't have
 access to it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies on my 2nd reply, I admit that's just my feeling attacked on it..</p>

<p>Oh, sorry for creating any "attacked" feelings, but I was already aware of the easeus product and what it required and I had stated that I don't have the encryption password and deleted all I could from the old drive once I got access to it, so I thought
 it a moot point to mention easeus if I could not meet its basic requirements.&nbsp;To me it was&nbsp;like I said, "I don't have
<strong>A</strong>" and then someone says,&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try this using&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>". But, if easeus can find what it needs... who knows? I am trying it, but have little confidence. It is just frustrating and amazes me that I can view the data just fine, but I can't&nbsp;move
 it! </p>

            EaseUS is now a scam. They offer you a free trial, then after wasting an hour + of your time they only allow you to see what data could be recovered. They will NOT recover it for you unless you pay $56.

            If you have any help to give I will graciously accept it. There is no "arguing" going on here, just a statements of facts, some of which you seem to miss or ignore. I missed your last link, myself. My statement on easeus is for anyone who reads this thread
 and&nbsp;attempts to use it, which you have evidently not done for some period of time. There is no "sudden renewal" after a free trial. The free trial I downloaded and installed DOES NOT allow one to recover anything. Nothing. It only shows what could be recovered
 and then asks for $56 before you can recover anything, just exactly as I previously stated. Any "free trial" of a product that does not&nbsp;allow you to actually try the function it was created for before asking for money is A SCAM.
<br />
<br />
I realize now that some of the data is accessible, but the vast majority of the data I cannot change ownership on, or even read. I do see that ownership on the drive is set to EVERYONE and EVERYONE is Allowed ... FULL CONTROL. The problem is whenever I try
 to access the data in any way I get an error message stating the "file could not be decrypted." I read the story at your second link and, unfortunately, I cannot do this with the decryption problem, but It got me thinking about encryption/decryption so I googled
 "cannot decrypt external drive" and I found a discussion about how to encrypt/decrypt data using WIndows Bit Locker options. I could not decrypt drive "E" (external drive), but I am in the process of encrypting it. I thought this might erase and rewrite any
 encryption headers (for lack of better term) and then allow me access. Encrypting at the rate it is will take hours. Will post results.

<p>Encrypting the drive using BitLocker did nothing. Same problem. First "You do not have authority", then when attempting to select for&nbsp;ownership change, "Unable to decrypt." &nbsp;Ideas?

    <title>Mouse conflicting with USB sound - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse conflicting with USB sound</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 headset, and recently purchased a World of Warcraft Cataclysm MMO Gaming Mouse. After installing the mouse software, the sound coming through the headset has become distorted. I tried another USB headset and the same
 thing happens. Uninstalling the mouse software, plugging in a new mouse and restarting the computer returns the sound to normal. This is only happening through USB sound. The speakers connected to my sound card are unaffected. Windows updates are fully installed.
 Is there some way to resolve the conflict between devices? I've considered buying a PCI USB card to separate them but I don't know if that will solve anything.

<p><span><strong><span>Hi melissa-m,</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Try the below troubleshooting steps:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></span><span><strong><span><br />
<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>Put the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
a. Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
b. Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in XP:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state?</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></span></span></a><span><span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>
 After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned&nbsp;under the section 'Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state'&nbsp;in the above KB article.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:<br />
<br />
</span></strong></span><span><strong><span>Also check if there any software available for the Gaming Mouse.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3:<br />
<br />
</span></strong></span><span><strong><span>You may also install the latest drivers for your sound card and then check for the issue.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Regards,</span></strong></span><span><strong><span><br />
