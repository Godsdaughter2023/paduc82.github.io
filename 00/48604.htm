    <title>Strange behavior of my keyboard under windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phrenz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange behavior of my keyboard under windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm desperate, and that's why i'm here to ask. I have really strange behavior of my keyboard and wonder what could be. So, basically when you type any special character like @$%! the symbol doesn't show but once you press another key. This happened on my
 previous windows 7 too, but at this point i wasn't so frustrated. Here goes the things i tried (have in mind that my keyboard is really simple one):&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. changing the keyboard - i tried at least 5 of any kind +Microsoft's some model - same situation. at the moment i'm owning Roccat Ryos MK2 Pro - and that's really annoying since this is my dream keyboard (for both working and playing) and it's supposed
 to be way over the normal keyboards.</p>
<p>2. changing the driver, older, newer - nothing really happened (i i'm still trying with simple keyboard in order to prevent 3rd party problems)</p>
<p>3. fresh install - since i have SSD hard drive - it's really easy to change my windows installation. tried with the repair from control panel, and absolutely clean install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. at this point i thought that the problem is in the hardware - updated BIOS, downgraded BIOS - nothing really happened.</p>
<p>5. changing the port where my keyboard is in - have more than 4 plus in front of my PC.</p>
<p>6. since i'm working as system administrator - i tried to install CentOS 6.5 - doesn't have this problem at all - so here i am - asking you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the protocol my system is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mainboard: Gigabyte P67-DS3-B3 rev 1.0</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i3 2100 Socket 1155 LGA</p>
<p>SSD: Seagate 120GB ST120HM000-1G51142</p>
<p>HDD: Seagate 1TB&nbsp;ST1000VX000-1CU162</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall my configuration is not so new (at the moment can't afford anything better) but i really wish to know what can spawn such behavior. Looked from the side - it's really stupid thing to ask - but imagine if i have to configure/monitor/watch over 1000
 servers remotely and need to enter mostly special characters. I even learned most of my passwords with double-hitting the keyboard ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, any answer, suggestion, or just comment will be highly appreciated since this is making my work harder and harder everyday!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BR</p>

            <p><span>Hi PhrenZ, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer this question to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have a program called Constant Guard installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might occur due to a conflict between a program and the special character keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may check the Programs and Features screen to see if this particular program is installed. If you find this program Constant Guard installed on the computer then you may uninstall this program and restart the computer to check if this helps.</span></p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>What happens if you tap the same key instead?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm thinking those&nbsp;keys on your&nbsp;keyboard may be operating the same way that special keys are overloaded&nbsp;on the "chicklet" keyboard in the TIP.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. instead of tapping on some of the letter keys you can tap
 and hold to make them bring up an array of loosely related keys from other languages.*&nbsp;&nbsp; A related analogy would be "texting" on a telephone.&nbsp; E.g. multiple taps on the same key would cycle you through the set of letters that were related to that key and switching
 to another key would leave the last one you left showing as the one that you "typed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>* An early preview gives a good description of the feature</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/07/17/designing-the-windows-8-touch-keyboard.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/07/17/designing-the-windows-8-touch-keyboard.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>"&nbsp;interesting counter example in press-and-hold behavior"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to do is open the On-Screen Keyboard, e.g. Run... osk.exe&nbsp; since doing that may show you some clues in their potentially more relevant keycaps than the potentially "incorrect" physical keycaps.&nbsp; Note that unfortunately it is not possible to
 have both the OSK and the TIP open at the same time, so while the OSK is running you would not be able to start the TIP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>

<p>When i type " if i don't take any action the symbol is not show, but if i take any other action (using space bar, typing the next char, the symbol shows)</p>

<p>How are you using it?&nbsp; As a diagnostic for your real keyboard or as a key generator?&nbsp; So, what do you see in each case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what keyboard, in particular what manufacturer, since there is probably an even better&nbsp;diagnostic from that source.&nbsp; For example, Microsoft keyboard owners can use mskey.exe.</p>
<p>

<h2>            XBOX 360 disc drive laser &#40;open tray error&#41;</h2>
                    &nbsp;My xbox 360's disc drive laser seems to barely be moving even with all the fixes i tried. It first moves close to the center of the disc then stays there and moves just ever so slightly. The disc then stops spinning and starts again. This proccess is
 repeated once more and then once it spins again the laser dissapears and the disc spins really fast then stops and I get an open tray error.

<h2>            Reverting to earlier Skype version</h2>
                    <p>Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will not listen.&nbsp; Not having the ability anymore to group my contacts and losing the ability to have multiple chat windows open is a major productivity loss and inconvenience for me.&nbsp; Many other features they changed or removed have me pulling
 my hair out as well and to the best of my knowledge, nobody who uses it asked for these changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know of a way to revert to an earlier version of Skype and have it stick?&nbsp; I was on the earlier version, had the updated disabled, but Microsoft slipped in a forced update and screwed me over.&nbsp; Does anybody know of any alternative software packages
 that use the Skype infrastructure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing else I guess I can always start over with my contacts on Google Hangouts.</p>

            Hi Tink-Maryland ,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Skype Classic was discontinued a while ago. I can only urge you to voice your opinion to the Skype Developers at UserVoice so that if it gets enough traction they will consider something:-

    <title>Skype For Business Recording not working from a meeting invite if not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samantha johnston &#40;samantha.johnston&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype For Business Recording not working from a meeting invite if not the organiser</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Myself and a colleague have access to Skype for Business recording functions and are able to record via meet now. If we send a Skype meeting request we can only record if we are the organiser, when trying to record if not the organiser, the record function
 is not available.</p>
<p>This is causing issues because working on a project, the meetings are set up by admin support and we are invited as attendees, we cannot find an easy way to enable recording unless we set up the calendar invite which is not really appropriate.</p>
<p>I have used Lync recording in the past and anyone attending the meeting could record if they had the recording option enabled. We do not have recording enabled for all users in the business, would this make a difference? could it just be a setting we need
 turned on?</p>
<p>We have a meeting tomorrow which we want to record so it would be good to get some answers</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Samantha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your update. Based on your description, the issue is that you can't record meeting even if you are the presenter. And only organizer can record meeting. If there is anything wrong, please feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, meeting organizer and presenters can record the meeting by default. In your case, please contact your admin to check if recording is enabled. For your reference:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please go to <strong>Skype for Business admin center &gt; online meetings &gt; brodcast meetings</strong>, then check the&nbsp;<strong>Allow broadcast meetings to be recorded</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't work, could you please provde the followings：</p>
<ol>
<li>Please let me know whether other users have the same issue in your organization.&nbsp;</li><li>May I know if your plan is Skype for Business standalone?</li><li>Could you please tell me the detailed Skype for Business version?</li><li>Regarding to the issue, may I know if you can find the record button? Could you please provide a screenshot of it?</li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might occur due to the following reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The volume is online and it has outstanding changes.</li><li>Changes were made to the volume and the computer was shut down before the changes were committed to the disk.</li><li>Corruption was detected on the volume. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform a <strong>chkdsk </strong>by following the steps provided below and check if it helps.
<strong>chkdsk</strong> runs to verify the file system integrity and to attempt to fix any issues with the volume.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + X keys</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>Type the command line below and press Enter:</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>CHKDSK C: /F /R</strong>&nbsp;(Replace the letter "C" with the drive letter of the SD card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface PRO &#40;First Generation&#41; Micro SD Issue</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface PRO i5, 4GB RAM and 128GB hard Drive with windows 8.1 for quite a long and I'm pretty happy with it.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that my surface hard drive is almost full I have ordered a 128GB microSD to add additional space to my surface.</p>
<p>I bought from a online retailer a 20€ 128GB (pretty cheap) when I install it on my surface I immediately start to copy from my hard drive to the micro sd. After copying I check that the content was not all there, in fact was only 10GB, the rest was empty
 folders.</p>
<p>Immediately check the microsd software on my surface and was everything ok, and card never unmounted during the copying process. I tried on my other laptop and was working fine. After I format it and with a USB adapter I copy everything again, and by surprise
 nothing change. Again copied 10GB and fill the rest with empty folders (like copied only the folders and not the content).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I tried to check the real content via online website which confirm that the real content was 128GB!!!!</p>
<p>I complain to the online retailer and by surprise he apologies and send me a free of charge 256GB microSD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just tested the card with the online tool, and confirm that exists 256GB of free space.</p>
<p>So, I again try to copy but the same thing happens, it only copies the first 10GB (no error or message appears during the copying process) maintaining the all folder structure but all empty (except the ones of the first 10GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me what to do to use the full capacity of the MicroSD card?</p>
<p />

<p>IceStorm III is correct</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to repair your console is to send it off to Microsoft using the <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
repair center</a>. Anything less than that can void your warrenty and result in a console ban. Please see the following from the Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to the Internet- my computer says there is an unidentified network. &#8203;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Having problems connecting to Internet with windows vista</p>
<p>I am having problems connecting to my Internet. After I checked to see what the problem was and tried to diagnose the problem windows popped up with these options.&nbsp;
</p>
<div>1- that I could automatically get a new IP setting for the network adapter "location Area Connection".&nbsp;</div>
<div>2-a problem with your network router or broadband modem might be preventing an Internet connection.&nbsp;</div>
<div>3- to reset the network adapter "Local Area Connection ".&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have tried all of those possibilities and I can't still connect to the Internet. I've called the wireless provider and they said that they're are no problems with your computer connecting to our connector. This is after we went through all of the following
 things.&nbsp;</div>
<div>1- the agent from wild blue Internet provider had me relaease and renew the ip address.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2- reset the DHCP</div>
<div>3- rebooted all he equipment.&nbsp;</div>
<div>4- said that all green values are there for the Internet connection.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have tried calling your services but. Ant get through which really frustrates me and shows that that isn't good customer service at all. So now I'm at the end of my roots and cannot figure out what to do. I've tried everything online and over the phone.
 It would much appreciated if I could just get Internet access back.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ps- I forgot to mention that my computer says there is an unidentified network so I don't know what that means. And I have Windows Vista installed on this computer so I would really appreciate the help and have he Internet back.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you- Cailin</div>

</p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span><span> Please go through step 7 of the Kb to keep the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span> </strong></p>
<p><span>Disable antivirus and check the issue status.</span> </p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<h2>            .Checking c drive consistency - deleting corrupt file</h2>
                    I have an NHS work laptop which I can use remotely at home. This week it opened with wanting to check my c drive for consistencies. It checked 3 areas one of which said it was deleting a corrupt file. I now can't access work files and I'm worried whether
 my computer has been hacked or if it is just some problem with the software. I have to go through a whole process of various passwords to actually link up to my work files so am hoping nothing has been compromised. Advice much appreciated.

<p>I am testing out 10 LTSB at home, but that seems to be a nightmare as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, at home I use my computer to accomplish work, not play games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main desktop at home is running a very trimmed version of Windows 7 Pro. &nbsp;Everything has been removed except what I use. &nbsp;It is stable, and if something works one way today it will work the same way tomorrow. &nbsp;If I want the Control Panel icon to be in
 one place today, it will be in the same place tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, Creator update moves the control panel link as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am extremely disappointed in Windows 10 over all. &nbsp;I would say that it would have saved the company a ton of money to find us some old Windows 7 machines and upgrade them instead of giving us these awful Win10 machines at work.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from updating to the Creators update, were there any changes made on your computer before encountering the issue?</li><li>What exactly is happening to your computer? What are the issues you're experiencing?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you've done so far?</li><li>Are you encountering any error messages when you're using your computer?</li></ul>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Prior to the awful creator update the main changes is that I had removed every pre-installed app that you can using the proper console methods. &nbsp;I had disabled Cortana, and Edge browser (Plus whatever other useless stuff could not be removed via proper channels,
 or just reinstalled itself via Windows Update) by moving them to a removed files folder within the SystemApps folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update now my start menu completely died (as in could not even shutdown without hitting Alt-f4), which is fine I just replaced it with Classic Shell, which is a far better interface anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the biggest problem is my work computer keeps getting filled up with garbage apps that serve no purpose on a work computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In what universe do I need X-box support at work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would I ever use Edge? &nbsp;Cortana may be great for people who don't know how a computer works or know how to type, but this is a WORK COMPUTER, I cannot afford the security risk of accidentally triggering Cortana while I am dealing with sensitive customer
 information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Cortana even remotely HIPPA complaint? &nbsp;I am guessing not, but you are going to have to figure that out before someone determines how to make a simple proxy rule and does a man-in-the-middle attack and starts stealing sensitive data by listening in on
 transferred data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the 10 machine at home, it isn't working yet, keeps dying, violently. &nbsp;As in it wont boot, wont repair, and bricks. &nbsp;I think that machine is going back to 7 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update popped up and asked me what I wanted to do, but it never stated what the update was. &nbsp;If I would have known I would have never installed it. &nbsp;If I had a choice I would have never allowed a Windows 10 computer inside this work network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of the apps you found in your work computer are part of Windows 10. Those apps are the default apps in Windows 10. Every fresh install of Windows 10 will include Cortana, Edge, Xbox, and other default applications. In the case of Cortana, it acts as
 a quick search tool so that you can search anything without accessing any web browsers. You can always choose to hide Cortana by right clicking the task bar and choosing "Hide" if you don't want to use Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your home computer, kindly explain to us what you mean by "it isn't working yet, keeps dying, violently" for us to provide you the proper troubleshooting steps. Are you encountering any messages when you attempt to use your home computer? Can you
 still login to your computer? How many minutes or hours does it take before your computer "dies"? What happens when your computer "dies"? Does it go into a blue screen?</p>
<p>

<p>The new direction of Microsoft is to run in the direction that the insiders push it. &nbsp;There seems to be this concept of "no computer left behind" whereby everyone gets the same computer and no one should be using anything different. &nbsp;Yes, I realize this
 is the help forum, and the people on here do not work at Microsoft, but also the forum is heavily loaded with the people who make up the Windows Insiders and Beta Testers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am saying that the Insiders and the Beta Testers are doing a dis-service to the computer community by making the apps that Microsoft offers up compulsory instead of optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Pro not Home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 2000 came with X-Box support, that could not be removed, would that have been acceptable at the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 2000 came with a search feature that sent telemetry data off of the computer in order to function would that have been acceptable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it wouldn't have, and that was a long time ago before many of the sophisticated attacks that occur today became more common place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So no, you are not Microsoft, but Microsoft, does, theoretically listen to what is happening on the forum so they can gauge the response that they are getting to their actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the point of creating this thread. &nbsp;To show that some of us are horrifically frustrated by the direction of things and hope that at some point the "no computer left behind" mentality gets dialed back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current state of affairs in not tenable, the inclusion of Windows 10 at this job will be listed as one of my reasons for leaving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is how bad Windows 10 is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why I post on this forum in the hope that someone actually listens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you are wondering, I have IT experience. &nbsp;I run servers. &nbsp;I create my own drivers when devices are no longer supported, or are not designed to work properly in environments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I demand the ability to shut off many of these applications because they cause problems. &nbsp;Many more than you are aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the constant 100% hard drive access caused by the combination of having windows update constantly update things and indexing service double checking things hastens the death of your hard drives, which is aggravated my the proliferation of SSD
 which have a stricter limit of write cycles. &nbsp;Windows 10, with its current configuration is designed to cause hardware failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some how this seems acceptable to everyone else. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a few days now I am having problems with my Windows 10. My laptop turns on when I press power botton, the manufacturer logo shows up for some time, and then nothing. I get the rotating loading sign for&nbsp; several seconds and then the screen goes blank
 with a cursor that appears and desapears from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to enter Windows recovery environment. I tried to force shutdown and then restart my laptop 3 times, both when manufacturer logo is on the screen, and when it desapears and windows tries to start up but nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to enter BIOS but I don't know if there is any option that could help me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to enter Windows RE or some other way to troubleshoot my problem at first place?&nbsp;</p>

            Hello NNasev,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try repairing boot records, using these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />5. Type following commands one-by-one and press Enter key after each:
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /SCANOS
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /FIXMBR
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /FIXBOOT
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD
<br />
<br />6. Close Command Prompt and see if you can boot now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

            Hi NN.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes you will see that , its just the way that ports are mapped by NAT when they travel across the internet, they will still be remapped back to the correct port when you receive them</p>
<p>This is a good presentation of how Xbox live uses NAT <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/confirmation.aspx?id=7288#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>All fixes at this point are temporary, even the one where you delete the profile and relink it to the system. &nbsp;If you experience this, just clear the system cache (hold down Xbox logo on system for 15 seconds then let go) and it should allow the next disc
 to read appropriately. &nbsp;All that support tells me is to wait until the April update and that should fix this problem. &nbsp;I know it is a pain and all, but just be patient.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are not in the system update beta, you will not experience this.</p>

<p>Typical Microsoft, oh no biggie... 500$+ for your system, been nothing but b.s. since I've bought this, how about not rushing out the system until you have all your crap together. The part that makes no sense is that I applied for the system beta and never
 got a response, and then the update before Titanfall launched so I figured I never had the system beta. Wow unplugging the power supply is enraging each time you switch out a game or turn the system on with a game in it. Thanks for the other way you stated
 above to clear the cache by holding the button down for 15seconds. UGH!</p>

<p>I honestly forgot that I signed up and am apart of the beta testing. I thought it was my system crapping out on me. WE DID sign up and agree to these happenings so it's understood. Just glad it wasn't an isolated incident.</p>

<p>If Holding the Xbox logo for 15 seconds does not work try doing a hard reset. This tends to resolve most issues I have had up to this point including this disc read error. &nbsp;</p>

<p>but here's the thing I've been dealing with this issue since titanfall came out and I was THIS close to trading in my xb1 for a PS4, but a friend persuaded me not too. So I've been doing an experiment I did the hard reset by unplugging the system and &nbsp;i
 didn't &nbsp;put the Titanfall game in at all, and I didn't get an error code with any of my other games. So is the Titanfall game itself causing the problem since it was the main reason for the update? And I too was in the beta.</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;Only thing that is a guaranteed fix, &nbsp;is to do a factory reset. Note, all games, save files, and apps will be erased. It's like hooking your system up for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;A mere "thanks for understanding," is not enough for me to live with this ugly disc read error bug. Let the big boys at MS iron this mess out. Funny, it was a friend who recommended signing up for the beta testing. These days people consider beta's to
 be cool demos in which you get try everything first. I knew what I was in for but never expected to run into such a deal breaker. Unregistered, playing again with no issues, and lesson learned. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Thanks but no thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Update. </p>
<p>A factory reset did not work. After reinstalling ALL MY GAMES, the disc read error came right back like it never left. Only method I find to consistently work is, to wait 20- 30 seconds. Let the disc get grabbed back in and wait. The disc drive will begin
 running again on its own and the game icon will reappear on the dashboard. It's now safe to change games with no error.</p>

<p>Hi there try this when ejecting the disc the console will draw the disc back in once it does wait 30 seconds for the disc drive to wake up, once it does it will read the current disc it will appear on the dashboard, once it does swap out your disc. Works
 100% of the time tested by the dev team and official support. </p>

<p>I contacted Xbox Support and they walked me through this. &nbsp;It works, but will require a reboot at the end:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Go to "Settings", "Disk &amp; Blu Ray", and then Clear Persistent storage</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Go to "Settings", "Network", "Advanced Settings", then clear the alternate mac address. &nbsp;It will then tell you to reboot and give you the option to do it on this screen.</p>
<p>Once you come back from the reboot you can remove the disk and insert another one. &nbsp;The next time you take that disk out, disk will get sucked in and you have to perform the 2 steps above once again.</p>
<p>I decided to hell with it and got a replacement Xbox. &nbsp; I won't be applying for anymore beta testing, now that I know that's what caused it!!!!!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I'd just like to say that the TUK TUK is the most underrated vehicle in the game. It has 3 wheels, holds 3 passengers in the rear (or up to 7 little people) &amp; has a powerful horn to warn enemies of my impending arrival. There is nothing funner on hastings
 or phubaibai then to roll out my uber tuk tuk, start blasting on the horn and looking for some roadkills!!! If you've been the victim of my tuk tuk roadkill expertise, then whoaaaaaaaaaa is you!!! I'm getting some upgrades on it while I'm here at work, specifically
 bullet/mortar/shell proof glass, forward/rear rocket launchers, and a new cigarette lighter. Beware all!! Fuzzy's coming for ya!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EPSON PERFECTION V600 SCANNER SOFTWARE</h2>
                    <div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Right after installing all provided Epson Perfection V600 software, the first time I tried to open a Word document I got this pop-up:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Word is running into problems with the: C\program files (x86)\common files\abbyy\finereadersprint\9.00\integration\finereaderlite.word.temp l.dot add-in</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>"If this keeps happening, disable this add-in and check for available updates".</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>SO I REBOOTED, AND NOW WHEN I TRY TO OPEN THAT SAME WORD DOC, it says "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to open the same Word file again it said:</p>
<div>
<p>"If this keeps happening, disable this add-in and check for available updates".</p>
<p>So I clicked YES.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>Then tried to reopen the same Word file and again get:</p>
<p>"A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to open an excel file, I get the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am leery of downloading any more non-Microsoft files.&nbsp; What can I do now? Wait on Microsoft?</p>
<p />

<p>Epson v600 uses ABBYY Fine Reader Sprint.&nbsp; There is a compatibility problem with the ABBYY Fine reader and a plugin it loads into Office.&nbsp; To solve this problem, if you go to their website you will find an update for ABBYY Fine Readers Sprint 9.0.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;you
 can disable the plugin by using the run command and running winword /safe.&nbsp; Go to Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Manage: Com Add-ins&nbsp;&gt; Go</p>

            <p>BorderRider, I'm sorry I missed your post in February. If you're still having the same problem, it's the fault of the Abbyy FineReader add-in for Word (an optical character recognition program) that was installed along with the Epson software. Please visit
 the page at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/finereader/sprint-9/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/finereader/sprint-9/faq/</a>&nbsp;and follow the instructions to disable the add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for continuing to support Windows XP, just how deep are your pockets? I can tell you that $100/year isn't going to do it:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/us-navy-pays-out-millions-to-microsoft-to-keep-running-windows-xp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/us-navy-pays-out-millions-to-microsoft-to-keep-running-windows-xp/</a>.
 And while I can agree that Windows 10 so far hasn't been the smoothest product Microsoft has produced, I think Windows 7 is as good as XP, and it will continue to get security updates until January 2020.</p>

            <p>I paid $150 to MS to hopefully fix all of these problems with Windows 10, but all I got was the Phillipines.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And the Phillipines have proven repeatedly that they cannot help.<span>&nbsp; </span>
So I am requesting my card company to reverse that $150 for “breach of contract”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To clean up a statement as much as possible, this Windows 10 is the worst FusterCluck ever passed off as useful software!<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight I had ENDLESS **** with a 500+ page Word Document, which performed perfectlty with XP.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With Windows 10 it takes at least 1 minute to open, then if I try to do a search (for a word or phrase), the God Damned thing crashes!!<span>&nbsp;
</span>This has been going on for a DAMNED YEAR NOW!!<span>&nbsp; </span>No FIX from the Phillipines.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And I have sent at least 40 “crash reports” to MS over the last several months, but NOTHING EVER IMPROVES!!<span>&nbsp;
</span>The fact is that MS doesn’t give a flying crap about its customers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>IT’S ALL ABOUT MONEY-MS MONEY!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But tonight was SPECIAL **** with this same document.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tonight I would add a few words, push “save” and it seemed to save.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But after a while I see that my document’s file name has been changed to a WRD.tmp, because the damned thing crashed --- and LOST all of my “saved” changes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That cost me another FOUR HOURS trying to find what all did not save, and try to recall what changes were made.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I became so God Damned Angry, that if that MS “president” (whover the **** he is) was nearby, I swear to God I would break his neck with my bare hands!!<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am 71 years old, but that is how pissed I am with this CRAP called Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my first 5 years out of College, I worked with Top Secret Security Clearanes designing Military Equipment, and the next 40 years in another industry where Bad Mistakes KILL.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have NO PATIENCE with INCOMPETANCE, the likes of Microsoft, because INCOMPETANCE KILLS.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It kills people, large companies, small companies, and certainly financially KILLS any small busines like my own – when caused by STUPID SOFTWARE.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft has NO EXCUSE.<span>&nbsp; </span>They should have continued supporting XP.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But NO, out of Sheer Greed, they QUIT XP and issued this CRAPPY Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi Yogesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to assist you in regards to Modern Setup Host, we would like to inform that Modern Setup Host or SetupHost.exe is a self-extracting archive and installer, which runs as a scheduled task everytime a user logs in. The priority showing there would be
 its default. This shows on how it uses your CPU, Memory, and even Disk usage. It would be best to have it by default rather than changing it to avoid any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Samsung M3 Portable 1TB external hard drive not showing up on Drive Manager</h2>
                    <p>I've seen similar issues regarding Windows 10 and Samsung external hard drives however, mine is slightly different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 recently and have found that my Samsung M3 Portable 1 TB is not working correctly. I have installed Samsung Drive Manager but when I open it there is no information regarding my external hard drive, no drives displayed and no options
 to choose (see screenshot). The drive shows up on This PC, Disk Management and Device Manager, but the Samsung Drive Manager is blank everytime. I've scoured the internet forums for a solution to this but it seems most people have a slightly different problem
 in that their external hard drives don't show up in the same places as me. I have never used this external hard drive to back up my data, but I remember when I had Windows 8, the Drive Manager program seemed to work fine and I at least had the option to back
 up if I wanted to. Any help that you can offer is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Specs:</p>
<p>
HP ENVY m6 Notebook PC<br />
Windows 10 Home<br />
<br />
System<br />
<br />
Processor: AMD A10-5750M with Radeon HD Graphics 2.50 GHz<br />

            <p>It sounds like the issue is with the Samsung Drive Manager software and not the drive itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the following topic the&nbsp;poster received information from Seagate Support&nbsp;saying the&nbsp;Samsung AutoBackup software is not compatible with Windows 10:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/samsung-m3-portable-hard-drive-doesnt-like-windows/0732aefa-1fcd-471c-907e-d2c51f669b5b">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/samsung-m3-portable-hard-drive-doesnt-like-windows/0732aefa-1fcd-471c-907e-d2c51f669b5b</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is not listed as a supported operating system in the download link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/item/samsung-drive-manager-master-dl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/item/samsung-drive-manager-master-dl/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try uninstalling Samsung Drive Manager and then reinstall the latest version of&nbsp;Samsung Drive Manager using "Compatibility Mode" and choose a previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the software itself may have to be updated for Windows 10.</p>
