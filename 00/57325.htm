            <p>What is the folder location?</p>
<p>It sounds like an installation folder, and if that is the case deleting to the recycle bin, would enable you to determine whether anything else is impacted, as it can allways be restored.</p>

<h2>            Skype Video Quality with Microsoft Lifecam Cinema</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before MS purchased Skype, the video calling quality from my MS Lifecam Cinema camera used to be awesome - really high quality 720P video.<br />
<br />
Since MS took Skype over, I now find the video quality atrocious, around 240 or 360P in resolution by the looks of it and at very low quality bit rates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I go into the Skype settings, I find page settings for the tonal adjustment of the Lifecam, but the page that controlled the video resolution has disappeared. The result is I'm locked into 240P or so video calling with awful bit rates.<br />
<br />
I'm struggling to understand why MS appear to have taken the resolution adjustment out of Skype.<br />
<br />
I could hardly have more compatibility with a MS Skype App as I have an MS HD Webcam and 40mbs Fibre connection and Win 10.<br />
<br />
Only adjustments Syke offers (2 windows side by side):<br />
<br />

<p>I have a similar issue in that the LifeCam is recognised (sometimes, LifeCam the mic is recognised but the camera isn't) but the auto level adjust doesn't work at all so the images are dark and un-useable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there is no camera control panel it makes what was a good camera a useless investment!</p>

                    <p>After my computer froze, I restarted it back up and all at once every key makes a pinging noise, even if I mute speaker. Holding shift key down makes constant sound. It is annoying, but doesn't seem to give me any trouble, so far.</p>

<h2>            STOP NAGGING ME&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is a pretty good operating system.&nbsp; In general I liked it.&nbsp; However, I found the occasional popup reminders annoying enough that I removed Windows 10 from the computer I was testing it on and installed Ubuntu instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main machine, the one I'm using right now, has never had Windows 10 on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; AND NEVER WILL IF I CAN AVOID IT!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is because of that annoying popup that keeps bugging me about my free copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate popups...&nbsp;&nbsp; Hate them to the point where, a system that I was slightly inclined to favor is something I now hate and despise.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, PLEASE, for your sake and mine.&nbsp; PLEASE, remove that damm popup from my computer.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying to my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per an update from microsoft, in Windows 7, occasionally, when I log onto my computer, there'll be a blue box on the lower right hand side of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The box didn't show up today, so I can't quote it.&nbsp; Roughly it says, "Please reserve your free
 copy of Windows 10 today".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say how often this box has popped up.&nbsp; It's been around once a week or so, maybe more often.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it cropped up a couple of times this week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, I find this message to be troublesome for a number of reasons.</p>

</p><p>1)&nbsp; Any popup involving a non critical event (critical being defined as processor overtemping or virus detected or something of that type) is irritating.</p>
<p>2) It's intrusive.&nbsp; This is MY COMPUTER.&nbsp; I don't like it when outside parties, (even Microsoft) directly tamper with what's on my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This attitude, the idea that Microsoft can pop a message up on my computer at any time and that they'll choose to do so for the purpose of marketing their software is very very disturbing.&nbsp; It leaves a foul taste in my mouth and makes me look seriously at
 alternative operating systems.&nbsp; It is this attitude that's caused me to decide NOT to install Windows 10, even though it's a better system in so many respects.</p>

            <p>I'm a user like your self.&nbsp; I dealt with this problem by making sure Windows Update is set</p>
<p>to "check for updates but let me choose...." </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, reboot the PC, Control Panel/Programs and Features/"view installed updates" (on the left)</p>
<p>Look for "update for Microsoft Windows (kb3035583).</p>
<p>Click and uninstall.&nbsp; Reboot if required.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the information, I'll implement the change you suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I should never ever be in a situation to disable an update merely because it's "annoying".&nbsp;&nbsp; For me, this issue will not be resolved until Microsoft understands the hostility they breed with this kind of behavior.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>I have advised my clients to do what I have dreaded doing for years -- turn off Automatic Windows Update.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is compounded by an incessant drive by Microsoft to install Windows 10 on your computer with out your permission.&nbsp; They keep re-installing KB3035583 (that is the enabler) on your
 computer, even if you uninstall it.&nbsp; The result is the huge download and then constant nags without an apparent way to say no.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So I have advised my clients to shut down WU.&nbsp; Once a month on the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to turn on WU and then to reject specific updates like KB3035583.&nbsp; After
 updating, they will turn automatic updates off again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 file.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer by now anyway.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using windows 7, and have
<strong><span>not</span></strong> installed win10 and do not want it, here is a procedure that I have used many times and it works.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you for replying to my issue.&nbsp; However, "Disabling updates" is not an answer to the problem.&nbsp; So this issue is NOT resolved and won't be until Microsoft decides to change it's policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this issue is Microsoft's Update that's causing a pop up to open on my desktop that tries to sell me on Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; This popup convinces me that Windows 10 is a bad idea, so I'm not going to install it and I'm more likely to replace Windows 7 with
 a different operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a sad thing for me, I've been using Windows for several decades and there really isn't a better operating system to replace it with.&nbsp; However, if Microsoft persists in intruding into my personal space, then I'll have no other choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm left with no other recourse but to curse those college educated elitist, whom themselves would never ever tolerate this abuse, but are happy to inflict it on others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, I appreciate everyone who replied to my question.&nbsp; Thank You again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; I'm nervous in general about disabling updates, I'm not an expert so I feel like I'm running the risk of breaking something.</p>
<p>2) If Microsoft feels strongly enough about this, they can and will remove our ability to disable updates all together.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We (the community) need to complain when Microsoft does something we don't like.&nbsp; They have no other way of knowing.&nbsp; If enough people care, they will change their behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I'm just a lone voice and nobody else gives a damm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, so be it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually

            <p>You are of course correct.&nbsp; Please do make your voice heard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will not take any risk by setting Windows Updates to NEVER.&nbsp; You will simply be taking the responsibility on yourself rather than allowing Microsoft to control it.&nbsp; You certainly should do security updates and do them on time.&nbsp; It will keep your system
 safe.&nbsp; However, Microsoft is abusing this trust </p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that of the world's 1.5 Billion Windows computers, about half of them are installed in businesses, governments, etc.&nbsp; The IT guys in those organizations would not even consider Windows 10.&nbsp; They have heavily invested in Windows 7 and will ride
 it all the way to the end, which is now set to be January 2020.&nbsp; I would not be the slightest surprised if that gets extended (ALA XP).&nbsp; So, there are an awful lot of computers using Win7 and will continue for along time.&nbsp; Almost none of those installs allow
 automatic updating.&nbsp; It is totally under control of IT people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key problem now, is staying in touch with the community to know which updates to reject.</p>

<h2>            What is the point of having a Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Now that Windows 10 is coming out, the message I get from all that is: sell your Xbox One to buy a good gaming PC.<br />
This way, I will have access to all the Xbox games + other PC games. This also means no more exclusive for Xbox, another reason to sell that console.</p>

<p>Maybe you should do a little bit more research. You are going to be in for a huge surprise.</p>
<p>Also selling your xbox to buy a good gaming PC is an option, but for a good amount of people its not. Some people just don't want to be bothered with PC gaming.</p>

<p>But it is exactly the same, except that the PC can be upgraded again and again + it has a lot more space on its hard drive. If you tell me that you still need to buy an Xbox One to play Xbox One game on the PC, then I don't understand what is the point of
 making this feature. Which freaking PC gamer will buy an Xbox One to cross platform? (Hey friend, I want to play with you to Fable Legend! I'll buy the game + an Xbox One, it will only cost 500$ so we can play together :D). Doesn't make sense at all. What
 about paying for Xbox Live? I own an Xbox One. I have to pay Xbox Live to play online. What about PC gamer? You cannot ask them to pay for Xbox Live, they will just laugh and enjoy their Steam account. So if you can't ask a PC gamer to pay for Xbox Live service
 but allow them to play online on Xbox Live, then it is unfair for Xbox One user and is another reason why we should sell our Xbox One to buy a PC capable of next-gen gaming. 2 in 1 instead of having to pay 2 different things. Think about it guys... There is
 something wrong lol... I heard a rumour last year which was about Microsoft, they wanted to stop (or sell, I don't know) the Xbox department. I though it was stupid. Now I am thinking they are actually slowly absorbing Xbox into Windows so there won't be anymore
 Xbox console in a few years. What do you guys think about all this? It really is like if your PC with Windows 10 is actually an Xbox One with more feature. You can enjoy it sitting in the couch of your living room with Xbox One controller... it is the same
 thing with more feature. The price? Well if you sell your Xbox One, you get a kind of ''discount''. I never really gamed on PC except when I first got one many years ago. I'll wait to see and learn more about all this but right now it is ringing a bell in
 my head... Why would I choose less if I can get more?</p>

<p>I'm a PC gamer and I own a One and PS4, I even pay for Gold and Plus. I do it to play the exclusives and I always will as long as we have exclusives. I complain a lot and even I won't complain about that.</p>
<p>If you can only afford or want one device you need to figure out where your games are and buy that device.

<p>OP you are about as misinformed as anyone I have ever seen...</p>
<p>not ALL games will be cross platform...</p>
<p>Stream your game fron the XB1 to any W10 device = your XB1 is playing the game and the visuals are pushed to another display.. &nbsp; meaning in laymans terms.. you need an XB1 and the game and watch the screen on your monitor...</p>
<p>XBL is for consoles and the live service.... PC gaming uses the internet but to use the XBL app to merge games and chat and all the bells and whistles will have it's own subscription... &nbsp;you do not need it to play the games.. just to merge with the XBL service...</p>
<p>It might be stated that games might be cross purchase... meaning play on either system, pay once...</p>
<p>I honestly cannot fathom how some get these ideas in their heads about this stuff and how they see things when they are described</p>

<p>PC gaming uses the internet but to use the XBL app to merge games and chat and all the bells and whistles
<p>Can you clarify that? Are you saying there is a subscription to use the Xbox app on the PC? I assumed as long as you were logged into Windows on your PC with the same account as your Xbox there wouldn't be any charges.</p>

<p>from other forums... and the consesus from other players in those forums, they are are stating...</p>
<p>We as XB users pay for XBL, on top of our ISP. PC users pay just their ISP but to gain full access to use the XB app from a "PC ONLY" user... they will most likely get a paid subscription service. Will it be $59.99 like XBL for the year.. will they get discounts
 and call it other than XBL? Will both services get a huge price drop down to $39.99 year?? &nbsp;who knows.. butdo expect some type of fee for PC users to gain access to all the XB app on a pc has to offer</p>

<p>
We'd like to clarify, have you made some changes on your computer's configuration prior to the issue?<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you already uninstalled and reinstalled the application, let us try to create a new user profile on your PC to further isolate if there are corrupted files in the current user profile that causes the problem. For instructions, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type this <strong>net user test /add</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the new user profile is already created, check if you are now able to open Mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted. </p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<div>I just purchased an SSD (128GB) and want to install it in my Windows 7 Home 64-bit machine as the source for Windows 7 and my programs. &nbsp;Windows 7 is currently on my 1.5TB C: drive. &nbsp;I want to transfer Windows 7, the program and user files to the SSD from
 the hard drive. &nbsp;I temporarily moved all data files from my hard drive to an external drive. &nbsp;After the transfer when I highlight all the the remaining folders on the C drive, including windows 7 folder and program, and user folders, and display the properties
 of these folder, it amounts to approximately 70 GB. &nbsp;However, when I display the properties for my C drive, it reports 270 GB of used space. &nbsp;I don't know where the other 200GB are coming from and I cannot image the hard drive at this level. &nbsp;Please suggest
 how I can ascertain what is on my C drive and how I can reduce it to less than 128 GB. &nbsp;Thank you for your assistance.</div>

<p>In addition to JW's post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Free Up Space - Increase Hard Drive Space </strong><br />
<br />
1. The following procedure cleans up files associated with your user account. You can also use Disk Cleanup to clean up all the files on your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click the Start button, in the search box, type Disk Cleanup, then click Disk Cleanup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the Drives list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. On the Disk Cleanup tab, select the file types you want to delete.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: To Remove all System Restore Points Except the Most Recent - Click "Clean up System Files" and you will get another tab called More Options. Now click More Options, then click "Clean up" under "System Restore and Shadow Copies" then confirm the
 deletion. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click OK on the bottom of the Disk Cleanup window and in the message that appears, click Delete files.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Reduce the amount of space allocated for System Restore. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Start--&gt;Control Panel--&gt;System and Security--&gt;System <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Next click on the 'System protection' link located in the upper left.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In the 'System Properties' window click on the 'System Protection' tab.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Locate the 'Protection Settings' box and select/click on the drive letter (usually C:)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Now click on the 'Configure' button to change the 'Disk Space Usage' Restore Settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Move the slider to reduce the amount of disk space System Protection can use (min. 2GB).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Click the 'Apply' and then the 'OK' button after you have adjusted the disk space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a huge amount of RAM the pagefile and hibernation file might be occupying a large amount disk space. 6GB of RAM can cause 12GB of space to be taken up using Windows default settings. However most imaging programs don't include these files.<br />
<br />
3. Turn of the Hibernation setting&nbsp; - note: you will not be able to hibernate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Click Start <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Go to All Programs --&gt; Accessories <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Right click CMD.exe and select Run as administrator <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D. In the commant prompt type: powercfg -H off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E. Press Enter, then exit CMD. You may need to restart<br />
<br />
4. Reduce Pagefile Size <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Open control panel and choose system and security. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Click on system <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Click on Advanced&nbsp; system settings. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Click on advanced tab. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E. In the performance section click on settings. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F. Click on Advanced and choose Change in the Virtual Memory section.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; G. Uncheck Automatically Manage Pagefile size <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; H. Select Custom and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I. Enter a new amount. Enter the same number in both boxes. Minimum: 1GB (or 1024MB).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I. click Set, then OK. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; J. Restart your computer</p>

<p><strong>Shrink Windows 7 Partition</strong> <br />
Be careful, re-sizing partitions is risky, always a small chance something could go wrong - backup anything important.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
1. Click Start, right click on Computer <br />
2. Click Manage <br />
3. Click Disk Management (on the left) <br />
4. Here you can shrink the C: partition - right click it and select "Shrink Volume"<br />
5. Chose a new size for the C: partition that is less then 120GB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Image Windows 7 And Move To New Hard Drive </strong>(one of several ways)<br />
<br />
Windows 7 has a built in imaging program, but I would not recommend it when moving to a different hard drive. Connect the new hard drive to the computer (as a slave if IDE, or connect it externally if you can through USB), then partition the new hard drive
 so it has two partitions (or use a second partition on the old hard drive if the new drive is not very big) - the last partition being a little bigger then the amount of data on your current hard drive. If you have a large amount of data (music/video etc)
 moving it to an external storage separately will greatly reduce the image size. Also make sure that the partition you are moving Windows 7 to is the same size or bigger then the current partition it's on.<br />
<br />
Now make an image of your current hard drive with either of the programs below and save it to the last partition on your new drive. If you have the 100MB recovery partition make sure to include that. After the image is created restore the image to the new hard
 drive - you should restore Windows to the first partition (or second if you have the 100MB recovery partition). But if you have a unique setup then set it up the same as your current drive. You may have to delete/change the partitions you made to the new hard
 drive when restoring the Windows image. Please be aware that in the computer world imaging is not always going to work, but your original data should not be harmed. You may need to reactivate after moving to the new hard drive.<br />
<br />
If you are unable to have both hard drives connected at the same time you can chose to save the image to DVDs. Then replace the old drive and use the DVDs to restore Windows to the new hard drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Both programs are completely free (and there are others available). Both enable you to make a boot disk to start the recovery, and both programs allow you to divide the backup to multiple DVDs:<br />

<br />
<br />
Now only have the new drive in the computer and turn it on and see if Windows boots, if it doesn't:</p>
<p>Try Repairing The Windows 7 Installation <br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart your computer <br />
2. Boot from the DVD. <br />
3. Choose your language and click Next. <br />
4. Click Repair Your Computer and then select the operating system you want to repair.<br />
5. Click on the Startup Repair link from list of recovery tools in System Recovery Options.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
If that doesn't fix it: <br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart your computer <br />
2. Boot from the DVD. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.<br />
3. Choose your language and click Next. <br />
4. Click Repair Your Computer and then select the operating system you want to repair.<br />
5. Select Command Prompt and type the following commands (pressing Enter after each one):&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

bootrec /fixBoot <br />

<h2>            USB Not being registered as a Disk Drive.</h2>
                    Hello, I've been trying to get this to work for a while now, No luck. I recently tried to plug in my USB Device and it was not registering as a Disk Drive. Instead it registered as a Universal Serial Bus Device (Not a Universal Serial Bus Controller like
 I've seen in other solutions.) If anyone knows how to get it to reregister under a Disk Drive (USB) please tell me. I have tried Uninstalling and Reinstalling the device, Updating the drivers, and Changing the default driver, No luck. Thank you.

            Hi TMM.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.   
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Disk management, scroll down to look for the flash stick on drive map, right click on it to Assign a Drive Letter so it shows up in Explorer.  
<br />
<br />If it doesn't show up then monitor Disk Mgmt and Device Manager while you try all other USB ports.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello Greg,<br />
<br />
I have tried all of the suggestions, And only moved up by a tiny step. I do not see it on the Disk Management but instead of it going under Universal Serial Bus Devices it is now under Universal Serial Bus Controllers. Though it is being registered as a 'SAMSUNG
 Mobile USB Composite Device'<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Also, It still doesn't show on Disk Management as a 'SAMSUNG Mobile USB Composite Device'.

            For USB drive not detected issue, first try steps here:  <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-recognized-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-r...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay, see if the Device is listed.  From it's dropdown menu change it to what you want it to do when plugged in.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br /> Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>.  If the SFC cannot repair broken files in 3 attempts, check the image file integrity using DISM from Step 10 of this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
I doubt that this could be a Microsoft Security Essentials issue. What is your current AV program?<br />
<br />
Vuze is one of those Peer to Peer clients or in short P2P it was also called as&nbsp;Azureus;&nbsp;an open source&nbsp;bit-torrent&nbsp;application. It also has the ability to stream and play&nbsp;media files&nbsp;from the network, locally or from the&nbsp;internet. It is likely possible that
 it could either be a bug in the program against your AV while its downloading then&nbsp;a sudden ending of the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kindly refer to their support forums for more ideas on your issue: <a href="http://forum.vuze.com/index.jspa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forum.vuze.com/index.jspa</a><br />

All the best~!

<p>Unless you are using completely outdated hardware that doesn't have a GPU, there is really no reason to install WMM 2.6. If you are just looking for the functionality of the "classic" Windows Movie Maker, I suggest you install WMM 6.0. It has the same look
 as WMM 2.6, but has both 32-bit and 64-bit versions as well as using the GPU to improve the speed of rendering. WMM 2.6 was designed back in the Windows Vista era for people that didn't have a good GPU. But most people have a capable GPU even if it is onboard
 Intel graphics that WMM can use.</p>

<pre>Hello,<br /> I am not a frequent poster on these forums, so I do apologize for my lack of familiarization with these forums and how they work.<br /><br /> I am posting because I am having some NAT/connectivity issues. I seem to be the only one as far as I can tell (at least out of all of the people in my clan, save my father who, obviously, is on the same network as me.) I will go ahead and give a detailed description/brief story of when the problem started and what's going on atm.<br /><br /> The first issue would be we have 2 laptops, 1 desktop PC, 1 Playstastion, and 1 xbox connected to the internet (With another desktop that is connected every now and then). We have high speed turbo internet and usually can run all of these things with little to no issue. (at least until we traded in our PS for an XBOX). My father decided he wanted to play online with me so decided to trade in his brand new PS for an older xbox 360. The first couple of days we could connect to the same party, join games, host 6 playe

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Scan for Malware with Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>If you have problems installing RKill and Malwarebytes, or updating&nbsp;and scanning with Malwarebytes in Normal Mode, use both of them&nbsp;in Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#vista</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Windows Vista</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently tap the
<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with the <strong>Windows Vista Advanced Boot Options</strong>.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>&nbsp;option using the arrow keys.
</li><li>Then press the <strong>enter</strong> key on your keyboard to boot into Vista Safe Mode.
</li><li>When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Vista will enter Safe mode.
</li><li>Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once in Safe Mode with Networking, download and run RKill.</p>
<p>RKill does NOT remove Malware; it stops the Malware Process giving you a chance to remove it with your Security Programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, download, install,&nbsp;update and scan your System with the free version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes AntiMalware in Safe Mode with Networking:</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently there are a number of issues that MS is working hard to resolve, unfortunately the trickle down is effecting quite a few features for both XBO and XB360 functionality.&nbsp; Unfortunately we all have to be patient as they work, but rest assured they
 will have things back up and going asap!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Rerun chkdsk and let it complete this time. Interrupting the routine may have lead to a file system failure. Just because it pauses for a length of time does not mean it's not still running. You may have damaged the installation to a point that will require
 reinstalling Windows, be prepared to take this step (consult your system documentation on how to use the manufacturer's recovery software).</p>

<p>If you can't access the system to run chkdsk, then boot to a disk to access the Command Prompt in the repair/recovery options and do it from there.</p>
<p><span><span>If you don't have a disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk
 using </span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).&nbsp; <span>
To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and
 exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32.<span>While in Command Prompt,
 type chkdsk /f /r and enter <strong>and let it run</strong>.&nbsp; It may take quite a while and seem to stall, but give it some time (under the circumstances, let it run for a full 24-hour day before deciding it is frozen).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work,<span>do
 a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If
 that doesn't work, go back to command prompt.&nbsp; <span>
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If
 that doesn't work, t<span>ry a System Restore to a point in time<strong><span>BEFORE</span></strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's
 the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>At
 that point, we pretty much have exhausted what can be done with the Recovery disk you made.&nbsp; Please reply with results at that stage and we'll see what we can do next, but Rick is right and we may need to re-intall Vista to resolve the problem - but we'll
 cross that bridege when we come to it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I
 hope this helps.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Good
 luck!</span></span></span></span></span></p>

            <p>I'm afraid you can't do it. The daily challenges are refreshed every month and only the current month is available. There are stats for each month keeping track on how you performed and also achievements tied to the <span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1); text-align: left">daily challenges, but the challenges themself are not kept at the end of each month.</span></p>

<p>I know on android devices if you manually change the date on your device, you can access challenges from previous months or future challenges through the rest of the current month (maybe further depending on when you check).</p>

</p><p>If, for example, you want to see all of December 2018's challenges, change the date to December 31 and you'll see everything from the first through thirty-first.&nbsp; I don't know how far back it goes, but pretty far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this works under Windows or other versions of MS Solitaire.</p>
