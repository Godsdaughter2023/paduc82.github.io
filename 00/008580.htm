<h2>            Windows Startup Without logging in</h2>
                    <p>Comment:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 on my laptop. When I took my laptop to church I knew I didn't have the wireless internet connection created. I tried booting up and when I tried to logon with my password without the wifi internet setup it started doing funny stuff. The
 screen started blinking and wouldn't stop. It took a exceedingly long time to reboot up. I finally got to the main screen after a few reboots and a lot of patience. Eventually I figured out you could set up your connection before the logon. After that everything
 worked okay. I don't like what happens when you boot up your computer and you do not have a wifi connection. The whole idea of having to have a account with Microsoft and logging in that account at bootup is a little disturbing. It does have a feeling of a
 little sneakiness to it. The whole idea of privacy does seem to pop up. I voluntarily offer you a view into my computing habits. Still, I do not like the idea of you being able to see what programs I run through your login if you wanted to even if I decided
 to turn it off. You can assure me all you want to but the reality is you have opened the door and no telling if someone can get through.</p>
<p>This is a new computer and I was still getting the feel of Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Micah</p>
<p />

<h2>            Both my Skype name &#40;account&#41; and my Microsoft account are gone. Need to retrieve my Skype account&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Both my Skype name (account) and my Microsoft account are gone ever since my work moved to using the Office365 suite of products. Even when I go to "recover your account," it doesn't work; it says my account doesn't exist, thus not recoverable (WTH? What
 is it for if not to recover a "closed" account?) I have been user <strong>*******
</strong>on Skype ever since it first started, and dozens of people know me by that name, so I don't want to create a new account, which would presumably force me to make a new username, and not link it to my prior one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: The Office365 suite uses Skype for Business. It doesn't appear to "cross over" with regular Skype users; can't find my friends on it. Is that by design? Do you need a completely different account for that product?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrea Bozoki&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Andrea</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can only be two reasons why you're getting a message that your account does not exist.
</p>
<ol>
<li>First, is because you probably&nbsp;typed your account's Skype&nbsp;name, email or phone number&nbsp;incorrectly . To check your correct sign-in details, please visit this support page:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA109/i-ve-forgotten-my-skype-name-or-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I've forgotten my Skype name or password</a></strong></li><li>Your account has been deleted. The message usually happens when you close your Skype account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>When you sign in to Skype using an email address you haven't used for Skype yet, it will automatically create a
<strong>new</strong> account. So, your contacts won't really show up on that newly created Skype account.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>But I didn't delete my Skype account, only my Microsoft account. </p>
<p>And I didn't type my username incorrectly; it's truly missing/no longer exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1: Can I recover my Skype account now, with its many associated contacts?</p>
<p>Question 2: If I can't, can I create a new account with the same username (abozoki) so everyone who knows me as that person will be able to find me again?<br />
Question 3: Can I use Skype for Business in lieu of Skype, or do users need to establish a separate account, with no "cross-over" between systems (meaning that I can't contact someone with only a Skype account using SfB)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>abozoki</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Is your Skype account linked to the Microsoft account you closed? If it is, then, your Skype account will also be deleted and cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to create an account with your preferred&nbsp;Skype Name anymore. the new account creation process only requires an email address or a phone number as minimum sign-up requirements.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact a Skype for Business user even if you're using a personal Skype account. The guidelines on how you can connect with people who are using Skype for Business are listed on this support page:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12315/can-i-contact-skype-for-business-users-from-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Can I contact Skype for Business users from Skype?</a></strong></p>

    <title>Shockwave Flash Object in Explorer 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clifforderven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shockwave Flash Object in Explorer 11</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have been &nbsp;running Win 10 Pro since upgrading from Win 8.1 for some months now and all seems to work well except for&nbsp;sound issues with some but not all video playbacks. For example most You Tube Videos&nbsp; which are accessed by going directly to You Tube
 have no sound issues but some accessed through Explorer 11 do not. When I check for Add-ons it appears to be there but if I look under Search for this Add- on I get no result. I notice that the third party App component "Shockwave Flash Object" comes imbedded
 with Explorer 11 which came&nbsp; with the upgrade.&nbsp; I suspect this has something to do with the issue.&nbsp;Is it possible and advisable to remove this app and download Adobe Flash Player separately to my desktop PC (Dell XPS 8500).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cliff Erven</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been through all of the above and none of the suggestions appears to work. I have similar issues with other browsers such as Edge and Firefox.
</p>
<p>The end result of running Internet Explorer Performance is that it did not find any issues!</p>
<p>After running the Manage Add-Ons for Explorer 11 and&nbsp;then disabling and again after enabling Shockwave Flash Object I still have no sound from certain video replays picked up by browser.
</p>
<p>It appears that many of the troubleshooting references appear to be related to earlier versions of Windows not Windows 10 Pro which automatically &nbsp;downloaded when I proceeded with the update from Win 8.1 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Word and Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Having serious difficulties in trying to fix a macro problem after loading Microsoft Office 16 on her Dell XPS with Windows 10.&nbsp; The installation process notified that macros were not enabled on her and a particular (not specified) macro in a template (also
 not specified) could not load.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, gets an error message everytime&nbsp;when opening Word stating that "the template is not loaded and the macro was not available . . .&nbsp; (but it does not list any specifics, including any error message coding).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What needs to be done to correct this situation?&nbsp;&nbsp;We have proceeded through the listed Add-in process which does not work and perhaps because there is no clue as to what macro or template is not functioning.</p>

            <p>If the problem is indeed related to a macro (discounting the possibility that the message isn't correctly describing whatever is really wrong), there are two things to do for troubleshooting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before starting Word, use File Explorer to go to the folders&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\STARTUP and %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP, and move any files from those folders to some other folder.</li><li>Also go to the folder %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates and rename the file Normal.dotm to something else such as OldNormal.dotm.</li></ul>
<p>Then start Word. If the message doesn't appear, one of the files you moved or renamed is the culprit. You can try putting them back, one at a time, and restarting Word after each one to try to pinpoint the problem.</p>

<h2>            Can you upgrade from Home Business to Professional</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Um... this is probably going to sound like a really stupid question to ask. Can you upgrade from Office 2013 Home Business to Professional? Personally I think the answer is basically,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can you upgrade from Home Business to Professional</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our survey says X</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there isn't an upgrade process then it doesn't really matter, At the time&nbsp; didn't actually need the other two applications. But now I do and it is only £60.00 more than buying Office 2013 Professional which is £330.00 at PC World. I could shop around
 to see if I can get a lower price but I&nbsp;think&nbsp;the standard&nbsp;price is £94.00 each which isn't that bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mel</p>

This appears to be an error related to a power management feature on the western digital drives known as PM2. PM2 once enabled prevents the hard drive from being "turned on" when the computer is activated until a signal is sent from the motherboard and activates
 the drive. Thus older computers lacking PM2 with hard drives that have PM2 have no reasonable way of "waking up" their hard drive. Creating a bootable DOS thumb drive and installing a hard drive utility capable of activating the hard drive is the only solution
 as of right now.</p>

            <p>Look at this thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a known problem. &nbsp;You need to boot up from DOS bootable CD or USB stick with hdat2 and run hdat2 /w. &nbsp; &nbsp; The win 10 update turns on the PUIS on your hard drive and if your motherboard bios doesn't support this then the drive doesn't spin up and it
 looks like the drive went bad</p>

            <p>Hola a todos </p>
<p><br />
Desactivar PUIS (Power-Up In Standby) en discos duros (el bios no los reconoce)</p>
<p>Está pasando mucho que Windows 10 beta Build 9879 escribe dentro del disco duro
<br />
algo sobre opciónes de energia y que la mayoría de los ordenadores, la&nbsp; BIOS&nbsp; no soporta, y el
<br />
disco duro no rueda, (la Bios no reconoce el disco) en espera de una orden para que gire,<br />
solo que hay que&nbsp; reiniciarlo al estado de fabrica, tarea algo compleja.</p>
<p>COMO SE SOLUCIONA</p>
<p>Debes descargarte el programita RUFUS y con el haces un pendrive de arranque MS-DOS<br />
También descarga el programa hdat2_50 ISO&nbsp; descomprimes la iso en cualquier carpeta
<br />
y copias en el pendrive de arranque la carpeta HDAT2 (en la carpeta descomprimida del iso)</p>
<p>Entra en tu pendrive y abre el archivo autoexec.bat&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&gt;abrir con &gt;bloc de notas &gt;editar <br />
y al final escribes :</p>
<p>CD hdat2<br />
hdat2.exe /W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Al poner el pendrive se debe poder arrancar desde el pendrive&nbsp; <br />
si no se puedes arrancar, se debe entrar en BIOS y poner en la <br />
pestaña del BOOT que inicie en primer lugar con el USB</p>
<p>Si se inicia el pendrive de arranque con el programa "HDAT2" aparece una pantalla negra con un menú de opciones</p>
<p>1ª pantalla seleccionar el "disco duro"&nbsp; &gt;intro<br />
2ª pantalla seleccionar "Device configuration overlay (DECO) menu"&nbsp; &gt;intro<br />
3ª pantalla seleccionar "Modify"&nbsp; &gt; intro<br />
4ª pantalla seleccionar "Power-up in Standby (Puis)" y cambiar a "remove" (flecha derc-izq)<br />
5ª Pulsar la tecla "S" y después la tecla "Y"<br />
.<br />
En la pantalla 3ª tammbién se puede optar por "RESTORE" en vez de "modify" y pondrá el disco duro por defecto de fabrica<br />
Pulsar la tecla "S" y después la tecla "Y"</p>
<p><br />
Saludos<br />

<h2>            Groove Music not properly syncing playlists from desktop to cloud, even though all songs are in One Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all of my songs are in One Drive. They are visible in the One Drive web app,&nbsp;I can play them over wifi on&nbsp;my Surface and on&nbsp;my Windows Phone, so the audio files are there in One Drive and they do work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove music app on the desktop recognizes my playlists created in Media Player, but when I try to sync them to the cloud (by adding them to a new playlist in Groove app), only SOME of the songs in the playlist sync. For example, I have a playlist with 150
 songs, but the cloud version&nbsp;contains only 72 songs. When I repeat the process, the same thing happens, and it only recognizes the same 72 songs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to play the songs that don't transfer to the&nbsp;cloud playlist on the web player,&nbsp;it tells me that the songs are no longer available.&nbsp; This makes no sense because they are not part of the Groove catalogue and never were - they are all my songs in
 One Drive and they are all there in One Drive.&nbsp; I can still play them on the other devices, but Groove web app not recognizing them and apparently not including them when I try to sync playlists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all worked perfectly when I last&nbsp;synced my playlists to the cloud, so something has gone haywire recently.
</p>
<p>

            After investigating a bit, I think this is because my Groove music library on my desktop appears to have gone&nbsp;crazy. I will try to reset it and see if I have more luck. I think this should work, so will close this query.

<h2>            How to keep the outline numbering format in the headings, when I past text from another document</h2>
                    
<p>I am creating a documnet where I have defined the heading 1-3 with outline numbering. I have in the opion box choose "Use destination style" when pasting between documents.</p>
<p>But when I paste text from a document that have indented (-1.23) the heading numbers the indent copies to my document( the formating of the text changes) I have created the outline numbering for the headings like this.<br />
1.<br />
1.1<br />
1.1.1</p>
<p>How do I format the template to use the destination formating&nbsp;of the&nbsp;outline numering for the headings?</p>

<p>After pasting, sometime you simply have to reapply the style to "nudge" Word to apply the destination formatting properly.</p>
<p>I've seen similar problem. Pasted text picks up part of the heading formatting, but not all, especially adding or losing heading numbers.</p>
<p>The simplest way to re-apply formatting is Find &amp; Replace. ie Find the "heading 1" with no text entered in the search field, and Replace with "heading 1", again with nothing in replace field. Seems kinda dumb, searching and replacing same thing, but it works
 because it reapplies all of the correct formatting.</p>

<h3> tomkludy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off presenter view on PowerPoint 2016 for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How can I turn off presenter view on PowerPoint 2016 for Mac? &nbsp;I use my MacBook Pro (13.3" Retina 2014) to display at conferences and have real problems with the way that PowerPoint presenter mode works. &nbsp;It turns off the OS display mirroring and prevents
 me from running other applications on the 2nd display, which is usually the one connected to a projector. &nbsp;If I click "Use Slide Show" then it functions a little better, but (a) this button sometimes does not work, displaying a black screen instead; (b) takes
 a good 10 seconds to switch even when it does work; and (c) renders at a terrible resolution on the projector, much worse than what the projector is capable of, or what is used with normal display mirroring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint 2011, with all of its other faults, was far better in this respect; I could turn off presentation mode and use mirroring which worked perfectly. &nbsp;Can I please have that behavior back?</p>

            <p>Doing presentations with projector while also being on
 webex caused people on the webex to see presenter view. After some searching, I finally found out how to disable Presenter View in Office 2016 (used to be easier in previous version!). There might be other ways to get there, but if you are in Presenter View,
 click on 'tips', then select 'Preferences' and uncheck 'Always start Presenter View with 2 displays'. End the show and start again et voila, no Presenter View :-)<br />

<h2>            Outlook.com automatic forward mail to another account issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently switched over from Yahoo! since they have changed the way they operate their auto forward functions. I have two main accounts set up this one which I do most of my mail from and a personal address that only family and friends have. This account
 is set up to auto forward to my personal address. At first I was not getting registration emails so I turned off auto forward until everything was switched. After everything was setup and working I turned auto forward back on but left the original copies in
 my inbox, low and behold when I went in to clear out the duplicates I am finding several emails they come in but are never forwarded to my personal account. I have looked in the junk box, checked rules, nothing... plain not there. I looked and Microsoft does
 not have a contact us for their mail so I started searching and found this community. I hope someone can help. I like the mail service but this is super frustrating.</p>

            <p>Hi Jesinta,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the mail client for my phone but access it through my web browser as well. Both of my email accounts are Outlook.com accounts. I have checked all folders, removed any rules that I did put in place, unregistered and reregistered my email address
 on the forwarding account. The same issues still occur. I have not gone through my emails this morning to see which have not arrived but at quick glance it looks like the same ones are still the culprits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I have been having the same problem.I did everything you did. I just was able to get on with a single use code instead of a password, I received the code from Microsoft. Thanks for posting, if not for your post I wouldn't have been able to find the code.
 Hope you can access also.

            <p>So I understand correctly, you have two outlook.com email accounts - a main one and a personal one.</p>
<p>Email sent to the main account is forwarded&nbsp; to the personal account, but some of the forwarded emails do not show up in the personal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this right, or is there a third non-outlook.com account involved? I have had a problem with forwarding caused by SPF rules and it was very hard to track down, but that may not apply here.</p>

            You are correct, I used to use Yahoo! but this is not in the equation anymore. Only two accounts are Outlook ones, which is why I feel this is very strange they are not linking up better. I leave them on the main account server to verify this and they
 are definitely not being received by my personal account.

            <p>A couple of approaches that you may want to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off forwarding from main to personal. Instead, "pull" email from main account into the personal account. I found this was more reliable but the second email account was not updated as frequently (i.e. every 30 minutes)</li><li>Add the personal email address as an alias in your main account (or vice versa). You have access to both emails in the one account but can still keep them separate (eg. different folders)</li></ul>
<p>I never knew why forwarding had problems with some emails but it may be to do with SPF rules that are&nbsp; set up for some emails (these rules tell mail servers what IP addresses are allowed to send emails for a given domain). Forwarding emails often break these
 rules.</p>

            for whatever reason I get an error trying to add the email account to my personal account. I read elsewhere that microsoft wont allow this for whatever reason. i also have tried adding my account as an alias and it says that its taken a'ready everytime
 I try. Is there something that needs turned on or off to allow it to be an alias?

            <p>I assume that you can't add the account as an alias because you are still using it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you created an alternate alias to your personal account that should then allow you to drop the existing email address from that account. This in turn would free it up to be used as an alias on the main account. However, I have not done this and am not
 sure if there are timing restrictions on re-using an email address once it is dropped from the first. So best to get confirmation from someone before trying that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, you can confirm if this approach works for you my adding a new email address to your main account, pretend that it is your personal email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, my knowledge at this point is more about what should word rather than first hand experience.</p>

<h2>            Bing&#47;Minecraft Integration</h2>
                    <p class="contentCodeblock" style="text-align: center"><em>NOTE: Minecraft is an example as I feel it is a simple, yet useful representation of search features. There are other instances that need similar improvements and functions.</em></p>
<p>Search results for items, blocks, and entities from Minecraft using Bing should have info on it. Considering Microsoft owns Mojang anyway, this shouldn't really be too hard. Google even has this feature and they aren't even affiliated with Mojang AB. Looking
 up "Minecraft Lever" in Google shows this to the right side.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10f853e7-e6fe-43f1-afb0-91ac0783b1e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10f853e7-e6fe-43f1-afb0-91ac0783b1e1" /></a></p>
<p>Looking up "Minecraft Lever" (The same thing) in Bing shows this to the right side.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c491ca4-cce0-4344-95de-f3e30f0c160a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c491ca4-cce0-4344-95de-f3e30f0c160a" /></a></p>
<p>Something is very wrong with Bing if I type the keyword "Minecraft" and still get results on unrelated things such as ACTUAL levers. I believe it would be beneficial to the search engine if this feature were to be worked on. Not just for Minecraft, no. This
 needs to be implemented as smoothly as possible throughout as many result types as possible. Many people look something up and they want results right away. Especially for something as simple as "Minecraft Lever", it is a waste to need to open a link to read
 through a page full of text when the information could be available at step one.</p>

<h2>            Can not recover my Skype Account</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to recover my Skype account and close all the current that I am not using. Of course I forgot my pass but when I tried to recover completely made a mess. Tried to speak with two agents, read all the articles and etc, do not want new account I
 would like to recover it since its&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">insufficient</span> information would like to provide it since I really need to keep this account. How is that possible,
 I am highly disappointed because this is the second time where Skype is unable to provide me good support. I am mixing the information with the other accounts and its making a big mess would like to close 2 accounts and recover one of it. Please provide painless
 and fast solution. The funny thing is that on my phone I am still with my Skype and have all but I can not log in or extract my contacts. So please recover my account and speak with me like I am a real person dont put me through virtual things that sometimes
 are not working.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>G</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/32e8057d-0f63-4a25-a578-67989ee7339d" title="IDgergana">
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the negative experience in recovering your account. We are strongly implementing the security of recovering your account through the questionnaire that is presented to your in the account recovery form to ensure that no one else is trying
 to gain access to your account. Our team had&nbsp;carefully&nbsp;checked and verified the form you have submitted and returned the results. I have two things in mind that can help you on moving forward through this.
<br />
<br />
First is the one that you mentioned that you are still logged on to your Skype app, which should be good as you should be able to manage your account from there. Try on entering the skype app's settings and try on editing your profile within it. It should be
 possible for you to change the primary email or add a mobile number that could help you reset the password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other would be since you are currently logged on to the mobile app, extracting the contacts should still be possible if you go to the skype.com website and view your profile. At the lower part of the profile page, there should be an option for you to
 export your contacts and save it as a .csv which&nbsp;will be&nbsp;very helpful if the only resolution given to you by the team is to create a new account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should help you add your old contacts to the new one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In any cases that you want to push through on recovering the said account, here are some tips that I can provide you to pass the recovery process:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Kindly just fill up the fields that you are 100% sure, if you are not sure of a certain field, please leave it blank instead</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Perform this from a computer that you have used before and you had successfully logged into your account to give us a higher chance of passing the validation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You can also try to answer only the account info part. First and last name, birth date, country, city and passwords you have used.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you can access your mails on your smartphone, you may check your sent items there for the “Subjects of your recently sent emails”</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Answer the form using&nbsp; the most updated information</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Ask a friend or relative whom you think you’ve recently emailed.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You don’t need to fill up the Credit card details if you did not associate your card in the first place, but if it did purchase Microsoft products such as Office 365, Xbox subscription, please
 put the LAST 4 digits only and the actual name of the card holder.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further inquiries. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the urgency of getting back to your account but as much as I would love to help you recover it, we in the&nbsp;Community Support do not have that kind of access to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way on how a user can regain access to his account when he no longer have access to his security information is by filling out our
<strong><a href="http://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account Recovery form</a></strong>. There's no other recovery option for this type of case aside from the mentioned form I'm afraid. If you keep on failing the form or you're consistently
 not passing, the best recourse that we can provide is for you to create a new Skype account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Together with the downloaded contacts file, you should be able to set up properly not only the security information with your new Skype account but also getting back into track with your existing contacts to prevent any further loss of your account in the
 future.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Export to PDF&#34; and &#34;Print to PDF&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to convert from Excel to PDF, understand that there are various options, which includes "Export to PDF" and "Print to PDF".</p>
<p>"Export to PDF" retains more information compared to "Print to PDF".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when looking at the the Space Usage in both the PDFs, noticed that the Font Space Usage for the "Print to PDF" is approx. three times more than that of the "Export to PDF". Hence the file size is much bigger than expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on why is this so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Local archiving and 365 retention policies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluewave5772  say:</h3>
<h2>            Local archiving and 365 retention policies</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am not sure what I am about to ask is possible, but it is what my client has asked for.</p>

<p>The client is utilizing Office 365 for email and is wanting to implement a combination of local PST archiving with server-side retention policy.&nbsp; Basically, they want all mail to be available in a local PST (which immediately makes no sense to me and I don't
 think they understand what they are asking for), while setting all mail older than 30 days to be deleted from server and unrecoverable.</p>

<p>Is there any combination of GPO/365 retention policy that can get close to this?&nbsp; I know I can delete email from the server with retention policies (at least in the default mailbox folders),&nbsp; but I'm not sure what to do about archiving the mail locally.&nbsp;
 Especially since I know all users will have a plethora of subfolders in their inboxes.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>hi bwop5772,</p>
<p>based on your description, the user mailbox has enabled archive, the user wants to delete emails which are older than 30 days from archive folder.if anything is minsunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>if “local archive” refers to in-place archive, as you said, you can use retention policy with default retention tag to delete.</p>
<p>if “local archive” refers to the archive feature in the outlook client as the screenshot below, it’s not feasible to automatically delete emails from archive mailbox. given this situation, we recommend you submit feedback via

    <title>Blocked email account, help&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chacho skuds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blocked email account, help&#63;</h2>
                    Long story short, I registered a microsoft office product key under an email which had a fake alt. email (Because the account was used for an xbox live account that was scrapped like two years ago or something..)&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I first used the product key on my laptop, which I don't have with me right now (I've sent it for repairs)...and am currently using my desktop (Which is where the problem started from)<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I guessed the password for the email wrong a bunch of times, because I can't be bothered to keep track of all the passwords that I do keep, and the account was locked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I completed the questionnaire that was required to allow me to recover the accounts password, and the request was denied.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since the request was denied, microsoft's automated service proceeded to block my account from ever being used, and suggested that I make a new request.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not really sure what I should do now, since I said that the account is practically useless to me except for the product key that's registered to it. I know for a fact that I don't have any sufficient proof to show that the account is mine - because I really
 don't remember what I used when I registered the account.</div>

<h2>            Films and TV Episodes are not showing up on other devices</h2>
                    I have purchased all of my films and tv on the xbox one but recently I have tried to access them on my desktop but it fails to see them as purchased. After I checked and I can open it in EI but when it attempts to open them in the Films and TV app it fails.
 I believe that I accidently purchase a season I already owned that I had assumed I didn't own because I could not load it on the desktop. The Season was free at one time when I downloaded it. I do not know if that affects anything. However it seems that that
 season is the only one that will play on the app because it was purchased and downloaded again on the desktop. How would I be able to fix this issue and is it possible to get a refund on the additional purchase?

            Unless you can see it, it is going to be difficult.&nbsp; However, are you going to replace it with the same deviec?<br />
<br />
If yes, then you can attach your device and via MyComputer, explore your device and find PIM.VOL which is located in the ROOT directory.&nbsp; If you get a new deviec that is EXACTLY the same, you can replace the PIM and your contacts will all be there.
