<h2>            Alternative to full Gold Membership&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>will there be an alternative to a full gold membership?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reason is I would like to not hook up my notebook to my beamer in the living room every time I'd like to watch a video on youtube. So I'd really like to use my xbox for it. But since I have a silver account, I cannot.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong. This is not a flame thread. Everything is worth, what its purchaser will pay for, I know. But for me my console is rather a multimedia/ streaming device and an single player gaming thing. I do not care at all for Multiplayer Xbox.
 I play &nbsp;some MMO's on the PC and that's all the online interaction I need.</p>
<p>As it stands now, I have the xbox, that is capable of delivering a basically free service (YouTube) into my living room, but I would be charged 10 Bucks a month if i'd like to use just that. But I have to purchase more than I need. Maybe a Dollar, would
 be the maximum I'd be willing to pay for that feature. Seeing that all the streaming is done not by Microsoft, but by google I'd even do that just with a small heartache.</p>
<p>I have read in the other threads how this is a perk for gold users. But what about the people who do not give a thing about playing multiplayer but want to use the console as what MS tries to position it now? A multimedia Living room device. For me this
 whole thing kind of tastes like I am tried to be conned out of my money, very much like EA does with their seperate online passes....</p>
<p>So unless there is a VERY MUCH reduced charge for these multimedia appliances planned it is time to think about getting rid of the box altogether and buying a pc that will be easily as powerful as the console is compared to devices that you can get for the
 money my box cost me now, and enjoy all the features I need for free.</p>

<p>Well I'm about 100% sure the same troll that turns every thread about Gold memberships into a flame war will find this eventually.</p>

<p>You do have a good point however. I agree there should be a lower costing membership just for using apps and other features. Should be called "Xbox LIVE Bronze"</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>You can find good deals on memberships usually on Amazon.com though if you are still interested.</p>

<p>Great point..other devices would not lock you out with extra charges.Just hook up your notebook.Where you can get all that stuff at no additional charges.Funny how MS wants to make a multi media device then locks all those things behind gold.When no one
 else does that.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for the EA pass thats a little different.You really only need to purchase that if you get a used game.I for one wait for most of my games to drop to 20 or 30 bucks pick it up new and get the pass as well.Now if EA raised the price of new games to 70 with
 the pass then I would see a reason to complain.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I have looked at the link you provided but I still think it is too expensive. In Germany all we get is youtube and I think a Sky (PayTV app, that has to be combined with yet another fee) so my benefit wouldn't justify the cost.</p>
<p>These were my thoughts exactly when I canceled my Gold Membership in the first place about a year ago. I only played Gears of War online and since I am well into my thirties and working full time not even that regularly.</p>
<p>So basically for what I am charged to play every once in a while (or now just watching youtube) is just not worth the little I take out of it :(</p>
<p>This really is a sad thing for me, but maybe I have just grown out of consoles all together....</p>

<p>Dear LordVonDoom,</p>
<p>would you please refrain from derailing this thread as well? I am not on a hate crusade against Microsoft, I rather would like to provide feedback. I asked a question and it has been answered.</p>
<p>With a lower fee for select stuff I could justify the money that goes into development of the dashboard, the apps etc.</p>
<p>So please would you just let it rest for this thread?</p>

<p>An Xbox Due. Looks like he found it like a bee to honey.</p>
<p>OP. I doubt you will see any changes to Xbox Live to allow lesser plans. Xbox Live started with multiplayer gaming and MS just kept adding incentives (these were long before other consoles allowed them for free). So since gaming is still at the core, I doubt
 you will see lesser plans. </p>

<p>Not to be a troll and go off topic but bronze comes before silver and silver membership is free membership so bronze membership would be?</p>
<p>Ontopic tho, it could be a good idea to make a individual membership that you can purchase for use with the apps alone.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I really thought wether I should reply or not.</p>
<p>I never said anything about you being hateful, just about me, not being such :) This is a fine yet distinguishing difference. Secondly my thougts are if something is worth it, I'll buy it. Sure you might get a hotdog down the road for 50c, but it just does
 not taste as good as the one aorund the corner for 2 Bucks.</p>
<p>What I am saying is, that I like the youtube concept on the xbox, love the app (have seen it at a friends) and acknowledge that nothing is free in this world.</p>
<p>The app has to be maintained and published by Microsoft. All I see is, that I do not want to pay so much for just one feature I will not even use everyday.</p>
<p>So if the app and the experience are way better on the xbox I'd gladly pay a fee, if it were a lot smaller than it is now.</p>
<p>That is all there is to it. And the feeling of Microsoft trying to get to my wallet results in this just one price strategy. If they came up with a more customizable plan, I'd probably pay and be a happy camper</p>

<p>[/quote]Bronze membership??Interesting What apps would they allow in that though???Since all the apps are locked behind gold.If they would release some apps I think it would be done by now threw silver..</p>

<strong>BCCode: F4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000F4&nbsp;</strong>
<p>Check and reseat&nbsp;all cards, memory and cables (on both ends when possible) actually remove and<br />
replace - do not just snug. On a laptop about all you can do is reseat the memory and possibly check<br />
the contacts/connection to the hard drive. Memory could be the problem so if you have more than 1<br />
stick swap them&nbsp;in and out to see if the problem follows one stick or try new memory. Antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs have been known to cause or have a role in this issue.<br />
<br />
Most general fix is updating drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers and other control software.<br />
<strong>Also check cabling to hard disk.<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Surface pro 4 USB port</h2>
                    <p>The USB port on my surface pro 4 isn't working. Nothing I plug in registers on the machine. I get no error messages and there is still power going to the port. For example I can plug in a mouse or a USB stick and the lights on those devices come on but they
 are not detected by the machine. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the reply. What are the implications of doing this - will my data be erased? This is my second surface pro 4, the first one refused to charge after a month and now this one has issues. Battery life is also appalling - wish I had stuck with Apple.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This didn't seem to trigger any sort of reboot but it did bring up a settings screen which included options for me to disable various ports. The USB port was showing as enabled but still the device doesn't seem to know when anything is plugged in. Thanks
 for your help so far though, I appreciate you taking the time to reply.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Do you get any errors when you try to play the files from Library?<br />
2. Were you able to rip the CDs successfully?<br />
3. What is the location of the files?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue can occur if the Media Library is corrupt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Rebuild Windows Media Player library and check if it resolves the issue.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps:<br />
a. Close windows media player.&nbsp; <br />
b. Stop the windows media sharing service.&nbsp; <br />
c. Go to Start and type services.msc in the start search field.<br />
d. Right-click on the “Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service” and select Stop.<br />
&nbsp;e. Navigate to C<strong>:\Users\” username”\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Media Player</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
f. Delete the files named <strong>CurrentDatabase_***.wmdb and LocalMLS_*.wmdb.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
g. Start the media sharing service by right-clicking on the service and selecting Start.<br />
h. Start Windows Media Player.<br />
This builds your library again.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Problem with WIFI Connectivity Signal Seen but Cannot Connect</h2>
                    I have a Laptop Dell Studio Model: PP39L Laptop.&nbsp; Win7 OS. I recently accidently
<br />
spilled tap water on the keyboard. The computer operates in all respects, <br />
but since then the computer can see a WIFI signal but cannot connect to <br />
even with the correct profile, password, etc. <br />
<br />
All the drivers have been updated, Device manager says the wireless device <br />
is operating properly.&nbsp; I replaced the wifi card, but the situation is still <br />
the same. I can use a USB wifi device and connect to the wifi network.<br />
Here are the results of the ipconfig report. <br />
<br />
Below this is a Windows Diagnostics Troubling Shooting report the show <br />
Pre-association successful, but Association failed. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Have you tried to connect to a open wireless access point?</div>
<div>this only&nbsp;happening on an&nbsp;specific&nbsp;WiFi&nbsp;network?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest &nbsp;verify the&nbsp;WiFi&nbsp;connectors (&nbsp;antenna&nbsp;cables) are ok ( reseat them just in case)</div>
<div>also give it a try downloading a sniffer so you can see if the WiFi card actually is listening or some how the&nbsp;</div>
<div>mini PCI &nbsp;port ( WiFi slot) is damaged.t again.</div>
<div>there are also some Dell diagnostic tools.</div>
<div>hope it helps.</div>
<div>Also look for Wifi updates on www.support.dell.com (drivers etc and uninstall windows default drivers for that Wifi)</div>
<div><br />
<div>if nothing Helps post i</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

try reseating the wifi cables in the card, and alos try out Ethereal now called Wireshark (<a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wireshark.org/</a>) its a sniffer to see if actually the card is at least listening something or something else got ruined
 with the accident with the water.

I reseated the wifi cables when I installed a new wifi card. <br />
&nbsp;I think the wifi is listening because I can see 5 bars. <br />
I will try the wireshark, I have never used a sniffer before, so I'll be on a learning curve with this tool.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tom<br />
<br />
PS: Wireshark does not see data to capture when the built-jn wifi card is used (It stills see 5 bars from the local network router.)<br />
There is data to capture when the usb wifi device is used as well as when the wired connection is used.<br />

<h2>            My email going into other people&#39;s spam folders&#63;</h2>
                    I have my own domain name &amp; we use Microsoft Exchange on a server to handle my email. It seems that almost everyone that I email now has my email going into their spam folder. Is there a way I can stop this happening when I do not know the recipient or
 am unable to contact otherwise to get them to add me to their whitelist.

            I'm simply referring to not knowing any other contact option for that person apart from an email address. And in the case of somebody emailing my business to ask a question it may be coming from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** which unless their actual name is abc123,
 I do not know the recipient.

            The crashes are looked to be caused by Battle Eye Anti Cheat Program driver that is known to cause BSODs with Windows 10. Uninstalling the program should resolve your issue.

<p>Check Device Manager to see if your USB ports are working properly.</p>
<p>1. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System, and then clicking Device Manager (left pane).‌&nbsp; Click Continue on the User Account Control prompt.</p>
<p>2. In Device Manager, Double-click Universal Serial Bus controllers and check to see if all your USB ports, hubs, and controllers are functioning correctly. Any devices not functioning will have a yellow exclamation mark in front of them.</p>
<p>3. If Device Manager shows any USB ports or controllers are not functioning, right-click every device under it and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time.</p>
<p>4. Restart the computer, and allow the computer to reinstall the USB controllers.</p>
<p>5. Plug in the removable USB storage device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>You may have to update the drivers if this don't work.<br />

<p>Hi Joamer,</p>
<p>I suggest updating the chipset drivers for your motherboard by visiting the manufacturers website and downloading the latest version.</p>

<p>I have the same issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>All USB Ports were working prior to a Windows Updates: <strong>'Update for Microsoft Windows (KB976902)'</strong> &amp;<strong>'Hotfix for Miscrosoft Windows (KB976422)'</strong>
</li><li>After that update, all USB Ports stopped working. My mouse, Printer, Camera, etc are not recognized.</li><li>I've attempted updating drivers, as well as uninstalling through deveice manager (as Rey G. Santos suggests here), but it returns with errors.</li><li>I've attempted updating the chipset drivers ofr my motherboard, but this did not solve the issue either.</li></ul>
<p>I believe the issue is directly related to the Windows Updates listed above. Please note that update (KB976902) is not possible to uninstall.</p>
<p>Is there anything else that can be done?</p>

            I am also having the same problem on a Home Theater PC (uses Bluetooth and CIR for input, VERY difficult to troubleshoot when USB doesn't work).&nbsp; Machine has been running since before Vista and has been upgraded (not recently) to Windows 7.&nbsp; For the past
 couple of weeks, I&nbsp;intermittently lose&nbsp;three (of four) USB OpenHCD controllers overnight and find the PC rebooted in the morning.&nbsp; The motherboard is an ASUS M4A89GTD Pro/USB3.&nbsp; One USB OHCI controller stays active.&nbsp; The motherboard incorporates an NEC / Renesas
 USB 3.0 chip and I suspect that is the controller that "works".&nbsp; The other ports come from an AMD SB800-series southbridge that would normally use an AMD SB USB filter driver, but I don't think the filter driver is installed.

<p>Assume that you have a Windows 7-based computer that is running on an Intel Atom Z670 processor and on an Intel SM35 Express chipset and you face this issue then run the
 Hotfix.</p>

<p>For the issue with Windows Vista Computer try these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Vista might report that there is “no driver found for you device” and/or will not display the pre-installed Vista OEM drivers. Even by manually selecting the driver,
 you will still get the “no driver found…” error. This is most likely caused by a corrupted INFCACHE.1 file. This file stores the location of drivers and their INF files. This file is hidden, has restricted access, and can be found in “c:\windows\inf”.</p>
<p>Delete the INFCACHE.1 file and it will force Windows to rebuild the INFCACHE.1 file the next time Windows searches for drivers. To delete this file, you have to set the security
 permissions of it to allow Full Control for the User Group Administrators or full control for your user account. Please follow the directions below:</p>
<p>1. Open a Windows Explorer window by right clicking on Start and then clicking on Explore.<br />
2. In the address bar, type C:\windows\inf and press Enter.<br />
3. Find and then right click on the file named INFCACHE.1.<br />
4.Select Properties.<br />
5. Click on the Security tab.<br />
6. Click on Edit to edit the permissions of the file.<br />
7. Click on Add to add User Groups.<br />
8. Type Administrators in the User Groups field and click on OK.<br />
9. Set Administrators to Full Control and click on OK.<br />
10. Move or delete the file INFCACHE.1.<br />
11. Reinstall a device to force Windows to rebuild the INFCACHE.1 file (DO NOT reinstall the same external hard drive that you were having issues detecting before. Please connect another USB device other than the one that Vista had an issue detecting).</p>
<p>This detection issue can happen several times in a row, but repeat the steps 1-11 and try again until this works.</p>

</p><p>Word is just a glorified text editor. You can do some formatting with it, but nowhere near what you can do with a real word processor.</p>

</p><p>If your formatting needs are high, you should get a real word processor: Corel WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, or the free LibreOffice or OpenOffice.</p>

            It worked perfectly well for me until the update a week or so back; now its fixed margins are a pain. Might this be Microsoft's way of forcing cheapskates like me to fork out for Microsoft Office? Microsoft would seem to have be trying to do this in introducing
 the xdoc file format, files I cannot open as I have not bought a subscription to Office.

            Yeah, tried the troubleshooter, it's pretty much useless, doesn't fix anything or will make the suggestion of restarting a router which doesn't fix the issue.

<h2>            Accidental deletion of UEFI partition</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 I decided to do a "clean" install.&nbsp; Unfortunately I accidentally deleted the UEFI partition and now my Gateway DX4870 computer just beeps and goes in an endless loop despite setting the boot sequence to DVD drive (or any other
 choice) as the first option.&nbsp; I also tried to reset the bios by removing the battery and setting the jumper pin to reset, but nothing worked.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be a "secure boot" override.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did make a system image (on an external USB-connected hard drive) of the upgraded Windows 10.&nbsp; What I'm trying to do now is to get that image back onto the internal hard drive.&nbsp; Here's what I have tried (it didn't work): I placed the hard drive with the
 missing UEFI partition in an external enclosure and hooked it up to another working computer via a USB port.&nbsp; I then hooked up the external drive containing the system image to another USB port on the same computer.&nbsp; Finally, I went to Advanced Startup and
 tried to do a System Restore. The idea was to get my working computer to "see" the system image on the external hard drive and "tell" it to transfer it to the damaged hard drive hooked up to the other USB port.&nbsp; However, Advanced Startup wouldn't recognize
 the USB port where the system image was located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to create a partition using Diskpart, but that didn't work either.&nbsp; So, I'm at my wit's end!&nbsp; Am I the only idiot to delete a UEFI partition?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>To get the UEFI back you have to download the UEFI firmware from the manufacturer website and you have to reboot the computer and go to the BIOS settings in the system and perform BIOS flash.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Anup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for this!&nbsp; I have two quick questions about your answer: First, by "manufacturer" do you mean the computer manufacturer (Gateway in my case) or the hard drive manufacturer (Seagate)?&nbsp; Second, I'm also not sure how to download the UEFI
 firmware to the damaged hard drive, since the only way I can read that drive at the moment is by putting it in an external enclosure and hooking it up to another computer via a USB port.&nbsp; Is this what you mean?</p>

</p><p>UEFI bios is part of the motherboard and is contained in the rom chip (bios chip).</p>
<p>The uefi partition on &nbsp;the hard drive is set up by the oem computer maker</p>
<p>when they install the oem version of windows on &nbsp;supported &nbsp;uefi motherboard, the same was</p>
<p>done for legacy bios.</p>
<p>If windows was installed from a dvd or usb drive, then the partitioning scheme is set up by the
</p>
<p>installation media, but often 3rd party software or using diskpart before installing the os.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the pc bios checksum hands over control to the os boot loader.</p>
<p>Was a full os drive done using windows backup,3rd party software, windows system restore,windows rescue disk set ?</p>
<p>First cold boot the pc, check the boot order settings, check what is listed and write it down.</p>
<p>When you reset the bios jumper it may have set the boot order incorrectly boot from an unbootable source.</p>
<p>Is or was there a disk set from the older os on the hard drive or disk set ? factory recover reset?</p>
<p>this should contain the original bootloader and os.</p>
<p>How was the system image done ? with what software &nbsp;? and to what device ? dvd , usb drive, internal drive.</p>
<p>If 3rd party software was used you need to use that software to restore the image.</p>
<p>If it is just win10 &nbsp;bootable media (dvd or usb) you need to boot from that source and try to recover.</p>
<p>There are some variations to the make and model of the pc what version is yours.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention this; some motherboards have a dual bios on board, it is a separate backup chip.</p>
<p>This could recover the main bios if it gets messed up but improper bios flashing, corrupted or virus corruption, but it only restores &nbsp; the bios chip, not the boot drive.</p>
<p>There are utilities that can undelete &nbsp; the boot sector or repair it if the data has not been overwritten.</p>
<p>But the issue you have is the uefi partition is the win boot loader and after bios check there is not response for the os to take over because the files are gone and does not know how to load the os/</p>

            <p>Hi kjl1956:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I'll answer you questions as best I can.</p>
<p>I installed Windows 7 from a DVD and then proceeded to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; This all worked perfectly.&nbsp; I then decided on a "clean" install following the instructions supplied by Windows Secrets (see: http://windowssecrets.com/top-story/how-to-clean-install-a-windows-10-upgrade/).&nbsp;
 This went smoothly until it suggested I delete partitions that were not needed.&nbsp; Well, I deleted the UEFI partition in error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I did this "clean install", I created a system image using "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)" in the Control panel.&nbsp; I didn't make a recovery disk, but I do have another one from a different computer running Windows 10.&nbsp; The image is sitting on an external
 hard drive with a USB connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure about your questions concerning the bios; all I know is that despite many attempts to get the computer to look for an external drive first, it will not.</p>

<p>Is the win7 dvd from gateway, downloaded or retail disk&gt;</p>
<p>Connect the usb drive that the image was backed up to and power it on.</p>
<p>Start the pc and change boot options to load the dvd drive as first boot device and save the settings.</p>
<p>When the pc boots and detects the win7 dvd the message to "boot from dvd" option will display, hit any key one time to load it.</p>
<p>Depending on the disk itself there may be more options from a gateway disk then just a win7 disk.</p>
<p>What you want to do is get to a repair pc options &nbsp;menu.</p>
<p>There should be a list to restore the pc from a backup or image.</p>
<p>You will have to select the image on the usb drive and or folder where it is located, run the restore from there.</p>
<p>This should recopy the uefi partition and all other partitions,' all data from after the image was created will be gone.</p>
<p>Note, it may be possible to fix the uefi partition from the dvd if this is a gateway dvd- factory restore disk.</p>
<p>If this does not work, using a win10 disk to do an implace repair or installing the original &nbsp;os may need to be done.</p>

            <p>It is an OEM disk.&nbsp; However, there is a larger issue: no matter how I change the boot sequence, the machine refuses to boot from anything except the hard drive -- which, of course, it is unable to do because of the missing UEFI partition.&nbsp; When I enter the
 bios the boot options are: (1)EFI device, (2) Hard drive, (3) CD and DVD, (4) Removable Device and (5) LAN.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, whether I put the original Windows 7 DVD into the CD slot or the USB-coupled external hard drive that contains my Windows 10 image into a USB socket, the result is the same: the machine looks for the UEFI partition on the internal hard drive, can't find
 it and goes around in a loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help, by the way.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>

I changed the boot options as you suggested.&nbsp; I got the same result -- it won't recognize anything other than the hard drive.&nbsp; I did find one thing of interest though: if I disconnect the hard drive (after getting into the boot menu) and then exit, the computer
 found the DVD and started to load Win 7 from the OEM disc.&nbsp; I then reconnected the hard drive, hit refresh on the Win 7 screen, but the reconnected hard drive was not found.<br />

            <p>On my uefi bios there is an option to set it to load the bios configuration in legacy &nbsp;or uefi.</p>
<p>This also lets me choose how hardware is loaded and if both uefi, legacy or both load and the order.</p>
<p>What your issue here could be that the win7 disk is loading in the format that looks for the uefi partition on the hard drive because it was a uefi bios on win7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this may not be true because win8 was the first native os that supported uefi bios, even though win7 could be installed on uefi bios under 2tb hard drives the drive format had to be mbr.</p>
<p>Another thing to look into is if your bios has a boot save order option that it is reverting back to even though you set the devices in a different order.</p>
<p>There is a program called disk part, it is a small iso base on linux that can check drive partition and status.,it can be run from the cd &nbsp;with no installation needed.</p>
<p>Being that the hard drive &nbsp;partition was deleted but attempted to be fixed could have caused more
</p>
<p>effects because now the underlying data may have been recovered with 3rd party tools.</p>
<p>What is the size of the hard drive ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not being able to load the win7 disk or win10 disk sounds more like a corrupted bios or bios configuration.</p>
<p>Win10 has a habit of reporting incorrect information to the bios.</p>
<p>Pull the win10 backup &nbsp;hard drive and try to boot the pc with win7 or win10 disk.</p>
<p>What this would confirm is if it is something besides the win10 installton. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Being that there is an image of win10 and the other steps do not work; connect the drive with the backup on it, try to boot from the win7 or 10 dvd disk and run the restore from there.</p>
<p>Would be a good option to copy that backup first to another drive before hand.</p>
<p>The only other option is to delete all partitions on the win10 drive using another pc or gparted and start fresh.</p>
<p>On the drive connecting and disappearing, that could be a power management setting that the pc time out is set too low.</p>

<p>Being that there is an image of win10 and the other steps do not work; connect the drive with the backup on it, try to boot from the win7 or 10 dvd disk and run the restore from there.</p>
<p>Would be a good option to copy that backup first to another drive before hand.</p>
<p>The only other option is to delete all partitions on the win10 drive using another pc or gparted and start fresh.</p>
<p>On the drive connecting and disappearing, that could be a power management setting that the pc time out is set too low.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your continued interest and helpful suggestions.&nbsp; Answering your questions: no, the boot sequence remains where I set it; it does not revert back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have used DiskPart on another PC to look at the damaged hard drive.&nbsp; (I placed the damaged
 hard drive in an enclosure and connected it via a USB port to this other computer).&nbsp; I can see the OS partition ("healthy") and there's also another partition (not the UEFI one) on the drive.&nbsp; But, as I said before, I cannot perform any operations using DiskPart
 -- it won't let me shrink or delete partitions.&nbsp; It is a 1 TB hard drive, by the way.&nbsp; The only way I can get the computer to see the DVD is by disconnecting the hard drive.&nbsp; Then the Win 7 installation commences.&nbsp; I then reconnect the hard drive when Win
 7 installation asks me where I want the installation to go.&nbsp; Unfortunately the hard drive is invisible, even though it is spinning (and even though DiskPart was able to see it when it was hooked up to the other computer via the USB enclosure).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I am going to take your last suggestion and reformat the drive.&nbsp; I do not need the data -- I have it backed up on two other computers -- all I want is to get my computer back again.&nbsp; I have the Win 10 installation tool (in case I don't get this done
 before Microsoft's Aug. 29 deadline) and I wrote down the activation code before I screwed things up with the UEFI partition.&nbsp; I don't know too much about this, but I'm assuming that if the Win 7 OEM disk doesn't put back the UEFI partition, then the Win 10
 installation tool will when I use it to upgrade to Win 10.&nbsp; Or am I talking nonsense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page. But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>

<span>
<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit. Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>

<span>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously. Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers. If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode. Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

The same for me, Windows 8 X64 updated from Windows 7 X64.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The events viewer just report failed update, no other errors.</p>

<p>The problem occurs both using Windows update and the manual update from the download center.</p>

<p>For now, I have hidden the update.</p>

<p>Once I will have some indications about a fix of this update for me, i will retry to install it.</p>

            Hi OGeneJacobs 
<br />
<br />Those files are okay, they are just opening in the wrong program . . .
<br />
<br />Internet Explorer in Windows is the default SVG viewer, you just need to change the file associations on svg files . .. 
<br />
<br />Right click an svg file, choose 'Open With' - Choose Another App
<br />
<br />Important - Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open svg . . .'
<br />
<br />If the app you want to use is not in the list, scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps'
<br />
<br />Again if the app is not in the list, at the bottom, click 'Look for another app on this PC', then navigate to find the application you want to use

<h2>            Windows 10 64-bit - &#34;Winmm.dll&#34; Corrupted&#47;Start-up errors</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I'd restarted my computer--no drivers or programs had been installed&nbsp;very recently.&nbsp;Windows started up quickly as usual, but I was greeted by start-up errors!</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09c45566-def8-4c1e-8029-b193edfb1607" /></p>
<p>This particular error seems to extend to just about any .exe I run, be it Firefox, Skype, Steam,&nbsp;media players&nbsp;or anti-malware programs. I ran a quick scan through Windows Defender and no issues seemed to be found, and the same goes for an anti-rootkit program
 I ran. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Most drivers appear to be unaffected and appear to run just fine on startup, while Microsoft Edge and IE have graciously continued working, allowing me to actually post the issue here. Windows updates have continued to download and install with no issue.
 Registry cleaners like CCleaner continued to work, though using it did not help with the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps my biggest folly was in killing any chance of system restore fixing the problem. I foolishly ran one of the maintenance options (which ended up being disk cleanup or something of the like) in hopes of fixing the system file but it seems to have wiped
 or deleted&nbsp;prior system&nbsp;restore points.&nbsp;In retrospect that was probably the dumbest thing I've done yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, I ran the typical procedures in response to system errors: system file checker, DISM (scan/restore variants)&nbsp;and disk-checking were all unsuccessful. I've attached the log files for both SFC and DISM through
<a href="https://www.mediafire.com/?0v3c458c8uxaag9." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mediafire in a 7zip file</a>: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll also provide the links to the logs individually if there are any problems extracting the 7zip archive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/bl1uzbouafw4utc/dism.log" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DISM Log</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Apologies for the excruciatingly large CBS log file, it's a testament to how many times I ran SFC in panic.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC and DISM suggested that the .dll in question&nbsp;(along with&nbsp;one "winnlsres.dll")&nbsp;is corrupted (perhaps due to a botched restart on my part?), but neither programs are able to repair the file or replace it. DISM in particular asks for missing source files,
 which I've attempted to provide with the USB media installation I'd used to upgrade to Windows 10 in the first place; this hasn't worked either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Windows memory test/diagnostic tool successfully, but I'm unable to access the results from the little icon in my toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also attempted a Windows reset in an attempt to preserve my personal files, yet that particular process either crashed or failed about 38% in. A hard reformat/clean reinstall of Windows 10 is currently looking to be a final resort. I've spent a good&nbsp;many
 hours attempting to figure out what exactly the issue is and what a good solution would be. Hoping you folks can deliver some much-needed aid for&nbsp;a slightly inept user...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: It might be important to add that I'm&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;many unfortunate people&nbsp;who did an upgrade to and then clean install of Windows 10, only to be unable to activate our copies of Windows 10 afterward. I'm not sure if this may be affecting the issue but
 I guess it's worth mentioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>create a new user account</strong> and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the Link given below.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-10</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>I appreciate the quick response.&nbsp;I didn't wake up early enough to respond in an equally quick manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting in safe mode worked in that I didn't get any start-up errors, but trying to run the same programs gave me the same winmm.dll error. The subsequent clean boot didn't differ at all from starting up my computer normally (which seems strange) and
 came with the exact same errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making a new user account did not fix any of the problems. I used the run command to create another administrator account and after the brief set-up process for logging into a new account I encountered the same winmm.dll error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to add that I also ran the Windows start-up repair tool that's part of the shift+restart/troubleshooting options, but after a short diagnosis it reported that my OS version was apparently incompatible with Startup Repair.

<p>I had already attempted using System File Checker multiple times (refer to the first post); while corruption was indeed detected, SFC said that it couldn't fix any of the files. I attached the CBS.log to my first post as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran DISM in response and it failed in both instances; first using the online function&nbsp;that draws&nbsp;upon&nbsp;Windows Update, and the second in which I&nbsp;used my USB drive-based media installation of Windows 10. Both efforts reported missing source files--its respective
 log file is also attached in the first post through mediafire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I've run SFC again just in case there might be something different to report. I've gotten the same results; corruption detected but repairs impossible.

<p>
</p><p>After successfully renaming the file I am unable to copy/paste its replacement into the System32 folder, nor am I able to revert the change to winmm.dll. It also appears to have completely broken my Windows 10 as I am unable to open programs, change file
 permissions, tinker with Windows 10 settings or even open the CMD console&nbsp;with administrator privileges to&nbsp;run SFC or DISM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I encountered this new problem I finally managed to do a Windows 10 reset successfully, which kept my personal files. However, the winmm.dll error still wasn't fixed, which is worrying because I used the Windows 10 installation media that I'd&nbsp;put in
 my&nbsp;USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that a complete reformat would be my best&nbsp;option at this point, but I'm worried that I'll get the same problem even if&nbsp;it's a clean Windows 10 reinstall.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Status update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd attempted the winmm.dll copy/pasting once more, only for Windows 10 to actually stop functioning. After three attempted Windows 10 resets (and three failures/crashes in which the reset process was continually interrupted), I decided to just attempt a
 complete reformat and re-installation of Windows 10. Everything seems to be functioning properly now, but I want to hold off on marking this thread as resolved, as I'm not sure if I won't encounter the same error again, especially if Windows 10 resets have
 failed to address the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all the suggestions. Though I don't think I've seen the last of this error it seems to be a rare one, at least on Windows 10. I hope others don't encounter something so frustrating to deal with.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would ask Yubikey.  It says it's portable to all Windows platforms so that would seem to mean public computers.  But I'd ask to be sure.

    <title>CD&#47;DVD driver, windows 7 install on a clean formatted HD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superc_53  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD&#47;DVD driver, windows 7 install on a clean formatted HD</h2>
                    The motherboard of my machine is a 32 bit Presario 56308NX.&nbsp; The BIOS was upgraded years ago to a Phenix Award Bios.&nbsp; Two HDs, both 250 gigs.&nbsp; The&nbsp; factoryy installed CD &amp; DVD drives were long ago swapped out for faster (plug and play) RW DVD/CD units.&nbsp;
 This unit ran XP (last installed version was SP3) for a decade with no problem.&nbsp; Last week the HD died (completely) and I plugged in a new formatted one and decided this time to install Windows 7.&nbsp; And here I am stuck.<br />
<br />
The DVD is smart enough to read itself and start the boot, but right after selecting English as my language the DVD decides it isn't really working right with the plug and play DVD and announces I need to install a CD/DVD device driver.&nbsp; {Now why it can't just
 keep on using the one it was using to read itself, I don't know.}.&nbsp; I don't know why 'Skip this step and find and install the new hardware driver later' wasn't included as an option, but it wasn't.<br />
<br />
I tried installing in Safe mode but just get the same message.&nbsp; Help!<br />

<p><span>A required CD/DVD device driver is missing </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>1) Change BIOS boot order - The most successful fix for this issue is to set the optical (DVD) drive as the first boot device in the BIOS. To do this, first enter BIOS mode as follows:
</span></p>
<p><span>This is accomplished by pressing a specific key repeatedly as soon as your computer is turned on (or right after it is restarted). For many computers, the key is &nbsp;F1, F2, F10, the Delete (del) key or the Escape (ESC) key. Consult your computer or motherboards
 manual or try different keys until you find the right one. </span></p>
<p><span>Find the screen or option for changing the boot order. Follow the instructions for changing the boot order.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>2) ﻿Disconnect all internal </span><span>hard drives you are not installing Windows on</span><span>. Also disconnect all external drives. Then reconnect after installing.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>3) If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD, double check that you burned the .ISO file as a disk image (and not as a regular file) to the empty DVD. If you burn it to a DVD again use the lowest speed possible. It's also possible the download
 has errors, try downloading it again. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>4) Update ITE ATA driver - Failing the above, try booting back into Windows Vista or XP. Launch Windows Update and install the ITE ATA driver update before attempting the upgrade. The upgrade advisor may not find this driver.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>5) Switch from SATA to AHCI - Follow the aforementioned instructions for booting into your computers BIOS, then check your HDD or storage settings. Turn off SATA, switching to AHCI, and reboot normally, then re-attempt installation of Windows 7. Also
 try switching to IDE. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>6) If you have another DVD drive hook it up to your computer and try using that drive to install Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>7) Try installing Windows using a USB drive:</span></p>

            <p>If you are performing a clean installation booting from DVD.&nbsp; We usually come across this error message if the CD/DVD drive is incompatible with Microsoft's AHCI driver (msahci.sys).</p>
<p><br />
To work around this issue, disable AHCI mode for your disk controller in the system BIOS. Typically the controller has to be changed from AHCI mode to "IDE" or "ATA" mode.</p>

<p>Installation might stop if the system cannot copy files. Here are some possible causes and solutions for this problem:</p>
<p>Your Windows installation disc is scratched, smudged, or dirty. Clean the disc with a soft cloth, insert it in the CD or DVD drive, and then begin the Windows installation again. If your installation disc is damaged, you might need to replace it. For more
 information, go to How to replace lost, broken, or missing Microsoft software or hardware on the Microsoft website.</p>
<p>Your CD or DVD drive is not working properly, or the disc might be vibrating too much for the laser to accurately read the data. For more information about this problem, consult your hardware documentation, or contact the CD or DVD drive manufacturer.</p>
<p>If your computer has multiple CD or DVD drives, your computer might be trying to locate files on the wrong drive. If your computer has a feature to disable CD or DVD drives that are not being used, disable the drives that you aren't using. Otherwise, try
 inserting the disc into a different drive, and then start the installation again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is usually caused by hardware or software that is incompatible with Windows 7. If you have this problem, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Wait about 10 minutes to see if the installation continues. Watch the hard disk indicator (often a small light on your computer that blinks when your hard disk is running) to see if there is any activity. If your hard disk appears to be working, the installation
 should be in progress. If your hard disk does not appear to be working, go to step 2.</p>
<p>Uninstall all antivirus software, and then restart your computer. Don't forget to enable antivirus software after you install Windows.</p>
<p>If the installation fails again, there might be a hardware incompatibility problem. Go to the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor on the Microsoft website to see if your computer can run Windows 7.</p>
<p>If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable network adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.</p>
<p>If the computer still stops responding during installation, contact your computer manufacturer or retailer.<br />
</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>If your copy of Windows 7 is a digital download, try downloading another copy and burn to a blank disc at the lowest speed supported by your DVD burner.

    <title>Mouse cursor not visible in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patdyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse cursor not visible in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My mouse cursor has suddenly disappeared from the screen on my Medion all-in-one touchscreen PC. This coincided with an attempt to install a Wacom Volito 2 graphics tablet using software that I now realise was not compatible with Windows 10. The mouse I
 use is a wireless mouse.</p>
<p>Things I have tried - using the FN key with various F keys as suggested online. I have checked the driver is up to date. Tried a new wired mouse. Checked that tablet mode is switched off. Used system restore to go back to the point before I tried to install
 the Volito 2 (however, after two attempts both times I got a message saying system restore was unsuccessful - I made sure on the second attempt that my Avast anti-virus program was disabled). I've used the Windows 10 troubleshooter. Using device manager I
 have established that the mouse is working properly. I have all the latest updates installed.</p>
<p>When I press the Ctrl key the indication is that there is a cursor there somewhere, just not visible.
</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is connected but for a few weeks prior to the problem, on starting the PC, the sign-in screen was sometimes showing streaks, flashing circles and lines at various parts of the screen and&nbsp; I couldn't move the cursor to click in the password
 box until a few minutes had passed and things went back to normal. After that it worked perfectly.</p>
<p>I am now considering a computer refresh or reset but am not sure if this will help.</p>
<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Patrick</p>
