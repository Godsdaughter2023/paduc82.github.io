<h2>            Windows Live Photo Galery as default</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows Live Photo Gallery on Windows 7. Installed Windows 10 and it had Microsoft Photos pre-installed. How to I get rid of Microsoft Photos and keep Windows Live Photo Gallery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original title: Microsoft Photos&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: </p>
<p>I asked previously about removing Microsoft Photos from Windows 10. The answer is I can not. I have used for years Windows Live Photo Gallery. The issue now is that when the Microsoft program pulls photos from Windows Live Photo Gallery&nbsp;they are then duplicated
 in the Windows program. Is there a way to disable the Microsoft program?&nbsp; </p>

            Hello, it is more an issue with lag when connecting a peripheral device like the razer core. The razer core has its own display adapter separate from the one on the laptop, my laptop is a razor blade stealth. I don't know if it is related to the new intel
 driver that is installed after the new windows 10 update. The lag is minor, maybe if I revert back to an older intel driver version the lag would go away. &nbsp;There is another issue too, the razer core will get disconnected from the laptop for a few seconds and
 reconnect back after that.&nbsp;

<h3> lesabernathy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t sign into Windows Live to play Bulletstorm</h2>
                    I have to sign into your stupid DRM Windows Live thing to play Bulletstorm, but no matter how many times I try to sign in it won't let me.&nbsp; I've been at this for two hours and no matter how many times I reset my password I can't sign in.&nbsp; I think the problem
 is that when I click the "Forgot Password" link it is taking me to an account that has the same email address but isn't link to my Xbox Live account.&nbsp; I even signed on to my Xbox to check the setting and it also has the email address "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".&nbsp;
 However I can only seem to make any headway when I don't try to sign into my xbox live account but still use the same email and password.&nbsp; However, when I do this, it keeps asking me to do an update but I can't get the game to play no matter how many times
 I download the update.&nbsp; I think the problem with that is because I have to force the game to shut down because there is no way to close the game properly after you install

Yes, well you are whistling into the wind here unfortunately, as there are no employees of Monopoly$oft on these forums. If there were it would not help.<br />
GFWL, Steam and now Origin are all a pain and intrusion, but they won't be going away any time soon.
<br />
I accidentally lost&nbsp; saves to several games because I thought I was just making a new user name for the game Dirt 3 when I was actually making a new GFWL account name which did not match the user name in the saves (part of the DRM in a number of games now ).<br />
There were other issues resulting as well so I uninstalled GFWL&nbsp; and reinstalled it using the latest download installer of the GFWL client.
<br />
As with Steam (and probably Origin) you have to let GFWL take control , with no interruptions, until it is satisfied.<br />
Once you get the games running again you can play in offline mode and ignore warnings about not being able to show the world your progress.&nbsp; I don't use the 'service'. If you do want to&nbsp; part of the GFWL thing&nbsp; there may be other fixes.<br />
<br />
It may be best to set up the xbox&nbsp; login and the GFWL with all the same details<br />
to avoid potential for conflict ( if you have not already).&nbsp; I don't have an xbox
<br />
account, so I don't know how it interacts with GFWL.<br />

            <p>Same problem here. I just want to play game offline, I dont want to be a part of windows live world. I have bought 4 games, this is the third I try to install and play, but it is impossible. Im really angry and I dont see any reason to buy these games anymore.
 And all of the discussions about problems with playing games are in foreign language, mostly in english. If you find out the solution, please post it. Best regards.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to poor hardware performance: 1 GB RAM, 16GB HDD, for me it has been impossible to install any major update. I installed a SD Card but, even in this case, the update requires a minimum of 2GB free space in C:\, with Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when I first used this device, the maximum available space was 1.5 GB. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to update successfully my version of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xavier Francàs</p>

            <p>I tried to upgrade with an USB stick and it did not work. There is a free capacity of 14 GB, but it is more than required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps a solution would be to recover the very first&nbsp;original version from this Media Creation Tool.</p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
</span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<br />
<span>
<p>For Dell, press F8 on the keyboard until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears on the screen.</p>
<br />
</span><span>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the recovery partition is not working, try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloading from a torrent site might put your computer at risk. If you must reinstall Windows 7 Home Basic 64 bit, do it the right way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tools you will need for this task:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://code.kliu.org/misc/winisoutils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">eicfg_removal_utility.zip</span></a></strong> – is a simple tool that will remove the ei.cfg from any Windows ISO disc image, thereby converting the image
 into a “universal disc” that will prompt the user to select an edition during setup. It’s a free download
<strong><a href="http://code.kliu.org/misc/winisoutils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">here</span></a></strong>
</li><li><strong>Genuine Retail Windows 7&nbsp;64 bit Installation DVD – </strong>this will be used to reinstall Windows 7 Starter 32 bit, any retail edition of Windows 7 32 bit will do, this includes Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate, doesn’t matter if its upgrade
 or full version. You cannot use a 64 bit DVD because there is no 64 bit version of Windows 7 Starter. You will need to create an image of the disc, please refer to our Notebooks.com tutorial about how to create a digital backup of your software
<strong>here</strong> </li></ul>
<p>After you have created the image of the Windows 7&nbsp;64 bit DVD, we will edit the image and remove the ei.cfg file so we can reveal all editions of Windows 7 during the installation and select Windows 7 Home Basic. Lets take a look at doing it step by step.

<p>After downloading the eicfg removal utility, you need to extract it, since its in a .zip file. Just right click it and click Extract All.

<p>Browse to where the Windows 7 Image (.ISO file) is stored, select it and click
<strong>Open. </strong></p>

<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment, the only difference this time is, you will be given a choice to select the edition of Windows 7 you want to reinstall.

<h2>            How to change file back to folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, and let me tell something before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I have searched the way to change the file back to folder on the internet with various combination of words. Second, I tried to do those ways, and they did not work at all. I used the check disk to find any disk drive problem twice. There was an error,
 but it had no detail showed and could not be solved. I used antivirus programs, including Microsoft Safety Scanner, to scan virus, and there was no virus or infected file. Recently, I desperately phoned Microsoft Support for help, and they said they had limited
 resource and left me frustrated. So now, my last straw, it is time to ask for help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem happened to my colleague. She said that her work folder turned into a file, and after I saw the issue, I found out that she accidentally added "." in between a word (eg. "From Desktop.2016".) I know it is a human error, and I cannot blame her
 for it. Right now, after trying my best to solve the problem, it still is a file with file type 2016. So, please tell me how to fix it. The magnitude of the problem is huge because inside the said folder, there are lots of important and highly valued files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Banyong
<br />
<br />This is an interesting problem . . .
<br />
<br />Simply adding a dot to a folder name will not change it to a file, dots are allowed characters in folder names.
<br />
<br />Right click that file and choose properties, what is the reported size of the file?

            Hi Banyong
<br />
<br />Yes,I thought so, that is not a folder, is it an small/empty file - change the file extension on that to txt and you will see there is little if any content in that file . . .
<br />
<br />There are 2 possibilities, your colleague has accidentally moved the original folder into another folder, or this may be caused by malware, if that was definitely the original folder name. 
<br />
<br />Please do a search in File Explorer for 'From Desktop' and see if you can locate the original folder in some other folder
<br />
<br />Also, you should run a full scan for malware, just in case . . .

<p>Hi DaveM121,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your advice. But still, I cannot find after doing the search, and there is no malware or virus after the full scan as you recommended.</p>

                    <p>I have an ASUS laptop with windows 10. On 8/19 I received a windows auto update and now my sticky notes have disappeared without warning. Initially after the update my sticky notes appeared but the font had changed. Then when I turned on my computer this
 AM {8/20} no sticky notes appeared. Just gone. Help me recover this program and my sticky notes.</p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sticky Notes can be found under Windows Accessories under All Apps&nbsp;in the Start Menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sticky notes from the previous version might be available on Windows.old folder. However, kindly understand that their may be a few applications which may not get installed along with the new upgrade therefore, you have to reinstall all those applications.
</p>
<p>It is always recommended to keep a back up of all&nbsp;your important&nbsp;files and folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, follow the steps below and see if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Press the <strong>File Explorer icon </strong>from the taskbar and click on
<strong>View </strong>tab.</p>
<p>2. Check the box for <strong>Hidden Items.</strong></p>
<p>3. Now, click on <strong>this PC </strong>and navigate the path: <strong>C:\Windows.old\Users\USERNAME\Local\Microsoft\Sticky Notes.</strong></p>
<p>4. The file should like <strong>stickyNotes.snt</strong>.</p>
<p>5. If it is not available in&nbsp;Windows.old folder. Then, there is no way to retrieve it. You may have to create new notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>

            Thank you but nothing you suggested helped. I cannot create new sticky notes. When I click on the sticky note icon on my task bar nothing happens. I'm at a loss. And why would this happen right after an update.

            Thanks - I downloaded the app and all my sticky notes were there. The font is different, but the text is all there. I have taken the precaution of copy-and-pasting them all into a document just in case they disappear when I log off, as someone in the chain
 described.

            <p>This Windows 10 update (installed this week) seems to have bugs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I can change to single line spacing (CTRL+1 and just beware, CTRL+using the Numerics pad "1" will NOT work!) and make font smaller, the sticky note itself will NOT retain these changes if I reboot or log off and back on again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being able to change the font in itself is annoying. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost every time when I try to adjust the font to Italics (CTRL-I), the sticky note literally disappears and the only way to get it back is to relaunch the app!! &nbsp;Users should NOT &nbsp;have to go the the Microsoft store to download another app!!</p>

    <title>File view depending on file type&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File view depending on file type&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way to configure windows explorer to use a specific file view depending on the file type? for some file types it is practical to use the extra large view (images, presentation, videos..) but is impractical for some others (notepad, excel, executable,
 binaries...), of course you can store your files on different folders organized by type but some times is easier to have the files in one folder and take the one you want at glance

            thank you but that is not a solution to the main subject of my question,&nbsp; I want to configure the folder to show the large view for files like images, videos, ppt files or dwg files and to show the other files using a smaller view because I'm not interested
 to have the big icon of the notepad files or the excel files, so for those files I prefer to have a smaller view but in the same folder on which the images will be shown with the large view

<p>sShort answer in "not possible"<br />
<br />
Reason is Windows 7 developers left it as it is and didn't add additional customization on size of the icon because most users doesn't see the need of having it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use 3rd party software that can alter icon size.</p>
<p>You can also use large icons settings. This applies to everything though. (control panel)</p>

<h2>            Receive error 80070005-4000D</h2>
                    <p>So far, I have successfully upgraded 8 PCs from 7 &amp; 8.1 to Windows 10 with no significant issues whatsoever. Just as my luck would have it, the last machine decided to be the problem child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me say up front, I had started the download on another identical machine in the same office before I started it on this one. I know it *shouldn't* have made any difference but that doesn't mean it *didn't*.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are Core2Duo (I apologize but my mind has gone blank) I think at 2.1 GHz, with 4 GB memory and Windows 7 Professional SP1 x86. The first PC's upgrade completed successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade process began normally. The software deemed both machines eligible for the upgrade. Then the download started. With it running, I left to go to another site to perform a little maintenance on a printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I returned, the first machine was powered down. Booting it told me the upgrade went well. But on the other, I was greeted by a white error window with the code 80070005-4000D that stated the update could not be installed. My options were to 1) Learn
 more about the error, 2) Cancel, or 3) Retry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I tried #3, then #1, and finally #2. All were equally unsatisfying. I started searching. The first solution I came upon suggested downloading an image from MS and using the media to boot into the upgrade (so described for brevity). I've done the first
 part of it but haven't actually tried the process yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't typically upgrade OSes, although I understand it's usually pretty uneventful. But because these computers are on a network with Small Business Server 2011 Essentials, I am a little reticent to run the risk of rendering the Connector totally fubar.
 I've read that fixing that problem is fairly straightforward, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another concern is whether the Windows 7 product key will transition to 10 as it does with the "normal" upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I was wondering if it would be worth it to try to remove the original upgrade files that were downloaded then try running the whole process over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies if these are Chicken Little concerns. It's just that these two computers handle 95% of the workload for the organization. That's mostly why I saved them for last. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any &amp; all helpful advice.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, I just couldn't resist giving my idea a try. I figured at best, I could save myself some time (and maybe some grief) and,, at worst, I'd waste an hour or so and have to use the media I created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I removed the original downloaded upgrade files (C:\$WINDOWS.~BT), restarted the machine, and began the upgrade process again. Am extremely happy to say it worked like a charm!</p>

<h2>            Latest patch for Xbox 360 Rise of the Tomb Raider Renders Maps useless</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi everyone,</span></p>
<p><span>I'm sorry if this issue has already been addressed and that I'm posting here, but Square Enix has brushed me off.&nbsp; I have been playing Rise of the Tomb Raider for months now with minimal problems (occasional hanging).&nbsp; However,
 ever since the latest game patch (REQUIRED IF I WANT TO USE CLOUD SAVED GAMES), I can't move, zoom in or out on maps while Lara is moving around.&nbsp; The maps also do not show any documents, coin caches, etc.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If I am at a fast travel point, the maps work OK.&nbsp; I have tried everything possible. Here's what I tried:<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Cleared the system cache and rebooted Xbox</span>
</li><li><span>Deleted the latest game patch, cleared system cache and rebooted<br />
</span></li><li><span>LAST RESORT - deleted all traces of the game including over 100 hours of gameplay, reinstalled game, Babba Yadda, etc, cleared system cache and rebooted.<br />
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Nothing has worked!&nbsp; I DID manage at one point to delete the patch and disable automatic updates, but I could only play a couple of times on the local drive before the same nonsense started up again.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I bought this game and the add-ons via Xbox Live Gold.&nbsp; I hope that someone one there has a solution or has heard that someone is coming out with a fix for this bug.&nbsp; I love the game, but I can't play it.&nbsp; If nothing is solved,
 I will request/demand a refund.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Please note:&nbsp; all other games including other versions of Tomb Raider are operating normally with no problem.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance, <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>MIACLOCKMAN<br />
</span></p>

<p>I have the same issue. Not sure how but it worked straight after the patch then following the next system reboot the problem first showed. After a couple of days the map then worked fine on two occasions including Friday evening. However from Saturday the
 map has not worked yet again and continues to not work.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 photo editing completely changed overnight - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thayes55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 photo editing completely changed overnight</h2>
                    <p>I do a lot of photo editing and use the built in photo editing that comes with Windows 10. &nbsp;I went with Windows 10 because I liked the way this feature worked and looked. &nbsp; However last night when I got into my photos to do some editing the feature had completely
 changed. &nbsp;For example the next and back button is now at the bottom of the frame instead of on either side. &nbsp;When I click on edit all of the options come up on the right side in photo form instead of the left. &nbsp;There used to be a choice of basic fixes or advanced
 options. &nbsp;If I chose basic I would get options on the right side of the screen (enhanced, crop, rotate, straighten, etc.) &nbsp;If I chose enhanced I would get options on the left side of the screen (light, color, filters). &nbsp;When I chose one of those options I
 would get a dial symbol with a dot that I would put my cursor on to move around the dial full circle from 1 - 100 for adjustments. &nbsp;These options showed up on the right side of the screen, &nbsp;Now everything is on the right side of the screen and there is no
 longer the dial adjustment , &nbsp;Instead it's a sliding bar left or right and there are dozens of filters when there only used to be 5. &nbsp;I do not want or like this version. &nbsp;The previous version was much easier to work with and allowed for more control. &nbsp;How
 did this happen? &nbsp;I haven't had any updates to my computer in the last week. &nbsp;Any ideas on how to restore the original version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I definitely have the same feelings about the update, it's been so simplified it's not a laughing matter. Why for the love of god Microsoft would you alter/remove features from an already great piece of software, if anything you should have added to it to
 make it even more advanced. I ask why but i guess it's in the question, you don't or haven't given people the option to pick and choose the updates applied whilst using Windows 10.</p>

            Why ON EARTH would you alter this program to, apparently, double the number of "filters"?!&nbsp; Have never used a filter ~ and don't envision that I ever would [Instagram, much?]. What was previously&nbsp;a well-designed and well-functioning&nbsp;platform is now unwieldy,
 unattractive, far more time-consuming,&nbsp;and&nbsp;ANNOYING to operate.<br />
<br />
Are we able to revert back to the previous version, or not?&nbsp; Bring back our wheels!

            <p>I am right with you on this!! I do a lot of photography, loved and solely relied (past tense) on Windows Photo Editor..
<strong>I just sat down to edit photos and I'm completely</strong><strong>&nbsp;shocked and in a panic by the new changes... really hate it. I cannot use it in this format at all.
</strong>I don't use filters. I loved the way I could control all aspects of tweaking the photo just right whether it was adjusting shadows, color, light or crispness. I do a lot of bird photography and one size does not fit all!! Even the button where you
 could toggle between the original and edited version before saving is gone. Who did Microsoft make this stupid new version for???
<strong>Is there a way to get the former version of Photo Editor back???</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>With the prior version I did not need to use PhotoShop or Lightoom but now I will have to. This version is unusable for me and like I said, I'm in a panic because I just sat down to comb through several hundred photos with hopes of perfectly editing ten
 or so prints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, how could you do this to serious photographer hobbyist???? I guess it's time to bite the bullet and go to Adobe Lightroom... ugh.</p>

            See if you have a restore point PRIOR to when the Photo Viewer changed (which was, for me, the wee hours of 11-15/11-16)?<br />
<br />
Restore to *that* date.&nbsp; Someone suggested that you turn OFF the ability for the Windows Store to automatically send you updates to their apps.&nbsp; If, in fact, it was the "Store" that sent us the inferior Photo Viewer, this *might* help.&nbsp; *Might* is the operative
 term, there.<br />
<br />
I will note that, after I restored to a previous date, I was able to retrieve the "old" viewer/editor, but my system is now running w-a-y slow.&nbsp; Will deal with that later, I guess.&nbsp; Good luck!

            I've tried doing the restore to a prior point to the update/downgrade. &nbsp;However both times I did it it got most of the way through the process then gave me an error that the restoration could not be completed and to check my disk to see if had been corrupted.
 &nbsp;Did that and there are no bugs in my system. &nbsp;Even though I was unable to complete the restoration my system ran slow for awhile too. &nbsp;What a joke. &nbsp;Microsoft are you listening?

            <p>I just went to use the default photo editor in Windows 10 and discovered that it has been completely changed. What was once a dynamic, advanced, and enjoyable editing program has now become a useless piece of junk. I was so happy with Microsoft for including
 such a rich featured application as a default program with Windows 10 that I actually felt PROUD and lucky to be a Windows user. Now I feel like Microsoft is pointing a finger at me and laughing. Hard. I am disgusted with you now. How DARE you make such a
 change and not give the option to decline it. There are no decent words for angry I am with Microsoft right now, and I really want to go on a Clark Griswold rant, calling you every dirty rotten name and every foul-mouthed expletive that can be said (written).
 Since that would do me no good and be totally and completely ignored by you sinners at Microsoft, I shall close with a link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;link non relevant video removed&gt;</p>
<p>
, Microsoft, for destroying the default photo editing capabilities of Windows 10.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Josh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to assist you better, please answer some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you lose connection to the internet before this started to show in your <strong>
Network status</strong>?</li><li>Does it still come up even after rebooting your devices?</li></ul>
<p>We suggest you try to reboot both the computer and your modem/router to allow the computer's network status to refresh. You can also just unplug the Ethernet cable from the computer then reconnect it after a few seconds to see if the status will be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your other concern, what error are you getting when you try to verify your identity on the Sign-in options for Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            HDR support and Sony projectors</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new Sony VPL-VW365ES projector and Xbox One S.&nbsp; I updated the projectors firmware to the latest version (2.301) which adds support for HDR.&nbsp; My problem is I can't get the Xbox to identify this projector as supporting HDR.&nbsp; I spent a couple of hours last night trying numerous configuration combinations and menu settings to no avail. Then I took my Samsung UHD player with HDR support off my other TV, connected it to the projector, and HDR worked just fine.&nbsp; It's just the Xbox and the Projector that can't talk and I'm not sure which component is at fault.</p><p><br /></p><p>For background: The Xbox is connected directly to an HDCP 2.2 compatible port (HDMI 2) using the cable that came with the Xbox. The Sony projector doesn't have any specific setting to enable HDR support. You simply connect your component via the HDCP enabled port.</p><p><br /></p><p>Steve</p>

    <title>My Game is not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beagle 15  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Game is not working.</h2>
                    <p>My Call of Duty WW2 game stopped working. I have tried everything to fix it but nothing seems to work. I'm on Xbox One by the way. Every time I load the game, it runs through the Activision logo, Sledgehammer games, and Raven. After that it goes to a black screen and keeps playing the same music over and over again. It just stays at the black screen and never progresses from there no matter what I try. So far I have tried:</p>

<ul><li><p>uninstalling and reinstalling the game multiple times.</p></li><li><p>I tried using a different copy of the game but that didn't work either so I don't thing it is the actual disc.</p></li><li><p>I can play other games without issue so it isn't the system itself.</p></li><li><p>I booted the game without signing into a profile and got the same error so I don't think it's that either.</p></li></ul>

<p>I am completely at a loss as to what the issue is and where to go from here. Has anyone had similar issues with the game or anything I can go off of? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>It would have to due to country regions and if Xbox Live is offered in your country. The 21 supported countries are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Australia**** </li><li>USA.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>A possible work around this is to change your accounts region and then have your internet through a VPN. I know the VPN technique worked for Netflix in Australia (before it arrived) but I haven't tested this technique with Xbox Live.</p>

<p>Could it be a corrupt cache?</p>

</p><p>These steps I found from this Xbox support <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/games/troubleshooting/cloud-save-troubleshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
site</a>&nbsp;to try and fix this. The steps delete the cloud saves. &nbsp;So I'm unsure if you have anything saved there already but this would delete your cloud saves.</p>
<p>

<p>Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord
 from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

 it sit for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, plug it in and turn it on. when we are at the dash, let's go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network settings &gt; Advanced &gt; alternate mac &gt; clear &gt; it'll do another restart</span></p>

            What happens if you go into your settings and enable Game DVR/upload? Some have reported the screenshot prompt won’t appear if this is unchecked.

<p>I had the exact same issue just now.&nbsp; The issue for me was that I was switching back and forth between having HDR10 output enabled without closing the game in which I was taking screenshots (Red Dead Redemption 2).&nbsp; I found that screenshots worked again
 once I completely quit the game and restarted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you're tinkering with HDR output settings, try completely quitting a game and restarting it to see if screenshots work again.</p>

            Just a thought, would you be able to check your xbox storage to make sure it isnt full?&nbsp; If there isnt enough room then it might not be able to take additional screenshots
