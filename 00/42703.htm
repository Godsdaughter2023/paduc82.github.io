<h2>            How do I block cheats from playing multiplayer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Multi-player can be tough and i am not complaining about that. I played and there was a player that was definately cheating. First incident: I shot him at point blank with a buffalo rifle - he just came at me and killed me! Second incident, I hit him cleanly
 at least 3 times and he just came at me and killed me. The way this cheat works is by pretending to be a regular player during standoff / shoot-outs at the start. Then in private, he racks up kills by cheating (basically he very rarely dies). I have to admit
 he is clever about the way he is doing it, but I dont want to play people like this as it spoils the game for me.</p>
<p>I have written down this persons game tag and want to know how i can block my console from joining matches with this person ever again?</p>

<p>On your dashboard, report and block the person, and move on with your gaming life. Set him as an avoided player. Doesn't mean you will never see them again, but it's the best chance.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>RDR is one of the games where the cheating and modding have gotten so bad that unless the game developer steps in and does something about it, then there's just too much for xbox enforcement to fight at their end.</p>

<p>As above to avoid them but you can also file a complaint against players like this, i've been playing this game for a long time now and still really enjoy it but recently there is an invincibility glitch opened in Chuparosa and something needs to be done
 about it most sessions now there is at least one player in this glitch. Fortunately all is not lost as you can go to several hide-outs pick up an explosive rifle and shoot the player with it and they are out of the glitch then you can kill them as normal.</p>

<p>That actually doesn't accomplish anything.</p>
<p>Sending multiple reports can get you in minor trouble for misusing the reporting feature. If it's because you need to send different reports that's fine, but only if it's legitimate, and once for each.</p>
<p>As for blocking, once you've blocked and avoided someone, going back to do it again just undoes it. In the end they will still be blocked and avoided, but only once is needed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Rockstar stays silent because they don't really care about mods and cheats in games that aren't the current new thing. Not kidding. They encourage it themselves at times. That\s ok for PC formats, but on consoles it's a massive problem.</p>

<p>In addition to the fine explanation by Canadian Tech, and assuming that you have a reasonably good display system so that you are using the "Aero" features of Windows 7, there are some very useful window re-sizing features in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Snap" feature is particularly useful when operating on two windows at the same time.</p>

<p>This bit of instruction may help....</p>
<p>
Move and shape windows
</p><div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<p>
Windows are rectangles that open on your desktop when you start a program.&nbsp; A window can fill your entire screen or take just part of it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
There should be three little boxes up on the top right of each window.&nbsp; Starting from the right, an X that when you click, will close the window; a single box or two boxes that if you click will change to the other form; and a dash – that if you click, the
 window will disappear from view, but still show up on the task bar at the bottom of your screen.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
If that 2nd box is a pair of squares, your window takes up your entire screen.&nbsp; The window can not be moved or change shape.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
If that 2nd box is a single rectangle, your window is in the form of a shapable, movable rectangle (like the window in your room).&nbsp; If it looks like it still takes up the entire screen, then you need to re-size or re-shape it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
To re-shape a window, move your mouse pointer to any window border.&nbsp; When you have it in just the right spot, the single arrow will change to a two-headed one.&nbsp; If you hold the left button down (assuming your computer is set for a right hander) while that arrow
 is two-headed, you can drag that window’s border in either direction.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
If you move that pointer to a corner, the arrow will take the shape of a two-headed arrow, but be angular.&nbsp; By holding down the left button while dragging, you can re-shape the window in both dimensions at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Once you have it the right shape, you can move the window.&nbsp; The very top of the window is called the title bar.&nbsp; By left-clicking and holding the arrow on that spot, you can drag the window to where ever you want it to be on your screen.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Windows will remember the shape and position of the window.&nbsp; So, the next time you open that particular window, it will resume the shape and position you last left it in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b></p>

<p><span>c. Check the <b>Use my setting for this device</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Select a profile and click on <b>Remove</b></span></p>
<p><span>e. After selecting a profile, check the <b>Set as Default Profile</b> button.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click <b>Close</b> to exit the dialog box.</span></p>

<div>2. I first used the "Method 1" you described.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Before I even got your answer I tried this method of resetting the default profile, disabling it, and updating the driver software (there are no updates). No matter what profile is default I get this same yellow color every time I close the laptop and
 open it (it goes to sleep and I log back in). And I do NOT wish to set my laptop settings to not go to sleep when I close it. I need it to so that when I leave it on my desk no one can log in while I'm gone.</div>

            <p>Hi michaeljreedy,</p>
<p>Other than the calibration, was anything else changed on the computer (new software, hardware, etc.)? If you have another user account on the computer, check to see if the issue exists on that account. You may also use
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a> to eliminate the possibility of a software conflict on the computer.

We are using Windows Media Player v11.0.6001.7000 in Windows Vista with all the updates.
<br />
If I disable CA Pest Patrol from startup, then i don't get this prompt, n'or does the video open outside of protected mode. everything works perfectly as it should. However, if i restart PP then i get the same prompt again, and it doesn't matter if i click
 on allow or don't allow. I have adjusted and lowered all my security setting to try to bypass this in IE, still to no avail. Additionally, lowing the security settings is not much of an option in my environment.
<br />
I have allowed the Media Foundation Protected Pipeline through the firewall both ways, but that still doesn't help it.
<br />
<br />
When we look at the CA log files, there is no mention of it having a hard time with this exe, n'or is the exe even mentioned. It does not appear to interfere with the file, however when PP is dissabled, it works.
<br />
<br />
Any help would be great. thanks.

<h2>            Having difficulty installing Canon LBP6230&#47;6240 printer on Windows 10 HP all in one PC</h2>
                    <p>I could use&nbsp;some help with installing my printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a mature&nbsp;end user&nbsp;and over the years have successfully moved through numerous MS operating systems which required a short learning curve for each , but have never had a problem installing a&nbsp;printer&nbsp;until now.&nbsp; My printer is&nbsp;less than 2 years old.&nbsp; I&nbsp;recently
 upgraded to a new all in one HP system with Windows 10.&nbsp; I had a traditional HP desktop system previously with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using the disk that came with the printer but it didn't seem to work so&nbsp;I was able to locate the driver's readme doc and determined it only works through Windows 8.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;downloaded&nbsp;from the Canon web site the 64 bit driver for my printer
 model supposedly good for Windows 10 but although my computer&nbsp;said it installed the printer correctly, when I tried to do a test print I got an error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is obviously very different from previous MS OS versions and I am feeling less comfortable navigating it and&nbsp;am not feeling&nbsp;that confident in poking around just yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck and don't have any idea what to try next.&nbsp; I am not in a position to&nbsp;buy a new printer at this time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>I am using a local usb connection.&nbsp; I discovered that the usb from the printer is 2.0 and is not compatible with new pc 3.0 usb.&nbsp; I don’t know if it made a difference but I figured it couldn’t hurt so I plugged in a usb hub that was 2.0 and plugged the printer
 into that.&nbsp; I again went to Canon and searched for the driver for my printer model and their site detected my pc is running 64 bit windows 10 and provided the driver version 21.45 as you noted so I downloaded that since I figured I had found the correct driver
 this time.&nbsp; I turned my printer off, uninstalled all previous attempts and drivers first then did a whole new install with the new driver and to my surprise…….my system found the printer and the new driver and when I clicked on “PRINT TEST PAGE”&nbsp; I was delighted
 to hear the sound of my printer reacting and it actually printed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I am good now and I thank you very much for responding to my request for assistance and providing helpful info.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 activation issues</h2>
                    After upgrading to 10 pro there is a problem with activation of windows. When trying to activate a message is being displayed ' we found a windows 10 home single language for this device running windows 10 pro. To activate using this digital license, you
 need to install windows 10 home single language.' I have changed motherboard of my PC recently but it was running well with windows 10 home. The problem started after upgrading to pro. When I contact the support team they told me that I have to downgrade my
 pc to windows 8 and then have to&nbsp;reinstall windows 10 for make activation. I tried to go back to win 8 but system says file has been removed. Please guide me how can I go back to windows 10 home single language or tell me how can I get the windows activation
 key&nbsp;Which was used for activation of windows&nbsp;8.&nbsp;I also&nbsp;want to know&nbsp;If there is digital license linked to earlier build why it could not automatically be continued with current build.

    <title>Surface Pro 4 fan noise &#40;i5&#47;i7&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wataru1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 fan noise &#40;i5&#47;i7&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Post (i5 SP4)</strong></p>
<p>Has anyone noticed the fan noise? How often does the fan kick in and how loud it is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking this because my Pro 4's fan (i5) kicks in frequently and seems worse than my Pro 3 (i5). This shouldn't happen at all because all I heard from the reviews and initial impressions was that the thermal dissipation has been greatly improved in Pro
 4 and you should not hear the fan even in heavy load.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is important because if no one is experiencing this, I'll have to return or exchange this product.&nbsp;(<em>EDIT: Returned due to not all folks&nbsp;experienced the same constant noise I had - This suggests some machines run cooler than others</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For technical details:</span> The processor will frequently turbo burst to 2.9Ghz even at low CPU usage (below 30%) as seen in background indexing and web browsing. The sustained high CPU frequency is the culprit for
 overheating and fan noise. The fan continues to kick in even if the CPU is locked down to 2Ghz (via advanced power options - maximum processor state). I have to lock the CPU down to 1.8Ghz to turn down the fan completely (<em>EDIT: This does not always work
 unfortunately</em>). My room temperature is constantly kept at 76 F.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (i7 SP4, with Jan. 27th firmware update):</strong> </p>
<p>After much deliberation between MS's and others' offerings, I&nbsp;eventually decided to settle down with&nbsp;an i7 SP4 (lot No.&nbsp;1602). The fan on this i7 rarely came on (with all the installation and indexing going, even benchmarking). This was&nbsp;perfect.&nbsp;However,
 after the Jan 27th firmware update, the fan noise is back (ironically, this update is supposed to
<em>fix </em>fan noise). Now I have the same constant noise for very minimal tasks that I am doing (browsing web and watch youtube videos etc). The experience is again completely ruined.

    <title>Print Spooler crashing after Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reverend_funk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Spooler crashing after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>A month ago my computer installed a routine Windows Update upon shut down. When I started up the next morning I couldn't print, getting an error saying I needed to install a printer to be able to print. When I clicked on the network printer I wanted to install
 I got another error: "Windows cannot connect to the printer. The local print spooler is not running. Please restart the spooler or restart the machine."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the spooler and it had indeed stopped. I restarted it and tried to print, only for it to fail again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Key Points:</strong></em></p>
<p>My machine is a HP 280 G2. 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor.</p>
<p>OS: Win10 Pro, version 1803, build17134.472</p>
<p>Printer is connected to another machine (called Print-Server) via USB and shared on the local network<br />
Print-Server is a HP Compaq dc7900. 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor</p>
<p>OS: Win10 Pro, version 1803, build 17134.523</p>
<p>The Windows updates that installed prior to the error were KB4480966 and KB4100347. The Error has occurred on 3 separate machines in exactly the same way over the course of this month. I have been able to use System Restore on two
 of these machines to go back to before the Updates were downloaded and disabled any further Windows Updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>On the remaining machine I have tried:</strong></em></p>
<p>Changing the spooler's Recovery settings (subsequent failures: Restart the Service)<br />
Checked all dependencies are installed and running</p>
<p>Removing the device and deleting the driver from the registry<br />
Re-adding the printer (fails with error: "Windows cannot connect to the printer. The local print spooler is not running. Please restart the spooler or restart the machine.") - Upon checking Services, my spooler has not stopped and I can print to a different
 printer (wifi).</p>
<p>Cleared out folder C:\windows\system32\spool\printers</p>
<p>Uninstalling KB4480966 and KB4100347 - Neither file listed in 'Uninstall an update'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two updates that were installed around the time I noticed the errors (Though I can't pinpoint the exact date). They are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe Acrobat DC (19.010320069) http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/837/cpsid_83708.html</p>
<p>Security Update for Adobe Flash Player http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=4480979</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next most recent update was installed well over a month ago.</p>

            <p>I have Premium Classic Jigsaw and have this issue as well.&nbsp; Two days ago I purchased three collections with "gold" and they downloaded.&nbsp; The next day or so, ALL&nbsp;of my "purchased" collections disappeared.&nbsp; Why has this issue&nbsp;not been answered???&nbsp;&nbsp;I paid for the premium version with&nbsp;my REAL money (because the ads were causing major freezes and&nbsp;driving me to distraction.&nbsp; And now I can no longer finish the collections I've built up over the past several months.&nbsp; I've tried to contact MS Games directly--no go. A virtual assistant sent me back to the forums, and I don't see this helping--yet.&nbsp; Please help us get our collections back!</p>

</p><p>(Website version): First see if changing your website's region here will fix it:

<p>
</p><p>If this is a region issue regarding your account you will have to have to migrate the Microsoft account to the country that you're in, on this page:
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/accountmigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://live.xbox.com/accountmigration</a> Please read all the warnings before you migrate the account as it can only be done once every 3 months and some digital games may not work anymore if they were bought in another region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you migrate the region, sign out and in and you should be able to select another address than just the USA if your account is set to USA either on your console or on the website.</p>

            This depends by your console region.<br />
<br />
If you are in the US you should select US as <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-HK/xbox-one/console/locale-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
your Locale</a> (region) and, of course, add a billing address.<br />
<br />
Make sure your console is set to the correct Locale so you will be able to use the proper address.<br />
<br />
Also, make sure to update the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
billing information</a> on your microsoft account. It might take some hours to correctly update.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Hey there Fall of Arkham!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're a dealing with this issue concerning changing your gamertag.
</p>
<p>I was going to ask, how are you trying this? On the console, or online?</p>
<p>I would suggest, if the previously posted solutions haven't worked yet, that you contact
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">customer support</a> so hopefully an agent can look into this personally for you.
</p>
<p>They are able to look deeper into your billing/account information for any discrepancies.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Give that a shot when you get a chance and let us know how that helped</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>2 days ago I was backing up my files onto an external hard-disk but discovered that nothing had been backed up so disconnected it.</p>
<p>Perhaps something was corrupt in my hard-disk so I will not use it again. &nbsp;The problem began after this effort so perhaps this has been the cause. &nbsp;I have tried to find answers on the internet but nothings seems to cover my particular problem.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting has not found any problems.</p>

            <p>Hello and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Chrome but there is no problem when I go through the browser the problem is the direct mail on my laptop which comes through Windows Live as I have always used gmail and prefer to to make gmail my messenger instead of Outlook. I have had no previous
 problems with this method.</p>
<p>Obviously the problem is not with gmail as I send and receive the mails on my phone the problem is on my laptop and Windows.</p>
<p>That is why I am posing the question here.</p>

            <p>It could be your firewall preventing connection, anti virus software's email scanner affecting/preventing connection.&nbsp;<br />
Solution is to make sure WLMail is listed as an allowed connection under the firewall or to turn off the email scanner/anti spam function of your AV software.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have removed Gmail account as suggested and had another error code when trying to restore it 0x8007054e so looked that up on this site and was advised to delete a hidden file called Comm, which I did and then re-configured Gmail account which was successfully
 restored but the same problem persists, the sent message goes into the outbox but won't leave there.
</p>
<p>I have removed the Outlook account just to make sure it is not blocking the the exit.</p>
<p>I really don't know what to do now.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Time Lady,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. &nbsp;If you read my reply below/above to the support engineer you will see I have made some progress but essentially am back with the same problem of the mails not leaving the outbox. &nbsp;I did post the full error message in my original message.</p>
<p>I have Bitdefender which has been no problem and really I am not an IT expert being 75 years old and just learning the ropes but I can follow instructions. I do not know how to do the things you suggest with the firewall but as it works for everything else,
 including the incoming mails, I cannot see how that can be the problem.</p>

<p>If so the email account will require an app specific password for it to work.</p>
<p>It is possible for receiving to work but sending not working if the problem is with a third-party software setting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>PROBLEM MYSTERIOUSLY SOLVED !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On opening my laptop mail this morning there was a box which said mails in my outbox did not have an account specified and should they be sent by default. So I clicked on yes and that was it.&nbsp; I have not seen this box message before and as I have only one
 account Gmail which is my default account as I deleted Outlook, I cannot understand why Windows Live has an outbox in my Gmail interface when Gmail itself does not have an outbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I am now so relieved the problem has resolved itself so I am thanking you both for the trouble and time you have taken to help me resolve it, I really appreciate your support.</p>

<h2>            System Restore won&#39;t work</h2>
                    System restore will not work. I recently upgraded with a special upgrade cd that I received because I purchased my VISTA computer two months prior to the release of Windows 7.&nbsp; Is there any way I can recover my system back to the original installation
 of Windows 7?

<p>Hi GodsPeach,</p>
<p>a. Why do you want to revert back to original installation?</p>
<p>b. What is the issue that you are facing?</p>
<p>c. What happens when you try to performa a System Restore?</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recover the system back to the original installation of Windows 7 you need to have
<strong>created a system image</strong> beforehand to use this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A system image is an exact copy of a drive. By default, a system image includes the drives required for Windows to run. It also includes Windows and your system settings, programs, and files. You can use a system image to restore the contents of your computer
 if your hard disk or computer ever stops working. When you restore your computer from a system image, it's a complete restoration—you can't choose individual items to restore, and all of your current programs, system settings, and files are replaced with the
 contents of the system image.</p>
<p>To know more about “System Image” visit the following link :</p>
<p><strong>What is a system image?<br />
<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-a-system-image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-a-system-image</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have the Upgrade DVD, you can perform a Custom Installation option from the Windows 7 DVD to install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A custom installation replaces your current version of Windows with Windows 7 but doesn't preserve your files, settings, and programs (it's often referred to as a clean installation for this reason). You can perform a custom installation using either the
 upgrade or full version of Windows 7.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you need to do:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to make sure your PC can run Windows 7. to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32- or 64-bit version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back up your files To avoid losing anything, you'll need to save copies of all the files, photos, and other information you want to keep on an external hard drive. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool you can use to copy your information (but not
 programs) off your PC and then put them back after you install Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Windows Easy Transfer does not support moving from a 64-bit version of Windows to a 32-bit version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the original installation disks for the programs currently on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the Windows 7 DVD and follow the instructions for a custom installation by selecting the Custom (advanced) installation option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinstall your programs and your backed-up files and settings. If you used Windows Easy Transfer, launch Windows Easy Transfer in Windows 7 (in the Start menu, click All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System Tools) and follow the instructions.</p>

                    <p>Okay I really need someones help!!</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>I'm not good at all on computers so I don't know the words for all of the things!!<strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer keeps looping between "A problem has accrued on this computer. It needs to restart. Restarts automatically. If you want more information, later search online:&nbsp;PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (iaStorAV.sys)" and then showing the HP loading screen
 and then looping endlessly until the battery runs out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded a ISO to a USB from Microsofts page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do next, putting in the USB doesn't change anything, I still can't access safe mode/boot option(I don't know what it's called). No options are available.

<p>We went into Gamestop last night and purchased the 4000 MS points to download the Season Pass so my son could play Nuketown Zombies. I redeemed the code and it said the download was complete (in about 15 seconds?). I tried to play Black OPs II to verify
 it downloaded and nothing was different. I went into BOII&gt;Multiplayer&gt;Store and it shows the Map Pack there and there is a check mark next to purchase but it wants me to download it again so I did that. It went from 1% to 99% and told me the download was 108KB
 and when it said it was completed, it only installed 56K. I deleted the download in my memory, cleared the cache and restarted the XBOX and attempted to download the mappack again. This time it went slower but again, only to about 19% and then shot to 99%
 and still only 56K installed. I've done this 4 times now. I've checked the privacy settings and they are 'ADULT'. I also downloaded Nuketown Zombies and Revolution and they installed without any problem but when I go into play 'ZOMBIES', it only pulls up 'GREEN
 RUN' on the burning globe, which I think is just the basic Zombie world, right? Shouldn't there be a few different selections on the globe? What happens if I delete Black OPs II COMPLETELY from memory, will that remove the Season Pass that I purchased? Please
 help. I have a very frustrated son who was really looking forward to playing this with his friends online. Also, I forgot to mention that we DO have an XBox live GOLD account. Thank you for any help that anyone can give us! :)</p>

<p>As UpliftKnight said, you should be able to now download the maps through the in-game store menu on Black Ops 2 with a cost of 0 MSP (As Battlefield 3 does). I would also like to add that choosing to download from the Marketplace in the Dashboard should
 be avoided for the most part, due to sometimes being charged for the item(s) again after already having purchased them via a pass. I do hope this helps and happy gaming!</p>

<p>I've tried that. "I went into BOII&gt;Multiplayer&gt;Store and it shows the Map Pack there and there is a check mark next to purchase but it wants me to download it again so I did that. It went from 1% to 99% and told me the download was 108KB and when it said

<p>It's not COMPLETELY downloading or installing from the in-game store but I appreciate your answers you guys. Thank you!</p>

<p>It sounds like corrupt data somewhere. Try re-seating your hdd or downloading the map to another storage device all together. Or try moving your saves to the cloud and deleting the black ops folder. It won't remove any of your licenses, those are recorded
 on xbox servers and tied to your account. Redownload the pass if you have to and then try again.</p>

    <title>Troubles with a virus&#47;false positive result on my hp laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Troubles with a virus&#47;false positive result on my hp laptop</h2>
                    I am having trouble with the following virus: Trojan:Win32/Anomaly.gen! A I'm not too sure if its a virus or not. When I try to get rid of it with Microsoft security essentials I get this error: Error code 0x800700df. The file size exceeds the limit allowed
 and cannot be saved. I looked for the download to fix this, but it said it wasn't available for my version of Windows 7 home. I get the virus in&nbsp; my d drive under the hp games, the same game. I'vee done a factory reset &amp; a clean disk restore but its still
 there. I can't tell if its a false positive result. I just can't get rid of it! Any help would be appreciated!!<br />
<br />
The specific loaction of the virus is: file:D:\preload\base.wim-&gt;(Image2876)\Program Files (x86)\HP Games\Plants vs. Zombies\Plants vs. Zombies-WT.exe-&gt;(EXEEmb)-&gt; (EXEEmb)-&gt; (EXEEmb)-&gt; (EXEEmb)-&gt; (EXEEmb)-&gt; (EXEEmb)-&gt; (EXEEmb)-&gt; (EXEEmb)
<br />
<br />
I've tried increasing the cache so that my windows essentials can get rid of the virus. I am thinking it may be a false positive result I can't get rid of, because someone else, just like me, had a major update in their windows, and they kept getting the same
 message for their wild tangent hp game. In frustration when windows yet again was trying to get rid of the virus I clicked on the x because I knew it wouldn't work, and now there is one instance of it allowed in my virus vault history, but it shows quarantined
 after that, but with that error message still. <br />
<br />
I want to leave things be until I know what to do. I don't want to screw things up unnecessarily!!<br />
<br />
Again, any help would be greatly appreciated. I've never had so much trouble with a virus, or deciding whether something was a virus or not<br />

<p>This sounds like a recurring task that someone scheduled to run on your computer at regular intervals. Have a look at the Task Scheduler for a possible culprit. If this means nothing to you then you can do this:</p>
<p>1. Click Start, then type the three letters cmd into the Search box and press Enter.<br />
2. Type this command and press Enter:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; schtasks /v /query &gt; "%UserProfile%\Desktop\schedule.txt"<br />
3. Open the file schedule.txt on your desktop<br />
4. Examine the list and/or copy and paste the text into your response.<br />

            Hello Carman, <br />
<br />
If you've recently updated your Windows 10, it's more likely that the issue is due to possible incompatibilities between Real Player and the Windows update.
<br />
<br />
This error message normally translates to Real Player system widget has crashed, which could be resolved by simply uninstalling your current Real Player and reinstalling the updated one.
<br />
<br />
To install the latest update of said application, you may refer to the software developer's website.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<h2>            Unidentified Network&#58; No internet access on wireless network</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <span>Unable to access internet through network</span></p>
<p>My laptop has recently started having problems of being unable to access the internet via the router, even though everyone else connected wirelessly has suffered no problems. When connected via wireless, the computer connects to the network, but also connects
 to an 'Unidentified Network'. If I try to disconnect from the unidentified network, I disconnect from both networks. Both have Local and Internet connection, but I can't access the internet while connected, though I can access the printer and other computers
 on the network. When connected via ethernet, however, the computer works fine, and can access the internet properly. When using Windows Diagnostic Manager, it gives me the message of 'Invalid IP settings', but resetting the wireless and generating new IP settings
 don't serve to solve the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 on Surface RT</h2>
                    <p>does anyone at Microsoft knows if Windows 10 will be compatible with surface RT, I read this morning on MSN that Microsoft reveal windows 10, but I wanted to know if&nbsp;surface RT and surface 2 will have an update to this new OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know is to soon to ask this type of question but please don't forget surface RT and surface 2 users, we are exciting about this incoming OS.</p>
<p>please make it available for us.</p>

            <p>Well, Windows 10 itself will be released on July 29th (on or after) for the regular PCs on the market to include Intel based tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the Windows 8 RT tablet line has been axed but Microsoft did mention that 'maybe' a few bits and pieces of Windows 10 will make it to the RT tablets but is unknown what.&nbsp; There is no promise that the RT tablets will get anything other than the usual
 updates and they will get those for several years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Surface RT and Surface Pro 3 and the Surface RT never had anything for it but is a usable tablet by itself and a few apps from the Store add a few features.&nbsp; It is a secure platform that you can rely on for online banking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RT version of Windows will continue, though but for the Raspberry PI 2 computer which will have Windows 10 RT available for it.&nbsp; So, the ARM based version of the system will actually continue but not in the Surface tablet line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface 3 (which is Intel based) replaces the Surface RT and Surface 2 as the low end tablet.&nbsp; It goes for about the same price as the RT tablets and can use the same keyboard.&nbsp; Plus, you can get the pen for it which is the same that is used for the
 Surface Pro 3 line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get more details on what is available for Surface tablets at Microsoft's online store at http://www.microsoft.com.</p>

    <title>NMIndexStoreSvr.exe, error stealing focus from other apps - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            NMIndexStoreSvr.exe, error stealing focus from other apps</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having problems with the above named service.&nbsp; The error report generator (WerFault.exe) keeps generating errors in the application log:</p>
<p>=====================================================</p>
<p>Faulting application name: NMIndexStoreSvr.exe, version: 2.0.16.0, time stamp: 0x46825db6<br />
Faulting module name: NMSearchPluginSimilarImages.dll, version: 2.0.16.0, time stamp: 0x46825c19<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br />
Fault offset: 0x00010dff<br />
Faulting process id: 0x5c4<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01cb39a7321d4207<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Ahead\Lib\NMIndexStoreSvr.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Ahead\Lib\NMSearchPluginSimilarImages.dll<br />
Report Id: 9489348f-a59a-11df-b9f5-463500000031</p>
<p>=================================================</p>
<p>This pulls the focus from whatever I have currently on screen, including full-screen games like WoW.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other day, it was happening every minute or so (and has happened several times since I started typing this...).&nbsp; Rebooting my computer seems to be the only fix.</p>
<p>Trouble is, the Indexing service is not running on my computer at all. I shut it off because it was too much of a resource drain and insisted on running while I was gaming.</p>
<p>I've seen articles on how to shut down WerFault.exe, but this seems like it is a more important part of windows and should remain running.&nbsp; Or should it?</p>
<p>Anyway, suggestions on how to solve this would be appreciated. It's getting to be annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>the NMIndexStoreSvr.exe is crashing. This exe is part of Nero Burning ROM. Which version do you use? Only Version 9 and 10 are Windows 7 compatible.</p>
