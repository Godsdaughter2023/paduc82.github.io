<h2>            Password Protect Folders for Access</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 10, I need to password protect several folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to give access to the folder(s) to particular people or users as these are commonly used work computers with no special log-in. Each employee needs to be able to access their own folder via their password or passcode.
</p>
<p>At my old job, we had this set up using an older version of windows and things were quite simple but I'm having issues with Windows 10. Any assistance?

            <p>
</p><blockquote>In short, we share one common account name.</blockquote>
<p>File sharing and folder access is normally managed by identifying users by their logon name &amp; password. Since you use a common account name, you cannot use this method. Not nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your current setup you need to use folder encryption. When you type this phrase into a Google search box then you will get several suggestions about the various methods:</p>
<p><em>folder encryption "Windows 10"</em></p>
<p>Since I have not used any of these methods I cannot tell you which is best. Suffice it to say that encryption is a dangerous tool. Lots of people have fallen into the trap of doing it with inadequate understanding of the technique, then losing the lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my second preferred method. The first method would be a file server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give everyone a personal account name &amp; secret password (=15 accounts!)<br />
</li><li>Create 15 accounts on each of the 15 machines. To speed things up I would script the process.</li><li>Grant full NTFS access to the "everyone" group for those folders that are public. Again this is scriptable.</li><li>Grant full NTFS access to specific individuals for thos folders that are restricted. Also scriptable.</li><li>Create the necessary shares on each of the 15 machines. Set the share access to "Full" for the "Everyone" group.</li></ul>
<p>This should keep you busy for about a day . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>A somewhat less messy method consists of using a workstation as a central file repository. Everyone stores his/her files on this machine. This would also facilitate the backup process.</p>

                    <p>When I entered my email information for my GoDaddy hosted IMAP accounts it insisted it couldn't find them. Sunday Mail was magically populated. I assume some updates took in the background.<br />

Now I am trying to add a second account and would like to see the account setting that it likes.

Anyone Know how/where to see them?</p>

    <title>My xbox repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scwb drysack  say:</h3>
<h2>            My xbox repair</h2>
                    
<p>Shipped my xbox to repair center Laredo, Texas after a couple weeks it is finished repairing and has been shipped back to me, however the tracking status said it has been picked up in&nbsp;ZAPOPAN, JA&nbsp;MX or&nbsp;<span>GUADALAJARA, MX which both i believe are not Laredo,
 Texas. My question here is why is my xbox in Mexico? was my xbox shipped from Laredo to Guadalajara to be fixed using cheap labor? or was it just routed to guadalajara prior to being shipped back home? i have looked into this and so far i have seen several
 of both answers trying to get down to the bottom of this and trying to decide whether to call xbox or fedex.</span></p>

<p>yes, however, your return address on the xbox could have been altered. unless they're sending you a new console instead of your old one, which might be the case if it's severely broken and they don't have any used refurbished ones in stock. they do manufacture
 them in mexico, btw so that might explain the reason why the current address on tracking shows a mexican address</p>

<p>Mine was sent to Laredo, and Laredo is a place where packages are cross-docked to Mexico. It is now on it's way from Zapopan as well. Looks like Microsoft need cheap labor. "They turk er jerbs!"</p>

<p>The customer service center is in Laredo. The actual repair center is in Mexico.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Cheaper to have them fixed in Mexico. And it is cheaper on the shipping if sent to and from the US. SO you send it to laredo, they fill up a truck, take it to the repair center, pick it back up, and ship it back out from Laredo.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Internatinal shipping through UPS can get expensive. Even US to Mexico will be double the shipping cost than US to US delivery.</p>

            <p>Hello Fardin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the reason of refreshing Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot and then try to refresh Windows.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>

    <title>remove software licensing notification windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joebob32321  say:</h3>
<h2>            remove software licensing notification windows 7</h2>
                    The popup is "titled software licensing" and comes up when i enter the control panel or any other windows program. It also states, "This computer is not running genuine window, To use this feature without interruption, this computer needs to be running
 genuine Windows. With genuine Windows you have access to all Windows updates and can be confident that your Windows software has the latest security and reliability enhancements from Microsoft."<br />
<br />
First let me start by saying my copy of windows is genuine. I bought this laptop brand new and I have the windows 7 home sticker on the bottom. Secondly let me point out that I have advanced A+, Cisco and programming skills. Now, I have disabled all annoying
 windows services and security threats that open ports on my computer; including windows updates and windows genuine software checker, remote access, fax services etc. I have almost rid my computer of all your annoying bloatware and cut your servers access
 to my computer entirely. <br />
<br />
That is, with the exception of this notification and one in my task bar called "solve PC issues: 1 important message".<br />
<br />
I thought I tracked the source of the annoying popups down to a dll file and after painstakingly getting the permissions to change system files; I changed the name of it to no avail. Please just point me to a registry file to delete/edit; or the executable
 that I can delete. After owning a computer store for years, I am not calling to verify my copy; nor am i turning your genuine "we don't trust you" program back on so your servers can probe and open up ports for hackers to access. Nor am I downloading anything.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, please stop annoying honest customers and tell me the source of the executable; I don't want to waste any more hours of my life removing bloatware. Also don't feed me, "automatic updates protects your computer" tech garbage that the average
 customer eats up. That may be true for the average Joe; but any advanced user knows it only opens vulnerabilities in the network.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

<div><br />
<div>
<p>
<span><u>To properly analyze and solve problems with Activation and Validation</u>, we need to see a full copy of the diagnostic report produced by the MGADiag tool (download and save
 to desktop - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )</span></p>

<p>
<span>Click on the Continue button, after a short time, the Continue button will change to a Copy button.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your post. (please do not edit the report.)</span></p>

            I did not sign any agreement with Microsoft. The lawyers can jump off a bridge, or try to sue me. I have a legal copy of Windows, what aspects of there software i choose to use is not their business. They have no legal right to say how I use my laptop
 or what I have on my hard-drive so long as they get their money. If Microsoft didn't have a monopoly on software distribution; I would use Linux. The truth is, it takes less time to get rid of Microsoft's bloatware usually than trying to get every piece of
 software I use to work properly on Linux.<br />
<br />
The raid driver is not the issue here. Jessen, good sir; the problem is with the genuine software service that I disabled. It is no longer able to verify my copy of windows periodically with Microsoft's Servers. There is an executable somewhere that attempts
 to connect with Microsoft, then when it fails; it gives popups. WgaTray.exe was the name of it in windows XP, What is the name of it now so I can DELETE it?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

            I do not need some probe tool to copy report files that I know how to access from the control panel. I told you the problem, and I know the solution: it is to delete the file giving the popups. I do not want a round-about way of temporarily delaying the
 popups. I want to end them at the source, forever. I think it is a dll in system32 but there might be a registry key I can modify. I am tired of searching. There is no Microsoft training program that tells you how to resolve my solution. Please refer me to
 a programer that knows Windows 7 system files by heart that can tell me which file to rename and the name of the system file checker to modify so I don't blue screen at start up.<br />
<br />
PS I disabled the service that keeps event logs on my computer so that tool you want me to download is useless.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

            As georg1009 suggest...we need to see the results of the MGDiag tool to see what might be causing you the issue. It's not a probe tool that will put your personal information out there for the world to see.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note...*THIS* is not Microsoft...just individuals like yourself that have varied skill sets and volunteer their time to try and help people. This forum is filled with people from around the world that are trying to help other people that are
 having issues. If you are looking for help..there are some of the smartest people I've seen on here.<br />

            simply put there is no file for you to delete. if there were it would be published all over the pirate sites. Microsoft does not make it easy to steal their software.
<div><br />
<div>all your wounds would seem self inflicted. if you are unwilling to accept assistance, there is nothing anyone can do for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>you already know windows needs periodic validation, especially to use the free Microsoft software. If you are unwilling to comply with the end user license agreements simply stop using the software.</div>

Like i have said before... my error is because I have windows update disabled. Error: 0x80070422 Of course it is giving that error. I do not want windows updates; they are annoying, slow down your computer, make start up longer, and create vulnerabilities.
 I used to be an adamant updater until I discovered a Windows XP update that actually slowed down the boot hard-drive read/write speed around the time Vista was launched (I had the exact HD for a data drive that had ten times the read/write). It was not a sudden
 change either, even after reformat it was slowed until i installed new and stopped doing updates. Rather than making a perfect product that doesn't need updates and selling services instead, Microsoft wastes trillions of man hours of consumers and their employees
 to inconvenience society and ultimately slow the progress of mankind. I would much rather be writing in my scientific journal than wasting time on this.<br />

            looks to me like you have disabled the software protection service. if so enable it and post a new report.

            <p>Disabling Windows Updates doesn't cause that error.</p>
<p>There is a problem with your Software Protection Service - something is preventing it from starting on demand the way it should.</p>
<p>Please use the following in an attempt to isolate the cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on Start</p>
<p>in the Search box, type
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">SERVICES.MSC</span></p>
<p>and hit the Enter key - accept the UAC prompt if you get one.</p>
<p>Look in the console for the Software Protection service, right-click on it and select Properties.</p>
<p>make sure that the Startup Type is set to Automatic (Delayed Start), and click Apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try starting the service now - do you get an error message? Does it start? does it almost immediately stop again?</p>
<p>Post back with your results, and a new MGADiag report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't start, then please do the following...</p>
<p>Please open an Elevated (Administrator) Command Prompt window and use the following commands....</p>

            Hi Mohamed.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Fixes for Kindle in Windows 10 here:
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/amazon-kindle-not-working-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/amazon-kindle-no...</a>
<br />
<br />1) Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />2)  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />3) If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />4) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then you can roll it in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t windows support rar files yet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonymcdevitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t windows support rar files yet&#63;</h2>
                    I mean seriously, why does windows still lack support for this basic compression format? Rar has been around for 25 years. I've been actively using .rars for at least the last 5-8 years. So is there any real reason that windows lacks this ability?

            Thanks, that is kind of what I figured. But why doesn't microsoft (lol,windows on-screen keyboard does not predict microsoft) just pay it? I doubt it could really be that expensive. They already pay for cd and dvd use, and rar files are becoming very common
 these days.<br />

<h2>            Problem using Win7 USB&#47;DVD  download tool &#40;concerning bootsect.exe&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, I am a student, (at the Florida Institute of Technology). &nbsp;And I used digital river to buy a version of win7 professional for my laptop.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now the laptop i am currently using is xp 32bit. &nbsp;I got it right when vista was coming out and it was supposed to work with vista, but the reviews were so bad that i never used it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So now i want to install 64bit win7, and i use the tool (and read the help) but I cannot get the correct version of bootsect.exe, so that I can create a valid bootable USB on this computer, so that I can format and install win7 64bit on this same computer.</div>

                </div>

<p>Hi nkarl2009,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>a. Do you get any error message whatsoever?</p>
<p>To make the USB device bootable, you need to run a tool named bootsect.exe. In some cases, this tool needs to be downloaded from your Microsoft Store account. This many happen if you're trying to create a 64-bit bootable USB device from a 32-bit version
 of Windows. To download bootsect:</p>
<p>1. Login to <a href="https://store.microsoft.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">your Microsoft Store account</a> to view your purchase history<br />
2. Look for your Windows 7 purchase<br />
3. Next to Windows 7, there is an "Additional download options" dropdown<br />
4. In the dropdown, select the "32-bit ISO" option<br />
5. Right-click the link and save the bootsect.exe file to the location where you installed the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (e.g. C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Apps\Windows 7 USB DVD Download Tool)<br />
6. Once the file has been saved, go back to the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download tool to create your bootable USB device</p>
<p>To install 64-bit of Windows 7 on your computer it is essential that your computer supports 64-bit computing.</p>
<p>The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU), handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than the 32-bit version.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to find out if your PC is running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows and what edition of Windows is on your PC:</p>
<p>Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.</p>
<p>• If "x64 Edition" is listed under System, you’re running the 64-bit version of Windows XP.<br />
• If you don’t see "x64 Edition" listed under System, you’re running the 32-bit version of Windows XP.</p>
<p>The edition of Windows XP you're running is displayed under System near the top of the window.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for more information on frequently asked questions about 32-bit and 64-bit Windows:</p>

            I've got the EXACT same problem (bought my win 7 64 bit ed. from digitial river), but your solution won't work for me! I don't have a "microsoft store account" because I purchased the ISO image from digital river, and the never provided me with an account
 number (or the bootsect file I need).<br />
<br />
Any other solutions?

            As many have mentioned before me, people who obtained a 64 bit copy of Win7 through Digital River cannot access the specified version of bootsect.exe to successfully create a boot USB for the 64 bit Windows 7 on a 32 bit computer. I too request you to
 look into this and contact us with a viable solution for us as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
I think I can make a bootable USB if I can get hold of someone's 64 bit computer, and create the boot USB on their system. But right now I do not know anyone with such a system, so please look into the matter.

            Same issue; Running 32 bit XP Pro&nbsp;downloaded the Student Win7 64 Upgrade ISO from Digital River. Downloaded the Windows7 USB DVD Download Tool and tried to install on a blank formatted 8 GB USB drive&nbsp; Works fine&nbsp;&nbsp;ALMOST..&nbsp;but get the error that need the
 bootsect.exe<br />
After researching this it appears this has been going on far too long. If they have a solution it should be posted, if they do not then they should say flat out that what we are attempting to do is not possible. I would have then purchased their DVD! In my
 case I have a DVD drive I can use.

                    when I open a site and then go to a link, how do I keep the link up sometimes it goes back to the taskbar area? when I click it I can bring it back up on the screen but it won`t stay there. I have asked some of my friends and they are having the same problem.
 What can we do?

            <div>Hello,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10. I would like to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to assist you better, kindly provide us few more details on the below questions.</p>
<div>a) Since how long have you been facing the issue?</div>
<div>b) Do you remember any changes happening to your machine prior to the issue?</div>
<div>c) Does the issue occur when a particular website is opened?</div>
<div>d) Does the issue occur in Safe Mode with Networking?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Boot your machine in <strong>Safe Mode With Networking </strong>and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Access the below link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span>1. Press the Windows + R keys to open the Run dialog, type msconfig, and click/tap on OK.</span></p>
<p><span>2. If prompted by UAC, click/tap on Yes.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click/tap on the Boot tab in System Configuration</span></p>
<p><span>4. Under Boot options, check Safe boot and select (dot) Network, click/tap on OK</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(93, 93, 93, 1)">5. Click/tap on
<strong>Restart</strong> to apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(93, 93, 93, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<strong>Safe boot</strong> under <strong>Boot options</strong> after performing the troubleshooting steps</span>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before you boot your computer in Safe Mode With Networking, you may want to follow the Methods given below.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1 :</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Run a scan to check if any virus is causing the issue from your anti-virus software.</div>
<div>Or run an online scan using the link : <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<div>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2 : Add-ons</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although browser add-ons can enhance your online experience, they can occasionally interfere or conflict with other software on your computer. Try starting Internet Explorer without add-ons to see whether the problem is resolved. Follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, then click Internet Explorer .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons) . Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Try to view the Web page again to see whether it works correctly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If disabling all add-ons resolves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will let you determine which add-on is causing the problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, then click Internet Explorer .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click Tools , and then click Internet Options .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click the Programs tab, and then click Manage add-ons .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click an add-on in the Name list, and then click Disable .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Try to view the Web page again to see whether it works correctly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. If the Web page works correctly, you know that the add-on caused the problem. If you still cannot view the Web page, the add-on did not cause the problem, and you can enable it again.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3 : Optimize IE(Internet Explorer)</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also you may <strong>Optimize Internet Explorer</strong> and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps in the given link to optimize IE.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the same link, reset IE settings as well.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</p>

<p>I'm still not able to complete the&nbsp;Windows Anniversary Update. I did in fact download again and got the same error. I believe the answers provided addressed moving from 8 to 10 where the user has the option to keep files only. That option is not supported
 in the update to 1607 from an earlier version of Windows (1511). I am considering wiping the machine as if I was going to sell the laptop. That should get rid of any applications that may be preventing the upgrade. I don't really want to do that, but I will
 if that's what it takes to move beyond 1511.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Sorry, Vipresh. I had hoped for another suggestion. I guess I will end up resetting the machine to remove all my account data, then try it again. Probably will do that later in the week.</p>

            <p>I also get this error, but as a consequence of manually resetting the machine as it is at 93% on the 'SECOND_BOOT phase'. After an hour and a half on a high end rig, using a SATA3 SSD drive, with little disk activity I am guessing that the installation had
 hanged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried first using windows update, then used the media creation tool, which I re downloaded to be sure. I also removed any unnecessary USB devices and other drives to be sure extraneous hardware was not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist. I would rather not rebuild.</p>

            <p>I finally gave up hope that anyone would have an answer that would permit me install the update without wiping the machine. I downloaded the iso and installed it on a bootable USB. I changed the boot order so it would boot, then when it asked if I wanted
 to save my files or do a clean install, I chose the latter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install was successful and it saves your old OS with all your data in a directory called something like Windows.old, so you don't have to go into your backups to recover your data; just move them into their proper place. On the other hand, you do have
 to reinstall and set up all applications, including IDEs and databases. Just glad to be moving ahead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a pain. Wish there had been better diagnostics. Be sure to have your licenses and of course, good backups.</p>

            I went through the Microsoft chatline twice, allowing MS techie to remotely control my ageing 2010 AMD PC. &nbsp;Techie did the usual troubleshooting and reloading but all failed at Second Boot stage, though drivers all updated as far as my driver update software
 could see. &nbsp;Win 10 reverted to build 1511 and update to 1607 failed. &nbsp;Next night we tried again and this time the techie showed that my motherboard drivers, originally for Win 7, worked for first update to Win 10 1511 but weren't up to the 1607 install. &nbsp;However,
 the Anniversary update compatibility check wasn't picking this up, it just saw that Win 10 1511 was working ok. &nbsp;Then the problem was how to stop automatic update repeatedly trying to get me up to 1607 build when the mobo drivers weren't compatible. &nbsp;Finally,
 techie admitted I would have to replace the motherboard etc and install 1607 using an ISO he was happy to offer me. &nbsp;I went back to the HP website and confirmed that no new drivers were avail

<h2>            To Play This The Owner Needs To Sign In</h2>
                    <p>The game i'm trying to play is rainbow six siege i have the disc and i'm signed in but it still gives me that message.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what could have caused this i did everything i could think of. hard reset, removing my account and signing back in, turning my router off and on,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think my xbox is glitched out while rainbow sic siege was in the xbox i opened up overwatch and it actually started and i don't own the digital version i own the disc for overwatch so the game started without the disc inside my xbox.</p>
<p>I need help on getting my game started before the next season starts so I will list everything i've done&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. hard reset&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. checked disc for scratches or marks. its clean and no scratches</p>
<p>3. gave it a full day to let it solve itself didn't work&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. reset router</p>
<p>5. went into settings to set my xbox to "home" but it was a;ready on that setting</p>
<p>does anybody have some suggestions?</p>

<p>Even if you checked for scratches and marks, when my console happens to not read a disc, even if it seems in perfect condition, I found that the following steps worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, even if you already hard resetted your console, please turn the console on, eject your Rainbow Six Disc, and then hold the power button for 10 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you'll be doing some cleaning on the disc anyways, your console can do a reboot in that time. So after you held the console's power button for 10 seconds, turn the console back on, and confirm that the console shows a green bootup screen.</p>
<p>While the console is booting up, take your disc to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apply a small drop of mild dishwasher soap to the silver side of the disc, and with wet fingers "massage" the soap around the silver side in a spiraling motion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the silver side is completely covered in soap, make sure you hold the disc only in the center hole and on the edge now. Then, rinse the disc under running water and shake the disc several times to get the water off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wipe the remaining water drops with a soft, lint-free cloth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you return to your console, it should have finished booting and be on the Home Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insert the cleaned disc, and check that the console shows the game tile with a disc icon in the corner of the game tile below the main tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the console shows the game with the disc icon, try launching the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the console still doesn't show the game tile with a disc icon, check if other discs work on the console. If no disc works, your disc drive might be defective, and the console needs to be serviced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also you didnt mention in your post but you need to make sure the disc is in the tray to play the game if it is then the disc reader is not reading the disc for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the only disc that this is happening with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it is happening with other discs then you would need to set up a repair for your console.</p>

<p>I think it looks far better and like the one you linked to, is only a case. However, inside a case you can put whatever HDD you want. Say a 2.5'' SSD.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Expansion-Desktop-External-STBV4000100/dp/B00BFFQN3M/ref=sr_1_2?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448319043&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=seagate+4tb+hd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.amazon.com/.../ref=sr_1_2</a></p>
<p>In fact, stuff that. I own the one above and it's great. &nbsp;It's also the same one Major Nelson uses but Western Digital make better external HD's (according to my buddies who work in IT) &nbsp;so get this one instead:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Desktop-External-Drive-WDBFJK0040HBK-NESN/dp/B00E3RH61W/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448319100&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=western+digital+4tb+hd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.amazon.com/.../ref=sr_1_3</a></p>
<p>You don't need a gimmick. &nbsp;You need an external Hard Drive.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Skype for Business Calendar Delegate - Assigning permissions WITHIN Office 365</h2>

<p>
</p><p>In Office 365 (I have to do this within O365, not in Skype for Business client or Lync client), where do I click to assign Skype for Business delegate permissions to my assistant, so that she can create Skype for Business meetings for me in Office 365?</p>

            <p>Hi Cathy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You just need to assign the outlook calendar editor permission to the delegate (assistant) in your
<strong>Outlook client</strong> via clicking <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Delegate Access </strong>&gt; <strong>Add</strong> &gt; Find and add the assistant account to be the delegate &gt;
<strong>Calendar</strong> &gt; <strong>Editor</strong>. </p>

<h2>            Windows is not accepting valid cd key after latest update</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently installed a fresh copy of Win 10 Pro on my new computer, the install went fine and accepted the cd key from my USB retail copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So essentially the base version was activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then did the microsoft updates over night to the "latest version". This morning after setting itself up it is asking me to activate my copy of windows as the key used is not a valid key. When clicking troubleshoot, it says I am not connected to the internet,
 which is ridiculous as I am typing on this forum USING the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code I am getting is 0xC004C003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "change cd key" the error code is 0x803FA067.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating, I have a legitimate copy and its treating me like a pirate : /</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My installation was a fresh windows 10 pro install from a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update was from the windows automatic update service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still having issues where it is telling me my key is not valid. I phoned into support and tried activating over the phone, but the gentlemans scripted responses were not helpful. He just told me my product has been activated too many times and I need
 more activation tries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However my box was sealed and the only one trying to activate it is me...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried slmgr -spk (then the code) in command prompt and it said key successfully added. But then when it comes to activation, it says it cant activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really dont want to purchase ANOTHER copy but it is looking like I have to, or suffer the Activate Windows watermark forever.</p>

<h2>            I have suddenly, and with no explanation, lost my sound. Again.</h2>
                    
<p>A while ago (quite a while after upgrading to Windows 7, so I don't suspect that to have anything to do with my problem), my computer stopped playing sound. Additionally, when I try to open any audio file in Windows Media, it says it "encountered a problem
 while trying to play the file." Also, when I try to test the sound I get the "failed to play test tone" error. I got around this by doing a system restore and that solved it for a while, but it's doing it again and the system restore didn't fix anything this
 time.</p>
<p>I have tried absolutely EVERY solution to this problem that I have found and NONE have worked. I'm using RealTek High Definition Audio. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, and updated the drivers a thousand times, no effect. I have tried every combination of
 settings, including disabling sound effects. The only other solution I found that I haven't tried is messing with the registry, which due to inexperience, I would rather avoid doing.</p>
<p>From what I've found, Windows drivers have some problem working with RealTek's, and this has been going on for a couple of years now. Why isn't there a patch to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Check Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) as you boot - usually F2 so watch screen as you boot - make<br />
sure on-board sound is enabled&nbsp;(if&nbsp;system uses on-board).<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;a PC with a separate sound card make sure that it is seated properly. <br />
<br />
For PC's you can use a separate sound card and for PC's and Laptops you can use a USB sound<br />
card. Neither of those are expensive.</p>

<h3> fewones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered. followed by a CLSID Error Which crashes almost every game that i play longer than 10-20 minutes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am really lost right now to the point where I have to start RMAing things which I really don't want to do cause I feel like this can be fixed. down to the point I reinstalled windows 10 about 5 days ago and to clean out my PC again which I usually do every
 half a year and everything was fine till I did so. now when ever I start playing a game that requires any kind of GPU power It crashes after 10-20 minutes. games like league of legends seem to be working fine but rainbow 6 siege crashes 100% of the times and
 never the same, just at random moments even in the menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I go to event viewer it shows me the same Warning followed by the same error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st: Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered.</p>

&nbsp;to the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM SID (S-1-5-18) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to mess around with TDR settings and authorizations for the CLSID but keeps coming back to the same error. the drives have crashed. I've reinstalled drives multiple times, reinstalled windows 3 times by now, down clocked, stress tested(
 no faults ) ETC..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that your GPU is encountering driver incompatibility issues or some hardware issues. We would like to help you, but the best option here is contacting
<strong>Nvidia's support.</strong> If your GPU still has warranty, we recommend taking it to the store where you've purchased it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have questions, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Can you watch movies on your android phone or is it pointless to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silentsoulstorm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you watch movies on your android phone or is it pointless to purchase them when your only choice to watch it is on the One or 360 &#63;</h2>
                    I own more then 20 movies from the store and want to watch them on my phone at work while it is slow but it only let me watch the trailers is there something I am missing because doing a search only shows that you can use your phone to control the movies
 on the One but says nothing about being able to watch them on the phone.

            All you need to do is connect your Microsoft account Movies Anywhere then you can watch your movies through Google Play, iTunes, Prime Video, FandangNow and Vudu. So which ever you prefer will work.

    <title>Touchpad problems after windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acyztd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad problems after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated to windows ten and I've been having issues with the touchpad. First off, the mouse icon moved before logging in, but then stopped after logging in. I then clicked enable device for the Elan touchpad. This let the mouse icon move but wouldn't
 let me click anything. So I then rolled back the driver. I can now click but I cannot scroll with the touchpad anymore. This has all been very frustrating, could you let me know if I have to do anything to get full functionality back? I have an Asus F550L.
 Thanks</p>

<p>I have Asus 64bit Q551L Core 7 touchscreen and upgraded yesterday to WIN10.&nbsp; Following this upgrade my touchpad didn't work either.&nbsp; I found the damned thing disabled.&nbsp; Turning it back on made the cursor work but not the buttons.&nbsp; With a bit of research
 (I'm no geek!) I decided to open Device Manager with WIndows key + X and found the mouse device and kicked it out also checking delete driver after uninstall checkbox.&nbsp; It's been 2 or 3 cold boots later and the pad and its buttons are still working.&nbsp; I hope
 this helps!&nbsp; It came back in as an Elan pointing device, for those who are way more geekish than myself.&nbsp; Personally I don't care what it calls itself as long as it works because this is my primary writing machine and I hate downgrading to my spare laptop
 or worse yet, the Power Book Macintosh!&nbsp; Good luck guys!<br />

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes! You can definitely include the audio of the friends in your party chat. When you're recording your game open the Xbox guide and scroll to the Broadcast and Capture tab and there should be a box you can check off that says "Include party audio" or something
 along those lies but the option is there when you select Set up your broadcast.</p>
