<h2>            Surface orientation lock button &#40;software&#41; issue</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I faced this issue recently, and to solve the issue I had refresh the device. But I still feel I should notify this. And So far I am not able to re-generate it but i think its quite possible.<br />
<br />
These are the steps I carried which causes issue.<br />
<br />
1) Open kindle app, open a book to read.<br />
2) Change tablet orientation to portrait and lock it.<br />
3) Try swapping few pages backward or forward.<br />
4) This step is tricky or I can't recall how did I let it happen. Wait for surface to go dark (sleep) due to inactivity or simply close your touch cover.<br />
5) Next time when you open, open in landscape mode directly.<br />
6) For me surface switched even if I locked it in Step 2. Still good. If you switch to portrait it will switch back.<br />
7) But then you will realize that the unlock button is disabled forever.<br />
8) You will be able to switch from portrait to landscape and landscape to portrait but won't be able to lock it as the button shows its locked and grayed.<br />
9) Even if you restart the surface it will still behave that way. I tried several ways to unlock and make it working but nothing worked. After refreshed solved the problem. After this I haven't tried it yet as I do not want to refresh the surface again. I am
 just ensuring I remain in landscape mode while letting it sleep.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if anyone has faced this issue and how we can correct this without refresh.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Hello&nbsp;mk_23,
<div><br />
<div>As you stated, this is normal&nbsp;behavior, if the touch/type Cover is attached it will automatically allow the screen to auto rotate, however if you remove the cover or fold it behind the screen then it will allow you to lock the screen orientation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Documents and Settings - Start Menu in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Documents and Settings - Start Menu in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I am the sole user of my computer, and it's owner. When I installed Windows 7, I found that I cannot access my start menu folder, neither my "Documents and Settings"; folder. All attempts to give myself permission fail. The inane software has a nonentity
 called "SYSTEM"; as my computer owner. I emptied the drive, re-installed Windows 7, then named my computer "SYSTEM" (wouldn't let me use the name as a user, of course). Still no joy. Is this the best I can expect from this OS, or is there a way I can access&nbsp;my
 own computer software. I like, for example, to re-organise my program menu and to check my documents and settings for unused residue from old programs. Do I need to throw this Windows 7 away, or is there a way to make it accessible?</p>
<p>Thank-you for your kind answer, Lead3. I cannot get this forum to work properly, so I have to use this "edit" of my original question to respond. You said: "Documents and Settings and Start Menu are not real folders. They are called Junctions and are there
 so that legacy software can interface with Windows 7's folder structure.</p>
<p>Windows 7 uses C:\Users\*your user name*\</p>
<p>and C:\Users\*your user name*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu</p>
<p>AppData is a hidden folder."</p>
<p>Lead 3, this is not true of my Windows 7 Ultimate. There are those locations, true, but there is no access to them.</p>
<p>First, I used other software to get into the Documents and Settings, and there is quite a lot in there, including the Temporary Internet Files, etc.</p>
<p>Second, I used XP on another disk level to access my Start Menu in Windows 7, and it is located at ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows/StartMenu&nbsp; on the drive where I installed Windows 7.</p>
<p>I am curious why I see many people "claim" that the inaccessible (without third-party software) folders are not really folders. Perhaps that is generated by Microsoft to deter people? More and more, over time, Microsoft has removed access to their software
 from their customers. I still find, for example, that the Windows 98 startup software is the most useful for both recovery and installation of hard drives.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Lead 3, it's good to meet you. I know your help is of good intent, and most likely quite spot-on for some other versions of Windows 7. Good on ya, mate!</p>

            There's no such thing as a "Documents and Settings" folder. &nbsp;It's only there as a re-direct. &nbsp;If a program is hard-coded to look or save in something under "Documents and Settings", that program would crash on Windows Vista or 7 because that folder doesn't
 exist. &nbsp;To fake a little bit of compatibility with these badly made programs, this re-direct tricks them into saving/looking into the Users folder instead. &nbsp;<b>Since it's not really a folder, you can't access it. &nbsp;No one can. Not even the super mega awesome
 plus administrator. &nbsp;</b>When you "use your software to get into" documents and settings, the software is seeing the Users folder. &nbsp;It's being redirected. &nbsp;The way it was designed to work.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>You will break your computer&nbsp;irreparably&nbsp;if you try, and you'll have to reinstall your system to regain proper function. &nbsp;<b>Please quit trying to hack it.</b> &nbsp;You shouldn't even
<i>see that folder</i>&nbsp;unless you're already doing some advanced things. &nbsp;Usually folks that go turn on hidden/system file display already know about what they should and shouldn't be hacking at.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After you've thoroughly broken the functionality by mucking around, you'll come back and complain about how much Windows sucks. &nbsp;If you had just used your computer instead of trying to hack a folder that doesn't even exist, you'd be so much happier
<i>and</i>&nbsp;have a working computer.</div>

<h2>            I can&#39;t see a server on my Windows 7 machine</h2>
                    I'm running a Lenovo laptop and am running a server (in fact, tried multiple servers on ports 80 and 8000). While I can access 192.168.1.100:8000 locally, I cannot access a server from another computer when both are behind the same router. I tried disabling
 the firewall and enabling inbound connections; additionally, other computers on the network can be accessed and pinged.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there some secret firewall I might be missing? I've just about given up on this issue, and it seems to occur in both Lenovo laptops. We're running as Standard User, if that makes a difference at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried everything in this list:</div>
<div><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/26564/how-to-check-if-a-port-is-blocked-on-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://serverfault.com/questions/26564/how-to-check-if-a-port-is-blocked-on-windows</a></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>netstat -a -n shows that we're listening on 8000</li><li>netsh firewall show state shows that we've turned the firewall off, though I also tried with it on</li><li>logging the firewall doesn't even show the TCP connection on 8000. It shows incoming
<b>UDP</b>&nbsp;connections from other computers, so clearly it's blocking <b>something</b>, but even when I make a specific rule blocking 8000, I don't see the block being logged at all!</li></ul>

<h2>            Unfairly targeted by Microsoft Terminators</h2>
                    <p>Hello boys and girls this is me silverfox and I sure do have a bone to pick with the people who decided to take away my services that I paid for. &nbsp;See this all started yesterday night between 9-10pm eastern time. &nbsp;I got invited to a friends party like i
 always do normally theres no one to play with when i get out of work so people invite me instead of the other way around. &nbsp;Any whos the game of choice is no other then PUBG. &nbsp;The rumble in the jungle no holds bar every one for themselves and just like in real
 life there is no respawns. &nbsp;The greatest game every devised! &nbsp;Its me and the boys taking a stroll through the woods and decimenting anyone who comes in our way. &nbsp;Anyways PUBG is the reason why i bought an xbox to begin with and their services.
</p>
<p>Ive been very loyal to microsoft and pubg. &nbsp;Its the only game and gaming system that i have ever used in all of 2018 and you know what its been a real fun ride. &nbsp;2018 was awesome and i truly thank microsoft for the fun. &nbsp;But i guess all good things must
 come to an end right? &nbsp;Before the party was setup i met a real cool dude lets say his name is Gandolf (Not His Real Gamer Tag). &nbsp;I know its corny. &nbsp;During a game of PUBG. &nbsp;We hit it off things went well and when i got the invite from my other friend he basically
 said “Hey bro are you down for some 8 man squads in Pubs man? &nbsp;“. Dude sounded striaght up like cheech and chong. &nbsp;I say sure lets do it let me get my other friend in the other chat and we will work together. &nbsp;So i went all excitedly to get my friend all giddy
 and such like a cute little Disney character breaking into song. So i told gandolf wr are ready to play and hes like cool lets do it. &nbsp;So at first me and gandy went to thr orginal pub not the pts. &nbsp;So i try to get back into my friends party and i relalized
 i couldnt. &nbsp;I found this particully odd and highly disturbing. &nbsp;But i didnt fret. let me keep trying to message him i thought. The lobby was quickly filling up and im begining to Panic that i wasnt going to be part of the greatest group in that lobby. &nbsp; Sadly
 I wasnt. me and gandy was pretty much alone in the game with the randos who came to our side AKA random players. &nbsp;Im not gonna lie i did voice my displeasure at the whole situation cause i knew my squad was good really good and now im on the otherside ready
 to go with a disorganized 4 man team who never played together vs a well oiled killing machine of highly disciplined 8man team. &nbsp;But all in all we lost.. &nbsp;what did you expect a different out come? &nbsp;But me and gandy did take out a member of my elite squad before
 our fate was sealed. &nbsp;The game turned out like any other game no fighting no cursing everybody had fun. &nbsp;At that point me and the team said our goodbyes. &nbsp;I asked gandy if he was up for another round. &nbsp;He said he couldnt cause ue has to go eat dinner. &nbsp;He
 said hell be back on after. &nbsp;Thats the last i saw of gandy or myfriends cause microsoft “enforcment”. Skynet terminator decided for whatever reason to suspend my account for no reason and with out reason just a very vague statement of why my account is suspended
 making me feel like i dealt the largest coke deal of all time. &nbsp;All joking aside this never &nbsp;eeevvvvvveeeer in my whole gaming career between xbox and soney. &nbsp;But after getting out of the party with my buds to realize that i have been suspended even if it
 was only temporary is unexcusable. &nbsp;I work most of the week today is my last day off. I wanted to actually sit down play some pubg and relax. &nbsp;Instead im calling game stop to take my Xbox back and getting refunds for the money i spent on games and xbox live.
 &nbsp;Whats worse is microsoft wont help me. &nbsp;Pubg is A tacticle team based game where you need constant communication. &nbsp;Take away someones ability to talk then you are useless to the game and you might as well not bother. &nbsp;This is not why i spent. Hundreds of
 dollers of RIG headphones!!! &nbsp;By the time my suspensions over ill be at work. &nbsp;Thanks microsoft&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Silver,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the suspension. As others mentioned you can go to the
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enforcement site</a> for what happened and to file a case review. Also note that some bans don't happen immediately. For example the suspension you received could of been from last week
 as the enforcement team does investigate reports. Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

    <title>Unable to launch installed games on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to launch  installed games on windows 10</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title: Downloaded Programs Will Not Launch </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to preface this by saying I am new to Windows 10, though I have used 7 and 8 extensively. Recently, I got a new computer with Windows 10 Pro installed on it. I, excitedly, downloaded a few programs for my gaming habit (League of Legends, Curse, etc.),
 and went about getting them loaded and installed onto the machine. However, when I went to run the League Launcher (or Curse, or really anything that wasn't on the computer to start), an..interesting thing happened. Namely, nothing. The startup window opened
 and closed itself like it sometimes does, and then...nothing. I checked Task Manager, and it said the patcher and its sister processes were up and running, but the main program didn't launch. Curious. I tried opening it again, and I watched the processes start
 up in the Task Manager view, but then, as quickly as they started, they closed themselves. I tried it with another program; Curse, this time. Same issue. I tried running either program as Admin (Though that seems redundant, as I was on an Administrator account),
 and the same thing happened. Then, I tried to run them in Compatability mode. Nothing. I checked for updates to Windows, futz'd with the drivers for..everything, and went through the song and dance repeatedly. At this point, I feel like I've scientifically
 exhausted every issue I can think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why won't my programs launch?!</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying so quickly! Let me try and answer those questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It is an HP ProDesk I received from a friend.</p>
<p>2. The games and apps that were already on the computer, like Solitare, launch and run just fine. It's only the games I have downloaded onto the computer that fail to launch.</p>
<p>3. As far as I know, the computer is not facing any other performance issues. It runs very smoothly, in fact. It just..doesn't launch my games.</p>
<p>4. I did put Bit Defender on it before anything else. However, that was the only thing I did before I tried to download and run League. I haven't even changed my profile settings.</p>
<p>5. I installed the games online from their company websites. I will try looking for them in the Windows Store, though I doubt I will find them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll work on updating all of the drivers and re-installing the games, to see if that fixes the issue. Thanks again for your help.</p>
<p />

            <p>- The game is compatible with Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <em>HP ProDesk&nbsp; </em>is not descriptive enough. HP make several sub-models of ProDesk.</p>
<p>[ EDIT: I just had a look at the 400 and 600. Both use Intel HD and should have Win10 specific drivers
</p>
<p>available from HP, so there should be no issue with graphics drivers. </p>
<p>The HD 530 graphics on these machines should be able to run LOL, but if your previous machine had</p>
<p>a more powerful dedicated graphics card and you are using old save and config files from that machine the configuration files may need to be deleted as too high settings in that file may prevent the game from launching.
</p>
<p>You could also go through the&nbsp; .cfg file and lower setting manually instead of deleting and restarting. ]<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- No point downloading the game again from the MS Store. There is nothing special about these versions vs those</p>
<p>from the developers site.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"2. The games and apps that were already on the computer, like Solitare, launch and run just fine. It's only the games I have downloaded onto the computer that fail to launch."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, they would, because the require very little graphics processing power, if any.
</p>
<p>I believe they may run using only the cpu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- On a&nbsp; machine with a&nbsp;&nbsp;clean install of Win10 you should also run the <em>DirectX Web Installer</em> to verify all
</p>
<p>DX files are installed.</p>
<p>

            So, I did some experimenting. I rolled the OS back to Win7 and tried to run it again. No dice. However, Steam now works. In fact, all of my Steam games launch and run just fine (so I doubt it's a graphics processing issue). Problem is, League and Curse
 still won't start properly. I made sure DirectX is installed properly, and I also made certain that .NET was installed correctly. I would understand if the game refused to work once it was trying to render graphics, however this is a
<em>VOIP</em>&nbsp;<em>client</em>&nbsp;and the <em>launcher </em>that are failing to start. They're hardly graphics-intensive, right?

            <p>Alright, so I got it working! And quite well, in fact. It seems it was merely a registry issue. I installed and ran CCleaner, and, after restarting, the games and Curse both started and ran just fine.</p>

</p><p><span>I suggest you to try to check the status of the issue in Safe Mode.<strong> Safe mode</strong></span><span> starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services.
 If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the link below for steps to boot in Safe Mode.</span></p>

</p><p><span>If we check the issue on Safe Mode, where only basic drivers are enabled, it would help us in troubleshooting the issue. In case the issue does not occur on Safe Mode, we can conclude that the issue is occurring

<h2>            microsoft plus superpack for windows</h2>
                    <p>I purchased the Plus Superpack (the 2-disk set) about a hundred years ago. I have used it reliably for years. This weekend I had to reload WinXP several times on one of the 3 computers I have in my office, and I was very surprised to get the message that
 this COA key has been used on too many computers. They don't sell this product any more, and support on this item is little to non-existant. So looks like I am stuck. Can't buy a new one, can't use the old one. Anybody got any ideas?</p>

            <p>Research would indicate that the product you bought is licenced for one PC only. This would make simultaneous installations on other PCs illegal even if the installation was permitted to complete on them. Did you install it on your other PCs too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that, just like&nbsp;Windows activation, you have reached the limit on the number of activations that Microsoft will permit with automatic internet activation. Is there a screen that suggests telephone activation? If there is, this will be the route
 for you to try. If it works like ordinary Windows activation, the automated entry of details by telephone keys will probably also reject your code but wait on the line and you should get to speak to a human. The human will almost certainly seek assurances
 that it is only installed on&nbsp;one PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the eBay seller has sold you pirated software with a key that Microsoft has identified as such, in which case no amount of pleading with the Microsoft employee will help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can transfer files from your phone to Surface via Bluetooth. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure that your Surface's Bluetooth adapter is turned on and visible to Bluetooth devices. Go to Start &gt; Settings (Gear icon) &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &gt; More Bluetooth options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. On your phone, turn on Bluetooth and search for devices. You should see your Computer name (Surface), tap on it and tap pair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You should see a notification on the Surface device to show the pair code. Click "OK" if the code on your phone matched with what is shown on your Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. After pairing and you're ready to transfer files, tap or click "Send or receive files via Bluetooth", then just choose "Receive files" for transferring from phone to Surface or "Send files" if from Surface to phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. By this time your Surface should be on standby waiting for transfer. It will automatically receive the file(s) and should show you a loading page saying "Receiving files". After it completes the transfer, a page saying " Save the received file will show,
 click or tap "Finish" to save the file(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. You're all set. The file(s) you transferred will be save in the Documents folder by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you encounter issues with Bluetooth devices, check out this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-bluetooth-devices?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    After launching a video in Windows Media Player, I tried to skip forward or backward using the 'play line or progress line' at the bottom of the viewing area. The sound will either go forward or backward, but the picture freezes. Most times the picture
 doesn't catch up with the sound.

            <p>Hi Evelyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I appreciate your interest in windows 10&nbsp;. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Plug the power adapter directly into a functioning wall outlet. Do not plug it into a power strip, surge protector, or secondary power source. This could be causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work then I would suggest you to update firmware&nbsp;from the HP Web site.</p>
<p>

    <title>Installing Wireless LAN Driver Failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> engineal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Wireless LAN Driver Failed</h2>
                    <p>So a while a go I bought a HP Pavilion running Windows Vista back when Windows had that upgrade to Windows 7 thing for free.&nbsp;Ever since I upgraded to&nbsp;Windows 7, I have had problems with the wireless driver. I didn't do anything about it though because it
 was working, and that's all I cared about. More recently, I have tried to install Windows 7 Service Pack 1, which will almost install, but then fail. It tries three times, failing with these different&nbsp;error codes: 80246007, 80200001, and&nbsp;8000405. I was trying
 to figure out the problem and was looking at the wireless adapter for problems that could have affected it. However, when I went to network connections, the page was blank, with only an organize menu item. So I figured that maybe I should reinstall the network
 driver. I downloaded it from HP's website and tried installing it, but got an error that it couldn't be installed. I then lost my wireless internet connection. I can't install the driver&nbsp;even from Windows driver update.&nbsp;So I tried a system restore to before
 I tried installing Service pack 1, which went through and rebooted, but then said that the system could not be restored because the registry restore point was corrupt. So I think I have got myself in a terrible predicament, because I&nbsp;need to use the internet
 on this machine. It seems that I may have to do a factory restore to Windows Vista to get it back, which will be a big pain. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks so much for reading this!</p>

            Thanks for the reply. It is actually a desktop, a HP p6140f. It has the latest chipset drivers and I updated the Bios about a month ago without a problem. I have tried plugging in the Ethernet for the first time ever, and also found out that it has problems
 too. I didn't mess with those drivers. What a mess...

<h2>            Gray overlay on desktop shortcut in the metro menu</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've recently started customizing my metro menu, and just as I was about to reach the point of perfection (at least in my eyes), the metro menu decided to crush my dreams. The white background of my desktop wallpaper was supposed to fill in with the white
 of my metro wallpaper, thus resulting in a completely white start menu, other than the icons of applications.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, as you can see in this screenshot I made</div>
<div><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XhzDPHT.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/XhzDPHT.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>there is a grey overlay over the desktop app.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was wondering if there was any way I can remove this overlay. I cannot seem to find it in Decor8 or the PC configuration.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

<p>Hi JCMT,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>What is the brand/model of your computer? 32bit or 64bit?</p>
<p>Laptop or desktop?</p>
<p>Is this a wireless mouse/keyboard setup?</p>
<p>I suggest performing a clean boot to determine if a startup program may be causing the issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Here's a good&nbsp;article&nbsp;for troubleshooting mouse issues:</p>

<p>You might check to see if the "Hide pointer while typing" box is checked by clicking the Start orb and typing "mouse", then click on the entry that appears:</p>

    <title>Smart AC Adapter capacity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the blue potatoes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Smart AC Adapter capacity</h2>
                    <p>Recently our laptop has been not charging when it's awake. The microphone has also been faulty, and absolutely refuses to work in Skype. Also, the&nbsp;screen randomly taps&nbsp;ITSELF and tries to bring up options.
</p>
<p>This has all been very confusing, until this notice came up saying we needed a higher capacity Smart&nbsp;AC Adapter.
</p>
<p>Does anyone know what an AC adapter is and if they are expensive to replace. (Our parents won't fix it if it's too expensive.)</p>
<p>I will attach a screenshot of the notice.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>An AC Adapter is the small black box that is typically located on the Power Cord that you plug into a wall socket to provide AC power to the computer and charge the battery at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AC adapter:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_adapter</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An AC Adapter should have been included with the device, it is important to use an adapter that is compatible with the device you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you contact HP for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I observed that <strong>midi6</strong> was not used, so I changed the Korg driver to use (all 3 places, under the class Media, under Drivers32 and Setup\Upgrade...\USB ) it instead of
<strong>midi1</strong>.&nbsp; Now when you run the Korg Uninstall Utility, the "KORG KRONOS &lt;Connected&gt;" shows up on the first screen as "midi6", however "Standard Driver [KRONOS] &lt;Connected&gt;" still shows up on the second screen as "midi10".&nbsp; Even after getting
 to this point, the driver is still not recognized.&nbsp; I am almost ready to let Windows restore it self back to the previous version.&nbsp; I hate to give up trying to get this to work! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I dug into this pretty deeply , tried a number of Registry changes, but could never get thinks to work.&nbsp;
<strong>Yesterday, I rolled back the PC that is connected via USB to the Kronos to the prior version (1809) of Windows</strong>.&nbsp; After comparing a number of Registry entries that I captured between version 1903 and 1809, I have a bad feeling that Microsoft
 may have screwed up more than just the Korg issue; because of the way other entries in the Media Class look hosed up in the Registry, makes me wonder what else is messed up there.&nbsp; I have another PC where all of my piano VST's run, which also has the new version
 of Windows installed.&nbsp; When I brought that machine up, the Yamaha USB driver for the Steinberg UR22mkII did not work, but simply reinstalling it fixed it-- because of what I saw in the Registry on the first machine is making me consider rolling back Windows
 there as well-- once the "old" Windows folder is automatically removed (I think in 30 days).&nbsp; I am not a Microsoft basher, but I think everyone should avoid not installing this new update until all of the dust settles, and we find out the true extent of possible
 damage. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Literally 13 months after I purchased mine the battery started dying quicker than normal and now at 18 months it dies at 70% with only Word, Chrome, and Spotify running. I have not contacted Microsoft about this issue but I did read an article in Flipboard
 about lots of people have an issue with their batteries failing after a year of use.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            ebay app</h2>
                    I just got a new surface pro 3 that was factory reset from seller and when I go to download the eBay app it is not in the store. There are similar apps but not an actual eBay app? I was curious if anyone else had this problem.

            Hello  FlipM0D3,
<br />
<br />eBay app was pulled from App Store. The company has also discontinued the support for those who still have the app installed. 
<br />It happened in 2017.
<br /> From now on, you will just have to use eBay services from your browser to access eBay.

<h2>            Surface Pro 6, Surface Dock, KVM switch, Samsung S32D850T monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue relates to the display resolution settings.</p>
<p>I want to use the SP6 via the KVM switch connected to Mouse, Keyboard and the 32" Samsung S32D850T monitor.</p>
<p>surface is via surface connect port -&gt; Surface Dock -&gt; miniDP to HDMI / USB to the KVM switch -&gt; to mouse,keyboard and the monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can however not select any resolution beyond 1080p (1920x1080) when connected to the surface dock and thus to the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>connections / cables / hardware</p>
<p>- either of the two miniDP ports on the dock</p>
<p>- connecting with Surface´s own screen off, e.g. laying flat on the desk, connected only to the dock</p>
<p>- connecting to dock as a 2nd screen, while having surface "open" on the table</p>
<p>- connecting the KVM switch directly to the surface via miniDP - HDMI</p>
<p>- 2 different miniDP - HDMI cables</p>
<p>
</p><p>software</p>
<p>- updating windows to 1809</p>
<p>- intel graphics driver updater (fails and sends me over to microsoft for download package)<br />
- microsoft update package vor 17763 build (doesn´t fix it either)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry that I´ve been gone for so long. Didn´t quite find the time to tackle this any further.</p>
<p>I have now tried connecting the monitor directly to the Surface, without any dock in between.</p>
<p>That gives the same result. Can´t go beyond 1080p.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´ve also tried Mini DP adapters to DP, HDMI and even DVI.</p>
<p>Always the same story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, mouse and keyboard, both connected to the KVM switch via USB, aren´t working anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´ve updated the Surface to latest availbale WIN 10 version, re-checked whether there is any newer Firmware for the dock and thus, I am now officially all out of ideas.</p>
<p>

            As mentioned by KarenJune_F, the cable itself matters here. For example, the mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable from the Amazon Basics line only supports passing up to 1080p. You need to be absolutely sure the cable you're using allows 4k. If you're not sure,
 please purchase one that explicitly states support for 4k resolutions. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rankie-DisplayPort-Cable-Resolution-Ready/dp/B00YONKZ72/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
This one</a> is a good example.

<p>So, I learnt sth new here.</p>
<p>The cable I had, was labelled 4K, actually though it obviously didn´t support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got another one, now this actually works!</p>
<p>Thanks for persistently making me try different cables! ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>I now have a new issue with the dock.</p>
<p>It´s supposed to be plug and play, but in order to get it to work with my KVM including mouse and keyboard, I have to connect it while it´s off and then only power it on once the dock is connected.</p>
<p>Any ideas ?;)</p>

<p>Thats how the system is set up if you have a gold subscription on your account and you are signed into a console any other profile that is signed at the same time can use your gold subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want your brother to be able to use your subscription then I would suggest putting a passkey on your account so anytime someone tries to sign into your account they would have to put the passkey in or set it up so that they would have to put
 your password in everytime. Just make sure your brother doesnt know what your password is.</p>

<p>If I understand your question correctly, you do NOT want your brother to be able to play online through your gold membership?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, in addition to steeledwand7664's answer, be aware that the first Xbox One console you sign in on, will become your "Home Console".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Home Console will then share all your games INCLUDING your Gold membership to anyone playing on that console, including your brother.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want your brother to play online, BUT be ABLE to play your games, your only way of doing that would be to add your brother to an adult family account at
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> and then disallow him to play online in the online and privacy settings on

</p><p>If you want to completely disallow your brother from playing your games and Gold benefits, you need to go to the console your brother plays on, sign into your account, and under Settings--&gt;Personalization remove the Home Console setting for that console
 on your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or simply find a different console that you will set as your Home Console, as your account can only have one Home Console at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you want to prevent your brother from signing into your account and again benefit from your games and Gold, make sure to protect your account with a passkey as steeledwand7664 described.</p>
