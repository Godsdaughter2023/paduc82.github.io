<h2>            Will I have to manually reinstall my drivers after a clean install of Windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning on doing a clean reinstall of Windows 10 on my computer in the near future. But I have read some things of people having trouble with it and having to manually reinstall all of their drivers. My question is if I do do a clean install, will
 it remove my drivers and make me have to manually reinstall them? Or will it just automatically reinstall them with Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Charles</p>

<p>A clean install by definition overwrites whatever is currently on the drive, so anything that isn't backed up will be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows includes hundreds (probably thousands) of drivers that it automatically installs. These are known as 'native drivers.' It's possible that Windows 10 has native drivers for all your computer's hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows doesn't have a native driver you can install a driver from the hardware manufacturer's website. These are known as third-party drivers. You can install a third-party driver for your hardware even if Windows has a native driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're thinking of a clean install, you can always go to the hardware manufacturers' websites in advance and download the driver installers. Store them on a USB flash drive, along with a text file that explains what each driver is and how to install it.
 That's what I did for my clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own USB flash drive has all the drivers (and firmware) I've ever installed, with complete information about each one. I never have to worry about where to find drivers or what to do with them. It's all there waiting for me.</p>

<p>A clean install erases the hard disk, which means, yes, you would need to reinstall all your hardware drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 comes with what are class drivers for basic hardware support, but you will likely need to install updated drivers either through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website. Learn how to do that at the following link:</p>

<p>

                    I currently have Windows 8 and I want to update to Windows 8.1. I disabled my Bitdefender antivirus and tried to upgrade to Windows 8.1 and after about 2 hours, I got the message that I cannot download 8.1, and the details said Error Code0x80072efe. &nbsp;Also,

<h2>            Windows 7 freezes when I try to open it in Normal Mode or Safe Mode</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p>I am writing this on my son's computer because my Medion MD8345 P6110D PCMT14 running Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit computer freezes within seconds when I try to start windows 7 in normal mode and safe mode so I cannot use it for anything. There is 3 months
 guarantee left. Medion support told me to load the windows 7 recovery disc and select “Repair your Computer.” I loaded it and selected Startup Repair and it said it could not detect a problem. I selected Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool and it said no problems
 have been detected. I selected System Restore to the latest date on the list of restore points, 03/26/2013 but it said “it did not complete successfully, an unspecified error occurred during system restore (0x8000ffff).” I selected “Startup Repair” again and
 it said “Your computer was unable to start, Startup Repair is checking for errors, if problems are found Startup Repair will fix them automatically. Checking disk for errors, this might take over an hour to complete. Attempting repairs. Startup Repair cannot
 repair this computer automatically. Sending more information can help Microsoft create solutions.” I sent the info to Microsoft. The information it sent was as follows.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I selected System Restore to the second latest date on the list of restore points 03/19/2013 but it said</p>
<p>“It did not complete successfully. Details: System Restore failed while scanning the file system on Drive
D:\ the drive might be corrupt. You might want to try System Restore after running chkdsk /R on this disk. An unspecified error occurred during System Restore (0x8000ffff).” Using the DOS Command Prompt on the recovery
 disc, I ran chkdsk /R on drive D and it said “windows replaced bad clusters in file 48710 of name “\windows\system32\config\SYSTEM.LOG1” 320240 files processed in step 4. Step 5 is OK. Adding 1 bad cluster to the bad cluster file. Correcting errors in the
 volume bit map. Windows has made corrections to the file system. 8Kb in bad sectors. Failed to transfer logged messages to the event log with status 50.” I tried to start windows in Normal Mode and Safe Mode but it froze straightaway.</p>
<p>I selected System Restore to 03/19/2013 again and got the same result again, suspected corrupt drive D. I ran chkdsk for drive D again and drive C but there were no errors. I ran Startup Repair and Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool again but it said it could
 not detect a problem. I selected System Restore to the remaining 3 dates on the list of restore points and got the same result again, suspected corrupt drive D.
</p>
<p>I phoned Medion support to tell them my results and they told me to press F11 and reload windows which will delete all my files in order to get the computer back to what it was when it left the factory because Medion want to know if there is a hardware fault
 on my computer such as a faulty hard disk and then I can send the computer back to them for repair. I am reluctant to lose all my files etc because I cannot remember when I last did a back up but Medion do not know what to do to stop all my files being deleted.
</p>
<p>Using the DOS Command prompt on the recovery disk I typed sfc /scannow which is system file checker for replacing corrupt window files, and it said “Beginning system scan. This process will take some time. There is a system repair pending which requires
 reboot to complete. Restart windows and run sfc again.” I rebooted it and ran sfc again a few times but got the same message. I also tried defragmenting drive D so I used the Dos command defrag D: /h /u /v but it said “defrag is not recognised as an internal
 or external command operable program or batch file.” I tried to defrag drive C and got the same message. I hope Microsoft be able to help me start windows and preserve all my files.</p>

            Thank you for your reply. I have done further tests.&nbsp;
<p>I have not loaded any software or programs recently but I may have had an update from microsoft. When I press the F8 key when switching on, I get the “Windows Error Recovery Startup Options” and I get the “Windows Advanced Boot
 Options Menu” and I tried “Last Known Good Configuration” and “Enable Low Resolution Video Mode” but in each case it froze before windows started.
</p>
<p>Using the Command Prompt on the recovery disk, I typed “diskpart” and “list disk” and this table appeared where disk 4 is a Seagate expansion portable hard drive plugged into a UBS port on my computer:</p>
<p><u>Disk ### Status Size Free</u></p>
<p>Disk 0 Online 931 GB 0 B</p>
<p>Disk 1 No Media 0 B 0 B</p>
<p>Disk 2 No Media 0 B 0 B</p>
<p>Disk 3 No Media 0 B 0 B</p>
<p>Disk 4 On Line 931 GB 0 B </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I typed “select disk 0” and “list partition” and this table appeared;</p>
<p><u>Partition### Type Size Offset</u></p>
<p>Partition 1 Primary 100 MB 1024 KB</p>
<p>Partition 2 Primary 910 GB 101 MB</p>
<p>Partition 3 Primary 20 GB 910 GB</p>
<p>Partition 4 OEM 1024 MB 930 GB</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I typed “list volume” (for disk 0) and this table appeared:</p>
<p><u>Volume### Ltr Label FS Type Size Status Info </u>
</p>
<p>Volume 0 G MEDHPENU32 CDFS DVDROM 2434 MB Healthy</p>
<p>Volume 1 C System Rese NTFS Partition 100 MB Healthy</p>
<p>Volume 2 D Boot NTFS Partition 910 GB Healthy</p>
<p>Volume 3 E Recover NTFS Partition 20 GB Healthy</p>
<p>Volume 4 F Removable 0 B No Media</p>
<p>Volume 5 H Removable 0 B No Media</p>
<p>Volume 6 I Removable 0 B No Media</p>
<p>Volume 7 J Expansion D NTFS Partition 931 GB Healthy</p>
<p>Volume 8 NTFS Partition 1024 MB Healthy Hidden</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I typed “select disk 4” which is the Seagate expansion portable hard drive and I typed “list partition” and this table appeared:</p>
<p><u>Partition### Type Size Offset</u></p>
<p>Partition 1 Primary 931 GB 31 KB</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I typed “list volume” and the “list volume” table for disk 4 that appeared was the same as the “list volume” table for disk 0 see above.</p>
<p>Using the Command Prompt on the recovery disk, I typed “bootrec /fixmbr” and “bootrec /fixboot.”</p>
<p>It said “the operation completed successfully.” And I typed “bootrec /scanos” and “bootrec /rebuildbcd” and it said “scanning all disks for windows installations. Please wait since this may take a while. Successfully
 scanned windows installations. Total identified windows installations : 0.</p>
<p>The operation completed successfully.”</p>
<p>The recovery disc showed that windows 7 is stored on drive D. The first “chkdsk” I did on drive D showed bad clusters which were replaced and a further “chkdsk” showed no faults. I did a “chkdsk” on drive C
 and that showed no fault. The “list volume”table for disk 0 and disk 4 showed disk G and disk C and disk D and disk E all healthy. “Bootrec /fixmbr and /fixboot” said operation completed successfully but “bootrec /scanos and /rebuildbcd” said “Total identified
 windows installations: 0.” Is that good or bad? Will the list of problem signatures and the list of files that help describe the problem help you find a solution to the fault. What should I do next? Can you think of any DOS commands I can do on the command
 prompt on the recovery disk? I am reluctant to do anything which will cause me to lose all my files etc because I cannot remember when I last did a back up. Do you know how I can backup everything on my computer into my Seagate portable hard drive plugged
 into a USB port? What commands would I use? I have heard of Xcopy but I do not know if it could be used to copy from my computer into the Seagate expansion portable hard drive plugged into a USB port in these circumstances using command prompt on the recovery
 disc and I do not know how to do it such as what letters and punctuation etc to use with Xcopy because I have never done this before and I do not know anything about partitions.
</p>
<p>Would it be possible to do a virus scan using command prompt on the recovery disc in case a virus is causing this problem? I am absolutely useless with computers so I am very grateful for your help.</p>
<p>When you look at the results of all those tests I have done, what do you think is causing the fault? I will follow your advice about using Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Never be afraid to ask. This forum has some of the best people in the world available to help.&nbsp;Peter Pattinson with some more questions about his faulty computer. Windows 7 still freezes when I try to start it in normal mode or safe mode. The fault may be
 caused by a virus and I have Bullguard antivirus but I cannot get into normal mode or safe mode to use it. Do you know how to do it from command prompt? The Command Prompt on my son's computer which is not faulty is "C:\Users\Pete&gt;" and if I type commands
 like "help" it understands it. The command prompt on my faulty computer is "X:\windows\system32&gt;" and although it understands commands like "diskpart" and "chkdsk" it does not understand "help", it says "help is not recognised as an internal or external command,
 operable program or batch file", the same as when I tried to type "defrag."&nbsp;I wanted to type "help" because it gives a list of Dos commands. Is the "X" in the command prompt significant and is it another clue to what is wrong with my computer? I still cannot
 load the Ubuntu/Bootmed disc because the hard disk drive appears to have priority.
<font><font>I pressed the Del key on powering up to get into Setup and selected Advanced BIOS Features and selected Boot Sequence which specifies the Boot Device Priority Sequence. It is set up for !st Boot Device [CD/DVD], 2nd Boot Device
 [SATA: HL-DT-ST-DVDRAM GH22NS50], 3rd Boot Device [USB: Generic CF Card Reader], 4th Boot Device [SATA: WDC WD10EARS-00Y5B1] which I assume is the hard disk drive. There are brackets around these Boot Devices.&nbsp;It says on the screen that "This specifies the
 Boot Sequence from the available devices. A device enclosed in parenthesis has been disabled in the corresponding type menu." Does the mention of parenthesis mean that although the hard disk drive is shown as 4th boot device, it is actually the 1st Boot Device
 because this sequence is disabled and another more important sequence has the hard disk drive as first priority? Is there a way of changing the priority so I can&nbsp;run this Ubuntu/Bootmed DVD as first priority? If I put the recovery disc in my DVDRAM and powerup
 but do not press any key when the message "press any key to boot from CD or DVD" appears on the screen, the hard disk drive tries to boot into windows and freezes straightaway. Is there a key I can press when I power up which will run this Ubuntu/Bootmed DVD
 as first priority?&nbsp;Is there a command I can type in the Command Prompt which will run this DVD?&nbsp;When I put the Ubuntu/Bootmed DVD in my son's DVDRAM, and look at the file, it is shown as a Zip file. Will being a Zip file&nbsp;make it more difficult to run on my
 DVDRAM? I need to rescue all my files before I can start to fix the fault on my computer.&nbsp;I hope I have not given you too many difficult questions but I am hopeless with computers. A problem shared is a problem doubled. I am very grateful for your help. Many
 thanks. Regards Peter Pattinson</font></font></p>

<p>My computer is still freezing up when |I try to start windows 7 in normal mode and safe mode. The fault might be caused by a virus. I have Bullguard antivirus but I cannot get into normal or safe mode to run it. Can I run from a Command Prompt? I want to

 Menu which shows Boot Order is set to 19h “Always boot network first, then local devices”
<font><font>I changed Boot Order to 18h “Boot the devices ordered in BIOS Setup” and pressed F4 to save and quit. I looked at the Configuration Menu again and found that Boot Order was 19h again, I cannot save 18h. Is

<p>Peter Pattinson with the latest report on my faulty computer. I still cannot start windows 7 in normal mode or safe mode. I can now load Ubuntu/Bootmed into my faulty computer. I followed the tutorial for recovering
 files stuck inside a computer that cannot boot. On the Bootmed desktop I double clicked on the computer icon which opened Media directory and double clicked on sda2 and double clicked on users and double clicked on the folder containing all my files on a screen
 called media directory and I could see all the files I wanted to recover. I connected my Seagate expansion drive into my USB port and waited a few minutes but it did not appear on the screen, Bootmed could not see it. I replaced the Seagate expansion drive
 with a pen drive and waited but it did not appear on the screen. I exited out of file recovery and started ClamTK the antivirus program and got into the screen called “Select a Directory (recursive scan).” When I connected my pen drive, it appeared on the
 screen labelled 32GB Filesystem in the left column. I tried to click and drag my files into my pen drive but they were not saved. On one of my attempts A message came on the screen “Could not mount 32GB Filesystem a job is pending on /dev/sde1. I do not know
 what this means. I right clicked on the pen drive in the left column expecting a menu where I could unmount and mount but the menu only said Remove Rename, it did not say Unmount or Mount. It was exactly the same when I replaced the pen drive with my Seagate
 expansion drive. It was not possible to save my files. I left my expansion drive plugged into my UBS port and again followed the tutorial for recovering files. In the media directory, the folders were sda1, sda3, sda2, Expansion Drive in the right column.
 The only things in the left column were Ubuntu, Trash and File System. I could not save any files because neither the expansion drive nor the 32GB Filesystem appeared in the left column. I plugged my expansion drive and pen drive into my son's computer and&nbsp;they
 looked OK. Please help me recover my files. Is there another way I can save my files into my expansion drive or pen drive? I still have not found out if XCOPY could be used or how to use XCOPY. If I do not get the letters and punctuation right, I could destroy
 all my files. As soon as I recover all my files, I can try and fix my faulty computer. Many thanks.</p>

<p><font><font>Peter Pattinson with the latest report typed on my son's computer about my faulty computer. I still cannot start windows 7 in normal mode or safe mode. I still cannot copy my files into my expansion drive
 and pen drive using the Ubunto/Bootmed file recovery technique see above. I used Ubuntu/Bootmed ClamTK antivirus and found 36 viruses. I did the Ubuntu/Bootmed diagnostic hard drive test (Self Monitoring Analysis And Reporting Technology SMART). My hard drive
 passed the basic health check and 100% completed without error the conveyance offline test and 100% completed without error the short offline test and 10% completed with read failure the extended offline test. I do not know how serious this result is but chkdsk
 /r on C: and D: done in command prompt in the System Recovery Options is OK. I have Bullguard antivirus and I have written emails to Bullguard a few times for advice and they keep advising me to start windows in safe mode and do a virus check and a backup
 and I keep writing back to remind them I cannot get into safe mode and asking them for advice on how to copy my files onto my Seagate expansion drive plugged into my USB port using command prompt in the System Recovery Options on the Recovery Disk or any other
 way, but they keep ignoring my question. Bullguard have an online backup facility but my backup is missing from their website. My computer is a Medion with 2 months guarantee left. I keep writing emails to Medion asking for advice and they keep advising me
 to start windows in safe mode and do a backup onto my expansion drive and I keep writing back to remind them I cannot get into safe mode and asking them for advice on how to copy my files onto my Seagate expansion drive plugged into my USB port using command
 prompt in the System Recovery Options on the Recovery Disk or any other way, but they keep ignoring my question. Medion want me to reload windows&nbsp;which will&nbsp;delete all my files to bring my computer back to factory spec so they can decide if my computer fault
 is hardware and under guarantee or software and not under guarantee but I am reluctant to delete all my files without backing them up first. Is there anyone out there who can help me? Many thanks.</font></font></p>

<p>Peter Pattinson again. In command prompt in the System Recovery Options I typed “robocopy /? and&nbsp;the information shown on the screen&nbsp;looks very complicated and I would need to know precisely what letters and symbols and punctuation
 to use or I could very easily accidentally&nbsp;delete the files I wanted to recover. I do not know if robocopy could be used to recover my files from my HDD to my expansion drive or pen drive. If I could fix my computer fault, I would not need to recover my files,
 I could do a backup when it is working OK. I asked Bullguard and Medion what they thought the fault was and how to repair the fault, after looking at the results of all the tests I had done, Medion ignored the question and Bullguard said the fault appeared
 to be related to a faulty hard drive or windows installation&nbsp;but did not give me any advice how to fix the fault. Many thanks.</p>

You also might consider upgrading your encyption to WPA2 or at a minimum WPA with a very long random ASCII key. Personally I use WPA2-Personal with a 63-character random ASCII to protect my home wireless LAN. WEP is terribly insecure and should not be used.<br />

    <title>Upgrading motherboard on RAID 1 setup - does Windows 7 require - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victoria pe&#241;afiel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading motherboard on RAID 1 setup - does Windows 7 require reinstall&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've read here (http://scottiestech.info/2010/03/17/upgrade-your-motherboard-without-reinstalling-your-os/) and also in these forums that Windows 7 doesn't have problems to boot under a replaced motherboard.</p>
<p>However, I'm not sure if this does apply to a RAID 1 configuration as well.</p>
<p>I currently have a computer with Win7 64bits with 2 drives configured as RAID 1 (with Intel Rapid Storage), using the SATA RAID Controller.</p>
<p>My question is: if I change the motherboard (ONLY the motherboard, the rest will stay the same, CPU, RAM, etc.), will Win7 be able to boot properly? Or should I prepare something in advance before the hardware upgrade? I have the retail version of Windows
 7 (no OEM).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>"Every man is occasionally blessed with luck" ... doesn't mean you should count on it rescuing you, though.&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>Unless the two RAID controllers are 100% hardware compatible your system will NOT boot up, I guarantee it.&nbsp; The RAID drivers are built into the boot files that start Windows and cannot be repaired or replaced short of a reinstall of Windows.&nbsp; At best you'll
 get a blue screen and a reboot that never ends, at worst your data will be scrambled and lost forever.&nbsp; A middle case would be a computer that starts up but is never completely stable again because it contains both drivers for hardware that's present and drivers
 for hardware that no longer exists.</p>
<p>It just ain't worth the risk - reinstall and be safe.</p>

<p>I read most all the threads about changing the motherboard too. Some people say they had no problems, other say they couldn't even boot up. I also just made a change from one ASUS board to another ASUS board. Most new motherboards have the raid choices for
 you in the BIOS for how you want it configured, at least mine does.</p>
<p>In my case, it wouldn't even boot. It just "blue screened". I tried going into safe mode with the same result. Even when I booted with my retail full install of home premium to try and do a repair, it didn't work. Windows just stated it could make the repair.</p>
<p>All I can say is, prepare for the worst and back up everything you don't want to lose.</p>

    <title>Trouble resetting Windows 10 - Lenovo Yoga - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jencerdena  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble resetting Windows 10 - Lenovo Yoga</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Lenovo Yoga laptop computer with an SDD and external hard drive, intel core i7 7th gen processer about a year ago and upgraded to windows 10 some time ago. It has been running ok up until about a month ago when it started getting sluggish and
 suddenly wouldn’t load my profile 50% of the time (I’m the administrator). My husband’s profile will load just fine. My photo app wouldnt work suddenly and the internet wouldnt open, i had to download google chrome to access the web. Now I completely am unable
 to access anything other than icons on my desktop. As a side note, almost all programs were loaded to the external hard drive as the SDD is not very big.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got my profile to load tonight and tried to go to the start menu to reset the PC and the start menu and search function will not open at all. I tried ‘shift’ and restarting to get to the blue troubleshooting menu. I can get only so far into the
 reset this way before it tells me I dont have enough space and to delete apps or data. :::face palm::: I obviously cannot access the uninstall function because, you guessed it, I cannot access the start menu or uninstall feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? I’m at a loss and not sure where to go from here. Any help appreciated!</p>

            Hi Jen, it looks like your only option might be to clean install Windows 10, since the reset is not going to work . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !. 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Jen.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The fact that your husband's account on the same PC is working OK points to account corruption which we see every day here.   The solution which works best is to create a new Local Admin Account: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a> 
<br />
<br />Sign in, move your files over, test that everything works correctly, then when ready you can delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />If it's a Microsoft Account you can change it to a Local Account before deleting and then associate it with the new Local Account when ready.  
<br />
<br />If this doesn't completely resolve all performance problems then What I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 7, 10 0xc0000225 when booting to install&#47;repare dvd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> random11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7, 10 0xc0000225 when booting to install&#47;repare dvd</h2>
                    <p>TLDR; Please read full details bellow but to summarize: when trying to boot into windows I get 0xc0000225 error. When trying to boot into windows 7 or windows 10 install disk I STILL get 0xc0000225 error. But when trying to boot into a portable windows 7
 I have on a DVD that works. Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok so a lot has happened in the last two weeks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I over clocked my CPU, I cloned my hard drive with windows 7 on it to a bigger drive, removed the old drive and replaced it with the new one, then upgraded to windows 10. I had a heck of a time dealing with boot manager to make it work but finally it was
 working. I could boot into windows 10 no problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then some weird things started happening. A few times after I had left the computer for a few minutes the computer monitors (dual screen) would both turn off, not actually off but in a no signal state and nothing I could do would bring it back, I was
 forced to hold the power button to restart the system. It happened twice and both times I thought it was windows 10 (this never happened in windows 7 even after over clocking) possibly an issue with sleep mode. Even though I had turned it to never go to sleep
 and never hibernate, I thought that when upgrading to windows 10 maybe those settings somehow weren't been observed. So I reset all those settings and tested putting my computer to sleep. Then I noticed that in proper sleep the computer would almost shut down.
 The lights would turn off and the fans would stop. However when the computer was in the weird state the lights and fans were still on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was also running a dual boot system before upgrading (windows xp and 7) after upgrading I decided I didn’t need a dual boot anymore and just wanted it to always go to windows 10. So I deleted the entry in the boot manager for xp and set the timeout to
 0 in bcdedit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then my computer went into the weird state again. And I restarted my computer by holding the rest button (I assume it’s the same as holding the power button but I figure I'll be super detailed just in case).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trying to reboot however I get an error. I didn’t write down the error code. Assuming it was caused by me messing the with boot manager I do multiple things to try and fix it. I load up a portable windows 7 I have on DVD and try and edit the boot manager.
 Also because of dual boot the boot manager was not on the same drive as 10 so I also tried to create a new boot manager on that drive and just boot into that drive instead of my other drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end nothing worked. And so I googled the error code that I was now getting (I seen at least one other error code originally but since trying to fix the boot manager 0xc0000225 is all I get). Cutting it a bit short I figure I messed up my windows 10
 partition because in windows 7 portable drive manager it saws RAW instead of NTSF and doesn’t allow me to browse data. So I run chkdsk /f and that takes forever but now I can see my files. But still get the error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also throughout all this I have since reset my BIOS to fail safe defaults, just in case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the title says, and what no one on the internet has a solution for (that I could find) is I am also getting this error when trying to boot to an install disk, windows 7 or windows 10. I know for a fact the windows 7 disk
 used to work. I used it after cloning my drive. I assumed it was an issue with my drive at this point and disabled all my drives in BIOS. Still got the error when booting to install disk. I can still boot to the portable windows 7 though, that works. So since
 portable windows works I assume it's not an issue with my computer hardware. I just can't figure out what to do now though.&nbsp; Can someone please suggest anything. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t my media player open&#63;</h2>
                    I have been trying to open my Windows Media Player for the past few days and it won't open. My computer is an Acer that runs on Windows Vista and I've tried clicking on shortcuts and opening from the file location. I've also tried downloading songs and
 plugging in my MP3 to automatically open it but it just won't open. It doesn't even give me some kind of message to tell me what's going on. All of my other programs run fine but I have no idea what's going on with the media player. Can someone tell me what's
 going on?

==========================================<br />
Just a thought...if you open Task Manager / Processes tab...<br />
do you see one or more instances of&nbsp; wmplayer.exe?<br />
<br />
If_Yes_ end process on all of them<br />
<br />
Try once again to launch Windows Media Player.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Stephen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know the current user profile logged in, you may press Windows Key + X, select Control Panel and select User Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you are in user account page, you can find the active user account. Check the screen shot.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/476be56e-5052-46e0-85e3-180d3083e657" /></p>
<p><span>To delete unwanted user account try these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Back up all the data before deleting the user account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Login to your user account which you want to keep.</span></li><li><span>Press Windows key + X, select Control Panel and User accounts.</span></li><li><span>Click on “Manage another account” and then select the user account that you want to delete.</span></li><li><span>Click on “delete the account”.</span></li><li><span>Depending on whether you want to “Keep the files” or “delete the files” choose the appropriate option.</span></li><li><span>You can delete the other accounts similarly.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Once deleted, the user accounts cannot be recovered. Make sure you back up any data if required.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the status of the issue. If you need further assistance, please post back. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<h3> jared v  say:</h3>
<h2>            Specific games always stutter and crash after hardware change</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">PLEASE READ: I have reinstalled windows completely, tried drivers from two months ago, made a registry edit (tdrDelay or something like that), changed nvidia power settings, tried an older gpu, tried a whole different motherboard,
 3 different kits of ram at different speeds, reinstalled drivers using DDU, removed gpu overclocks, disabled fullscreen optimization for games, ran windows memory test changed cpu priority of games...I'm definitely missing some things I tried, I just can't
 remember them all. Overheating is not an issue for both the cpu and gpu , both stay below 70 c. SPECS; Ryzen 7 2700x stock w/xfr, EVGA GTX 1080 FTW, Corsair AX 760, G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) (PC4 25600) F4-3200C16D-16GTZR, Asus ROG X470 Gaming
 F, a kingston 240gb ssd, 1tb hdd and 4 tb hdd. A few weeks ago I decide to upgrade my old 3rd gen i7 pc to a Ryzen 7 system. After booting up and installing drivers, everything seemed fine. I noticed when playing pubg and fortnite the games run very fast,
 yet it constantly hitches and stutters. If the stutter is strong enough, it seems the nvidia driver hangs and the game crashes. In fortnite, the game log will say something along the lines of "waiting for gpu to catch up (0.5 seconds). It will print the line
 over and over until I kill the game in task manager. PUBG does the same, but both games will only do this when I am actually in a match. The gpu will still run at the same boost clock in the lobby as it does in game (since it's on prefer high performance)
 yet being in a match is what will cause it to hang. In the windows event manager the event's catergory is "display" and will read "Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered". What's odd about this is Rainbow Six siege exhibits
 absolutely NONE of these issues and hasn't crashed on me at all since the hardware upgrade. The stutter isn't present whatsoever when I am in windows, it also persists when I dissconnect the PC from the internet and play offline games. Help is appreciated,
 I am at an absolutely loss regrading this one.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">EDIT: Another game that doesn't exhibit stutter and freezing is Doom 2016, I noticed whenever I change the graphics API (in the in game menu's) from Vulkan to OpenGL the game starts stuttering and running poorly. When I change it
 back to Vulkan the issues completely disappear.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your time and effort in troubleshooting this issue. As you mentioned that only issue is only with particular games (PubG and Fortnite), I would request you to change the in game settings.
 Set the game settings to low performance and write back with results. We will look into this for you.</span></p>

<h2>            Desktop image bigger than screen on second monitor&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
This morning I turned on my machine and on the second screen the desktop is bigger than the actual monitor so I can see just a part of my desktop and if I reach the border of the monitor with the mouse the desktop scrolls to show the hidden part. Why is this
 happening? is happening only on the second monitor not the first one???<br />

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker - Movie half done and now it won&#39;t play so I can finish. No picture in the small screen.</h2>
                    I am making a movie and am half way finished. As I make the movie every few minutes or so, I would hit save project. It seemed to help this freeze up problem from being a problem because if it did freeze up, I would just exit and not save it and turn it
 off. Then turn computer back on and go back to movie maker and continue making my movie. But now.....I turned it on to finish the movie and it is frozen so I can't play it to coordinate pictures to music. What causes it to freeze like that and is there a way
 to un freeze it so I don't have to start all over? Please help me. Thank you, Diana

            Hello Wilder Woman,<br />
<br />
When you look at the KB article 923946, it takes you to a Media Encoder Page. For Windows Vista, it takes you to a different KB article to download
<br />
<div>KB&nbsp;929182 - FIX: You may experience issues when you use Windows Media Encoder 9 Series on a computer that is running Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929182<br />
</a><br />
In the article is a download that you should download to your computer and run the hot fix. Before applying the hot fox, make a system restore point, so if it
<br />
causes any problems you can restore back to the point before you applied the hot fix.<br />
<br />
Right-click on the Computer icon in the Desktop, and choose Properties <br />
In the left pane, click System Protection <br />
Alternately, to access the System Protection tab directly, click Start and type SystemPropertiesProtection.exe.
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
<br />
Click the System Protection tab, and then click Create. <br />
In the System Protection dialog box, type a description, and then click Create.<br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if you have any other questions or need further help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div>

            Hi Tony 
<br />
<br />It may well be a Windows update stuck, or as you say a fake . .. 
<br />
<br />Can you please take a photo of that screen you are seeing, so we can make a better judgement on this for you.
<br />
<br />Then in your next post, click the second last button on the toolbar above your post to select that image and upload it to your post . . ..

            This is regular update message. So, we should not worry something from the side of Fake/Virus/Malware.
<br />
<br />Leave it for few hours. Then update back the progress here. Sometimes, it does take lot of hours. Wait is the best advice otherwise we may get into recovery of your computer.

            Hi Tony,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />It looks like a feature update is installing, which brings newer features to Windows. If you have a large data and a relatively "not a new computer", it might take hours.
<br />
<br />Does the hard disk activity light blink?

            Give it one more hour and if that doesn't finish, Perform a hard shutdown by pressing the power button for 5 seconds. Turn it on and let the PC restore the previous version of Windows.

<h2>            Problems with programs that use 3D graphics, don&#39;t display 3D graphics windows and give an error message saying my system does not support 3D hardware acceleration</h2>
                    <p><strong>Question:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I upgraded to windows 10 (from win 7), I've been having problems with programs that use 3D graphics. Some programs either a) don't display 3D graphics windows or b) give an error message saying my system does not support 3D hardware acceleration.
 Windows tells me the drivers are all up to to date. Also, I don't seem to be able to access the Intel graphics control panel (usually done by right clicking in desktop). Is there a way in which to turn on 3D hardware acceleration or a reason that would be
 disabled in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System specs:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer aspire 4733z</p>
<p>Intel Pentium processor @ 2.30 GHz</p>

<p>Ciao ragazzi, non sono se siete entrati a far parte dell'<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Xbox LIVE Rewards</span>, comunque per chi c'è (e lo chiedo sopratutto agli admin) avete presente la sezione&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MyAchievements</span>?
 Dunque in quella sezione c'è scritto che in base al tuo punteggio giocatore avrai dei premi e le fasce sono:</p>
<ul>
<li>3000 - 9999 </li><li>10000 - 24999 </li><li>25000+ </li></ul>
<p>Il punto è che non riesco a "sbloccare" nulla, nonostante i miei sudatissimi G Point. Qualcuno sa come
<em>sbloccare</em> la situazione?</p>
<p>Grazie bella gente!</p>

<p>Ho il tuo stesso problema! </p>
<p>Sono iscritta dal 11 ottobre e non si sono sbloccati. Dobbiamo solo aspettare o dobbiamo segnalare il problema?</p>
<p>Va bene che se non si accumulano almeno 100 mp non ti vengono depositati, ma a fronte di un nuovo acquisto e rinnovo vorrei almeno un po' di chiarezza.

<p>A me li ha sbloccati subito dopo l'iscrizione, mi sono iscritto il 29 settembre, però non saprei cosa dirvi provate ad aspettare ancora un po e poi segnalate il problema. Una domanda ma a voi vi dice "Ci sei quasi" o è già andato via?

<p>Non saprei, come ho detto prima a me li ha sbloccati e non ha fatto niente (ho sbloccato forse un centinaio di punti G), forse è perchè mi sono iscritto prima di ottobre ma non vedo motivo di non sbloccare gli achivements a chi si è iscritto dopo settembre;
 può darsi che sia solo un disguido temporaneo per il gran numero di iscrizioni</p>

    <title>Unable to connect toe Xbox Insider Hub on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to connect toe Xbox Insider Hub on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've been researching for fixes, and have not had any luck yet. The issue I have seems to be only for me since no one seems to know why it's happening. Spoke to Microsoft support to fix it and they weren't sure what was causing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image on the right is what I keep running into:&nbsp;https://gyazo.com/99c2162ba0553a478410f0011eecbd55</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Please try again. There was an issue with your network."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not own a console or have a Gold sub for Xbox Live. I am running on the most recent update for Windows 10 and the app store, I've also recently (About a week ago) reformatted my PC(Full clean). As you can see on the left I'm attempting to connect in
 order to play the new game Sea of Thieves beta. I have a couple friends who have no issue whatsoever. I'm not running on a proxy either, I've run out of ideas so I'm willing to try anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
