<h2>            Network speed test</h2>
                    Network speed test appears to work very well. Almost invariably It shows exactly the up- and download speeds in the contract with my provider. Incidentally, however, the speeds are significantly lower. I want to confront my provider with these incidents.
 A problem with this is that the network speed app does not show the time of measurement, only the date. Does anyone know how I could get the time in the results table?

    <title>Xbox One Elite Controller Headset Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thegoat is here  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Elite Controller Headset Issues</h2>
                    I have just gotten a new Elite Controller but have had audio issues from My headset (Turtle Beach XO Fours). At first I couldn't hear game or party volume so I updated my controller as well as assigning it to my profile. It didn't look like it helped so
 then I kept unplugging and replugging the adaptor and jack until I could finally hear volume, but my friend in the party couldn't hear me. I then continued until I restarted my Xbox and that seemed to solve those issues. However, whenever I play a game that
 is mild to intense in sound, all volume cuts out until I quit or raise or lower the volume, which only very temporarily solves the problem. How can I get get the volume to stop cutting out?

<p>I had a issue simular to this. I updated my elite controller with the headset adaptor and headset plugged in. I haven't had any problems since then. Are you having headset issues with standard controller or only the elite?</p>

<p>8/06/2016-I originally blamed esotu, for this issue. After spending time trouble shooting I ended up replacing the cords to my controllers with new cords and sound was 95% better. Still have long loads and sound is silenced where the loud sound used to occur
 with occasional squelch noise. My theory is its a defect in the controller and/or a software update for the controllers chip set maybe needed.</p>

<p>Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power cord back in and restart the

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It sounds like a hardware issue, but you can try to do one simple step of clearing your console's system cache and seeing if this clears the problem up. If it doesn't, then I suggest returning to the store where you purchased this to exchange it as this console
 is less than 30 days old they should honor an exchange. If they don't, you'd need to
<strong><a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">send the console in for a repair</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> frustrated user 47  say:</h3>
<h2>            possible trojan&#47;virus in media player and nuancewds.exe</h2>
                    I have had Norton Internet Security advise that media player is using all of one processor in a quad core system.&nbsp; More recently, I received the same message for nuancewds.exe.&nbsp; I dug a little deeper, and was advised this executable was copying the screen
 to the clipboard.&nbsp; A few days before this discovery, I had installed Paperport 12.0. What is troubling is that I was not using Paperport, or any other Nuance application, when Norton's warned of heavy processor usage.&nbsp; I emailed Nuance, but have heard nothing.&nbsp;
 Has anyone else experienced a similar problem?&nbsp; Is this a trojan/virus?&nbsp; If so, what is the solution?&nbsp; (Microsoft Safety Scanner and Norton's do not "see" a problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />

            You might consider changing how Windows indexes and searches: if you tell Windows to index and search inside files, such as pdf files, it is going to have to use resources to do so. Go to indexing options, click on file types, and you should see "Pdf Professional
 filter" instead of "File Properties filter" for pdf files. If you uncheck that, it will reduce the cpu usage. Then, though, when you use Windows "Search," it will be less effective, and it will theoretically search file contents anyway if you tell it to search
 file name and contents only in indexed locations, but if you tell it to always search file names and contents, then your searches will take longer than forever, and, if your Windows is like mine, it won't find everything anyway.&nbsp;

</p><p>1. Run a SFC to find if there is any corrupt files, I have already done that with the scan returning the results: "That there aren't any System Integrity Violations".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Run a DISM Tool scan, I have also already done that as well and it too has come back with everything not having any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Run the PowerShell Command, I've done that as well with it only turning up red text showing errors but that's how it always looked in the previous version of Windows 10 with this error on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you're actually going to offer any help on this, PLEASE don't ask for things to be done that I've already done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, like I said above this Critical Error message isn't showing up for me but it has all the symptoms of the error from the previous version of Windows 10. But if someone is actually seeing the Critical Error message as well, please let me know that (please
 let Microsoft know as well by showing it here).</p>

            <p>A strange part of this bug on Windows 10 Home, Version 1511, 10586 is that even though I the Start Menu and the Task Bar is inaccessible, the clock isn't showing up the Notification icon shows (but this isn't new since that's the only thing that shown with
 the error as before), but also Norton Safety Minder (AKA: Norton Online Family) has its icon showing up, and slowly after awhile the iCloud icon showed up for a second then went to being hidden like I usually have it set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the unlike before with this error on the previous version of Windows 10 I've discovered that programs such as Internet Explorer like to freeze a lot more that they ever did with this error before. The system is also using a lot more Memory (RAM) than
 usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>prior to shutting down and restarting the computer a few hours before this Critical Error started one of the "New to Windows 10 Apps and Programs", namely Microsoft Edge crashed and stop responding. Like in the previous version of Windows 10 this lead to
 the Start Menu not being accessible by being clicked on (a Left mouse click) or the keyboard shortcut but Right clicking on it did work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are all common issues that always preceded this Critical Error on the previous version of Windows 10. I've never had this Critical Error occur after installing any updates like some people have (I always shutdown my computer daily) so if this error
 was connected to updates being installed I'd be seeing it the next time the computer is restarted after installing the updates but that doesn't occur.</p>

            Also just figured I should add that just before I shutdown my computer before getting this Critical Error I was setting up Microsoft OneDrive; something I decided not to use before and technically still don't want to use since I 100% prefer Dropbox but
 an app on my iPad was demanding OneDrive and wouldn't sync to Dropbox so I was forced to use it and activate it on my computer. I was planning on deactivating it when I turned my computer back on yet instead I got this Critical Error. In this case it could
 be related to Microsoft Edge crashing and stopping to respond like it usually has been or a direct connection to Microsoft OneDrive.

</p><p>Here is the post you're saying to refer to and for your information every time I've ever had this Critical Error I've always used Safe Mode after using the other 3 things I've tried; so if this is what you're going to suggest you are wasting my time since
 I already know about this. Plus the SAME can be said for the other solutions listed by Ravinath. None of them work, this error always comes back after awhile. NONE OF THEM ARE A PERMANENT FIX THOUGH!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are aware that some customers experience one of the following errors consistently in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">“Critical Error – Cortana isn’t working.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ll try to fix it the next time you sign in.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">“Critical Error – Start menu and Cortana aren’t working.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ll try to fix it the next time you sign in.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">“Critical Error – Your Start menu isn’t working.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ll try to fix it the next time you sign in.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to temporarily resolve the issue by booting to Safe Mode, and then immediately booting back into normal mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;This workaround may resolve your problem for a while, however the error may return later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To boot to Safe Mode:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From Hold the Shift key down while you press the Power icon and select&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once you are within the Windows Recovery Environment, select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>Advanced options</strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>Startup Settings</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When it restarts, you should see a number of options.&nbsp;&nbsp;Press 5 or F5 for&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode with networking</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once you sign into your account in Safe Mode, you’re done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just restart your PC to return to a normal boot.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party antivirus software, we recommend uninstalling and then reinstalling the antivirus software, as this may also provide a workaround for this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest way to uninstall an app is to find it in the Start
 menu’s app list, right-click the app, and select&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some customers have reported that adding a new local administrator account has resolved their Critical Error. If that doesn’t work, try removing the original administrator account now that you have a new one created.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I already Know about booting up into Safe Mode yet it only works for a little while like a few days to a week to a little longer. It isn't a PERMANENT FIX and this error is extremely annoying that it is TIME FOR A PERMANENT FIX, NOT A WORKAROUND! And furthermore
 my computer is always set to finish the first three fixes I've stated and then I go to Safe Mode then after booting up normally the Critical Error is gone for only a few days. But on top of that, booting into Safe Mode hasn't worked for everyone getting this
 problem since the previous version of Windows 10. Some are finding their computers won't allow them to login to Safe Mode which then turns into a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVERYONE GETTING THIS CRITICAL ERROR WANTS A PERMANENT FIX, NOT SOME WORKAROUNDS THAT DON'T FULLY FIX THE PROBLEM!</p>

            <p>First something I noticed with the previous version of Windows 10 as well as this one is that when using Safe Mode With Networking, Windows 10 for some illogical reason will not allow me to connect to the Internet. I only remember Safe Mode With Networking
 only allowing me access to the Internet once the first time I ever got this Critical Error and every time after that when booting up into Safe Mode even though I've checked the option "With Networking" I'm not allowed to connect to the Internet or my Wireless
 Network or even a wired network; I've tried both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following Screenshots show proof of all of that:</p>
<p>1. No NETWORKING (NO Internet Connection At All):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/498d703d-98f4-439a-b595-4217f42d47b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/498d703d-98f4-439a-b595-4217f42d47b7" /></a></p>
<p>(And before someone wants to say my Network Adapter must be disabled, it 100% isn't. I am always seeing the light that it is active and Enabled, not the red light for it being off/disabled.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Proof I'm Using Safe Mode With Networking<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87d3536a-e0f4-4ade-affd-19c4ff6b575e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87d3536a-e0f4-4ade-affd-19c4ff6b575e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Proof I Can't Connect To The Internet With Safe Mode With Networking Enabled</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/036267c1-e6e2-44d2-a11a-8ece865e3864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/036267c1-e6e2-44d2-a11a-8ece865e3864" /></a></p>
<p>(And before someone wants to ask what the answers to this Internet Explorer's page's questions are: (1.) All Network Cables are plugged in. (2.) Airplane Mode Is Off (I NEVER USE AIRPLANE MODE) (3.) My Wireless Switch is ON, I always have it on at all times
 (plus my Wireless Adapter's Drivers are up-to-date as well). 4. Both my iPad and my Andorid Phone as well as my iPod can perfectly connect to my Wireless Network and access the Internet Perfectly fine. (4.) Since all my Wireless Devices connected to my Wireless
 Router are working in connecting to the Internet and also going to a wired connection directly from my Internet Modem also doesn't work in Safe Mode With Networking there is no logical purpose in restarting the Wireless Router!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Also, this screenshot shows exactly what I get every time I run a CMD SFC/Scannow Scan whenever I have this error or any other error for that matter on Windows 10!</p>

I've had the same experience both on a new laptop pre-installed with Windows 10, and a desktop upgraded to 10 from 7. &nbsp;MS seems to only parrot the same workarounds without even admitting they have a major defect in Windows. The latest "solutiion" I was given
 was to create a new user with admin privs. Yes, that does provide a workaround, but this is not a solution.</span></p>

            Do you have Dropbox?<br />
<br />
<p>I just found posts that suggest a potential root cause of this issue. It appears that for a number of people, the cause appears to be related to Dropbox. Remove Dropbox, and the problem goes away. I would be curious if the problem is isolated to just Dropbox
 users.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do use Dropbox but Dropbox ISN'T the problem. I removed Dropbox and then reinstalled it because the issue occurred again right after removing Dropbox a day later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People before have said that Avast Anti-Virus is the cause for the Critical Error problem, but I don't use Avast, I use Norton Internet Security (which is actually the best Anti-Virus Software you'll ever find out there. I should know, I've used all others
 including Microsoft's Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials and they all had one thing in common, they all let Viruses, Spyware and Malware through), but Norton Internet Security found and removed all that the others ignored and allowed to stay
 on my computer. Even Malwarebytes did the exact same thing and allow viruses through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People have also said that the Critical Error problem is caused by updates installed by Windows Update so they've removed updates and said the problem has gone away. But Windows 10 Updates are all Cumulative so no matter what if your system is missing an
 update its just going to be reinstalled with the next cumulative updates release. So removing any cumulative updates has proved to be a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a Computer Repair Technician at the Computer Repair place I work at in where I live my coworkers and I have actually discovered that there are possibly many causes to the Critical Error problem and a person can remove or preform any of the temporary fix
 but they all don't last because the error will come back when you least expect it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some causes to the Critical Error problem that my coworkers and I have discovered on our own personal computers. We've also have duplicated the problem on a test computer as well.</p>
<p>1, Whenever Microsoft Edge crashes and stops responding you might end up noticing that your Start Menu also stops working and won't respond to a Left Mouse Click nor will it respond to using the keyboard shortcut. Right at this time your Start Menu will
 work to a Right Mouse Click but you don't have access to anything in your Start Menu. When Microsoft Edge crashes and you try to re-launch it you'll discover that it won't launch or it will launch but it will stay on a blue screen with the Microsoft Edge logo
 on it. You'll get the same effect if you try to open the Windows Microsoft Store at this time but it will have a blue screen with its logo instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When other "New to Windows 10 Apps and Programs" stop responding and crash the same problems caused by Microsoft Edge can occur. These new programs are: Cortana, Groove Music, Photos, Movies &amp; TV, etc. (any of the newer programs not seen in previous versions
 of Windows seem to cause this problem as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Sometimes when you first logon to or restart your computer before you hit the login screen and/or the screen where you have a picture just before you put your password in. If you don't hear the Windows Startup Sound here you might be having this Critical
 Error about to occur but sometimes this doesn't happen all the time. We've also discovered that this could be related to Windows Fast Start though and turning of Fast Start has seen to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the above possible causes can be the problem "maybe" if running CMD SFC/Scannow has told you that your computer doesn't have any System Integrity Violations. If a SFC/Scannow scan has found errors there could be another reason for the Critical
 Error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has had the Critical Error problem reported well before it was released to the public on July 29th. The Windows 10 Critical Error problem was actually present during the Windows 10 Technical Preview and Microsoft didn't know what was causing it
 then and apparently they still don't know what is causing it yet. Sadly some people get this error and others don't, some of them&nbsp;have Avast installed as well as even Dropbox without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be Driver Issues that are causing the Critical Error problem as well. What I'm getting at here is that Computer Manufacturers at times modify the driver hardware used in their computer manufacturing and thus modify the driver software as well to
 especially work with the drivers. Microsoft has Windows Update install Drivers for Windows 10 but these aren't the ones distributed by your Computer Manufactures on the products page for your computer, instead Windows Update gives the generic version of these
 drivers, these generic versions of such drivers can be also found at the driver hardware manufacture's websites as well. Here is an example of what I mean about generic drivers, Intel makes the driver and the driver updates for the Intel graphics GPU Driver
 inside my personal computer, but HP my computer manufacturer modified both the driver hardware as well as the driver software so when attempting to install the driver updates through Intel's Update program it won't allow me to install the driver software and
 it gives me a notice to go get the updated driver software from my computer manufacturer (HP). This is also bad if you do a Clean Install of Windows 10 for you wipe the hard drive including the manufacturer's installed driver software, then since Windows Update
 installs driver software, you're getting all generic drivers without any warnings to get them from your computer manufacturers. Such generic drivers can thus cause other problems so the Critical Error problem "could" be connected to such depending on your
 pc drivers. When I installed Windows 10 back in August on my personal computer Windows Update installed one generic driver and both HP and the driver's manufacturer don't have an updated driver but I always check to see if there is one.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 4, 1)">$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 4, 1)">Register&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 4, 1)">$manifest</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 4, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong>&nbsp;Try booting your computer up into Safe Mode:</p>
<p>There are a few ways to get to Safe Mode</p>
<p>Pressing F5 on startup can get you there in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also press and hold the Shift Key well clicking on Restart via the Power Icon on the Security Settings Screen or the Login Screen where you put your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another but longer way to get to Safe Mode is to follow these steps:<br />
<strong>1. CTRL ALT DEL to get to the Security&nbsp;Settings page</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Click on Task Manager</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. When the Task Manager window pops up click on "More Details" on the bottom</strong><br />
<strong>4. Click File and "Run New Task"</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Type in the new window that comes up: msconfig (check the box: Run this task with administrative privileges)</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. In the new window that pops up, click the Boot Tab and then check "Safe Mode" and also check "Network". Then click Ok.</strong><br />
<strong>7. Restart your computer</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing it this way requires you to leave Safe Mode or you'll always boot up into it. To Exit Safe Mode, follow these steps:<br />
<strong>1. Right Click on your Task Bar, click on Task Manager</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Click "More Details" if you aren't able to see the "File" menu</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Click on file and Run New Task</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Type msconfig again</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. In the window that comes up, click the Boot tab and uncheck "Safe Mode"</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Restart your computer and the Critical Error should be gone.</strong></p>

</p><blockquote>Do you have Dropbox?<br />
<br />
<p>I just found posts that suggest a potential root cause of this issue. It appears that for a number of people, the cause appears to be related to Dropbox. Remove Dropbox, and the problem goes away. I would be curious if the problem is isolated to just Dropbox
 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.dropboxforum.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/203581953-DB-cause-Windows-10-Critical-Error-Start-Menu-failure?page=1#community_comment_208109153</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I do use Dropbox but Dropbox ISN'T the problem. I removed Dropbox and then reinstalled it because the issue occurred again right after removing Dropbox a day later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People before have said that Avast Anti-Virus is the cause for the Critical Error problem, but I don't use Avast, I use Norton Internet Security (which is actually the best Anti-Virus Software you'll ever find out there. I should know, I've used all others
 including Microsoft's Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials and they all had one thing in common, they all let Viruses, Spyware and Malware through), but Norton Internet Security found and removed all that the others ignored and allowed to stay
 on my computer. Even Malwarebytes did the exact same thing and allow viruses through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People have also said that the Critical Error problem is caused by updates installed by Windows Update so they've removed updates and said the problem has gone away. But Windows 10 Updates are all Cumulative so no matter what if your system is missing an
 update its just going to be reinstalled with the next cumulative updates release. So removing any cumulative updates has proved to be a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a Computer Repair Technician at the Computer Repair place I work at in where I live my coworkers and I have actually discovered that there are possibly many causes to the Critical Error problem and a person can remove or preform any of the temporary fix
 but they all don't last because the error will come back when you least expect it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some causes to the Critical Error problem that my coworkers and I have discovered on our own personal computers. We've also have duplicated the problem on a test computer as well.</p>
<p>1, Whenever Microsoft Edge crashes and stops responding you might end up noticing that your Start Menu also stops working and won't respond to a Left Mouse Click nor will it respond to using the keyboard shortcut. Right at this time your Start Menu will
 work to a Right Mouse Click but you don't have access to anything in your Start Menu. When Microsoft Edge crashes and you try to re-launch it you'll discover that it won't launch or it will launch but it will stay on a blue screen with the Microsoft Edge logo
 on it. You'll get the same effect if you try to open the Windows Microsoft Store at this time but it will have a blue screen with its logo instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When other "New to Windows 10 Apps and Programs" stop responding and crash the same problems caused by Microsoft Edge can occur. These new programs are: Cortana, Groove Music, Photos, Movies &amp; TV, etc. (any of the newer programs not seen in previous versions
 of Windows seem to cause this problem as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Sometimes when you first logon to or restart your computer before you hit the login screen and/or the screen where you have a picture just before you put your password in. If you don't hear the Windows Startup Sound here you might be having this Critical
 Error about to occur but sometimes this doesn't happen all the time. We've also discovered that this could be related to Windows Fast Start though and turning of Fast Start has seen to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the above possible causes can be the problem "maybe" if running CMD SFC/Scannow has told you that your computer doesn't have any System Integrity Violations. If a SFC/Scannow scan has found errors there could be another reason for the Critical
 Error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has had the Critical Error problem reported well before it was released to the public on July 29th. The Windows 10 Critical Error problem was actually present during the Windows 10 Technical Preview and Microsoft didn't know what was causing it
 then and apparently they still don't know what is causing it yet. Sadly some people get this error and others don't, some of them&nbsp;have Avast installed as well as even Dropbox without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be Driver Issues that are causing the Critical Error problem as well. What I'm getting at here is that Computer Manufacturers at times modify the driver hardware used in their computer manufacturing and thus modify the driver software as well to
 especially work with the drivers. Microsoft has Windows Update install Drivers for Windows 10 but these aren't the ones distributed by your Computer Manufactures on the products page for your computer, instead Windows Update gives the generic version of these
 drivers, these generic versions of such drivers can be also found at the driver hardware manufacture's websites as well. Here is an example of what I mean about generic drivers, Intel makes the driver and the driver updates for the Intel graphics GPU Driver
 inside my personal computer, but HP my computer manufacturer modified both the driver hardware as well as the driver software so when attempting to install the driver updates through Intel's Update program it won't allow me to install the driver software and
 it gives me a notice to go get the updated driver software from my computer manufacturer (HP). This is also bad if you do a Clean Install of Windows 10 for you wipe the hard drive including the manufacturer's installed driver software, then since Windows Update
 installs driver software, you're getting all generic drivers without any warnings to get them from your computer manufacturers. Such generic drivers can thus cause other problems so the Critical Error problem "could" be connected to such depending on your
 pc drivers. When I installed Windows 10 back in August on my personal computer Windows Update installed one generic driver and both HP and the driver's manufacturer don't have an updated driver but I always check to see if there is one.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>On a last note, following these steps has gotten past the error:</strong><br />
</p>
<strong>Method 1:</strong>&nbsp;Open an Administrator CMD window.&nbsp; If you can’t find a way, use these steps:&nbsp;
<p><span>1.Press CTRL+Shift+ESC to open Task Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
2.Click File &gt; Run New Task&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
3.Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
4.Type CMD&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Type the following command at the CMD prompt:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>sfc /scannow</strong><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Type the following commands at the CMD prompt:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong><strong><br />
<strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</strong><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;If dism and sfc both completed and show no remaining issues, run these commands in powershell:<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>

</p><p>You've provided the most comprehensive explanation &amp; well aggregated list of workarounds that may help people deal with this issue, even if just temporarily. &nbsp; Kudos for taking the time to write this up. I think bottom-line is Microsoft does not appear to
 know the root cause(s). Let's hope they find it and provide a permanent fix to address it.</p>

<h2>            Unable to check the status of KB3063858 on system</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: KB3063858 - update installed query</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How do I tell if KB3063858&nbsp; is installed or not on my W7 Home premium 64bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB3063858&nbsp; - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3063858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3063858</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell this was not offered to me. It not in my 'view update history' as a successful update or a failed update, and its not listed in my 'installed updates' either. However, I've checked for updates and its not being offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So its not offered and its not listed. How can I check if its installed or not or if I need it ( I assume I do ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the article for 64 bit W7, two of the files are:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Kernel32.dll</td>
<td>6.1.7601.18847</td>
<td>1,162,752</td>
<td>09-May-2015</td>
<td>03:26</td>
<td>x64</td>
<td>Not Applicable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kernel32.dll</td>
<td>6.1.7601.23049</td>
<td>1,163,776</td>
<td>09-May-2015</td>
<td>06:05</td>
<td>x64</td>
<td>Not Applicable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kernelbase.dll</td>
<td>6.1.7601.18847</td>
<td>424,960</td>
<td>09-May-2015</td>
<td>03:26</td>
<td>x64</td>
<td>Not Applicable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kernelbase.dll</td>
<td>6.1.7601.23049</td>
<td>421,376</td>
<td>09-May-2015</td>
<td>06:05</td>
<td>x64</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Q1</strong> - Why are they listed twice with different file version numbers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked these files on my PC and they appear to be:</p>
<div><span>Kernel32.dll – 6.1.7601.18869</span></div>
<div><span>Kernelbase.dll – 6.1.7601.18869</span></div>
<div>
<p><span>both dated 25-05-15</span></p>
<p><span>which matches neither of the above, so I assume it isn't installed?</span></p>
<p><strong>Q2</strong> - If it isn't installed, why isn't it being offered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates appears to be working as I just installed some optional updates and MSE definitions tonight.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info. The update wasn't hidden I'd already checked that (I should have said).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try a manual download and install, but I was a little concerned that it appears I wasn't even offered it.
</p>
<p>How can I tell if I'm missing any others? Do MS make an audit tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is set to notify me of updates and then I install them and I always follow up on the odd failure IF one ever occurs. All updates presented are installed apart from some of the not really relevant optional updates.</p>
<p>I was also concerned about the version level of mine as it didn't appear to match either of those listed.</p>

            <p>limey74,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I ask how you found this was missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I was looking at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/issues-installing-updates-windows-7/f9e1e90e-8ac7-4b0a-b36b-639b1cfbcc5a">
another post</a>, and went to check If I had it, and that's when I spotted it apparently hadn't been offered. It wasn't in 'Installed updates' and it wasn't marked as successful or failed in 'View update history'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I hadn't manually checked, I'd never have known.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what else to try now, I've repeatedly tried windows update, I've downloaded the updates manually and it says its not applicable to this computer, I've tried from my normal standard user account and from my Admin account and from safe mode. Tried
 resetting WU to don't check and run a manual check, didn't help. All fail to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, all other important and security updates seem to be installing correctly, or at least, I've not spotted any other apparently missing updates.</p>

    <title>Failed To Sync User Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> friskiereight2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed To Sync User Data</h2>
                    For the past 2 weeks I've been trying to play Minecraft on my xbox one, but everytime I get on, it would load in for a few seconds then say "Failed to sync user data." and never let me play. I have tried a few things, such as waiting, uninstalling and
 reinstalling the game, I've even tried a hard restart on my xbox at least twice. None of these solutions worked and I can't think of anything else to do. I've tried my sister's account and it works for hers but not mine, and I've spent money on this game so
 I don't know how to solve this situation.

<p>I have a couple steps for you, first off, complete a hard rest following the steps below exactly as I’ve written them :&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug
 the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this does not work then do a factory reset, following the instructions at th link below, and choosing the “keep my games and apps” option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Give both of those things a try and then let us kmow how it goes. Cheers!</p>

            <p>Dear Amit(Kumar),</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's nice, but of course I suppose every person on the planet has now done all that about 25 times or more in the search for the non-existent Microsoft&nbsp;solution that the only possible reason for this is every computer on the planet must somehow be defective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you should try your own advice about ten times and see if that solves the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge just won't show up in 'Apps and Features' either. No amount of disk checking, re-booting, clean installs, or re-installs, or deletions and re-loads changes the fact that Edge is simply not recognized by Windows 10 Pro, fully updated to 14393.576.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it can now be installed from Store, and you can get limited functionality, create a desktop icon, which refuses to allow itself to be set to 'Run as Administrator', and you can pin it to your taskbar where it shows up as a blank space, but if you
 know it's there, will let you click in the space anyway to start up Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you can't minimize it or it just disappears, and 'Settings' can't recognize that it exists on your computer, and you can't set it to become a default app because Windows 10 can't see it for some reason, and you can't copy and paste to it's website bar
 either - right click and the whole program just disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I won't pay any money to buy anything else from Store either, because how you can trust it won't just take your money and do the same thing Edge does?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>XP Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard 5000 Numlock Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c5agan  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard 5000 Numlock Issues</h2>
                    Hi everyone. I apologize if we aren't supposed to question XP anymore (it's not that old is it? :0p)<br />
<br />
I have a brand new Microsoft Wireless Comfort keyboard/mouse 5000 that works fine unless you consider trying to use the fancy numlock and keypad. When you use the wireless Keyboard's numlock = ON, the numpad doesn't respond at all. When it is OFF, the home/pg=up/arrows
 work as designed. <br />
<br />
I installed this keyboard/mouse set on a desktop XP OS and it worked perfectly. Could it be that the drivers were not designed to work well with laptops?<br />
<br />
Here is what I've tried:<br />
1. Reinstalled drivers X2: did not solve issue<br />
2. Use Windows generic HID Keyboard driver: did not solve issue<br />
3. Turning 'Toggle Keys' on and off: did not solve issue<br />
4. Installed latest drivers from Microsoft's website: did not solve issue<br />
<br />
When I used the keyboard program to detect key strokes:<br />
&nbsp;-when numlock = ON, it didnt recognize any keystrokes from the numpad<br />
<br />
Here is the odd thing:<br />
&nbsp;On my Laptop, there is a shortcut for 'Toggle Keys' (never used it before). The shortcut is holding down numlock for 5 seconds. When I hold the key down for 5 seconds, to where the numlock = ON at the end of the 5 seconds, the numpad works correctly. But then
 tapping the numlock again will ruin it. <br />
<br />
Is the only way to use this keyboard on a laptop using that toggle key?<br />

    <title>How can I play the content that I purchased for Microsoft Flight now - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> py-am-i  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I play the content that I purchased for Microsoft Flight now that it is impossible to log in to Games for Windows Live through the game &#40;required to access DLC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I purchased $65 worth of content for Microsoft Flight back in 2012.&nbsp; When I go to play the game, I get the following popup prompting me to log in to Games for Windows Live account in order to use the DLC I paid for:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e80dc527-1804-4ebf-ba74-32e208aa3ce7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e80dc527-1804-4ebf-ba74-32e208aa3ce7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no issues signing into my account through a browser, but when I follow the instructions to log in to my account through the game, the sign in screen says please wait and never does anything.&nbsp; This effectively locks me out of the content I spent $65
 on.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4207758-44ab-415d-8a58-9bf8eef313cd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4207758-44ab-415d-8a58-9bf8eef313cd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use the licenses that I purchased.&nbsp; I never in a million years would have spent $65 if I knew the offline content I purchased would be unavailable in the future.&nbsp; I cannot, in good conscience, purchase another MIcrosoft product until this is corrected.&nbsp;
 It isn't right.&nbsp; It feels like Bill Gates snuck into my room, stole my copy of Microsoft Flight and left an advertisement for the new Microsoft Flight Simulator.</p>

Weird, because they told me to post here about it and said someone would be able to help me.&nbsp; They said to leave a case number.&nbsp; They sent me this link and gave me step by step instructions on where to post this.&nbsp; I'm utterly confused/frustrated.

    <title>Windows update disables Thunderbolt and and Dock. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update disables Thunderbolt and and Dock.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Precision 5520 and a Dell TB16 dock.</p>
<p>The recent windows feature update disable Thunderbolt services and I could not restart the service.</p>
<p>Without Thunderbolt services the Dell TB16 doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back the update and everything worked.</p>
<p>I made sure automatic updates were turned off, and took the further measure of disable the update services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine this morning blue screened and restarted... and installed updates, which killed the Thunderbolt service and thereby the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First MS needs to fix the update so it doesn't kill services.</p>
<p>Second MS has to allow user to absolutely stop all updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is patently ridiculous when updates are broken that MS won't let users shut down updates and avoid hours of work to fix what they break.</p>

<h2>            System won&#39;t boot past &#34;Windows is Starting up...&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>When I start my XP system, I get to the point of the boot that says "Windows is Starting Up..." then nothing. I even tried F* to restart using Safe Mode with the same outcome. I also tried stwarting in Sagfe Mode in the last safe config. No luck, I cant
 start up my system. Could this mean my system hard drive die? Any thoughts</p>

<p>if niether normal mode or safe mode function,</p>
<p>then your only choice is to boot with an xp cd.&nbsp; you can borrow one if you don't have it.</p>
<p>then after you boot with the cd you will come to a setup screen</p>
<p>so select repair.</p>
<p>by selecting repair you will launch the recovery console and you will eventually get to a system prompt.</p>
<p>at the prompt run the following commands&gt;:</p>
<p>chkdsk /r</p>
<p>fixboot</p>
<p>fixmbr</p>
<p>then exit, remove cd and try booting normally again.</p>
<p>incidentally, fixmbr is not always necessary.</p>
<p>however, by saying "yes" to fix the master boot record you will ensure that it will return to its default state.</p>
<p>if you still cannot enter windows after running the above commands,</p>
<p>then it sounds like your registry hive has become corrupted.</p>
<p>in which case you will have to boot with the cd again and execute the process of restoring the registry manually.</p>

<p>Thx Dan</p>
<p>After 20 plus restarts, my system rebooted. Wow. Now what to do? I tried chkdsk, but it would not allow chkdsk /r. The command fixboot was not recognized same with fixmbr. I am scared to reboot my system. Im trying to run malwarebytes and MS Scurity Essentials
 and perhaps Glary Utilities.</p>
<p>Any thoughts of what I should do while my system is actually running?</p>

<p>if you had to boot 20 times, then it sounds like a bad hard disk or the master boot record has crashed.</p>
<p>also, it is highly unusual that you could not run the commands at the disk prompt.</p>
<p>if you are at the disk prompt try running help and see what commands are available to you.</p>
<p>perhaps, i made a mistake with advising you to run chkdsk /r</p>
<p>there may be a different switch for chkdsk like chkdsk /f</p>
<p>so try running chkdsk /f</p>
<p>if you still cannot run any commands at the disk prompt,</p>
<p>then it could be an infection it is not a faulty hard disk.</p>
<p>there are anti virus programs that protect the disk and boot record from infections.</p>
<p>however, they in turn act like an infection and prevent users from access to the disk system.</p>
<p>other than the above my last suggestion is to try to reinstall the operating system via your xp setup disk.</p>
<p>it might be worth a try but may also prove futile if the hard drive is faulty.</p>

<div>If one chkdsk extension won't run - changing the extension won't make any </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>@Lorena</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please try this:-</div>
<div>open a Command Prompt (DOS) window</div>
<div>At the prompt, type</div>
<div>SFC /SCANNOW</div>
<div>hit the Enter key, and have your Windows disk handy!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This will search the OS for system file problems, and attempt to fix them</div>

<div>These things happen - but it may be worth running the hard disk manufacturer's test utility over the drive anyway to make sure it's OK.</div>

<p><strong>Hi Lorena. I can't help but ask if when you type chkdsk /f or /r are you leaving a space between the letter k and the forward slash? If not, do so. Also, tell me the manufacturer of your hard drive and I will attempt to locate the disk utility for
 you. If you do not know the manufacturer you can download Speccy from Piriform, the makers of Ccleaner. It will list all system component information. A real handy tool to have around.</strong></p>

<div>Baby steps, joel - baby-steps! - let the user actually learn something along the way to enlightenment, so that they feel more confident next time they hit a brick wall!</div>
<div>I would be quite happy with your advice in this particular instance - but you have to remember that the OP is not conversant with most of the stuff we take for granted - and will not&nbsp; (hopefully) hit the same situation again.... so we take baby-steps in
 the hope that the OP learns from the experience, and can then do the initial work for their next problem, themselves!</div>

    <title>My microsoft sculpt mobile keyboard no longer pairs with Surface Pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My microsoft sculpt mobile keyboard no longer pairs with Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>My&nbsp;microsoft sculpt mobile keyboard previously paired with my Surface Pro 4, but I had to reinstall windows. Now it doesn't pair. It used to tell me to type an 8-digit number on the keyboard, followed by the Enter key. All of a sudden, it asks me to type
 a PIN into a field on the Surface Pro 4's dialog screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, there is no PIN and there never has been any PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my bluetooth drivers, restarted Windows a couple of times, and the same thing results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I went to my wife's Surface Pro (original) and paired the same keyboard with it. Twice. Each time it put an 8-digit number on the screen, which I typed on my&nbsp;microsoft sculpt mobile keyboard, followed by the Enter key. It paired great and worked
 properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Wedge Mouse that pairs fine with both computers, so Bluetooth is working properly all around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck is wrong with the Surface Pro 4 that it won't display an 8-digit code so I can pair my two Microsoft devices to one another? How can this be fixed?</p>

<p>I read this solution on a Samsung/Microsoft forum, and it worked:&nbsp;</p>

If the keyboard is asking for a passcode, you can enter "0000"+Enter on the UI, and then "0000"+Enter on the physical keyboard. It should then work.</p>

</p><p>Apparently this is a user-settable PIN feature that, to my knowledge IS UTTERLY UNDOCUMENTED after SIX YEARS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Surface Pros since they came out more than 4 years ago and have paired many devices with them. This is the first time I've ever encountered this procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, Microsoft, put this in your documentation!</p>

<h2>            Device name&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've bought my new Surface Pro from amazon.com. And after almost 3 weeks, I just realised that it already has a device name that I never set myself: "desktop-sju306B". My old surface pro 3 doesn't have such a weird device name. It's just Surface Pro 3. Did
 Amazon send me a used one?</p>

            My computer is a Lenovo Ideapad 330. After a recent update, it crapped out. Could not do system restore. And every trick that every Youtuber gave, did not work. I've had this PC (Piece of ****) for four months now. And this 1903 update broke it. I wish
 that the lawyers would drop the stupid weed killer cancer suits and make a case against microsoft to compensate this failure of an OS. By the way, whoever is running the microsoft corporation, your OS update gave my computer E-AIDS. And I never joke about
 AIDS. Anyone who finds this comment funny, you suck as a person. As HIV can never be made as a joke. I don't care if the comedians make these tasteless jokes, I do not joke around when it comes to failures that cause that. And I only use that word or acronym
 as a metaphor. Toys R Us died of Retail AIDS, now my PC is dead from the 1903 virus or more commonly known as E-AIDS.

<p>I installed version 1903 on the evening of 8/1/2019. It took two hours, and when finished it had erased some of my software programs, some of my extensions in Chrome, and who knows what else. I've spent the last 4 hours
 trying to undo the Windows destruction. Unfortunately, Chrome is working badly too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen multiple posts in here about this problem. When is one of you Microsoft geniuses going to answer?</p>

Hi, I had to rest my computer to version 1809, once back on the operation of 1809,&nbsp; every day for 7 days I checked for updates. To my surprise, I had numerous updates, which was the cause of the corrupt install of version 1903. I don't know why MS engineers
 allowed version 1903 to be installed with previous updates not installed. All works fine I hope this helps&nbsp;

</p><blockquote>Thanks. I had to roll back too, but not before my connection to Chrome was destroyed. I still can't use Chrome.<br />

<p>Hi, I had the same problem also, I&nbsp; removed Chrome completely I thought. although the app shows it's removed there parts of the program running in the background that remained. Go to task manager &amp; scroll down locate all goggle task &amp; delete it reboot.&nbsp;
 Do a disk clean &amp; reboot. Check for MS update, If you installed 1903 then reinstall chrome. Once installed verify all works fine then, update to goggle version 76&nbsp;</p>
<p>all should be fine. Good luck&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Skype 8 on Windows 7 Massive Memory Leak - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype 8 on Windows 7 Massive Memory Leak</h2>
                    <p>So, I have Skype 8, latest version, on Windows 7. Once started, it starts eating memory at a steady pace, until I have to re-start it. When I try to quit, it devours CPU instead, until I have to kill it in task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to stop this at all?</p>

            Hi CeruleoZefiri,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />Copy the below line and paste into Run window and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.
