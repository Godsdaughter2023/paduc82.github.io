    <title>Installed HP M1212nf Mfp printer using USB Port - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cooper22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed HP M1212nf Mfp printer using USB Port</h2>
                    I have checked all my software and hardware, but when I install the printer using the installation disc the printer will run. But when I turn my computer off and restart the computer, the printer does not print. The printer shows a my default printer and
 the printer says ready but I get nothing. I can re-install and get it to print but it will disconnect when i turn my computer off. I have another Dell printer that I can switch to and it will print, but the HP won't.

The answer depends on what e-mail program you are using. Since you<br />
didn't tell us, I can't be sure.<br />
<br />
But try this: just drag the file in My Documents to the e-mail<br />
message.<br />

            <p>Try removing flash, restarting and then reinstalling it. If still no joy, there is a removal tool on the Adobe site so repeat the process using that tool.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Test flash here - <a href="https://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a> you should see a flash animation towards the top of the page, a small text box telling you which version you have installed, and a larger box telling you the latest versions. Visit the page in the browser you
 want flash for ( IE, or firefox etc if you use firefox ).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If flash is not running or is out of date, click the "Player Download Center" link and download the latest version of flash ( download/save to your desktop, as opposed to running it if you have already tried running it ) then once downloaded, run the update
 from your desktop. UNTICK the optional offer first IF you don't want to install that ( usually Chrome ).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can check what version of flash is installed by looking in &lt;start&gt; &lt;control panel&gt;
<em>( view by icons not categories ) </em>&lt;programs and features&gt;. In the list you should see 'Adobe Flash Player xx ActiveX' or&nbsp; 'Adobe Flash Player xx Plugin' &nbsp;with the version number. ActiveX is needed if you use IE, Plugin is needed if you use Firefox or
 Opera etc. The latest version at the moment is '11.9.900.152'.</p>

<p>
</p><p>first i will list down my spec of my devices</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">surprisingly, while i getting disconnect , all the cmd shows<strong> resquest times out</strong> , and after i saw my wifi is disconnected, the pngs show
<strong>destination host unreachable ,</strong> i more surely that issues comes from the devices not the router, due to solution that i have i tried ,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <strong>set the power options to Maximum Performance with all plan&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>2.<strong> unchecked the allows the computer to turn off this devices to save power that under power management&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>t</strong><strong>ried forget and reconnecting my wifi</strong> (every time disconnected from wifi , this is the fastest ways i can get back online)</p>
<p>4. <strong>disable and enable back the wireless adapter</strong></p>
<p>5. <strong>uninstall and reboots, or uninstall and scan hardware change</strong></p>
<p>6. <strong>update the driver based on lists given</strong></p>
<p>7. make my devices listen to 192.168.1.2 which nearly prior to 192.168.1.1 (ROUTER)</p>
<p>8. <strong>make the static ip and static dns</strong> (this is not working when i bring my laptop to friend house I have to change it back, so i changed its back to normal)</p>
<p>9. <strong>win+R + regedit and remove the fMinimizeConnections under group policy</strong> (seems not sloved my problems even changed to 1 or 0 or delete it, so i change it back to default )</p>
<p>10. <strong>Roll back my pc </strong>, this take me half days and caused me loss my working data (I hates this solution)</p>
<p>11. <strong>Forget other wifi </strong>, which left only the one that i willing to connect (not working )</p>
<p>12. <strong>disable wifi sense, disable hospot 2.0 networks, disable paid wifi services</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. <strong>disable / take back authorize OF firewall </strong>, which i don't let mcAfee to take control on my firewall</p>
<p>14. <strong>sit near to my ROUTER</strong> (this result less disconnection from wifi , but still happend)</p>
<p>15 <strong>try to uncheck the "connect automatically" that under wifi SSID , of other wifi but its magically checked back after i close the coloum and reopen it</strong></p>

            <p>IMO somewhat unwise, when you first boot the PC, untill any anti virus program, or internet connection is completed Outlook may give unintended err's</p>
<p>If you want to go ahead you place a shortcut to Outlook in the StartUp Folder (All Programs&gt;Startup)</p>

<h2>            Surface pen stops writing mid sentence</h2>
                    I use OneNote 2016 to take notes, complete homework, etc. I recently upgraded to a surface book 2, utilizing a 3rd gen surface pen. While writing the pen will randomly stop writing on my page. The only way to reset it to write again, is to lift my hand
 completely off the screen, then place it back down. This seems like a minor issue, but it is a huge inconvenience when I work on notes for hours at a time.

            Do you have the issue if you don't rest your hand on the screen? 
<br />
<br />1. If you don't have the issue when not resting your hand on the screen, this sounds similar to (but not the exact same issue) as a huge thread about the Surface Pro 2017 - your Surface Book 2 that has the same technology, thus the same issue(s) <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpronew-surfdrivers/surface-pro-intermittent-pen-inaccuracy-when-hand/28ef8566-0003-4c68-a964-6c2562423eb0">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/for...</a> 
<br />
<br />I know about the inconvenience as I have the 2017 Pro and have seen it myself. If I used an older Surface Pro 3 Pen, I have far less trouble. 
<br />
<br />Sadly, I don't have a solution other than to encourage you to file a report using the Feedback Hub App under Surface Book 2 and model your report after the one 
<br />
<br />2. if you still have this issue when not resting your hand on the screen, we can try some additional trouble shooting, but I'd like to see what happens when you try the test above first.

<h2>            Error 0x87160139 when attempting save as high def movie file...</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I have questions related to saving and sharing a movie

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I created a movie using numerous pictures, short videos, and music.&nbsp; It's roughly an hour long and currently still saved as a Windows Live Movie Maker "Project."&nbsp; What I'm attempting to do now is save it as a "Movie" for "High Definition Display(1080)."&nbsp; Once
 I have it saved as a movie file, I intend to take it to a friend who can burn it for me.&nbsp; However, the attempts to save keep failing.&nbsp; Sometimes it gets to as much as 45% complete (over the course of 4 hours!), but then I get an error message.&nbsp; The error code
 is "0x87160139" and the message reads, "Movie can't be saved.&nbsp; Find any missing files or remove the unusable items from your project then try again."&nbsp; This is infuriating because there aren't any missing files.&nbsp; I also have no knowledge of what is being categorized
 as an "unusable item."&nbsp; Please let me know how to fix whatever needs fixing so I can successfully save this.&nbsp; I've worked too long on this to hit such a miserable road block on the final step.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hi
<span>NukeFuego,<br />
<br />
The error that you received is being triggered due to some other Windows Live products installed in your computer that might have corrupted components in them making other products affected. To fix this, I suggest that you uninstall the whole Windows Live Essentials
 in your computer and reinstall it again to make sure that all related files of Windows Live products are updated. To do this, please refer to the Solution Article below:<br />

            Thank you for your review of my issue.&nbsp; Unfortunately, per your recommendation, I tried uninstalling Windows Live Essentials and re-installing and after attempting to save the project as a High Def file, I'm still getting the same error.&nbsp; After several
 hours of attempting to save and getting to about 45%, I get the same error message.<br />
<br />
Please further advise.&nbsp; I have a banquet approaching where I plan to distribute dvds of this video which I plan on having a friend burn once I have the high def file saves.<br />
<br />
Thanks,

            Hi <span>NukeFuego,</span><br />
<br />
For us to further investigate the issue, can you please provide&nbsp;what are the file types that you have used in your project? Please check the supported file types here:
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Windows Live Movie Maker File Types FAQ</strong></a><br />
<br />
<span>For now, please ensure that your video card drivers are up to date. Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver
 affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.
<br />
<br />
To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):
<br />
<br />
1. Click on <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button and type
<strong><span>dxdiag</span></strong> in the Search programs and files box and press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong> key on the keyboard.
<br />
2. Click on the <strong><span>Display</span></strong> tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.
<br />
3. If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.
<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks,
<br />

            While you are waiting on a response, you might want to diagnose which files are causing the problems.&nbsp; My guess would be the .m4a and .mov files.&nbsp; As a test you might try copying your project, removing those files from the project and seeing if it will
 then save.&nbsp; If that helps, then consider converting these files to .wma for audio and .wmv for video.

<h2>            Big issue in Windows 10 for internet</h2>
                    <p>I have big problem with Windows 10.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I reinstalled my Windows and upgraded to latest version build 17763. After updating, the internet works unstably! It always drops. I ping to my router, and, I try to ping to 8.8.8.8 and other IP (outside of LAN), sometimes it drops (time out).</p>
<p>Before reinstall windows, I have no this issue. Just only after reinstall and upgrading. I try to update all drivers to latest, but the issue isn't solved.
</p>
<p>My network works normally (I tested on other devices and other computer, they work ok). The problem only happens on my notebook.</p>
<p>When I visit a site, sometime I cannot reach or very slow (the status loading.....). It is really really bad! I almost cannot work anything with internet! Sometime, the speed is fast enough &gt;1MB/s for downloading, but sometime is 0.<br />
</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection.
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.

            Hi Dang,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia and I am glad to assist you today. 
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this situation. We would like to help you promptly.
<br />
<br />What are you DNS servers set to? 
<br />
<br />ipconfig /all should show your servers.
<br />
<br />also, if you could run the nslookup command with the server you are trying to resolve
<br />
<br />example:
<br />
<br />nslookup microsoft.com
<br />
<br />should give output similar to the following
<br />
<br />Non-authoritative answer:
<br />Name:    microsoft.com
<br />Addresses:  23.96.52.53

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

            I reinstall again, and upgrade again. But the problem is still not solved. If there is no effective method, I need to clear all the system disk completely to reinstall again. But I don't want to do that now, because I need to install many others. I tried
 to repair Windows, but it is not helpful!

    <title>Cannot rip CD, cannot change album info - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g&#42;lycra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot rip CD, cannot change album info</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 7 this month, my Windows Media Player experience is considerably worse than it was under Vista.<br />
<br />
I cannot rip CDs now - I get the error: "Windows Media Player cannot rip one or more tracks from the CD".<br />
<br />
I cannot set a rip location - under the Rip Music tab in Option, the location is blank and when I click on the Change button, nothing happens. No error, no dialog, no message, nothing.<br />
<br />
I cannot change album info - I choose the "Find album info" option, choose the album/track, click OK and nothing happens. No changes, nothing.<br />
<br />
Please someone help...!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h3> jameskdutton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accessing safe mode Windows 10 will not accept password for administrator account</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to access safe mode to repair a driver issue. When I attempt to go in to safe mode I am prompted to enter my administrator password. The system tells me it's not the correct password. I have confirmed with my written records I am entering my
 admin password. This is a home computer and I am the only operator of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the admin password after several unsuccessful attempts to access Safe mode and it refuses to accept the new password in the same way it did the old one. I have also noticed that even when logged in to the computer operating it when using programs
 I am often prompted to run them as the administrator even after I gone to advanced options and selected run as administrator.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not uncommon for Safe Mode to not accept a Password...</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your only option is to use Repair or Installation Media to turn Safe Mode off.. Then change your account to not use a login and try fixing your driver again...</p>
<p>

<p>I tried that early on but still when trying to enter safe mode it asks a password. In a lengthy exchange with Microsoft they still are not understanding my situation either and keep sending me instructions on resetting the account password. I am starting
 to think my only hope is to buy another operating system and install it on a freshly formatted HD. As I am also locked out of being able to reset this one because it wont accept a pw to access that feature either. For such a common and wide spread issue you
 would think they would take time to come up with a fix.</p>

<p>Yes removing the password on the local account is what I did I did. I rebooted and attempted to access safe mode and it asked for a password.&nbsp; I upgraded from windows 8.1 to 10 for free, so I&nbsp; have a license key but I would like to solve this issue because
 from reading many forums around the internet it's likely to re-appear on my machine as it has on many others that have gone through this. One thing I have not covered is that since going to version 1703 the windows 8.1 originally on my PC is gone and there
 is no longer that to restore or anything else on my restore partition. That issue has never been solved by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That sometimes happens with a upgrade to Win 10 with a machine running preinstalled Windows... It damages the Recovery Partition... However, the partition to restore to Win 8.1 is not the same as the one Win 10 uses...</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you in fact set your machine to not need a password and you are still getting asked, that is not a normal circumstance... Not accepting a password that is in use is a bit of a different issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is something from my notes concerning my experience turning off my password...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>First thing I found is that the Password CAN NOT be changed through Notifications... Accounts... Sign In Options... The page just locks... But you can try it...</p>

There is no option to change password with this method at least non are displayed to me. It simply shows the options of changing account type or manage another account again after selecting it as described above. If I click change account type I can only change
 it to user or leave it an admin account. I have previously tried a fix to add another account and go in to safe mode that way but it doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't do registry changes of any kind. To be honest it looks like I will never recover the windows 8.1 or the recovery patrician I used to have before the 1709 update. As with 99% of the world I didn't purchase a computer to become an IT tech. I could
 have saved a lot of my time and frustration had I just formatted and re-installed and cut my loss of 8.1 and move on so that's what I'm doing. I hope one day Microsoft develops a system of support that actually addresses issues like these. I have gone the
 endless support emails with them where they just never seem to get the problem. And no offense but coming here and following step after step of peoples best guesses doesn't seem to help many people either. Thanks, I'm out.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The only way you can&nbsp;display one login icon and&nbsp;still have access to all user accounts is to use the following procedure.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Driver Not Found&#34;&#63; When Pairing Nokia 360 Play Bluetooth Speaker</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>On our old HP Pavilion laptop, I just replaced the painfully slow stock Hitachi HD with a speedy 7200 rpm Western Digital Black 1TB HD. Start up times are WAY faster, yay!</p>
<p>I did a fresh install of Windows 7 Pro. </p>
<p>After quite a bit of trouble finding all the drivers, I can't get our favorite Nokia 360 Play bluetooth speakers to connect anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried clearing the speaker of all pairings and then repairing, but after the laptop detects the speaker and tries to find the drivers, via Windows Update I assume, (and which it always found them in the past before the new OS install) It now shows a
 red X during the device installation process, stating "Driver not found".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Bluetooth Radios in Device Manager, it shows "Generic Bluetooth Adapter" and "Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator". Both of which report as "working properly".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP driver page is totally confusing, showing numerous drivers for different adapters, even though the results are for my specific model.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a Microsoft driver that is missing? The laptop didn't come with an HP restore disc.

            Hi Kenneth.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If that popup came out of a webpage it sounds like a scam.  
<br />
<br />Run a full scans with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>.  Clean up anything they find, restart PC and then run both scans again until they come up clean.
<br />
<br />I would also uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />Depending upon what is found or not, I'll have other suggestions on what to do.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>If it shows up only in your browser, I agree with Greg, you have no virus. It's just a shenanigan that a WEB page can do. Definitely do not follow its instructions. You have to get off the page that is doing that, &amp; then clear the browser's Temporary Internet
 Files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - crash the browser...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Right-click the <strong>TaskBar</strong>, &amp; select "<strong>Task Manager</strong>".</p>
<p>(2) Right-click your <strong>browser</strong> in Task Manager, &amp; select "<strong>End task</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bd82acf-e019-49d6-8c42-f1055831cc22?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bd82acf-e019-49d6-8c42-f1055831cc22?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) Open the browser again - hopefully no longer on that page.</p>
<p>(4) Use the browser's settings to clear the TIFs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In Edge, that is "<strong>More (â¦ icon), Settings, Choose what to clear</strong>"...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90b8dd73-eb2d-42ee-9383-8d114bb2dee6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90b8dd73-eb2d-42ee-9383-8d114bb2dee6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You should be good after that - providing you never followed their instructions - but definitely run a virus scan anyway. I also agree Windows Defender is best. (However, it won't prevent this particular
<span>shenanigan </span>- it happened recently to me too!)</p>

            Hi Kenneth,
<br />
<br />Unplug your PC and if it is a laptop, remove the battery 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Plug your PC back in and if it is a laptop, replace the Battery 
<br />
<br />Start your PC and see if it boots into Windows 
<br />
<br />If not, let's see if we can get into the Windows Recovery Environment: 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Will XP Mode in Windows 7 enable use of 16-bit installer for 32-bit application&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently purchased a new computer running Windows 7 Home Premium, 64-bit.&nbsp; I am attempting to load some older legacy engineering design software and I'm running into issues.</p>
<p>The software in question is 32-bit software.&nbsp; I have confirmed this by investigating a working installation on an XP machine.&nbsp; In theory, then, the 32-bit software should run under Win 7 Home Premium 64 (right?)</p>
<p>However:&nbsp; the installer files for the software are 16-bit and very old.&nbsp; They worked fine in XP (SP2), but not working at all in Windows 7 HP.&nbsp; I've tried toggling all the "compatibility" settings in Win 7 HP 64 to no avail.&nbsp; I continue (not suprisingly)
 to get a software compatibility error message.</p>
<p>"The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running..."</p>
<p>Details from the installer file:</p>
<p>File description: Setup Launcher (setup.exe)<br />
Type: Application<br />
File Version: 3.0.101.0<br />
Product Name: InstallShield<br />
Product Verion: 3.00.101.0</p>
<p>I would consider upgrading to Win 7 Professional to get access to "XP Mode" if I could get a definitive answer as to whether it would enable use of this 16-bit installer file.</p>
<p>Can anyone answer this?</p>
<p>Once installed, the software in question is 32-bit and should run fine under Windows 7, so I think (?) I would only need XP Mode to run the installer...&nbsp;&nbsp; ...right?&nbsp; 32-bit software could be launched and run under Win 7.&nbsp; Is there any other workaround available
 to run 16-bit installer .exe files such as this one?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
-Jason</p>

news:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** .com...</div>
<p>So, if I am understanding this correctly:&nbsp; Use of XP Mode, available to me if I pay for upgrade to Win7 Pro 64, would allow me to run the 16-bit installer program for my 32-bit application, but I would only be able to run the 32-bit application while using
 XP mode?&nbsp; Is that about right?</p>
<p><strong>YES</strong></p>
<p>This application (16-bit installer) is a companion application for another 32-bit application that I have already successfully (!) installed and can run in the Win 7 Home Prem environment.&nbsp; In other words, "main" application (32-bit functional in Win 7)
 has to be running and then this second software (w. 16-bit installer) has to be run "on top" of main app, launched from within main application.&nbsp; Is this possible given the constraints described above?</p>
<p><strong>You would have to install the 'main' application in XP also and run it all in XP mode</strong>.</p>
<p>Seems odd that 32-bit software would be constrained to run in XP Mode, even though many 32-bit apps run quite nicely in Win 7.&nbsp; This is relatively simple software.&nbsp; I would just try it, but I just broke the bank on my new Win7 Computer and other MS software,
 so I'm having some heartburn over paying for the upgrade to 7Pro without having some idea as to whether it will work.&nbsp; Otherwise I really have no need for 7Pro.</p>
<p><strong>It's not (so constrained).&nbsp; As you correctly noted, the issue is the 16 bit installer.&nbsp; If the software is 'relatively simple' it might be possible to manually set it up to run in Windows 7 without the installer.&nbsp; This would involve
 figuring out what registry entries it needs and what files (e.g. dll's) it may access.&nbsp; That would require monitoring all changes made in XP when the install is run and would require some expertise.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you can run the software in XP mode in Windows 7, it seems like that should be satisfactory and simpler solution.</strong></p>
<p>Any help much appreciated!</p>

            Hi Kenny,<br /><br />It's hard to determine from the website but do they have a specific driver for windows 10?<br /><br />It looks like vista is the latest driver on that site. You may need to speak to their support department to confirm this and obtain a working driver forWindows 10

    <title>Windows 10 asks for activation after motherboard change - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 asks for activation after motherboard change</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I have had to change my desktop's motherboard after it started to fail up to a point where I had trouble with starting it up and backing&nbsp;up my files via USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I changed the motherboard, windows keeps&nbsp;asking me to activate it which confused me because I thought I already activated it over a couple of years ago.
</p>
<p>I tried to use the troubleshooter which lead me to the option to activate windows after a hardware change, however, it could only find my&nbsp;laptop, not my desktop. My desktop was signed in with my Microsoft account before and after the upgrade, so I assumed
 it would recognise it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently at a loss here, does anyone have any suggestion on how to fix this?</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Depending on the type of Windows 10 license you have installed, you might be able to transfer it to a new computer if needed. Over the years, Microsoft has distributed its desktop operating system through different market channels. New computers will often come preinstalled with an OEM license. There are many other channels Microsoft distributes Windows in, these include Retail, Volume License, Academic, and subgroups such as Upgrade licenses. Check these links, I hope it helps.

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if that does not help, you would have to call Microsoft Support.
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)

<p>Hey there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop isn't branded or build by any OEM. I built it myself about six years ago and I installed it with a retail version of Windows 7 (Which had a licence code and a DVD).
</p>
<p>When Microsoft announced the free upgrade to Windows 10, I just proceeded with the upgrade, but they didn't give me any sort of licence code for Windows 10, it seemed to be connected with my Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember having to reinstall the entire thing to a new hard drive after my old one began to show S.M.A.R.T. errors but it was so easy setting the whole thing back up, which basically meant logging into my Microsoft account and that was it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand why my Microsoft account isn't activating Windows 10 on my desktop. I still have the Windows 7 disc and the licence code for it, just in case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When installing Windows 10, the digital license associates itself with your PCâs hardware. So, if you make significant changes, such as replacing your
 motherboard, Windows will no longer find a license that matches your PC.</span></p>

    <title>How Do I &#34;Reset&#34; Hard Drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajhdmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Do I &#34;Reset&#34; Hard Drive&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I am currently debating upgrading to Windows 8.x from Windows 7 Home. What I am wondering is if there is a way to completely reset my hard drive to the factory settings. Since I have gotten my laptop, I have accidentally made multiple partitions and installed
 Ubuntu at one point, but what I want to do is uninstall everything and erase all partitions so I can basically start over with Windows 8. However, I know that if I format the hard drive completely, it will be unusable because there will be no firmware. So,
 how can I safely do this without removing the firmware?<br />
Thanks.<br />
PS: I have created so many partitions that I don't know which ones are safe to uninstall and I have had to re-add the Windows boot manager after the Ubuntu one wrote over it, which may have put it on a different partition.<br />
Also, this is the partition screen, if this helps. I am sorry if I left out any information.<br />

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<span>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Dell, press F8 on the keyboard until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears on the screen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</span><span>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

            Ok, thank you. And this will remove all of the partitions I created? (Including the Ubuntu install I no longer use?)<br />
Also, I have Office 2010 on my PC. Is there a way to transfer it over after wiping the drive? I do not have an install disc, for I downloaded it from the Microsoft website. I am not willing to buy Office again, be it 2010 or 2013.<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<p><span>Hey Atrane21,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per Aiptek website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aiptek.com/drivers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.aiptek.com/drivers.htm</span></a>, the camera
 doesnât have Windows 7 support and there are no drivers for Windows 7 or for Vista. As such all the features may necessarily work correctly in Windows 7. If the compatibility mode failed to work, then youâd probably want to get in touch with Aiptek and see
 if they have any workaround to get the webcam working on your computer.</span></p>

<p>I have the same issue and it buffers every 15 seconds so it makes it damn near impossible to watch a movie. &nbsp;Netflix and HBO GO never buffer for me, so not sure if this is Xbox issue or Starz issue. &nbsp;It is however annoying and since the iPhone app works
 great on the same network with no issues, I feel this has to be an xbox problem.</p>

<h2>            when I receive a notification, my whole screen turns a &#34;negative color&#34; on me for a split second. Extremely annoying.</h2>
                    <p>So, as the title states when a notification comes in, my screen goes negative. How do i fix this???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Happens with all notifications.</p>
<p>- Toshiba Satellite Radius 12 P25W.</p>
<p>- Has happened with all builds.</p>
<p>- Laptop came with windows 10.</p>
<p>- Did a factory reset and still occurs.</p>
<p>- Happens on any application at any time.</p>
<p>- The taskbar is unaffected, meaning, the colors do not change on anything but the currently opened window.</p>
<p>- Display driver has been updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i managed to grab a screenshot of it.</p>

<h2>            Desktop Icon Text missing</h2>
                    I really wish I could come up with a good way to describe this, so I need to show a screenie of it. I installed a hotfix, next thing you know, all my desktop icon text disappeared. It's still there, when you rename, it pops back up, and when you view in
 explorer, its all present. Just can't see the text on the desktop.<br />
<br />
Anyone ever run into this, or know how to fix it?<br />

<p><strong><span>Hi Buzzedword,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Which hotfix have you installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to use the below mentioned methods and check if these help -<br />
</span><span><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>I would suggest you to I would suggest you to perform an SFC scan and then check-<br />
</span></span><span><strong><span>Perform a SFC Scan</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>sfc /scannow&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a><br />
</span><span><br />
<span><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong>if the issue persists, I would suggest you to refer to the below mentioned link to fix a corrupted user profile and follow the steps provided-<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a></span></p>

<p><span><span>Check if the issue appears in the new user account. You may also check after logging in as an administrator.
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:
<br />
<span>If the hotfix you have installed is not very critical for your computer then you may use the below mentioned steps for system restore -</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore
 the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note: When you use System restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed
 are removed. It is possible that your hotfix files may get removed.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To do this, there must be a System Restore point at which the logon was successful. Follow the steps mentioned below to perform
 system restore â</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, type
<strong>system restore</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>System Restore</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list.<span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span><br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>System Restore</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click
<strong>next</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
<strong>next</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
</span><span>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />

            Still nothing after attempting this. The desktop labels are still missing. Still has it that if I try to rename, the label pops right back up but disappears after confirming.<br />
<br />
Could this be a spacing issue, or some sort of toggle that might have been accidentally tripped?

            <p>Hi Luise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many reasons behind this concern. Before we go to a more in-depth troubleshooting can you try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Checking if there is updated firmware of your Logitech 602.</p>
<p>- Try to use a different mouse.</p>
<p>- Do a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a clean boot isolate software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
