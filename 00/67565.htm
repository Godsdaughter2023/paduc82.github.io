<h2>            Edge won&#39;t remember Gmail passwords</h2>
                    Its really frustrating since I like the new Microsoft browser very much but it cannot remember my passwords. I already setup it to remember passwords but it didn't even import them from explorer like it did for other saved passwords.&nbsp;

    <title>Sudden network connection problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m3ikl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sudden network connection problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>yesterday I bought a XBox 360 and installed it without problems. I was able to make a software update and I could connect to XBox Live without problems. I also downloaded the car packs for Forza Horizon which worked fine. I was connected all the time I was
 playing, because all my achievements were compared to other players which doesn't work if there is no internet connection.</p>
<p>Today when I turned on the XBox360 it told me it can't connect to XBox live. First I ran a connection test where the problem was that the 360 didn't get an IP address (it's set to DHCP). OK, no problem. I switched to manual configuration and set IP, Subnet,
 Gateway and DNS. Now the LAN connect worked, but it told me the internet connection can't be established. The diagnostic messages varied all the time. Sometimes it was the "wrong MTU" message, or I saw the "reset network hardware and modem for 30 seconds"
 message. But this all doesn't make sense. I also have a PC next to the XBox360, so I unplugged the network cable from the 360, put it into the network port of the PC and tested what's happening: the PC got an IP address immediately and was able to ping LAN
 IPs, WAN IPs and domain names of several websites. So I would say the network cable up to the 360 works fine.<br />
My network is set up properly (I'm doing this stuff also on the job), my PCs work fine, I never had problems with this stuff.</p>
<p>Here's some info about my configuration:</p>
<p>Router: Linksys WRT54GL w/ DD-WRT firmware<br />
Configuration:<br />
IP: 192.168.0.111<br />
Subnet: 255.255.255.0<br />
DHCP Server: on, beginning at 192.168.0.180 w/ lease of 1440 mins<br />
DNS via DHCP: 192.168.0.111<br />
MTU for internet connection is 1492.</p>
<p>When the XBox360 ist set to automatic IP it doesn't get one, it shows a 169.x.x.x IP and tells me there is a connection problem.<br />
After playing Forza Horizon for a while today and checked back to the settings it showed up a 192.168.0.x address, but when I tried to connect to XBox Live again it lost this IP and switched back to a 169.x.x.x address.</p>
<p>When using manual mode the connection to the LAN is successful, but then I get an error when connecting to the internet.<br />
I used these manual settings:</p>
<p>IP: 192.168.0.28 (isn't used by another device, so it should work)<br />
Subnet: 255.255.255.0<br />
Gateway: 192.168.0.111<br />
DNS: 192.168.0.111<br />
<br />
I am not able to ping the XBox from a PC when using these manual settings. I don't know if this should work or not, but most network devices respond to pings, so I gave it a try.</p>
<p>I also tried these steps:<br />
- resetting XBox360 network settings to factory defaults<br />
- restarting the router<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So what could be the problem with the XBox360? And why did it work perfect yesterday and today there is no chance of connecting to the internet?<br />
What else can I try? <br />
<br />
Thanks for help!</p>
<p>Regards, M3ikl<br />
<br />

            <p>Hey there M3ikl!</p>
<p>Could you post up the make and model of your modem as well.<br /><br />If you look up the DHCP server on your router what is the IP pool starting and ending address?<br /><br />Make sure UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) on your router is enabled.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you restore your Xbox network settings to defaults and restart your console. Could you tell us what the IP address the Xbox obtains from the DHCP server or if its an unusable 169 IP address.<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi taidara,</p>
<p>the modem is a Turbolink 1203 by sphairon which I got from my ISP (M-Net in Germany).</p>
<p>The DHCP range begins at 192.168.0.180 and is set to a maximum of 50 users, so it would stop at 192.168.0.229 if I calculated correctly.</p>
<p>The UPnP function in the router was disabled. I set it to enabled.</p>
<p>I just checked how many IPs are in the DHCP pool at the moment and saw an interesting value:</p>
<p>The only DHCP IP is 192.168.0.185. Hostname is unknown, but the MAC address starts with 7C:1E:52 which belongs to Microsoft. I will check if the MAC address belongs to the XBox 360. Perhaps the lease of 1440 mins (= 24 hrs) is too long for the XBox? Something
 very strange is, that the PC I used some hours ago isn't listed in the DHCP lease list (the lease isn't over at the moment), but the lease of which I think is from the XBox was from one day before which would be expired is still listed. It is usual that the
 PC from where I am posting right now isn't listed, it has a static IP.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I can tell you more about these strange DHCP values and which IP the XBox got when I restarted it and resetted the settings to default. It's 1 am here now and I need some sleep ;-)</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>Regards, M3ikl</p>

<p>Hi taidara,</p>
<p>now it works!</p>
<p>My suggestion was right, the MAC address of which I thought belongs to the XBox really belongs to it.</p>
<p>The behaviour was really interesting: After turning on the XBox360 today it got 192.168.0.185, that's the IP address from the DHCP pool which it got on monday the first time I started it.</p>
<p>Before I tried to connect to XBox Live I did a connection test, and what happened? IP address error, and the IP switched from 192.168.0.185 to a 169.x.x.x. So the problem seems clear: The DHCP server of DD-WRT seems to have problems with the XBox 360, or
 I have settings which don't work with the console.</p>
<p>To make it short: I set the 360 to a static IP, deleted the DHCP lease of the console's MAC address and voila: it works perfectly!</p>
<p>Thanks again for your hints, because I would have never looked in the DHCP pool which lead me to the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Regards, M3ikl</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t create a system image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan in seattle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t create a system image</h2>
                    Apologies for not having all the exact language right in this question, I'm away from my computer, but I wanted to get a question up there as soon as possible. I think there's enough to go on here.<br />
<br />
I recently did a clean reinstall of Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 64-bit on my Dell XPS 8000 desktop. I ran the reinstall from a USB drive using files created from the appropriate ISO file downloaded from Digital River. Now that everything is newly installed and
 all updates have been applied, I'd like to create a system image on my external drive to preserve the system as it is now, in case I want to refresh the system from time to time as things get gunked up.<br />
<br />
I have a Fantom 2TB GreenDrive, which I just formatted for NTFS, 4096 (whatever) based on some other articles about people having similar trouble creating system images. The hard drive of my computer is partitioned into three sectors: Recovery (about 1 GB),
 something else (about 90 MB I think), and the C: drive (about 1 TB). These were the default settings when I reinstalled Windows, and after thinking about deleting the smaller partitions I decided just to leave everything alone.<br />
<br />
When I try to create a system image, the backup program says it wants to include both the C: drive and the Recovery partition; there does not appear to be a way to modify this to include only&nbsp;the C: drive. Then when trying to create the system image, after
 a minute or so I get an error message, I believe 0x8078002A, saying there was an I/O device error. If I watch the detailed view of the system image creation process with the green progress bar, this seems to happen as soon as it tries to do something with
 the Recovery partition.<br />
<br />
So my question is, is there a way to create a system image of just the C: drive (and not the Recovery partition), or would that defeat the purpose of creating a system image at all? And related to that, if you can't create a system image without including the
 Recovery partition, is there some other setting or thing I can do so that I can create a system image successfully?<br />
<br />
I also created a system restore point that I'm hoping I can preserve long-term, but that might not be quite as good a solution as having an externally saved system image that I can always roll everything back to if need be. I also created a system repair disc
 on a DVD (would have done a CD but didn't know how much space I would need), but I'm not even sure if that is of any use without also having a system image.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions you might have.

            We regularly see such reports in this forum: The native image creation process is temperamental and lacks flexibility. Sometimes the process fails outright, sometimes it will not do what you want, sometimes it refuses to recognise the target partition.

<p>Thanks well in some ways this is somewhat comforting in that I didn't do something wrong when reinstalling Windows. Most crucial to me though is that I be able to back up all my data (photos, music), but I would like to be able to roll back the entire system
 occasionally too if it's not too much hassle. I will check out True Image as a possible solution.</p>

<p>Images are not suitable to back up your pics and music files. You should use a dedicated data backup tool.</p>

            Your posts seem to be conflicting.
<br />On one side you say you are being asked to Restart in Start. 
<br />If you are trying the ISO method, it would restart automatically-you would not be asked.
<br />Does the Setup.exe file in ISO open?(Leave the restart prompt in Start as it is a bug)

<p>i basically just click on the media creation tool exe and a pop up opens not the normal purple screen saying exactly this - there was a problem starting setup. close the tool, restart your pc, then run the tool again. - but whenever i restart and&nbsp; run it
 agin it just says the same thing</p>

<h2>            Wedge Touch Mouse - Pairing With Surface PC&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>Hi have a Surface Pro 3 and a Surface Pro 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can paid the Wedge Touch Mouse with each one via Bluetooth and it gets discovered. However, if I pair the Wedge mouse with the Surface Pro 3, when I turn it off and turn on the Surface Pro 1, the Wedge mouse which had previously been paired with the Surface
 Pro 1&nbsp;doesn't go active. I can see it in the Bluetooth devices as <strong>Wedge Mouse Paired</strong>, but it does not function.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have to disconnect the Wedge mouse device via the screen, then re-pair it again. It finds it fine and then works. Same exact thing happens when I go back to the Surface Pro 3, it shows paired, but won't connect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both devices reflect that the Wedge Mouse was paired successfully, but it only works with the last Surface PC that I paired it with.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled the mouse drivers in Device Manager from both PC's and allowed them to be re-installed. I also checked for updated drivers and not were found.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing incorrectly?</p>

<p>Hi Skier7667,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be by design. Has it ever worked before? Do you have another Bluetooth device to help us isolate the issue? Does it connect automatically if you do this:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Connect the mouse on your Surface Pro 3. Restart the device and observe if the issue persists.</li><li>Do the same with your Surface Pro 1.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to change Bluetooth service to automatic. Go to <strong>Services </strong>
&gt; <strong>Bluetooth Support Service</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            How do I make Windows 10 not lock while inactive&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a setting in Win10 where I can make it not lock while I'm not using it? If there is, I can't find it. If I don't touch&nbsp;my laptop's&nbsp;mouse pad, it'll lock after 5 minutes and I have to unlock it. I know Win8&nbsp;had a setting for this and I want to
 set it to Never&nbsp;or 30min&nbsp;when I'm downloading something.

<p>Why can't I activate Windows?</p>
</b>
<p>If you received a message saying that Windows couldn't be activated, here are a few reasons why it might not have worked, and some things you can try to fix the problem.</p>
<b>
<p>You upgraded to Windows 8, but didn't have a previous version of Windows installed (error 0xC004F061)</p>
</b>
<p>If you see error 0xC004F061 when you try to activate Windows 8, it means that you're using a product key for an upgrade version of Windows 8 and a previous version of Windows wasn't on your PC when Windows 8 was installed. To install an upgrade version of
 Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>contact support</u></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>A different version of Windows or product key might have been used as part of a repair</p>
</b>
<p>If you took your PC to a repair shop or to a friend who builds and fixes PCs, it's possible that a different version of Windows was installed to complete a repair. Or if the repair shop or your friend used a different product key for your PC, that key might
 be blocked if it was used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>If Windows was activated before you took it to the repair shop or your friend, then re-entering the product key that came with your PC or original copy of Windows might solve the problem. You can also try reinstalling your original version of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>One copy of Windows might have been installed on multiple PCs</p>
</b>
<p>If you have one copy of Windows and installed it on more than one PC, activation might not work because the product key has already been used on another PC, or it's being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Normally, the rule
 to follow for most copies of Windows is 1:1, meaning that one copy of Windows can be installed only on one PC.</p>
<p>If your product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow, you'll need to buy a product key for each one of your PCs in order to activate them.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Counterfeit software</p>
</b>
<p>If you have a counterfeit copy of Windows that wasn't published and licensed by Microsoft, activation won't work because Microsoft won't be able to create a match between your PC's hardware profile and your 25-character product key.</p>
<p>Microsoft's <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=71144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>How to Tell</u></a> website can help you figure out if your copy of Windows is counterfeit. If it is, you'll probably need to
 buy a new copy of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Used PC</p>
</b>
<p>If you bought a used PC with Windows already installed on it, it's possible that the product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>You might need to ask the seller you bought the used PC from for the original Windows DVD and product key. If the DVD and product key aren't available, or if you tried them and still can't activate, you might need to buy a new key.

            I recently bought a laptop with windows 8 on it and found this website when learning more about windows 8 products http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs I signed up and I got a key for the Windows media center pack. Could someone verify
 that this is legit because my new laptop is the only Microsoft product aside from an Xbox 360. I have gone through the list you replied and the only thing I can think it would be is where I got the key from.<br />

<h2>            Halo 3 language confusion</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought and downloaded Halo 3 from the Marketplace and it was working fine until I started playing the campaign. Actually, there's nothing wrong with the game itself--it works as it should--but for some reason the audio is all in Spanish. The menus
 are in English, so that's fine, but whenever a character speaks it's in Spanish. I don't speak Spanish, so the game is really confusing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm annoyed because there was no indication what-so-ever that my version of the game would have Spanish audio, and I would like to know if there is a way to get a 100% English version. If I need to download another version of the game, would I have to pay
 for it again or, since I've already paid for the semi-Spanish version, would I get the English version for free?</p>

<p>The first page shows all rhe supported languages however all games get labeled with the nationally supportrd language of the region</p>
<p>Even if you change to usa or engliand it won work because of the region locks unless you live there</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 takes 6&#43; minutes to boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;recieving my computer back from&nbsp;the repair shop (a non related issue--replacing a bad water pump), I started&nbsp; up my computer, and now it takes about 6.5 minutes to boot (It goes through the initial POST without issue) and then gets stuck on the "Starting
 Windows" screen for about 6 minutes.&nbsp;Eventually, the little windows animation plays and it goes to the login screen. From there it is no problem, and all of my programs seem to run fine. It is just the infuriating wait during&nbsp;startup&nbsp;that is making me crazy.
 (It previously booted in about a minute). </p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading the forums here, I have tried:</p>
<p>- The repair function when you hit the "F8" key</p>
<p>- To boot in Safe Mode (no effect--it takes the same ammount of time in safe mode)</p>
<p>- restore (no effect)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;boot from&nbsp;last&nbsp;good configuration (no effect)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;"clean boot" (No effect)</p>
<p>- Scannow (nothing found)</p>
<p>- Memory Test (no errors) </p>
<p>- Reinstalled Windows from my disk (no effect)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would greatly appreciated.</p>

            Jessie, to troubleshoot problems related to hardware devices not working properly, you need to first check whetther the software you have installed for&nbsp;a particular hardware is working with the current operating system to provide the features showcased
 by the device, which we commonly refer to it as a "Driver".<br />
<br />
You can get more information about the driver and your hardware's functionality from Device Manager.<br />
To open Device manager,<br />
Go to Start &gt; Run, and type msinfo32. then expand the Components tree and choose Sound device or<br />
<br />
Go to Control Panel &gt; Device Manager -&gt; scroll down through it to find your hardware listed, check&nbsp;if the status of hardware says working fine and if it is not, probably you will have a red or&nbsp;a yellow flag beside it.<br />
<br />
If you have a yellow flag beside to it, you need to worry much as you must just update your drivers and the problem is not related to your hardware but software.<br />
<br />
But, if you have a red flag beside to it please check with your device manufacturer as the problem could be severe and related to hardware.<br />
<br />
In your case, by updating&nbsp;drivers for your sound card device which is compatible with Windows 7 should fix the issue. Look for any updates or compatible drivers from your manufacturer's website.<br />
<br />
Don't worry much, these are common issues and can be fixed by applying a bit of simple logic.<br />
<br />
Goodluck.<br />
<br />

<p>Smwutches hit it right on the nose. You can still "buy" and download free stuff on your console without any credit card attached, however, so you can still take advantage of all the free demos and promotions like Games with Gold.

<h2>            page fault in a nonpaged area &#40;em008 64.5059.dat&#41;</h2>
                    Hello , <br />
This is the first time I am writing to Microsoft concerning any problem because I'm fedup with this problem now. Usually , I deal with any errors / BSOD or any faults occuring to my system / O/S. But this is the first time ever , I'm experiencing such sadness
 and madness . <br />
It hasn't been too long since I bought my new Dell Inspiron 15R with Windows 8 pre-installed. I upgared to Windows 8 Pro , and it has been working quite well. I have reformatted my O/S about 4 times in 2 weeks period. The one and only reason is "Page Fault
 in Nonpaged area" error , which I have been facing from time to time whenever a certain thing is installed and then I restart. Just for the record , I installed a new Windows 8 theme , but after the "Please wait" screen , the visual went Black with only my
 cursor visible. So , I restarted my system and it showed the Lock screen and login screen , I logged in and still the black screen. I tried to open "Task Manager" , tried WIN + D , WIN + P , what not , everything went in vain. So ,&nbsp; I restarted again and there
 it was again ... the same Page fault error . Each time it showed up , the preview was somewhat like :<br />
<br />
PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA (em.008 64.5059.dat),&nbsp; the em.008 was intact but the digits after that kept changing in the BSOD after each reboot. I couldn't even find a file with that name entering in safe mode.<br />
This problem had occured three times before , so after the previous system format , I turned off the Fast Startup and Automatic Updates for safety measures as well as they led to the "Black Screen after Restarting" problem . It resolved that problem.<br />
I have tried , "System Restore" , "chkdsk" , "Clean boot" and uninstalling my graphic drivers as well but the problem is still intact , which again leaves me to my only option "Reformatting" my system again..
<br />
Please , help me solve this problem ASAP with step wise details .<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Yours Truly<br />

            I have been installing only "Important Updates" before my previous reformatting of Win 8 O/S. And it was one of those 163 - 165 MB update which required update and caused the "Black Login Screen Error" 2 times which led to formatting.&nbsp;<br />
And as for the software I use , I have been using them over Windows XP , Windows 7 on my other pc and laptop for around 2 to 3 years now . I am pretty sure , the softwares I installed didn't cause the problem of "Page fault in nonpaged area".&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for your advice though.

            Hi Harshit,<br />
<br />
This problem may occur if the computer is infected with a variant of the HaxDoor virus.
<br />
<br />
The HaxDoor virus creates a hidden process. Additionally, the virus hides files and registry keys. The executable file name of the HaxDoor virus may vary, but the file name is frequently Mszx23.exe. Many variants of this virus put a driver that is named Vdmt16.sys
 or Vdnt32.sys on the computer. This driver is used to hide the virus process. The HaxDoor virus variants can restore these files if you delete them.
<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to run online virus scan using Microsoft safety scanner.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Problems with boot&#47;startup</h2>
                    <p>Back then it was normal everything workouted well. Windows keep bugging me about an update, &nbsp;then the problem started while booting i can see the motherboars logo then the black screen with microsoft on top and a spinning dots indicating it was loading i
 was surprised in what happens next. After the microsoft logo a black screen followed with the same loading dots and it took 1-3 mins before another please wait with the spinning circle in the center, then followed by the lock screen when i type my password
 the censored letter (dots) delays a bit when it log ins its terribly slow then after a couple minutes its back to its normal speed. Then i restarted it must be a malfunction, same thing happened. (Slow boot, laggy startup) i tried updating to the latest windows
 version still the same. &nbsp;I need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The solutions ive made was :<br />
</p>
<p>1. Update to windows</p>
<p>2. Disabled unnecessary startup files.</p>
<p>3. Changed the ram paging ( in the control panel)</p>
<p>4. Uninstalled my avast antivirus</p>
<p>5. Cleaned the hardrives (disk cleanup)</p>
<p>6. Ran couples of antiviruses and uninstalls them again due to no threats found&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Restarted a ton of times&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Shut down and on a ton of times.</p>
<p>9. Removed the usb cables the mouse the keyboard and the ethernet cable and restarted again.</p>

            Unfortiunately it looks you are going to have to reinstall.  You can reinstall without losing data.
<br />Similar procedure as before 
<br />1.	 Start your PC
<br />2.	As Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down
<br />Do this twice
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />You will then have 3 options:
<br />1.	Keep my files and Apps
<br />2.	Keep my files
<br />3.	Keep nothing
<br />Select the option that appropriate for what you need and click Reset

    <title>how to decrypt efs encrypted files with efs related master keys not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pgdarkness  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to decrypt efs encrypted files with efs related master keys not the account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with efs, here it is;</p>
<p>I've encrypted some of my files with windows 7 ultimate 32 bit, and make a backup of windows user account certificate.</p>
<p>After that for a reason I decided to get a fresh install of windows, so I did and using my backup, accessing my encrypted files was easy.</p>
<p>But, after a while, I decrypt the files and encrypt them again and was thinking that my old backup of certification would work this time again ( my mistake ), also windows did not offer to make a new one, So I didnt.</p>
<p>and again after that, I install a fresh windows 7 ultimate 32 bit, note that I quick format the C partition.</p>
<p>Now I cannot access the files, and the question is "Can I ReGain Access having these :"</p>
<p>1- I have Partition C recovered using Phoenix Data Recovery ( God Bless You GUYS ), but&nbsp;I dont think replacing recovered files Into Partion C using 3rd OS would bring my previous installation of windows back, knowing that recovery guarantees ~50 - 90 % of
 files to be recovered. But EFS Data Related Files Should be OK.</p>
<p>2- Using Advanced EFS Data Recovery 4.42 ( Thanks to Elcomsoft ), and knowing the User name And password, and scanning the recovered files, bring the Master Key Needed to decrypted files back, But I could Not Decrypt Files Larger Than 1 MB for any reason.</p>
<p>I may reask the question, "If Advanced EFS Data Recovery having partion C recovered Files And User Name+Password of Account which encrypted the files, Can Decrypt the files, How Can I do it without AEFSDR?"</p>
<p>Its very important issu, and Im all ears for any idea of any kind, So Please Advise me!</p>
<p>thanks.</p>
