<h2>            how can I get back my msn.com email account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I removed an msn.com email alias from my Microsoft account for some reason, remaining a non Microsoft email address associated with that account as primary alias. Now I can no longer access my msn.com email. I've tried all steps according to help from Microsoft
 support (thank him/her so much for spending a lot of time with that), but still can't get my account back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I log in using the non Microsoft email address, the outlook.com says something went wrong, simply because that's not a Microsoft email account;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I tried to sign up for MSN premium service, with the original @msn.com email address as a new account, paying $10 per month. But everytime the sign up progress is ALMOST done and I fill my name in the
<span style="font-weight: bold">
Review and sign the agreements</span>&nbsp;box, the sign up page says:</p>
<ul>
<span>
<span>
<li>The e-mail address that was entered was not recognized. It must start with a letter and can only include numbers, letters and underscores. Please retype your member name or e-mail address.</li></span></ul>
<p>&nbsp;I'm sure the email address is correct, it meets all criteria of the email name. So I'm wondering, if that @msn.com email address still exist in msn.com system but is removed from the new Microsoft authentication system?<br />
</p>
<p>3. I tried to send an email using Gmail to this @msn.com address but got the error message</p>
<span>The response was:</span><br />
<span>The response was:</span><br />
<p>550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>4. I also tried to call MSN support phone number but was not answered after more than 1 hour waiting with the music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get my @msn.com email back? It's so important to me that all my bank and job accounts are associated to this account while not all of them can be changed to another email address. Please help!&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Brian, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The reason why you can't use your email independently is because of MSN emails are merged to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the reason why an alias was made. It allows other email clients to be integrated to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest having your MSN email added back to your Microsoft account to resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12407/microsoft-account-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to help you manage aliases on your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have other queries, let us know.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the reply! My problem was, the @msn.com email was no longer available, and the only domain name from Microsoft that can be added to existing microsoft account as alias is @outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I waited 60 days from the day I removed the @msn.com alias, then tried again to get a new @msn.com email address (it's a paid service by msn), this time the system let me go thru!! Finally I got my old email address back, as a new account. Thus, the problem
 has been fixed by time, and of course, myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The conclusion is, the "remove alias" function is devastating. Once removed, the email address becomes unavailable for 60 days, without being able to undo, even the technical support won't (or "can't") do anything to fix it. While closing an account gives
 user 60 days to reopen and keeps everything. Microsoft really should change this horrible policy.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com Won&#39;t Import Email Folders from Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Outlook 2013 and Outlook.com.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com will not import my email folders from Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I spent 4 hours on the phone today with a Microsoft technician.&nbsp; After trying a myriad of things he confirmed that it is a problem with Outlook.com.&nbsp; The Microsoft technician was an Office
 365 specialist.&nbsp; The problem does not occur in Office 365 accounts.&nbsp; Only with Outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to import an email&nbsp;folder from Outlook 2013 to Outlook.com I am getting the following error message...</p>
<p>"The folders your are trying to change do not support this operation.&nbsp; Sorry, Exchange ActiveSync doesn't support what you're trying to do."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes no sense that Outlook.com would not allow importing of email folders from Outlook 2013.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this problem?&nbsp; And, do you know a fix?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<h2>            LG optimus 7 doesn&#39;t respond anymore</h2>
                    Since yesterday my phone constantly keeps asking to connect to a PC. (It alternavely shows the LG-logo for a couple of seconds and then for a minute or so the drawing that shows a WP7 phone, a usb-cable and an arrow pointing to a laptop).&nbsp;
<div>When i connect my WP7 phone to my laptop Zune automaticaly starts and suggest a have to reset my phone and upload a previous Update.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Zune starts withe first step of resetting the phone, which takes lake 30 minutes, and when the first step is finished it looks like it skips over the 2nd and 3d step and it says "Resetting Complete, you may switch of your phone now".&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've done this resetting thing already 4 times and still my phone just keeps saying i should connect to the pc and then it starts all over again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any solutions about this? I don't want to have send it back to the online-shop i bought it because that would mean i'd lose my phone for more than a month...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you can help me i'd really appreciate it!!&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you very much!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your post.</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand, the phone does not want to start, so I think a thing to try is to perform a factory reset. Please notice, that when you do this you will lose everything that is on the phone but there is a chance that the phone will start to work again.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you used a windows live ID on your phone, you contacts are saved. To check that, please go to:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.live.com</a></span></p>
<p><span>And log in with your WLID and password that you used on your windows phone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To perform a factory reset: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Turn the power off. </span></li><li><span>Hold down the VOLUME + &amp; – and the camera button and keep pressing them
</span></li><li><span>Then, press the Power button and hold it till the phone vibrates after that let it go - a menu should pop up</span>
</li><li><span>Your LG Optimus 7 will turn on </span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please let us know if this helped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kind regards</span></p>

<h3> erikd_  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I create the new calendars in outlook 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Pls don't tell me the obvious and well documented "File --&gt; New" solution as it does not work for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I get the following error msg when trying to create a new calendar in the software version of Outlook 2013, "Cannot create the folder. Calendar, task and
 contact folders cannot be created in Exchange ActiveSync accounts"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to get this whenever I try to organize my calendars, tasks and contacts by importing all my old blackberry info.&nbsp; Why on earth does Outlook 2013 have these commands when they don't let you do what you're trying to do?&nbsp; It's very frustrating and I'm
 starting to regret purchasing Outlook due to the constant frustrations trying to do seemingly simple tasks like, create a new calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any info on why 2013 is so stubborn.&nbsp; thank you in advance</p>

 more functionality in the web version vice the desktop software.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>It's a limitation of the EAS accounts. If you create calendars in outlook.com&nbsp;online, they will sync down.

            <p>ok, so just when I think I'm getting somewhere...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my root problem is inability to get data from google calendars into Outlook.&nbsp; I was able to somehow import these calendars into the desktop version - they display in the 'Other Calendar' calendar group, not the 'My Calendar' group. So they don't yet show
 in outlook.com or my Win8 phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I can't move them to My Calendar group, hence my original question how to create calendars so I could copy the events themselves over.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you've explained to me how to create new calendars, I went ahead and did that but because I already had a "Race Schedule" named calendar in "Other Calendar" group, my desktop Outlook showed "Race Schedule [1]" in My Calendar but shows as "Race Schedule"
 in Outlook.com and WIn8 phone and none of the events I copied there show in either outlook.com or my Win8 phone. And to boot, I can't rename or even delete the calendars in Other Calendars group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if I may ask you another question, How do I delete these 'Other Calendars' and then how do I reimport my google calendars into My Calendar group so all these events etc show in Outlook 2013, outlook.com and my Win8 phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you again.</p>

            <p>The only calendars that sync to outlook.com are calendars in the outlook.com data file. You'll need to move the appointments from the google calendar to the outlook.com calendar.

            <p>Yes, when I right click on any of the calendars in the 'Other Calendars' group that Delete command is grayed-out.&nbsp; The name field in the Properties popup appears to be an editable text field, but it's not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had used a google utility to convert my google calendars into pst file then imported it and it created them in the Other Calendars group, but now I can't do anything with these calendars (move, delete, etc) and they don't sync w/outlook.com or win8 phone
 so they are practically useless to me. How do I get rid of them to start over?</p>

<h2>            Row height will not change except by manual adjustment to each row.</h2>
                    <p>I am working in 2010.&nbsp; I have a problem with the row height of my data - not the header row.&nbsp; I have checked in the View/Tables/More Tables and all my rows are set to no wrap for data.&nbsp; I have checked in Bar format and all my bars are on row 1, all bars
 have either no text or only on the right.&nbsp; The font sizes are all in a reasoable range up to 10 points.&nbsp; I looked at right clicking the row and there is no option for setting the row height (like we can in excel) I can see no option to change all row heights,
 and double clicking on the row border has no effect.</p>
<p>I did search for other questions of this ilk and did not find similar...</p>
<p>Am I missing something, or do I have to manually adjust each rows height?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Do you have enough free space, 20-40GB, in the partition where you are going to install Windows 10?</p>

<p>Grammatik&nbsp; replied on July 29,2015<br />
<br />
This worked for me after the update&nbsp; tried to install but failed, and I got error message&nbsp; 80240020.&nbsp; I was upgrading from Win 7 Pro through the reserved copy showing in my taskbar. I found it by searching google for the error message and then on a&nbsp; reddit
 subpage. <br />
<br />
https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/3eyrre/fix_for_the_80240020_error_when_trying_to_install/<br />
<br />
The Reddit page says:<br />
<br />
"What this error means is, your Windows 10 installation folder is unfinished and/or corrupted. Now, how do you fix that?<br />
1. Go into "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" and delete everything in that folder.<br />
2. Now, run the command prompt as an administrator. Type in "wuauclt.exe /updatenow".<br />
3. Go to your Control Panel &gt; Windows Update and your Windows 10 should start re-downloading from scratch, hopefully without flaws this time."</p>

 already, and when you look at profiles you see them as members since to-day or after July 29th, Microsoft said "free" upgrade to windows 10 for the people who&nbsp;participated in the program now it looks like anyone can jump on and get the so called "free" Windows10,
 so much for us that have been in the program and suffered with the up's and down's, Microsoft needs to address this.&nbsp;</span>

            If you read the original information, we started in 2014 but anyone who had a qualifying system would be able to get Windows 10 in the year after July 29, 2015.&nbsp; Those of us that had qualifying systems would get the final but if we did not have a qualifying
 system could continue with the insider program and stay updated with the test builds.&nbsp; If we quit the program and did not have a qualifying system then the build would expire.&nbsp; Every build, 10041 to 10166, expire 10/15/2015.<br />

</p><p>To retain the insider preview test licence (regardless of what the original base O/S was) you needed to keep the build up to date.&nbsp; If you haven't then it won't update now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in this position then you need to install a qualifying O/S (7, 8, 8.1) then run the free upgrade then opt back into insider builds.</p>

<p>It will not update as of July 15 all keys were removed and if you didn't have 10240 ACTIVE at that time all the old builds would expire, the only way right now is to use a Active version of Win7sp1 or Win8.1to upgrade to Win10&nbsp;and then rejoin the Preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I've removed my win 10 preview and got highly frustrated and gone back to my old Win7 pro version. &nbsp;Also I don't want to upgrade to Win10 as It dosen't support no. of old hardware like Philips TV tuner card etc.</p>
<p>I must state that it was a total waste of 9 months trying out the &nbsp;preview and facing unsolvable problems. I believe in quick removal of carcinogenic organ to live and see tomorrow.</p>

    <title>How long do images last on the cloud&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How long do images last on the cloud&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Currently using a older version of Skype and the newer version of Skype on different computers (the older is 7.41.0.101) and the newest is the current edition.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;I usually clear out my Media Cache files V3 once and a while to save space (as my friends and I send tonnes of memes), but I also scroll back to reminisce on previous chats and laughs, then I started noticing that the thumb/tile
 images are reappearing in the Media Cache files when I scroll back to them even though the images were deleted previously, also my computers should not have the same main.db yet they are still creating the same images and placing them back into my Media Cache
 files (older version is thumbnails, newer is tiles) so this brings up the curious question of where are the thumbnails being pulled from even though they have been deleted from the Media Cache, I read that Skype only caches
<strong>message</strong> memory for only 30 days then it deletes it off the server and is sent to the Media Cache or My Skype Received Files but that doesn't seem like the case because most of the images and messages are over 30 days old up to 2 years yet they
 are still being loaded and downloaded into the Media Cache or updating the main.db somehow. Which brings a dubious fear that the images and messages are being stored elsewhere aside from the sender and I PC's and somehow managing to transfer files even though
 they are not the same version nor should be able to load the thumbnails or images in the first place because they should be deleted after 30 days? or is my account linking my two different main.db's?<br />
<br />
EX. <br />
<br />
Deletes Image 1 from media cache (image is older than 30 days)<br />
<br />
Scroll back to Image 1 location<br />
<br />
Goes back to media cache and Image 1 reappears.</p>

            Thank you for the response, brings up the question you can't delete chat after 30 days but that is true for images aswell even though they are on the cloud for much longer, must've been a developers choice, I'm taking this is also the same for the most
 current version,. Thank you again Master Yoda. Just uptight about security and data protection- there was a data breach a few days ago from Blank Media Games<br />

 with the chat cloud duration.</p>

            Seems like I can only go back 180 days and delete images, anything further it doesn't delete visually on Skype 8, but it did on Skype 7.41 which makes no sense, the image is still being stored elsewhere- I feel like this is more of a Microsoft mod question.

            I just deleted an image from my Skype 8 client from May 18, 2018 without issue. The farther you go back in history with a lot of data, the less responsive the client can be. The lack of removal may be due to increased resources and the cached history not
 catching up fast enough to either properly execute or refresh the changes. Try <a href="https://preview.web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Web Preview</a> to see if the older images are still there or if you can retry the removal of older images.

            Thank you TechFreak, even on Skype Preview it is struggling to delete it, I'm not sure if it even is, but still questions unanswered. 1.) How long do our messages and more specifically images last on Skype's servers before they themselves delete it and
 2.) Is the deleted message or image completely removed from Skype's servers and my main.db. Also still makes no sense how Skype 7.41 received the deletion of the image but not Skype 8.

So here's an example, it makes no sense I can't tell if the message is truly deleted or not, it does the same for images. Left is Skype 8, and the right is Skype 7.41 (The two images are before and after)<br />
<br />
EDIT: First image is before (Left is Skype 8, right is skype 7.41) the same for the after image

<p>1. According to any official post on the topic, it is 2 years. This would be since the feature was enabled on the account or since it was newly created. On my longest accounts this currently appears to be around April 21, 2017, matching the duration you
 have (1 year and 8. 5 months). It is still possible some accounts may have had that feature enabled earlier. Accounts created after that date, would have a different cut-off. After ~April 21, 2019, you should no longer be able to scroll up to that date or
 there should be no data. If you still can see the date with data, you might want to try Skype for Web Preview again, so that it is not working off any possible cached data. It would make sense that any data in those earlier dates would not exist unless there
 are some delays in queuing the deletion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Any images or other data that are/were sent as attachments by the client, would only be retained for 30 days. I have seen exceptions to this in the past but that appears to be the current enforced policy. Skype history is similar to any web page. You
 have an index that displays shortcuts to images stored in the cloud or in cache. The process of deletions appears to have changed. In the past is was from the singular device but appears to now be a cloud deletion. When you delete something older from the
 cloud, it should delete the entry/link and the underlying image stored. If it currently is not performing a complete deletion, it is either because the information is cached, the client is not working properly or the deletion request/update might not have
 made it to the particular server you are connected to in that client. A system this big can easily have some redundancy and latency due to replication. You may want to check again later to see if the problem magically rectifies itself. It is hard to figure
 out the underlying reason if I cannot replicate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Classic Skype (7.x) will state the message has been deleted. Skype 8.x releases will simply delete the item without leaving a trace it was ever there. This behavior is definitely intentional, not accidental. The only thing deleted in your example was the
 word "okay".</p>

 looping problem before failing....as if it's not autenticating properly.&nbsp; However if I run iexplore -extoff (read that somewhere to troubleshoot IE) I can run the games okay (not play them fully as they need the flash addon) but it doesn't show the same symtoms.&nbsp;
 I have disabled every single addon (run without permission, all add-ons) and then run again and I still have the same symptoms.&nbsp; If I run again with iexplore -extoff it runs okay.&nbsp; Does this -extoff manage more than just addons?&nbsp; I have tried with Opera 10

    <title>Can I change the default folder for Chart, Theme and Color Templates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avmotamed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I change the default folder for Chart, Theme and Color Templates for Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My team currently uses Office 365 (E3), and I tried posting this question to the Office 365 community, but they were unable to answer and recommended this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Our small team all use the cloud for connecting via OneDrive for Business and SharePoint, and currently use a centralized SharePoint location for Word and Excel document templates (.doct and .xltx files).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>I would like to do the same for user generated chart (.crtx files) and color themes (.xml files), so we can consistently brand our documents. Since the cloud based enterprise environment appears to lack this functionality, I was hoping for a workaround by
 redirecting excel and word to another directory for these user generated &nbsp;"sub-templates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Office 2013, the current path is: <span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
&nbsp;C:\Users\XXXXX\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates</span>&nbsp;and either \Charts\ or \Themes\Colors\, where XXXX is the user name.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>My question is this:</strong></span> Can we change the path that Word and Excel use to access these "sub-templates"? This way I could manage the templates in a centralized SharePoint Online library and all
 our users could then sync that folder locally through OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alex</p>

            <p>I am not sure of Office 365 but in Excel, you have an option to set a template which would open by default. Its under File&gt;&gt; Options&gt;&gt; Advanced &gt;&gt; General</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25557bb9-3caa-4752-8e42-77d6185049dd" /></p>
<p>There should be such an option in MS Word too. You may explore or post it to MS Word forum. Hope my response helped. Mark is useful if you found it.</p>

            Hi haritejar
<br />
<br />Please explain your question in more detail, are you experiencing activation problems with Office, or are you trying to re-install Office?
<br />
<br />Was Office already installed and activated on your PC and if so, was that linked to your Microsoft Account on Office. com
<br />
<br />What version of Office do you have, is that Office 2016, 2019 or Office 365?
<br />
<br />If so, Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />Under Licences and Subscriptions, do you see your Office licence listed?
        </p>

            Hi  haritejar
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />When you install and activate Office 2016, you get a digital license, which removes the need to keep or remember the key if you need to reinstall Office again. This should be linked to the account used to activate the suite. 
<br />
<br />Reinstall Office
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.
<br />
<br />If you still can't activate the suite, please contact support and they will be able to investigate and determine whats the cause.

<h2>            Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type - anyone have this phone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've always loved the small candy bar nokia phones, since I would put them in my front pocket at work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the n8 now.&nbsp; I'm seriously thinking about picking up a "Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type" as well.&nbsp; I can pick one up for $150 in the US and use on my AT&amp;T network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like the sleek clean look and people wouldn't give me mean looks when having my phone around at work.&nbsp; (Work hates people with Smartphones...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wanted to get any opinions on&nbsp;anyone with the&nbsp;Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type - thanks guys! :smileyhappy:</p>

            It's been two days since I've been using the Nokia C3-01.<br />
<br />
So far the phone froze once while the radio was playing in the background and the display stopped showing. I just took the batteries out and put it back in and everything went back to normal.<br />
<br />
During a call, the screen autolocks which is weird because I can't press the mute or loudspeaker button on the front. I'm too used to the iPhone where it won't lock the screen during a phone call unless I physically press the lock button myself.<br />
<br />
Occasionally the phone would show a white screen for several seconds and the white screen would go away and the screen would go back to what I was seeing before.<br />
<br />
The alarm clock rings for one minute if uninterrupted. This is a bad because if I need to wake up with the alarm clock and I don't consciously hear the alarm clock in that one minute, the alarm clock does not ring again.<br />
<br />
This phone doesn't have the option to disable autolock. I need to disable autolock because if I am connected to a WiFi connection, I wish to be continually connected and, therefore, need autolock to be disabled to maintain connection.<br />
<br />
This phone doesn't have screen brightness adjustment.<br />
<br />
This phone is advertised as a smartphone, but some people say this phone isn't a smartphone. I don't want a smartphone because AT&amp;T will automatically charge you a data plan without your prior consent when you are using a smartphone with your SIM card. So far
 I haven't been charged a data plan, but I am expecting this might happen in the future.<br />
<br />
These are my worse criticisms I have for the Nokia C3-01. But, in my opinion, if you can tolerate these negatives, I think the Nokia C3-01 is a good phone.<br />
<br />
But you liking the Nokia C3-01 would depend on what you need to use the phone for, and everyone has very different preferences.

<p>hi, i got the phone two weeks ago and everything was working fine. i get exactly the same issues that&nbsp;
<em><strong>noki_c3_01</strong></em> has mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>recently every now and then the touchscreen decides to stop working. (the keypad continues to work)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i did the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- removed SD card (2gb) and used the phone without it to check if the problem occurs again.</p>
<p>- soft reset of settings</p>
<p>- checked for software updates, no updates found (5.65)</p>
<p>- even without new updates i used nokia update manager to re-install the current firmware</p>
<p>- changed sim card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>none of the above helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the other thing i noticed is that this issue doesn't have a specific pattern. this 'disabling' of the touchscreen occured when:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- answering the phone while being locked.&nbsp; (i couldn't unlock afterwards)</p>
<p>- receiving messages while viewing inbox</p>
<p>- receiving message while calling</p>
<p>- after leaving the phone for a long period of time.</p>
<p>- right after using bluetooth transfer</p>
<p>and more that i cant really remember right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i dont know if we should assume that it's not some specific application or style of use that causes this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>could this be a hardware problem? how could it be a hardware problem if at any other time the screen functions perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my gut feeling says that it's the touchscreen ''service'' (software) that fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s. this occurs even when battery is fully charged</p>

<p>Sure - my email sender name for my outlook email account now appears as an email address, and I want it to show as my name. &nbsp;I just had to reinstall outlook, and made the changes successfully in my IMAP accounts, but following directions in this forum, which
 entail going into the account settings for the outlook account, which is Microsoft Exchange, leads me to a box indicating the mailbox name as the email address, and cant be changed</p>
<p>

            Dear Fara,
<br />First check if you entered your name to your account during setup. If not you can change it now,. You can use tips from this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-display-name-that-e-mail-recipients-see-2b53331a-ba2a-4803-88dc-ac9fe376c8a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change...</a> 
<br />Please Note: If you are using a Microsoft Exchange account, you cannot change the display name. Only your Exchange administrator can make this change.
<br />Hope this is what you are looking for!

            When i reinstalled outlook, this email address just somehow was indicated as a microsoft exchange account, but this is on my personal computer...so i guess im the administrator? &nbsp;I believe it was ActiveSynch before...not sure thats the right term. &nbsp;Im
 really baffled - all i did was reinstall the program...

    <title>windows 10 activation problem after going trough the insider programme - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrsupernova  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 activation problem after going trough the insider programme</h2>
                    <p>Only 3 months ago I bought a new HP Stream 11 with pre-installed W8 and then joined the Insider Programme for Win 10, testing W10 before release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few updates, I think it was 10310 - my laptop wouldn't update any more and I was stuck - even after W10 was released to the public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I had to do a clean install of W10 using the Media Creation Tool, and now I have to 'Activate Windows' according to the message permanently in the bottom right of my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I input my original key that came with the laptop, it is not accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me! What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partly because of all this trouble, I want to sell the laptop now, but it's worthless without a fully functioning operating system on it
</p>
<p>
</p><p>:(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Windows 10 - I was doing my best to help with the final release of Windows 10 - and I feel like it has come back to bite me.</p>

            <p>If you can get back to Win 8 upgrade to Win 8.1.&nbsp; Get it free in the store there on Win 8.</p>
<p>Check to see that it is activated. If it is then use the Media Creation tool to
<strong>upgrade.</strong>&nbsp; Do not do a clean install.&nbsp; Check Settings, Updates, Activation.&nbsp; If it is activated right click start, Command Prompt (Admin) type slmgr /xpr and hit enter.&nbsp; This should tell you that you are permanently activated.</p>
<p>Now if you want a clean install use the tool again and do the clean install.</p>
<p>In the process do not put in any more keys.&nbsp; If it asks just <strong>Skip </strong>
or<strong> Do it later</strong>, which ever is available on the screen.</p>

            You will need to contact HP and ask for the windows 8 installation media for your laptop, you may have to pay a small amount for it. Once you have the win 8 media install it and all the updates including 8.1 now you should be able to upgrade to win 10
 with no licence issues.

<h2>            Office 365 vs 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I have recently upgraded my work laptop and move from office 2010 to office 365. My problem is I have two software programs that are a must for my work that require office to work 100% correctly. These programs support office 2010 including all versions
 up to 2016. They do not support 365.</p>
<p>So my questions are,</p>
<p>1- should I uninstall 365 and install 2010 or purchase 2016 and install that?</p>
<p>2- what are the differences between 365 and 2016?</p>
<p>3- the software manufacturers both state I can install SQL server but it's not ideal, what is SQL server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just after the best way to go. I have two other staff both of which are in the same position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>If your programs support Office 2010 up to Office 2016 and do not support Office 365, I suggest installing Office 2016. However, Office 2016
<span><span>is </span>sold as a</span><em><span>&nbsp;</span>one-time purchase</em><span>, which means you pay a single, up-front cost to get Office applications for one computer unlike
</span><span>Office 365 which </span><span>you can choose to pay for your subscription on a monthly or yearly basis.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about the difference between Office 365 and Office 2016, kindly check this

<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 What&#39;s the Difference Between the Content Placeholder and Other Placeholders&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't understand the subtle differences between the different types of placeholders. Can someone explain or provide a link to relevant documentation?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8646242-9589-44e4-b28c-0edfce220569?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8646242-9589-44e4-b28c-0edfce220569?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Image Placeholders crop images nicely, while Content Placeholders do not. The Image Placeholder is the only one I could find information on, but not any official documentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My preference would be just to use Content Placeholders in most cases, but I'm not sure if there are drawbacks or differences that would entice me to use the other placeholders: Text, Chart, Table, SmartArt, Media, Online Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've probably never used Online Image, and SmartArt I almost never use, but I'd still like to know the best way / reason to use these different placeholders.</p>

<p>In day-to-day use, I find the significant difference is between Content and Picture placeholders. When a graphic is inserted, the Content placeholder will resize to the photo. If the photo is smaller than the placeholder, you'll get extra space around it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a Picture placeholder is used, the graphic is resized to the placeholder. The smallest dimension of the graphic will fill the width or height of the placeholder, then the longer dimension of the graphic will be cropped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes the Picture placeholder more useful for tightly constructed image pages, the kind that designers love so much. The picture grid remains constant. Content placeholders are better when you want to be sure the entire image is included and the layout
 design is less important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never noticed any difference in function with any of the other placeholders compared to the Content placeholder, which is probably why there isn't anything written about them.</p>

    <title>Access 2000 Runtime, Office 2003&#47;2007, Snapshot Viewer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terri_k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2000 Runtime, Office 2003&#47;2007, Snapshot Viewer</h2>
                    
<p>I have an application that installs/uses the Access 2000 runtime.&nbsp; The application references/uses the Snapshot Viewer ocx.&nbsp; In most cases, there has not been a problem with the application or with Office.&nbsp; In a few cases, at the point where Snapshot Viewer
 is called into play, Windows Installer pops up with a reference to the runtime.&nbsp; Usually, once the installer finishes (or if I run a repair on Office directly), the issue is resolved.&nbsp; This is true on both Office 2003 and 2007 machines.&nbsp; However, now I have
 instances on Office 2007 machines where Windows Installer immediately throws up strange errors --&nbsp;looking for dlls that are part of System or System 32 in subfolders of&nbsp;ART that do not exist!&nbsp; Even though the problem seems to be with Snapshot Viewer, re-installing
 Snapshot has no effect.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the runtime, the application and Office several times to no avail.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks Terri.</p>
<p>Just guessing here, but since Office apps are ideally supposed to be installed earliest version first, I'm wondering if the issue is that you're trying to install a 2000 version product on a machine that already has 2007 on it. This could be causing issues
 with your library files. Do you have any machines where you can install your Access 2000 runtime first and then install Office 2007?</p>
<p>Another option, since Access runtime is now a free download, have you tried installing the 2007 runtime for your app instead of 2000 runtime? The Access 2007 runtime can be used for both MDB (2000, 2002, 2003) and ACCDB (2007) files.</p>

I'll do some researching on the 1309 error in our internal database and see what I can find...</p>

<p>Kathy,</p>
<p>Is re-installing Office different than running the repair?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Switching to the 2007 runtime is not not an option.</p>
<p>Dumb question maybe -- but shouldn't the runtime be totally independent of Office?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi Terri..</p>
<p>There are no such thing as&nbsp;dumb questions :)&nbsp; In fact, you are correct. Runtime, for the most part, is separate from office, however there are some components that are shared which can occasionally cause conflicts.</p>
<p>I have a few other questions for you.</p>
<p>1. What o/s is your application being installed on?</p>
<p>2. Does your application use the snapshot viewer ocx, the snapshot viewer exe or both?</p>
<p>3. What location does your application install to?</p>
<p>4. How many versions of msaccess.exe are installed on these machines?</p>
<p>5. Do you know if there are any differences between working vs non-working machines as far as programs/updates installed?</p>
<p>6. Do the working or non-working machines&nbsp;have the latest security update applied for snapshot viewer?</p>

<p>7. You could try using the Windows CleanUp Utility to allow you to do a fresh install of your 2000 application.</p>
<p>Use the Windows Installer CleanUp Utility to remove Office 2000, Office XP, or Office 2003<br />

<p>Sorry I haven't been able to give you a concrete answer as to what's wrong. I have not seen this specific problem before and there are no solutions&nbsp;in our internal database related to "Error 1309" besides indicating a corrupt install.</p>

<p>Hi Kathy.</p>
<p>There are no such thing as&nbsp;dumb questions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span>Funny, as a trainer, I say that all the time...&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></strong>:)&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What o/s is your application being installed on?&nbsp; <strong><span>XP SP3</span></strong></p>
<p>2. Does your application use the snapshot viewer ocx, the snapshot viewer exe or both?
<strong><span>ocx</span></strong></p>
<p>3. What location does your application install to?&nbsp; <strong><span>The runtime is installed to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ART</span></strong></p>
<p>4. How many versions of msaccess.exe are installed on these machines?&nbsp; <strong>
<span>Office 2007 (SP2) + 2000RT</span></strong></p>
<p>5. Do you know if there are any differences between working vs non-working machines as far as programs/updates installed?&nbsp;
<strong><span>To create the most&nbsp;level playing field possible, we&nbsp;removed the 2000RT&nbsp;and ran the standard&nbsp;corporate "push down" of XP, Office and other application&nbsp;updates.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>6. Do the working or non-working machines&nbsp;have the latest security update applied for snapshot viewer?
<strong><span>I had no success with this -- sorry, I don't remember the exact message, but it was something like&nbsp;"SR-1 was already applied."&nbsp; I just tried running the patch on a system that is working (with Office 2003
 +2000RT), and got the message "The expected version of the product was not found on your system."&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;Also re-intstalling Snapshot separately&nbsp;does not help.&nbsp; In most cases, running a repair
 on Office fixes it.&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>BTW -- just to vent: the only reason I am using the snapshot ocx is because it is a requirement in my application that reports&nbsp;display&nbsp;"Page&nbsp;[Page] of [Pages]" (not negotiable), but the report writer
 cannot be trusted to correctly calculate [Pages] when conditional grouping is used -- an issue I understand still is a problem in 2007.&nbsp; As a kludge, I output to a temporary snapshot file, use the ocx control&nbsp;to open the snp and tell me the
<em>real</em> total page count, and re-run the report passing that number in.&nbsp; If there is a better way to get an accurate total page count, please let me know!!!</span></strong></p>
<p>7. You could try using the Windows CleanUp Utility to allow you to do a fresh install of your 2000 application.&nbsp;
<strong><span>I will&nbsp;look into that.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>---</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I downloaded a newer Snapshot Viewer but that didn't&nbsp;help.&nbsp; It's obvious that&nbsp;accessing this control is the problem...&nbsp;&nbsp;if I copy the ocx to my application folder, is there a way to "manually" register
 it -- would this stop Installer from thinking something else is needed?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thanks.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>4/1/2010 - update</p>
<p>Kathy, I now have another user with Windows 7 and Office 2007 who is using an earlier version of my app which does not reference the ocx directly.&nbsp; Everything was working fine until they used the standard Access menu function to Send Email&nbsp;with a&nbsp;Snapshot
 format report -- Windows Installer immediately popped up along with the infamous 1309 error.&nbsp; The app then completely stopped running.&nbsp; He could not immediately get an IT staff person to run&nbsp;a repair on Office - so I&nbsp;can't say&nbsp;if that will resolve the issue.&nbsp;
 W had to re-install the runtime and app to get it going again and the user will be avoiding Snapshot until further notice...</p>

<p>Hi Terri,</p>
<p>If you copy your ocx to a different location, you can try manually registering the snapview.ocx file using regsvr32.exe. Easiest way to do this is go to Start/Run then type</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe "Path to snapshot viewer OCX"</p>

            <p>Don't believe so. This question comes up periodically, for reasons similar to yours. Folks want to archive off threads, save them, forward them, whatever. So far haven't seen anything that will do that. Best that can happen is to copy the text out of a block
 and paste it somewhere else, but that doesn't capture sender or date/time. Not much good for a 'legal' record.</p>
<p>I think the issue is likely that access to the message section is not open to third party developers, and that's why nothing has been generated. Unfortunately MS hasn't provided a message backup/storage option like it did for Windows Mobile either.
</p>
<p>My best suggestion would be to take a good camera and screen shot the thread. scroll through the messages overlapping one text so that the continuity can be established.</p>

<p>AM in the USA now, and went and bought a prepaid SIM Card. Rhe technician when trying to install (unsucssessfully) the SIM Card tried to "Restore all factory settings" and in so ding deleted all data in the phone. This included Messages (In-Box, Sent and
 Saved Messages, Drafts etc) and all Images, Videos etc.</p>
