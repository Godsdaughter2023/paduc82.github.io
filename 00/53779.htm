<h2>            Surface 2 touch not working after Windows firmware update</h2>
                    <p>A friend of mine has a Surface 2 and a couple of weeks ago the touchscreen stopped working (remarkably right after the warraty expired)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out that the update: Update of system firmware 9/11/2015 tries to install Touch Firmware 2.17 but keeps failing to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only 2 ways to get the touch working again:</p>
<p>- Switch off the Surface for a couple of hours but then it fails again when you reboot or when the update tries to install again.</p>
<p>- Roll back to firmware 2.15 but the update just tries to install again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried everything for Windows Update reset to complete reset, nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to contact the Microoft service desk but they ask me to pay 29€ just to talk to them about a problem there are creating deliberately.</p>
<p>If this is the way Microsoft is treating the few customers that are using their mobile products, it is no wonder their market share keeps dropping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone here that knows of a solution other than hacking the registry to disable Windows Update?</p>

            <p>Unfortunately those are the defacto answers which don't help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The internet is full of fora where users complain about the trouchscreen not working after an update.</p>
<p>This is the 2nd surface 2 I was given with a malfunctioning touchscreen. The first one got replaced by MS since it was still unders warranty, the other... well I'm not going to let people pay to repair something MS broke themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the last few years I recommended dozens of people to buy a surface because that is what they are more familiar with but if it is MS policy to release updates that wreck tablets and then request pay to fix them, I can no longer do that. I'll just tell
 people to buy a Samsung or ipad.</p>
<p>Apparantly MS has such a huge market share in the tablet market they can afford to screw people over.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>- Roll back to firmware 2.15 but the update just tries to install again</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know that was possible, at least in terms of actually having firmware change.&nbsp; I would believe it is possible to try to make the OS think differently about a firmware update which had not actually been applied though.&nbsp;&nbsp;FWIW I had a situation with
 my Surface 2 Pro (some time ago) where every month I kept getting prompts to install a firmware update which supposedly had already been installed.&nbsp; I called Surface support about that and they suggested I stop using the "Download automatically but install
 conditionally" method of using Windows Update.&nbsp; Doing that revealed that there were other updates which had been in the same installed but not applied state for a long time.&nbsp; A disadvantage of changing to completely automatic updates is that I no longer feel
 aware of what is being applied.&nbsp; There is a notice about the Restart though (when required), so I suppose I could use it as an opportunity to achieve a significant amount of the same informational objective, though with less control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, (I just remembered), there is something that I have been speculating about for doing that.&nbsp; E.g. I have noticed that&nbsp;&nbsp;WMIC BIOS&nbsp; supposedly allows&nbsp;commands which would change it somehow but I haven't found anyone who can explain what the implications
 of trying to use them would be.&nbsp; So, when you "roll back" the firmware is there any change in&nbsp; WMIC&nbsp; BIOS&nbsp; List&nbsp; /Format:List&nbsp;&nbsp; Much the same information is available in msinfo32 System Summary; however, it is even less clear then how involved the actual firmware
 would be involved in the generation of that report.&nbsp; I.e. I would feel much more assured about the completeness of firmware updates (or roll back, if that is really possible) if I thought that the firmware itself was doing some of the reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>On the RT a firmware rollback is possible in Device Management. I don't know if it is genuine firmware but Microsoft allows you to roll back the firmware 'driver' to a previous version.<br />
</p>
<p>On an RT you don't have the option to configure how to obtain your Windows updates, it is all pretty basic as opposed to a PRO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After two weeks of searching for a solution and MS simply ignoring such a widespread problem I recommended my client to buy a Samsung tablet.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when you encounter an issue like this, I myself would first try a manual power cycle steps like mentioned on the following link, be sure to wait at least 60 seconds before powering on again:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that fails I would try the Reset options (likely shows an option to Keep Games and Apps installed) to see what happens.</p>
<p>If that fails the only option left is the USB update option, see this link for information:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-factory-defaults-using-usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi pbare15,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In order to perform rating in experience index it needs the graphics card drivers to be installed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to update the graphics card driver and check.</p>
<p>Steps to update graphics card driver:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on start button. <br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box type devmgmt.msc and then press enter.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the graphics card device and right click on it<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select properties.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the properties window, under Driver tab, click on Update Driver button.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the installing the updates restart the computer.</p>
<p>I you are still facing the same problem then, i recommend you to download and install the drivers for it from the manufacturer's website.</p>

<h2>            System Recovery &#34;The system image is on a hard disk....&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop with a SSD. I made two logical partition C and D on a SSD, so I installed Win 10 on the C logical disk and made a backup image on the D logical disk. In win 7, I can restore my back-up image on another logical disk, but I tried to recover
 in Win 10. I got the message "The system image is on a hard disk, but windows need to format...." and I have to stop this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how can i solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>Jin</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor and Office Insider for Android. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />If you're restoring to the same hard disk, you don't need to select the Format And Repartition Disks check box. 
<br />
<br />You are getting that error message since the system image you wanted to use is located on the same hard disk that would be formatted and restored to. You can only select a system image from a drive that is different that the one that is being restored. 
<br />
<br />Refer here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/backup-restore/105971-restore-windows-10-disk-image.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/backup-restore/105971...</a>
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps for backup
<br />
<br />1. Take system image in external drive or a set of optical discs.
<br />(Unfortunately, you can't create a system image on a USB flash drive.)
<br /> 
<br />2. Try this free backup, disk imaging and cloning solution

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            We have tried all that and are currently looking into it possibly being bad drivers.&nbsp; While we did go to the appropriate web sites for the drivers we are trying to re download them in case the ones in our image files are bad.

<p>Hey there Snake! If I understand correctly you are claiming your region was "accidentally" changed? Given the amount of prompts and approval messages you have to go through on the website to do this it is virtually impossible to do this on accident.<br />
<br />
If your region has recently been changed you will have to wait 90 days to change it again. If you have any further questions, please let us know. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Install&#47;Recovery Disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidibbotson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Install&#47;Recovery Disc</h2>
                    I have a Asus A53E which requires a new hard drive, but before I go ahead and replace the hard drive could someone please assist me. Unfortunately I have not got&nbsp;Window 7 installation&nbsp;or recovery disc to enable me to reinstall. Will &nbsp;I need to purchase
 a complete new Windows 7 software or can I get a recovery disc that will link with the Windows 7 Product Key on base of my laptop. Any advise appreciated.

<p>My existing hard drive has already crashed and therefore cannot create a recovery disc. So is there a way I can replace windows 7 that came with the laptop without having to purchase a new full copy of Windows 7.</p>

If your existing disk is unreadable then you need to order a Factory Restore DVD from the Asus distributor. There might be a handling charge.

            OK so you can purchase a recovery disc from Asus. Thank you I will look into that.

    <title>Disk Properties is getting free space and used space wrong on my disk - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disk Properties is getting free space and used space wrong on my disk drives</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have a LOT of disk drives attached to my desktop under windows 10.&nbsp; I was surprised recently to get a message that there was not enough free space to hold all of the files and folders that I was trying to move.&nbsp; Free space in Explorer said 1.3 TB.&nbsp; Actual
 free space turned out to be something like 350 GB.&nbsp; I run properties on a folder in the root on a volume and get one number for free and used space.&nbsp; If I select all the folders in that internal folder and select properties I get different number.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Home with all updates applied.&nbsp; I think this is new (the last 8 months or so) but I could be wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My immediate problem is that I bought a 32 TB server (WD) for my Blu-ray movies and filled it with astonishing speed.&nbsp; I was just trying to confirm or deny that I had less than 1 TB free on a device with 22 TB available under raid5 and I quickly discovered
 that I couldn't trust the numbers that Explorer is showing me.&nbsp; I also discovered that the problem effects internal drives as well as external ones (USB and Network).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a general problem with Windows 10 and very large drives?&nbsp; Nowadays, only my system drive is smaller than 4 TB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Patrick, I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps mentioned in <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ntdebugging/2008/07/03/ntfs-misreports-free-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Incorrect Free Space</a>&nbsp;and see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In the above article, you may need to perform Check Disk, so while performing chkdsk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive then chkdsk tries to repair that sector, if any data available on that might be
 lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still face any issues and as you have RAID Configuration hard drives, we suggest you to post your query in
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IT Pro TechNet forums</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h3> bernd hoeppner  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to connect a bonjour network printer under Win8 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using a tablet under Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would like to print documents.</p>
<p>We are using an Apple Access Point for WLAN (Airport Extreme)</p>
<p>My tablet connects the network using this access point, no trouble.</p>
<p>The printer is connected to the dedicated USB-Printer-Port of this access point.</p>
<p>So it seems to qualify as a "bonjour printer".</p>
<p>The only way to print sofar is for me to switch on some mac mini in </p>
<p>this network, tell my windows tablet to print to this computer,</p>
<p>because the mac mini has no problem to find and print over "bonjour".</p>
<p>What I really need is the DIRECT WAY: tablet to bonjour printer,</p>
<p>but I dont know what to tell my tablet so it could find this printer.</p>
<p>Any clue to this one ?</p>

            <p>Hello Bernd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with file sharing, you’ll need to visit the <strong>Network and Sharing Center
</strong>in the Windows <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click <strong>Change advanced sharing settings</strong>, and enable “<strong>file and print sharing</strong>.”
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn3.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f06%2fturn-on-file-and-print-sharing-on-windows-8.1.png" height="534" width="650" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit the Printers list in the Control Panel, right-click the printer you want to share, and select Printer properties.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Click the Sharing tab, enable sharing for the printer, and give it a name. You can also enable printer sharing while setting up a new printer.</p>

</p><p><strong>Access a Shared Printer on Windows</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Windows Explorer or File Explorer and click the Network option to browse computers on your local network. Double-click a Windows or Linux PC sharing a printer and you’ll see it shared printers. Double-click the printer to add and configure it. It will

<h2>            Should media player 12 have a unique Mac address.  Mine does not.  Is it broken&#63;</h2>
                    I am having problems streaming music to my Sony home theatre system. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Streaming in Windows media player 12 is switched on and I can see the Sony theatre system in my network mapping but when I look at my Media Player properties, there is no Mac or IP address. &nbsp;Is this normal?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a second (Vista) computer networked and I can access its music library and stream music to the Sony system. &nbsp;What is going on?</div>
<div>Also the Sony only identifies my Vista computer as an available server.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas to resolve the problem would be much appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks in advance</div>

<div>In case there are others who still have had the same problem, I suggest you follow the following instructions, which work but I don't know why.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Select:</div>
<div>1 &nbsp;Control Panel</div>
<div>2 &nbsp;System and security</div>
<div>3 &nbsp;administrative tools</div>
<div>4 &nbsp;Services</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now from the list you have to stop:</div>
<div>1 &nbsp;WMP network sharing service</div>
<div>2 &nbsp;Service UpNp device host</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next restart:</div>
<div>1 Service UpNp device host</div>
<div>2 &nbsp;WMP network sharing service</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Now give the system a try. &nbsp;It worked for me. &nbsp;My home cinema can see my Windows 7 laptop and I can use the WMP 'play to' feature to push music to the home cinema.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found this solution after much internet searching but I lost the link so I can't credit the author. But you know who you are. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using<span>&nbsp;folderBrowserDialog in my application development and I had a problem in win 7 that every time &nbsp;i selected a new folder in this dialog, the whole "Folder-Tree"scroll
 down to the bottom so that &nbsp;the selected folder is at the bottom of the FolderBrowserDialog. I think it might be a windows 7/ Vista bug because its working fine in Win XP.<br />
</span>

<h2>            Surface Book, surface dock, DP conected 1920x1080 Lenovo ThinkVision MOnitors. not working</h2>
                    <p>Scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have two new surface book (i5 intel only graphic)</p>
<p>2 Surface Dock Pros</p>
<p>4 Min DP to DP cables (reputable brand) 1.8m</p>
<p>4 new Lenovo Think vision 222p DP 1920/x1080 21.5" monitors (i.e. just full HD not 4K)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario;</p>
<p>When we connect both monitors the laptop screen just flashes on and off (mostly off) random bits of display., hardware detect beeps etc. Monitors flash a bit but switch to no input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: anyone got this working with this configuration (which according to the MS troubleshooting is supposedly the best and preferred config)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things tried.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Plug the&nbsp;DP cable into surface book's built-in DP port -all combinations of monitors, cable a surfacebook work perfectly.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Surface books have had full Windows update and report themselves to be fully up to date.</li><li>At least one has had a the manual firmware and drivers pack installed - downloaded from the Microsoft surface book troubleshooting site.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The docks have both had the September 2016 update applied but the dock updater tool (downloaded from the Microsoft dock troubleshooting site link). Interestingly, despite the web site saying that Windows Update would apply the dock updates[https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/surface/manage-surface-dock-firmware-updates?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396]
 the updater tool reported that both docks had out of date firmware and updated them.</li></ul>
<p>I&nbsp; have managed to get one surfacebook to work with just one monitor (not entirely stable but the employee can do something).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also able to get a monitor to work over HDMI with a mini DP to HMDI adapter; oddly this works only f I turn the magnetic connector from the dock upside down (i.e. with the table going forwards towards the keyboard - surreal sounding&nbsp; but repeatable
 [and reported by other people in forums here for other peripherals].<br />
<br />
Needless to say this is very frustrating and disappointing - this is hardly new device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't trust Windows update (it failed to apply the firmware updates as per the MS article). Does anyone have list of the right divers and surface components?<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I have had a reply from Micrsoft support. Their suggested solutions is<br />
"<span>Seems like there is an issue with the surface dock. I can see on this topic on our Microsoft forum that someone had the same issue:
</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunatelly our technicians didnt find the reason behind the problem yet, but as soon as soon as they will find they will post it on the forum."</span></p>
<p><span>"</span><span>Your other option is to use the mini-DP to HDMI and/or VGA to one monitor and buy a USB 3.0 Video Adapter and run the additional monitor from there. (Unless you already have Display Port
 Monitors the USB option is the least expensive)." and a link to displaylink's shop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes - with a mature product that they have been selling in the thousands, using the supposedly recommened and best configuration (2 x DP monitors at Full HD) the best MS support can offer is that I should buy a 3rd party product.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Incredible?&nbsp; [seem to here all the time with MS these days. And I worked for them training support staff for over 20 years]</span></p>
<p><br />
"</p>
<p>Answers from Micrsoft support vary according to who youtalk to - they seem to just be searching databases and reading out "random" solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note I am not trying to use 4k monitors. I don't want to run VGA.HDMI with loads of expensive adapters. Just use the product as described and recommended by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Thanks I'd seen the monitor article.</p>
<p>I think if there's a compatibility issue then that''s a problem with your product and your sales literature. I don't think you can dismiss 96% of a product<strong> line of a company like Lenovo, particularly their professional ThinkVision current models,</strong>
 by listing just two that work in an article that is effectively hidden from a customer until such time as they have bought, had trouble and started searching for clues.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be more honest to say on the product sales pages that having a DP1.2 monitor that works with all other DP devices in your office is no guarantee that it will work with a Microsoft Surface Dock as our support for DP is patchy and we only
 guarantee a tiny handful of monitors will actually work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>update:</p>
<p>Yeterday the user of one surface reported that she had one monitor working. It turned out that this was one which I had changed to DP1.1 so that might be a clue. I then discovered that I could add the 2nd monitor (probably still on DP1.2) and that would
 work ... not entirely stable but with usable minutes between the flashes that it sounds as though that's the norm that many surface dock dual monitor users live with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise, swapping in the other surface book to this dock whilst in a stable config worked but the resolution was wrong (only using 80% of the screen). Correcting the resolution brought back flashing after about 3'seconds of stable display. Swapping
 surface book to the other one transferred the flashing to the 1st config but reconnecting the displays with the 1st surface book could bring back some stability (occasional drop out which I suspect is to do with power management as so often with display link
 type technologies).</p>
<p>The 2nd surface would connect, remain stable for about 30 seconds and then become unable. Connecting the 2nd surface to the newly switched on dock went staight to flashing and was unworkable.</p>
<p>Being now very suspicious of this 2nd Surface (when I registered it for support it reported that it had only 6 months warranty to run - we had only just bought it new 8 days before! The MS support engineer we spoke with tried to claim that Amazon always
 &nbsp;activate the machines when they get them from MS but retracted when I pointed out that the other one that arrived n the sme day didn't have this feature (bought from Amazon because MS couldn't support the right payment method).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking further on this 2nd &nbsp;surface book, I found that although Windows Update reported that all was updated, several of the surface components were noted as failed in the history. Annoyingly, clicking on the more details link takes you to a page that
 reports no info for this driver (a driver that only exists for a Microsoft product in a Microsoft OS and I am looking at a Microsft more info page ...what chance anyone else?).</p>
<p>Anyway, after some playing (fortunately at home) a cascade of updates startled arriving and some 5 hours later I had a lot more stuff. (This reporting of all updates being complete and then a change of mind is not just a surface book thing - it's an annoying
 feature of Windows update that I have seen many times - I think it happens when a device does not have a complete catalog for a particular build so upset determines that the next tranche can't be applied but rather than saying "there are more updates a vainly
 but they can't &nbsp;be applied to your current configuration" a it just says "up to date". Anyway, not a surface issue but the message is not to trust no updates to apply &nbsp;messages from Windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dont know if this has helped ...can't try the devices (the users have to do work and the council offices are not open yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two surface updates failed even still - this might be because I had manually applied the surface drivers and firmware pack at one stage .. there was an error code but I didn't note it as I foolishly assumed that this would be dprecorded in the update history
 &nbsp;but it's not and the more deals link just takes me to a web page where MS haven't bothered to complete any details. (I know that there are other places I could look but my point is that the update history should record the error ...and I have already wasted
 20 hours of my time for free [in the UK town councillor,, which is the reason I am aware of the problems the officers are having, is an elected but unpaid role).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried to obtain a list of surface specific drivers and versions from Ms so I could manually check... particularly as I have no confidence in reports from Windows update or update this driver from device manger... but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a radical suggestion and seeing the hundreds of pages of surface user pain with docks on your and other forums (representing 100s of thousands of customer lost hours) how about a simple troubleshooter that just checks surface component versions/fixes
 and reports if you have a consistent set? (I have over 40 MS certifications and a 4 digit MCP and I have found the whole surface dock experience immensely frustrating - so what do ordinary users do?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>annoying feature of Windows update that I have seen many tines-</p>

            <p>Hello! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a bit of research on this and this is what I found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>per this Surface article: https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-docking-station-surface-dock#Check10</p>
<p>
</p><p>The surface book is capable of driving two external monitors at 30hz or a single monitor at 60hz.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>per Lenovo support on your monitors: https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/t2224pd</p>
<p>
</p><p>These monitors do not directly state that they support a 30hz display format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very probable that, due to this detail this could be considered incompatible. I would get in touch with Lenovo directly to see if these do in fact support 30hz display mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For surface update failures I would use the surface diagnostic toolkit available here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46703</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will run on your device and search available updates available for your device against what is currently installed and prompt you to download and install them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the surface dock updater was recently updated (last month I think). The best way&nbsp;to&nbsp;run this on a surface book, I found through personal experience, is to disconnect the tablet from the keyboard and directly connect the tablet to the dock and
 run the updater. Then after&nbsp;restart the surface and the surface dock (disconnect power and reconnect). &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi RossK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks - but I think your research is a bit suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article you quote doesn't mention 30Hz - I think you are getting confused with the known issue round 4K resolution monitors (which must be incredibly frustrating if you believed the spiel about surface being high end and as good as a desktop - it took
 a long time for MS to admit this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article that explains this is here: https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/music-photos-and-video/connect-surface-to-a-tv-display-or-projector?os=windows-10</p>
<p>
</p><p>The relevant last line from the table in here is (max resolution supported)</p>

<p>My monitors are only 1920x1080 so hugely within specification. (I can't imagine why anyone would make or use at 1920x1080 res monitor running at 30Hz - it would look dreadful!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>[And I know have one set of monitors and surface book mostly working with only the occasional flash witch seems to be suffered by nearly all MS dock users on dual screens). [oddly if simply swap to the other surface book the screen become unstable and then
 remain unstable when I swap back to the previously working one.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link but as I said i have run this tool and have updated to the September firmware patch. I even mentioned that despite what the article you quoted in your post says, Windows update does not apply this patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[The troubleshooting article&nbsp; says: </p>

            <p>Update</p>
<p>1 machine is mostly stable. It flashes sometimes and one morning the user called to say. The surface book was unsusble when connected to the dock. I went in and confirmed that when connected the screen on the book flashed on and off repeatedly when connected
 to the dock and external&nbsp;</p>
<p>monitors. Disconnecting, resetting etc. Made no difference. Then suddenly after just going through the same steps docking, undocking, powering on and off dock and book, connecting dock directly to tablet and turning the dock magnetic connector upside down
 (which weirdly seems to reset things sometimes) I suddenly found it came back (to the mostly stable state). The user asked me what I did (and did differently to what she did) and the answer is I have no idea (which is deeply unhelpful and barely worth posting
 other than to let people know that this configuration is meta stable).</p>
<p>Yesterday, I did a driver by driver comparison between the two books but couldn't se anything different - although the permanent flasher had reported a number of fails on surface components without ever recording success, the drivers seemed to match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did a recovery/rest of Windows on the 2nd book (which I had done &nbsp;of the 1st one at some point).</p>
<p>
</p><p>after this Windows update still reported one failure (intel touch) which was worrying and it went back to flashing. Windows update insisted everything was up to date (but I've been here before on these machines .. Windows update reports all is done and then
 a few hours later decides to add more,so I manually ran the surface update pack and got a stable single monitor ...but then the building close. That said, one evening I took the whol setup home and got it Ll working</p>

    <title>Grinding noise on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tina global citizen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Grinding noise on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 on my 5 year old HP laptop, and I am having a problem with the sound. It has an intermittent grinding sound. At first I thought it was Youtube, but then, any sound system I open has the same identical grinding sound.
</p>
<p>It is VERY annoying. If I cannot fix it, I will have to revert to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Anyone experiencing the same problem? </p>
<p>Feedback really appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Fast User Switching issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mister sidney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fast User Switching issues</h2>
                    <div>Hello there...</div>
<div>I'm running a Dell Vostro 460 with Windows 8 Pro with Media Center (64 bit). I have four users set up on the machine, two running as Administrators. I have a big issue when switching between users...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Primarily, I've lost fast user switching, so if someone checks their e-mail or something I lose everything running.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Secondly, after using Win+L to switch users, typing in the correct password removes the Signed in status underneath the user, and then resets the screen to a fresh log-in screen, where I need to retype the password to sign in successfully. This happens
 intermittently.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only significant tweak I've made to the system is that I've disabled the Lock Screen using Group Policy Editor.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried looking this up to now avail - do you have any suggestions as to what I need to look at/tweak?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All help gratefully received - this whole issue is really annoying!</div>
<div><br />

            Dear&nbsp;VipinPalathully,
<div>&nbsp; Many thanks for your response; I have turned off all non-Microsoft start-up items and it does not resolve the issue. Running in safe mode allows fast user switching to work, but soon as I start-up normally the issue returns, so a Microsoft service/s
 is causing the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What can I try next?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Look forward to your&nbsp;response&nbsp;on this one!</div>
        </p>

            Well, I'm glad it's not just me! I haven't got any further with this one, and I've got to say it disappoints me that there has been no resolution to the issue. The computer hasn't been tinkered with, is running Windows from a fresh install with Office
 2010, Adobe Creative Suite and not a lot else, yet fails fundamentally as a family computer. If you make any progress C-Dan, could you post it here for me to try, and I'll do the same for you?

Sure,<br />
I didn't have this issue until a refresh.<br />
I had 4 users before the refresh and 4 after. But somehow the refresh process has rendered the users crippled because my live account usertile picture doesn't update on these nor do I have an option to trust the PC.
<br />
Btw, I added a new user via the main user and now that new user shows in fast switching but the rest show only on the logon menu, but&nbsp;not under the usertile on the start screen.<br />
