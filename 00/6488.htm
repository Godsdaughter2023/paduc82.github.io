 computer virus protection system had informed windows operating services that I had a problem with viruses on my computer and would I log on and follow his instructions. &nbsp;I did not do this but instead asked for a contact phone number to verify the call. &nbsp;He
 gave me: 02 80061421. &nbsp;I did phone back and spoke to a very similar sounding man who said that he was Austin Jones. &nbsp;He did not provide me the name of the company but said that it was computer support. &nbsp;I strongly guess this was not a legitimate service and
 promptly ended the call &nbsp;however, if it is, I imagine that people here will be aware of that and let me know. &nbsp;It is concerning that they knew my name and number. &nbsp; Was I right in my assumption?&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

    <title>IE9 Tracking Protection blocks well-known jQuery CDN URLs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carl.camera  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE9 Tracking Protection blocks well-known jQuery CDN URLs</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this is going to be a big problem for lots of websites.&nbsp; I am very supportive of Tracking Protection and I especially like that IE9 automatically counts how many different sites are pointing to the same javascript files across domains, then disables
 access to that javascript file automatically.&nbsp; THIS IS GREAT! But there's a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a handful of well-known jQuery javascript CDN (Content Delivery Network) urls out there that many of us web designers point to in order to improve performance.&nbsp; The beauty of a CDN is that if there are&nbsp;many sites that all point to the same jQuery
 library at <strong>ajax.googleapis.com</strong> then the javascript library is more likely to be cached on the client browser when he or she visits my page.&nbsp; However, it appears that&nbsp;these jQuery CDN libraries&nbsp;-- because they are in fact javascript files used
 across several domains -- are being disabled automatically by IE9 Tracking Protection.&nbsp; The result is dramatic loss of functionality on many, many, many websites.</p>
<p>Example websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://youversion.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://youversion.com</a>&nbsp; (the home page shows "loading" -- entire website functionality is gone.)</li><li><a href="http://ohiomcr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ohiomcr.com</a> (the carousel is non-functional - hover states over navigation do not appear.)</li></ul>
<p>Incidentally, the google map javascript&nbsp;on the ohiomcr.com site is&nbsp;not blocked by Tracking Protection.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://maps.gstatic.com/intl/en_us/mapfiles/310c/maps2.api/main.js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maps.gstatic.com/intl/en_us/mapfiles/310c/maps2.api/main.js</a>&nbsp;GET&nbsp;304&nbsp;text/javascript&nbsp;226 B&nbsp;16 ms&nbsp;&lt;script&gt;&nbsp;140&nbsp;0&nbsp;16&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp;374</li></ul>
<p>The workaround, I assume, is to have each domain host their own jQuery library. This is what I plan to do. But expect some backlash from developers. I think the IE9 Team should be aware of this problem and, frankly, you need to alert web developers because
 many sites will be affected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps to recreate:</p>
<p>1. Enable Tracking protection in IE9</p>
<p>2. Visit 20 sites that invoke the same jQuery CDN (<a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/[............]jquery.js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ajax.googleapis.com/[............]jquery.js</a>)</p>
<p>3. Open IE Developer Toolbar</p>
<p>4. Enable "Net" tab in IEDevBar</p>
<p>5. Revisit sites in Step 2 -- note that the js is blocked by Tracking protection.</p>

    <title>Emails not sending from Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimcallaghan67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails not sending from Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I have set up my GoogleMail account in Outlook 365 on a new Windows 10 laptop. All went well for the first week, but on Friday my sent emails stayed in my Outbox and wouldn't send. I receive a "0X800CCC0F" error message when attempting to synchronise. I
 can receive emails okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send emails from my GMail account by logging in through Edge or Firefox, but I prefer to use Outlook. A number of the fixes I've looked at online suggest running scanpst.exe, but this file is nowhere to be found on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in resolving this issue so that I can send emails from Outlook would me much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            Hello Jim,
<br />
<br />Thanks for choose the Microsoft community services.
<br />
<br />I would suggest to check the send and receive group config, go to send/receive tab, send and receive group, define send and receive group, then check the two options Schedule automatic send/receive every 5 minutes.
<br />
<br />I hope this configuration helps, if not I suggest to create a new outlook profile:
<br />
<br />1.In Outlook, select File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Manage Profiles
<br />2.Choose Show Profiles &gt; Add.
<br />3.In the Profile Name box, type a name for the profile, and then choose OK.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this worked.

<p>Hi Liliana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the first suggested fix (send receive group config) did not solve tge problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried setting up a new profile, but I’m getting an error message saying that the action cannot be completed as the name cannot be matched to a name in the address list.</p>

            I am so sorry for my late answer, if your account cannot be configured in a new outlook profile you have to contact the email service support because there could be something wrong with the ports or something changed.

<h2>            Bring back &#34;Manage wireless networks&#34; in Network and Sharing Center</h2>
                    This is something that was missing in the original release of Windows 8 and still hasn't been fixed. In this preview release of Windows 10, it's still missing. Changing a network from public to private requires registry edits. Viewing details of all networks
 ever connected to on the PC requires command line hacking. This is regressive. The feature was available in Windows 7, and yet more advanced versions of Windows lack it. Please bring this back, both in Windows 10 and Windows 8.

            <p>Agreed 100 %&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also missing and wrong, is the proper dialog when single clicking the network icon on the task bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently it brings up the dumbed down and useless metro version dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the links from there go into full screen metro rubbish.&nbsp;&nbsp; What it needs to
 do is bring up the proper condensed Windows 7 style dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important to have the proper condensed dialog, as we use this point as an entry to turn on / off VPN's, or as a shortcut to the proper network sharing / config dialog, or to right click network
 items and get status.&nbsp; None of that is possible with the dumb metro versions.</p>

            Yup. That was one of the bigger complaints in Windows 8. I hope they duplicate all legacy system applications in the Metro mode, or make it so that we actually don't see any of them at all when running on the desktop. They already have the right idea with
 Continuum. Hopefully it'll be completely fleshed out by release.

            <p>I am easily able to do everything except change from Public to Private or Business. To do that you must choose to forget that specific network it the "Manage Known Networks" list and then setting it up again as if it were a"new" connection. With the exception
 of "Open" or unencrypted connections. The OS apparently views them as "Public" automatically. More than likely part of their enhanced security they think they are achieving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do agree with you though. If they are trying to have a "Tablet" mode and a "Computer" mode, then they need to cut down on this touch screen mindset for "Computer" functionality.&nbsp; But then again, everything comes with a learning curve.</p>

<p>yeah, if your machine connects to a LOT of wifi connections, you get this horribly polluted list of EVERYTHING you've ever connected with, sorta like, a, well, nevermind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here's the RESULT of it: &nbsp;whenever you're NOT connected to a network, because you've not associated with one of those "in that area", guess what your computer will do? &nbsp;That's right, it will CONTINUOUSLY try to connect to EVERY! STINKING! ACCESS! POINT!
 IT! HAS! EVER! CONNECTED! WITH! like a desperate lonely basement dweller or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a wifi device does THIS, it MESSES UP THE BANDWIDTH of connections to nearby access points. &nbsp;It might be your NEIGHBORS access point that gets affected. &nbsp;In short, without the ability to "manage" wifi connections, YOUR WIFI will be a source of RF POLLUTION
 that will negatively affect the performance of OTHER PEOPLE'S NETWORKS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, it's a major pet pieve of mine. &nbsp;And *THIS* is a *HUGE* reason why it needs to be PRESENT, EASY TO USE, and maybe even giving you an occasional notification like "you haven't connected to these networks in a while, do you want to remove them from the
 list?"</p>

            <p>I've been able to usually end up getting to a place where I can set the network to private by one of the various meandering methods that allow this change, but it usually takes me quite a while to remember how to do it. What I don't understand is why Microsoft
 removed the convenient option that was available in Windows 7. In Windows 7, you could just go to the Network and Sharing center and click on the area that said "Public". You could then select the appropriate kind of network. This to me was fairly logical
 and straightforward. Windows 10 still has the same basic layout for the Network and Sharing center, but for whatever reason, the type of network is no longer clickable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My job is to support people all day, so making this simpler would be a big help to me. I've already had to set about 6 computers from public to private and every time it's been a headache.</p>

            <p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've resolved/solved the issue, however, appears to be potentially related to the version 15.34 (170404), or at least, it seems fine after reverting to&nbsp;15.33 (170409).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your suggestions, and prior to un-installing &amp; re-installing, I did boot my mac into safe mode (forcing it to auto-repair system permissions), however, behavior did not change doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was fully uninstalling Office 2016 for Mac version 15.34 (170404) , and re-installing 15.33 (170409) which I downloaded from the Office 365 portal. Going forward I'm leaving insider off, as this issue is too severe for me to work with.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the directions I used to uninstall before re-installing with the fresh copy downloaded from Microsoft.<br />
</p>

</p><p>Although YouTube is listed as a supported service pasting URLs from it onto pages in both my desktop and browser versions of OneNote no longer produces thumbnails (as of April 2019).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating as I use OneNote to index a lot of videos from YouTube and having a thumbnail image is very useful.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience caused by the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, when we tested at our end by inserting the video link in both applications
<strong>OneNote 2016 for Windows</strong> and <strong>OneNote for Windows 10</strong>, we can’t reproduce the problem you described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OneNote 2016 for Windows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59ac7e5a-ef57-4334-bcfa-e25fa5e98ddc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59ac7e5a-ef57-4334-bcfa-e25fa5e98ddc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OneNote for Widows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d3279f6-874e-4328-8ee9-14be6295cde4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d3279f6-874e-4328-8ee9-14be6295cde4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps we had followed: Open the OneNote application&gt; Insert Tab&gt; Online Video&gt; Paste the copied URL&gt; OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If insert the URL by using CTRL + V (not following the above steps), it inserts only URL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to move further about the issue encountering at your end, can you please provide the following information:</p>
<p>a. Are you using OneNote 2016 for Windows or OneNote for Windows 10?</p>
<p>b. Provide the version numbers of application you’re using.</p>
<p>If OneNote 2016 for Windows: Open OneNote&gt; File&gt; Account&gt; Take complete screenshot of page and provide it.</p>
<p>If OneNote for Windows 10: Open application&gt; Settings&gt; About. (Let us know whether you’re using personal account or work account)</p>
<p>c. Provide the steps you’re following to insert the video.</p>
<p>d. Screenshot of your problem for better understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your patience and understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chitrahaas </p>

<h2>            Exchange 2010 to 365 Hybrid without ADFS</h2>
                    I have a single exchange 2010 sp3 server and want to perform a hybrid deployment to 365, using the Azure AD Connect tool. I want to have password sync enabled and not use ADFS. Is there any reason why this would be an issue, I've done a lot of homework
 and not found anyone who has documented doing the same. I'm happy with all of the domain/DNS config, and the alternate UPN in AD on-premises that we require. My assumption is that I can install ADD Connect on a dedicated domain joined server, go through the
 wizard with password sync and the exchange hybrid deployment options checked. Then I can go through the hybrid deployment to create the connector between on-premises and exchange online. Most people seem to do this via the 2010 EMC, but I'm open to suggestions
 for better ways based on the above. E-mail goes through a filtering service, before going to out on-premises server, so I assume that once all mailboxes are migrated to exchange online, I can repoint the filtering service to the

<p>Hi ChrisSeal,</p>
<p>I will list your questions:</p>
<p>1. “<em>I want to have password sync enabled and not use ADFS. Is there any reason why this would be an issue</em>”</p>
<p>There will be no issue. Without ADFS, we can deploy Exchange 2010 hybrid.</p>
<p>2. “<em>My assumption is that I can install ADD Connect on a dedicated domain joined server, go through the wizard with password sync and the exchange hybrid deployment options checked. Then I can go through the hybrid deployment to create the connector
 between on-premises and exchange online</em>”</p>
<p>Great. You’re absolutely right.</p>
<p>For hybrid deployment, you can use Hybrid Configuration Wizard (HCW). HCW will automatically configure hybrid settings, include connectors, etc.</p>
<p>You can refer to Exchange Server Deployment Assistant to deploy hybrid: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/exdeploy2013/Checklist?state=2718-W-AAAAAAAAQAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
technet.microsoft.com/.../Checklist</a></p>
<p>3. “<em>I assume that once all mailboxes are migrated to exchange online, I can repoint the filtering service to the 365 tenant</em>?”</p>
<p>Yes, you can integrate 3rd party filtering service with Office 365.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. I was able to install Office 365 from the portal last week. Then, I was having an issue on why I cannot open Microsoft Excel file from explorer. So, I tried repairing (online) the Office as suggested in one of the forums but after
 this process, Office 365 disappeared in my computer. Tried downloading again and now I am receiving this error code 30188-39. Help please!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Olivia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the problem occurred after you tried repairing (online).</p>
<p>Also try to use this <strong>easy fix tool</strong> to completely uninstall Office then try again</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair an Office application</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please double check the App and Feature to ensure Office doesn’t exists in your computer?</p>
<p>(Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;Programs and Features) </p>
<p>And let us know the result.</p>

            <p>Maybe its caused due to water getting into the phone. If you think that’s the case then use a hairdryer and carefully heat the camera lens and let the water inside to evaporate.<br />

<p>But the best way is to take it to the shop and ask for a Repair or maybe a Replacement if the warranty is still not void.<br />

 came good again. I had a look and it says there are no new updates for it. He thinks maybe it would help to redo the phone but I have to back all info just looked at sending to cloud I did some as a test but now i don't know how to find it the cloud and contents.

<h2>            Send as attachment freezes Excel when closing application</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I encounter an issue in where one of my supported user, when using the send as attachment option in MS Excel. It opens up an new message window and the message was sent out with no issue. The issue are as follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>After sending the email, the new message window does not automatically close </li><li>After manually closing the window, when trying to close Excel it freezes. There seems to be a save option popup box, but never appears and Excel just does not respond.</li></ol>
<p>Anyone have any idea whether how to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>Anyone encounter the issue before?</p>

    <title>Excel just IGNORES the date format I tell it to use - very - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jheikkinen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel just IGNORES the date format I tell it to use - very frustrating&#33;</h2>
                    Let me start with two important background facts:<br />
<ul>
<li>I am Canadian and reside in Canada, and have my various regional and language settings set up accordingly (and with the exception noted below, I do not wish to change these if any other option is available).</li><li>Contrary to what Microsoft software invariably assumes, the US date format (mm/dd/yy, in Microsoft terms) is
<i>at least</i> as commonly used in Canada as the UK one (dd/mm/yy).</li></ul>
In particular, when I look at the date on a receipt for a purchase of any kind, it is
<i>always </i>in the US format (the only exception I've noticed is the Canadian government, who use yyyy/mm/dd and thereby sidestep the whole problem) If I could change the default short date format in my regional settings to the US format, I would - but unfortunately,
 Windows 7 doesn't give me that option, not without lying about what country I'm in and thereby changing other things I don't want changed.<br />
<br />
(This is just one of many cases where MS software going back to Windows 95 has made and in some cases continues to make questionable or downright wrong assumptions about what constitutes reasonable regional settings for Canadians, I assume because we're too
 polite to correct them. Older versions of the English (Canada) dictionary were risible - no-one here, or anywhere that I know of, even the UK, uses spellings like "manoeuvre" or "connexion" anymore, and don't even get me started on keyboard settings... but
 I digress.)<br />
<br />
Now, having said all that, the above problem with Windows 7 not letting me change certain regional settings is the sort of problem that creates other problems. To wit:<br />
<br />
I have a column in which I have set the date format to mm/dd/yy. However, Excel, completely flying in the face of all common sense, "helpfully" assumes I am NOT entering dates in that format. When I type in something like 09/07/13, it
<i>actually flips the first two numbers on me, </i>assuming that this date was meant to be July 9 even though I have explicitly told it that in that column, that string means September 7. (It parses dates along the lines of 9/30/13 correctly, but if something
 makes sense as both a US or UK format date, it assumes I'm entering it in the UK format even though I've told it the column uses US format.)<br />
<br />
Why would I have set the format that way in the first place if that wasn't how I was planning on entering the dates, and more importantly,
<i>how can I get it to <b>not </b>automatically make this incorrect "correction"?!?
</i>I'd prefer to have it take these dates at face value <i>without</i> screwing up the sort order, so "just make it a text column" is NOT an acceptable answer, even ignoring the fact that it will screw up all the data I've already entered.<br />
<br />
Another thing that makes this still more annoying is that this is just about the ONLY case where it "corrects" the date format. I've tried entering dates several other ways in the hopes that it will automatically change them into the format I've set for that
 column - I've seen Excel do this before, mostly when I was entering things that <i>
weren't</i> dates but that look kind of like dates. (For example, once when I was doing a list of Magic: the Gathering cards, it kept "correcting" creatures' power and toughness stats to things like Feb-02 instead of 2/2.) But now, the one time I WANT Excel
 to do this, it won't, no matter what I type in!<br />
<br />
tl;dr version:<br />
<ol>
<li>How, given my other settings as described above, do I get Excel to stop<b> </b>
incorrectly "correcting" dates that could be either UK or US format, like 09/07/13, by flipping the first two numbers? i.e. I want it to just leave them the way I'm entering them, but Excel stubbornly refuses to do this and there's no obvious way to change
 this WITHOUT screwing anything else up (e.g. sort order).</li><li>If there isn't a satisfactory answer to 1, or heck, even if there is, in what unambiguous formats can I enter dates and have it automatically change them to the format specified for the column? I thought this was the default behaviour, but in practice,
 Excel seems to do this at all and only times when I <b>don't</b> want it to.<br />
</li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>as you said in&nbsp;Canada the regional settings are: dd/mm/yyyy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and you want to convert the dates in column A to mm/dd/yyyy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>first,</p>
<p>use Custom format in column A &nbsp;<strong>mm/dd/yyyy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>second,</p>
<p><u>basic</u></p>
<p>say that you want to type:&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;25 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type as the regional settings: 25/12/2013</p>
<p>and returns.. 12/25/2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also,</p>
<p>try this sample</p>
<p>say that you want in column&nbsp;B...<strong>yyyy-mm-dd</strong></p>
<p>use custom format in col. B yyyy-mm-dd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and in cell B1 type <strong>dd/mm/yyyy (25/12/2013)</strong></p>
<p>returns <strong>yyyy-mm-dd (2013-12-25)</strong></p>

            I would much rather be able to read the dates directly off the receipts and type in exactly what it says. That's really the point, not so much the format they display in - that can be anything, really, as long as it's consistent (though it's easiest to
 work with if that too matches what's on the receipts). As emphasized above, I really just want a way to type in US format dates and have them consistently interpreted as US format dates, not a way to type in something
<i>other </i>than US format dates.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's not like your suggestion is <i>that </i>hard, in the grand scheme of things. (Actually, it's
<i>easier </i>than you make it out to be - you don't need the custom format since the format you say to create already exists among the built-in Date options). I've already done what you suggest a few times where nothing else worked.
<b>But </b>it's slower and more error-prone (not to mention <i>annoying</i>), not insurmountably so, I grant, but enough so that it ain't the droids I'm looking for.
<br />
<br />
For context, there's a fairly large number of items to enter and, once I've cleared the current backlog, this will have to be done again (albeit on a smaller scale) on a monthly basis basically indefinitely. It's an annoying but important bit of busywork that
 I want to make as quick and painless as possible. To that end, a solution that lets me just type in what is actually on the receipt without having to think about or translate it is preferable to nearly any solution that doesn't.<br />

            <p>Only if the AddIn supports this, your AddIn does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>If the macro recorder is active, any macro can store commands to the recorded macro. If you use the AddIn to tranfer the data, the AddIn executes a macro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple "Hello World" example,&nbsp;paste this code into a normal module:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub MyAddInMacro(Argument)<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox Argument<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp; Application.RecordMacro "Msg = ActiveCell"<br />
&nbsp; Application.RecordMacro "MyAddInMacro Msg"<br />
&nbsp; Msg = ActiveCell<br />
&nbsp; MyAddInMacro Msg<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>Close the VBA editor and write some chars in some cells. Start the macro recorder, select a filled cell, execute the macro Test (press Alt-F8, etc.), stop the macrorecorder and have a look at the recorded macro.</p>

<h2>            Onedrive for business always requires credentials</h2>
                    
<p>have this problem for weeks.</p>
<p>almost every time i login to my system, onedrive requires credentials to sync my files. sometimes i even could not find any place to input my credential.&nbsp;a screenshot is&nbsp;shown below.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b0fcd7d4-34c8-4ec5-8838-5b19bdce10a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db0fcd7d4-34c8-4ec5-8838-5b19bdce10a1" /></a></p>
<p>when this happens, i have to use the repair option. then all the files&nbsp;in the onedrive folder will be moved to a new folder and the online version will be downloaded. since i have thousands of files it will take a looooong time. also i am worrying if i will
 lose any file during this process.</p>
<p>is it possible to solve this problem? i do not want to input my credential everyday, no need to say download all my file again and again. actually i hope onedrive could work silently, as if it does not exit but&nbsp;keep my files safe.</p>
<p>thank you</p>

                    <p>I have a worksheet that has data that uses dynamic lists to create data. Sometimes the data is one row or sometimes it can be thirty rows. After the user updates the data I wish to have a button that would copy this data from worksheet1 to worksheet2 and
 place the data in row A2 and move down from there. When the data set changes I would like the new data to be appended to the data already existing in worksheet2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In worksheet1 my data only exists in columns F, G, H.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far this is what I have but it only copies the first row of data that is generated each time to build the data set in worksheet2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; r = 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Worksheet1").Range("F2:H2").Copy<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Sheets("Worksheet1").Range("A2") = Sheets("Worksheet2").Range("A30").End(xlUp) _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then r = 0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Worksheet2").Range("A31").End(xlUp).Offset(r, 0).PasteSpecial _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Paste:=xlPasteValues<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Application.CutCopyMode = False</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance with this.</p>

            <p>Try the code below.&nbsp; I've set it up with Const values for worksheet names, column IDs and first data row on each sheet to make it easy to adapt if needed.</p>
<p>It looks for last used row in F:H on source sheet to determine how many rows to copy, and will work even if all 3 don't have entries in all cells in 'last' row.&nbsp; In determining where to put it on the destination sheet, it looks for the last used row anywhere
 on that sheet and copies F2:H# to column A just below last used row on the sheet in any column.</p>

<br />
<br />In Word, go to File - Account and sign out 
<br />
<br />Close all Office Applications 
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, type control and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel - User Accounts - credential manager - Windows Credentials

<br />Remove all Office 365 credentials that look like: MicrosoftOfficeXXData: . . . ..

            <p>Hi Rikk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you already have <strong>Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 9879
</strong>installed on your computer you can install it from Windows Store as Windows Update. Please
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/settings-all#Tab=t9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">open PC Settings</a></strong>&nbsp;and then check for updates under
<strong>Update and Recovery</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However there is another method to install <strong>Windows 10 Technical Preview
</strong><strong>Build </strong><strong>9926. </strong>You can download the ISO file from the link given below and install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Download Windows&nbsp;10 Technical Preview ISO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso</a>
</p>

            <p>Thanks, found it through PC Settings, but had to search for it, why doesn't PC Setting appear somewhere like Control Panel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it loaded OK, but came up with .... "There was a problem with connecting to OneDrive."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I discover that no matter how many times I click "Connect Automatically" for the internet, it never does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing ... I see a new Start Menu, an improvement on nothing, but there is no link to the Control Panel! Now I have to do a search for it, like we were back in DOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will Microsoft listen to it's customers and give us back the Start Menu as it was in Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works, we know it, we like it, it does the job .... haven't you learnt from the flak you got when 8 came out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hate it when you change things for no good reason, and if 10 doesn't have the old Start Menu, as we were led to believe, you will get more bad press. This new one is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You even change names for no reason .... File Manager &gt; Windows Explorer &gt; File Explorer, it's as though you deliberately try to annoy people.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Why does Microsoft go to so much trouble to hide this number from customers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to pay money for a MS product I have no problem IMMEDIATELY getting in touch with an agent.

<p>
</p><p>But for customer service, the number stays hidden. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love to hear if anyone has found a number!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice a video on MS where young people in a large, calm, cool, bright building are saying they would LOOOOVE to get feedback on products and services but ...gee whiz....they don't provide a phone number as to where to reach them..

<p>Thanks for your suggestion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like Virtual Assistant. I like talking to customer service agents in Canada or the US.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS needs to open its wallet, set up a Customer Service Dept to answer the endless complaints about its products and services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I grew up in an era where a business would not let its phone ring any more than twice before picking up. This concept is foreign to MS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to go to great lengths to reach senior management to get MS problems solved, and I hate bothering them. But it works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply nonetheless. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day. </p>

<p>Hi SolarEclipse:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customers will decide when there are be no more toll-free phone numbers, not you. Keep your arrogant remarks to yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to write the CEO of Microsoft Canada, Ms Janet Kennedy, in Toronto, Ontario, and the CEO of Microsoft USA, Mr. Satya Nadella, in Redmond, Washington.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will print and attach your comment, and recommend you be sent for basic customer service training. I will send them my comments by written letter -- that is,&nbsp; of course, only if you don't mind me sending letters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already spoken to two Microsoft customer service agents since posting my question, and now have both their phone numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I spoke to a senior customer service rep this morning, January 26 at 9:00 am Mountain Time, and he advised me that
<p>
</p><p>I have already copied and printed your comment so there is no point trying to take it down.</p>

</p><p>Good luck with your job.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> jerry1777  say:</h3>
<h2>            MapPoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>In November 2016 I asked the question "Does MapPoint 2013 still have VBA in it?"</p>
<p>The reply was "Yes. But you probably would not want to purchase it because it would not be wise to program with a discontinued product!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have lost my MapPoint 2011 to a hard disk crash and needed to replace it.</p>
<p>I have many programs and routines Using the VBA code inside MapPoint from inside Microsoft Acces to automatically
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Send name and address to MapPoint, sort data by address, send numerical field and post to an Access table while producing maps in routes, print&nbsp; sorted reports in Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VBA code I have needs no additional development but does need MapPoint on my computer so it can be called as an application from Microsoft Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My MapPoint 2011 was registered with Microsoft, but in 6 phone calls (all of which were dropped), Microsoft could not get me routed anywhere to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up with the need to have Mappoint on my computer so my MapPoint Application code in Access would work.</p>
<p>I did find a copy of MapPoint 2013 on the internet, registered and installed it, and solved my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I meant to reply to my 2016 question and answer that there is a good reason to have VBA built into MapPoint if only to run already-written VBA Code,</p>
<p>Thanks again to the MVP who answered Yes&nbsp;</p>

    <title>VBA Code to Open a Form in Datasheet Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rdw1260  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA Code to Open a Form in Datasheet Mode</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Access 2016. I have a switchboard item which opens a form&nbsp;after doing some web research dates back to the 1990s.&nbsp; Based on my research it appears that the following event VBA code is very outdated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Form_Load()<br />
If Me.OpenArgs = "GotoNew" And Not IsNull(Me![SubjectMatterID]) Then<br />
DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, 3, 0, , acMenuVer70<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've found the following which does not make sense for acFormBar, 3, 0, , acMenuVer70:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0 Undo<br />
1 Cut<br />
2 Copy<br />
3 Paste<br />
6 Delete<br />
8 Select record<br />
9 Select all records</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to open&nbsp;the form: SubjectMattersTypes"&nbsp;in datasheet view instead of form view. I'm seeing macros are being created in my database instead of VBA when I use one of the wizards.&nbsp;Are macros replacing VBA event procedures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help,</p>

<p>It appears that I'm going to have to learn how to create navigation forms.&nbsp; Do know of any web sites that's a good source of examples of creating them and/or example of styles?</p>
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I can't help you on that score, I'm afraid, as I have never had occasion to use a navigation form.&nbsp; I always design the opening menu forms for applications from scratch as a simple unbound form with command buttons to go to the relevant objects in the database.&nbsp;
 You'll find examples in most of my demo files e.g. <em>Questionnaire.zip</em> in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
When you open this file you are presented with an opening form in a format I've used for many applications over the years.&nbsp; Four of the three command buttons open forms by calling the OpenForm method of the DoCmd object in the control's Click event procedure.&nbsp;
 The first two open bound forms, the third and fourth open unbound dialogue forms, of which the first then opens a bound form, the second a report.&nbsp; The final button on the form simply closes the database.<br />
<br />
By using forms of my own design like this I can tailor them specifically to each application, and present them in a consistent style.&nbsp; If you want to explore navigation forms, however, google 'Access navigation forms tutorial' and you'll find plenty of links
 to choose from.<br />
