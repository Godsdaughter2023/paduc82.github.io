<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes you can do it on your Touch PRO. I dot it on my Diamond with a 3 persons group. I don't know if there is a limit, but you can try it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just create a new Outlook contact named for instance Group1, and in the e-mail field just paste the several e-mails seperated by semi-colon ( ; ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works great for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Nuno Luz</p>

<p>I am having the exact same issue. Have tried to contact support through multiple methods and have gotten no feedback. Apparently, my old account (which I am unable to access) is over-riding the existence of my current account in the search engine when people
 try to look my name up.</p>

<p>I even called Microsoft and spoke to an operator who said they have noone specifically to assist with Skype.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Skype account is linked to the Microsoft account, we have another resolution for that. Its like moving your Skype account to a different Microsoft account (please use dummy Microsoft account). Let me also set your expectation that we only allow you
 to move your Skype account <strong>one time</strong>, so it's important that you verify the Microsoft account you want to use before getting started. You won't be able to merge your Skype account with a Microsoft account that is already linked to another Skype
 account, or has existing Skype Credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have move the Skype account (the one you want to close), to the dummy Microsoft account then please proceed with the deletion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about this, please go through this link: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa34822/can-i-move-my-skype-account-to-a-different-microsoft-account-if-it-s-already-been-linked?q=move+link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            This is a 2-step process. The first is exporting your contacts from AOL to a CSV file and the second is importing those contacts (CSV file) into Outlook.com.

<h2>            mail merge 2010 extra space</h2>
                    <p>Mail merge adds several spaces between words in the address see example below. I've tried to edit the mail merge by hand however can only print the first envelope. I've also tired exporting to pdf and it still won't print. When I edit the addresses the edits
 are gone and it reverts back to the way they merged in. I've been searching for days on how to import the names with out this problem. It seems the problem must be in excel and have tried erasing all the formatting still with no luck.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Hermes, 
<br />What is the address in this? 
<br />&gt; 550 5.1.1 &lt;emailadres&gt;... User unknown
<br />I don't need to see the exact address - you can replace parts with 'alias' and 'domain' - but it appears that is something not quite right with it, such as extra characters in it. ( Single quotes are not uncommon.)

<p>That's not the problem </p>
<p>The address is correct</p>
<p>More then often checked</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its strange i can&nbsp; other people in the organisation with the same domain name send an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem tartd with my gmail account (using mailapp windows 10)&nbsp; at once a bouncer&nbsp; after several times i used a live account also with&nbsp; the same mail app&nbsp; (used automatic fill) no problems at all
</p>
<p>I could send an email and i could reply on his email.</p>
<p>But then i get also bouncers on his email and if i try to send an email also the same bouncers
</p>
<p>So now i have bouncers on gmail and live</p>
<p>Even after deleting the accounts from the mail app and re instal them&nbsp; the same problem</p>

            they are most likely in the \Windows folder. Note that these files are built into the ROM. Even if you are able to delete them, they will come back if you perform a hard reset.

            <p>Thank you Anusha. The issue is that I am not getting a red warning, but a orange one. So, there has not been a way for me to send in a report as a website owner. All I have been able to do is type in a code and clicking that it is a safe site. I have done
 this every day for a few weeks now and nothing has changed. Do you know how long the process is for Microsoft to go in and take my site off the phishing list? Or is there anything else you know of that I can do?</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 hangs when opening emails from a certain sender - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jw_ic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 hangs when opening emails from a certain sender</h2>
                    I have a problem when we a receive a notification email from a certain sender.&nbsp; The email is actually from an internal address within the company.&nbsp; We receive email notifications when we receive a voice mail on our phone system and that email is what is
 causing the problems.&nbsp; The email we receive is very basic and just has a small amount of text saying "IP Office Voicemail redirected message".&nbsp; When I try to open the email (or view when the reading pane is enabled) it hang Outlook for about 20-30 seconds.&nbsp;
 This happens with every notification email we receive from that address.&nbsp; I tried locking up Outlook when it was hanging to see if I could get any error messages.&nbsp; In Event Viewer I got this:<br />
<br />
"The program OUTLOOK.EXE version 14.0.7113.5000 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Action Center control panel."<br />
<br />
Things I have tried:<br />
Clean install (of both Office and Windows)<br />
Removing and recreating the Outlook profile<br />
Setting Outlook to "Read all standard mail in plain text"<br />
Updating Windows/Office<br />
Setting our voice mail server to send from a different email address<br />
Opening Outlook in safe mode<br />
<br />
We are on a domain with Exchange.&nbsp; This started happening a couple of months ago.<br />
<br />
Any ideas as to what I can try next?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<p>Hi Bernie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your purchase of Office came with a product key, you can enter your product key in Office setup website. After you enter your key, you can download and install your Office. Kindly follow these steps on how to enter your product key:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>www.office.com/setup</strong></a>.</li><li>Sign in with your Microsoft account, or create one if you don't have one. Be sure to remember this account so that you can install or reinstall Office later, without a product key.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/72ce415d-6e6d-44aa-9732-c2cfcf8e9423?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<h2>            VBA checking if the Conditional Format returns TRUE</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Required :</span><br />
I'm trying to find if the conditional format's formula returns true.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Problem :</span><br />
So I thought I'd check the cell.interior.color, but it only returns the base color.<br />
<br />
How can I either :<br />
- Get color's number as seen on the screen<br />
or<br />
- check if a conditionalFormat.Formula1 returns true?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hi Nancy,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting the thread on our forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you create a simple table in Excel 2016, Table Style Options and Table Styles should appear. For the issue please upload some related screenshots for our reference. Meanwhile,
 I suggest you go to Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;right-click on the Office 2016 applications’ icon&gt;Change&gt;Online Repair, restart the computer and then do a test to see the result. Moreover, upload a full screenshot of the&nbsp; Account page in Excel 2016 for our reference.
 You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d04a631-0590-43c7-9572-1929ba5d695f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d04a631-0590-43c7-9572-1929ba5d695f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>For the Properties option, it is only enabled when you get the table from an external data source such as a SharePoint Online list. If the table data isn’t from an external data source,
 the option is greyed out by default.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34a53080-0722-4ea3-b0d3-f92082fd867f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34a53080-0722-4ea3-b0d3-f92082fd867f?upload=true" /></a></p>

    <title>Filter icon greyed out on certain fields in a table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ross2013w  say:</h3>
<h2>            Filter icon greyed out on certain fields in a table</h2>
                    <p>I have a table called&nbsp;tblMilestoneStateMachine&nbsp;in which several fields lookup values from&nbsp;linked tables. The figure below shows one example of such a field: Curr_MeetingTypeID.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef9c616f-2160-465b-9121-4d7e3216f613" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The combo box query is:</p>
<p>SELECT tblCatalogMeetings.MeetingTypeID, tblCatalogMeetings.MeetingType<br />
FROM tblCatalogMeetings<br />
ORDER BY tblCatalogMeetings.SortOrder;</p>
<p>
</p><p>where tblCatalogMeetings is a linked table. Curr_MeetingTypeID&nbsp;is bound to column 1 and column 2 is displayed in the table. (Pretty standard stuff.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this field, the filter icon appears greyed out. When I click on the arrow next to the field name a weird selection window opens.</p>
<p>Is this a known problem? My searches have revealed nothing. (The typical reported problem is not being able to filter within&nbsp;a form.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I decided to come back to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that the filter icon is greyed out on every field using a combo box&nbsp;with a lookup defined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I edited the first field&nbsp;(ProgLevelID) having a lookup: I changed the lookup from combo box to text, saved the table, then re-configured the combo box lookup. Not only did the&nbsp;filter icon start to work, it now worked on all of the other fields where it did
 not work before -- even though I made no changes to those fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a second&nbsp;table with&nbsp;ProgLevelID as a field&nbsp;that&nbsp;also uses a combo box lookup. I had the same filter icon problems as in the first&nbsp;table.&nbsp; I re-did the combo box lookup definition as described above and the filter icon started to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I returned to the first table the filter icon was again greyed out on all the fields as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it makes any difference, the database was originally crated in Access 2007, was imported into Access 2010 and then imported into Access 2013.</p>

 profile/wallpaper to preferred ones. if i dont do this then,the phone turns on power but the screen stays white with nokia - as would to the point of joining hands- only i dont get to the hands... also, my menu option that was once 'download' has replaced
 itself with the 'ovi store' which doesnt do anything other than show the initial ovi start up- incidetally, the ovi store in my apps has also stopped wiorking and has a script alert stating initialisation failed.. any help appreciated - finally, on applications
 installed instead of the usual list of installed apps,as u would expect- i get nothing,, it used to return back a step- now it shuts phone down where i have to repeat steps at top of these probs....phew!:smileysurprised:</p>

<p>Hi, try a soft reset, back up your contacts with Ovi suite, NOT your settings(these may be causing the problem) Then dial *#7370# followed by passkey 12345 the phone will re-start and be 'factory fresh' but you will have to 'set it up' again. Nothing on
 memory card will be affected.</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<h3> d. lucas  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;FR&#93; Show details gives more info</h2>
                    In the My Phone app, we're able to click on the "Show details" link to get a summary of the "Changes made to your phone or online account".<br />
<br />
E.g., my last sync gave me:<br />
<br />
Calendar:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 updated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 deleted<br />
Text messages:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 new<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 deleted<br />
Documents:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 deleted<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to have an additional "Show details" link next to each of these changes so that we can identify exactly what was changed.&nbsp; For example, the calendar entries added/deleted, the document filenames updated/deleted, etc., as well as where they modified,
 on the phone or on the online account.<br />
<br />
You could alternatively just include that info by default, but for most cases the summary may be sufficient and it's only in some cases that you want/need the more detailed info.<br />

<p>The problem I have is the alignment of the text. &nbsp;I would like to set a hanging indent so that all numbers, starting position of text and word wrapped text all align correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I get by default:&nbsp;<a href="http://prntscr.com/bsbv7i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://prntscr.com/bsbv7i</a> (please copy to your browser)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Footnote Reference is separated from the Footnote Text by a single space character. &nbsp;For single digit numbers a hanging indent of 0.2 cm works, for double digit numbers the hanging indent has to be 0.3 cm. &nbsp;If you have a mix on the one page you can't
 get the text to align.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like it to align like a numbered list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Now is the time</li><li>for all For all good men</li><li>To come to the aid</li><li>Of the party</li><li>Now is the time</li><li>For all good men</li><li>To come to the aid</li><li>Of the party</li><li>Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party and for all good men to come to the aid for the quick brown fox to jump over the lazy dog</li><li>For all good men</li><li>To come to the aid&nbsp;</li><li>Of the party</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be gratefully received. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1)">So I recently upgraded to Office 365 which came with Outlook 2016 and was disappointing to say the least that the Appointments list in the To-Do bar STILL only shows up to the next 7 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1)">There are hundreds if not thousands of complaints about this that go back years (as this was a problem in Office 2013 as well). Yes I get that the calendar functionality changed to this whole “peek” thing but that does not mean
 it is an improved or even practical change. We need the functionality we had in 2010.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1)">So I’d love to know if Microsoft is actually going to correct this and allow us to display more than 1 week or at the very least would love an explanation for why this was changed in the first place? What benefits does this have
 over the old 2010 version?</span></p>

<h2>            Mail merge with single first page, and multiple second pages</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a really hard time figuring this one out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to use a mail merge to create a document that has a single first page, and then one or more second pages.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my example (i work for the judiciary)</p>
<p>I have a one-page letter, cover sheet that is generated for each defendant.&nbsp; It is a letter to a defendant stating that they are scheduled for court.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after this first page, there could be one OR more "second" pages.&nbsp; i.e., there is a one-page&nbsp;court order that is generated for EACH DIFFERENT case that they have in our system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merge data spreadsheet (which is probably not set up right) looks something like this...</p>

<p>
</p><p>At first I was&nbsp;running a macro that stored both the cover letter and court order in autotext entries (this is how i've accomplished this type of problem before).&nbsp; So, the macro inserted the cover letter autoext entry for the first person, fills in the address,
 etc.&nbsp; Then loop through each case, inserting an order, filling in the case number, etc., for each case that they have.&nbsp; Wash, rinse and repeat. &nbsp;However this is a royal pain as trying to use section breaks, etc. in this situation&nbsp;is a nightmare.&nbsp; It just never
 seems to follow the section break rules that i set up for it.&nbsp; So i thought that a mail merge would be faster and much cleaner.&nbsp; The second page(s) (court order) is a very complicated table...it has many many rows, columns, and lots of merge fields.&nbsp; I tried
 looking into using headers, different first page, etc., doing nested mail merge, but neither seemed to help me solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something that can be done?&nbsp; I'm pretty familiar with VBA, so using code to do this wouldn't be a problem..</p>

            <p>Doug is correct, my Many to One add-in will not do this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A custom process would be required, and frankly it doesn't matter where you store the fixed texts. They could be building blocks for the fixed texts (as your original premise) or separate documents, or listed in a Word Table or better still an Excel workbook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looping through the Worksheet is relatively straightforward, but it would be time consuming to achieve a reliable working version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is not so clear from your proposal is whether you want to include all records on the sheet, or just a selection.</p>
<p>
If you want to discuss rates, then contact me (or of course Doug) and one of us can take it further. We would however require a sample datasheet (and an example of the finished document). Doug's e-mail address is at the bottom of his message, or you can contact
 me at supportATgmayor.com (put your forum username in the message subject).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To answer your question (i think), I am looping through and including each and every one of the entries on the spreadsheet.&nbsp; I want to create a cover sheet, and then after that, an order for each separate case #&nbsp;that the defendant has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you offer any advice on doing it one of the other ways you suggested...using separate documents or a Word or Excel table?&nbsp; I don't know if this is what you're talking about, but the court order is basically one big table...with lots of rows and columns,
 fields, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say separate documents, could you run the merge on each file, and then somehow merge the two documents together?&nbsp; I guess that would be even more complicated than the autotext method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try to use the autotext, the mess that occurs is with the section/page breaks.&nbsp; I can insert the additional orders just fine, but often the top part of the second order bumps up to the order on the first page, or it creates a bunch of blank pages
 at the end of the file&nbsp;as each loop iteration progresses.&nbsp; I've tried inserting the section breaks via code, as well as on the document itself...coding a delete command after the autotext insert, to get rid of the blank page that inserts itself.&nbsp; I come so
 close, but it just never behaves the way i want it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think of doing it through Access?&nbsp; I am very familiar with Access.&nbsp; Could i set up relationships and do it with some sort of report?&nbsp; Or is that just going to behave like the add-in (only being able to use a continuous report, nested in the regular
 report?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all of your quick replies.</p>

            <p>Do you need it to be a single document as opposed to separate documents for each defendant (given that presumably these orders are sent to the defendants, so will need to be separated at some point) in order to deliver them?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With separate documents it is a relatively straightforward task to start a new document from a template, which would contain the cover page and a page break before the case data. Then loop through the worksheet to get the defendant's data and insert it sequentially.&nbsp;
 There should be no reason to have blank pages, (unless there are extra breaks are in the inserted text) as long as you set a range where the text is to be inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where you insert the fixed texts from is really immaterial. If it is in the cells of an Excel worksheet then you can read that worksheet into an array using ADODB and process the array to get the data in the document. A Word table you can read from directly,
 if you open the document, and it works well, but is slower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Building blocks are already in the template so are inserted quickly, but are more fiddly to set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want it all in one document then having processed the first defendant, you insert a section break, and start to compile again. Otherwise you save and close then start again,</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; I thought about keeping them as separate documents before...the cover sheets and the orders, but i'm not sure if that is acceptable to those who will be using it.&nbsp; It would certainly be a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, when you think about it, it would probably be even&nbsp;better that way anyway.&nbsp; I could even create an envelope on the second page of the cover sheets file.&nbsp; It would be easy to programmatically open/create the orders using the same merge data
 after finishing the cover sheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to ask the ones who commissioned me to create this, to see if that is acceptable.&nbsp; Like i said, now that i think about it, it makes more sense to do it as seperate documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your reply and advice.</p>

            As you say with separate documents, it is a much simpler process. If the users don't want to use separate documents to hold the fixed data then use the building blocks. It is only the setting up of them that is fiddly. Once done they are transparent to
 the user. <br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Per checking the account, we found that you have purchased a subscription “Office 365 Enterprise E5” on February 23rd 2017. While our system was trying to charge for monthly subscription of amount 26.41 GBP to the credit card# 8620, the
 transaction failed due to credit card decline by the financial institution. </span>
<span>Please be informed that below are the common scenarios when customer’s credit card gets decline:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Confirm with </span><span>the bank if the transaction has been blocked from their end? (If yes, ask the bank to allow the transaction, our system will try to charge their credit card once in every 3 days).
</span></li><li><span>Cross check if the credit card information is updated and same as registered with the bank. (If you wants any help in updating, please
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Add-update-or-remove-a-credit-card-or-bank-account-in-Office-365-for-business-30ba9c83-50d8-4020-90ed-830a5b8c8724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a> to follow instructions for updating credit card). </span></li><li><span>Check If you have enough funds in credit card?</span></li><li><span>Check with the bank and make sure the card is allowed for recurring, online or international transaction.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please check all the above. Let us know if the issue persists.</span></p>

 this means you can only use one Number&nbsp; to make voice calls, its pointless. Everything works OK if you forget Ovi Suite and input dirrect into the Phone</p>

    <title>Problems deploying add-in for entire organization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markus engvall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems deploying add-in for entire organization</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
We have developed an Office add-in for Word that we now are trying to sort out what good ways there are for our customers to distribute through their organizations. These customers are using Office 365. From what we gather there are two ways of doing this,
 but none of these ways seem to work for us.<br />
<br />
The first one is distributing from an add-in catalog as described on https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/publish/publish-task-pane-and-content-add-ins-to-an-add-in-catalog. When following the instructions on this page we fill in all required fields correctly
 and click "Ok". After loading for a while we're returned to the "Manage site collection" page. There are no error messages, but the site we entered does not appear. We can therefore not perform the next step of adding the add-in manifest to the catalog. What
 could be the cause of this?<br />
<br />
We have also tried the "Centralized Deployment" variety, also with little success. Using the admin interface we can successfully upload the manifest, turn it on/off and set access to everyone. However, when testing with any account in our Office 365 organization,
 we cannot see the add-in we just added. What gives?<br />
<br />
If you need more details, I'm happy to supply them!<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Markus

            <p>Hi Markus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After checking the tenant information and screenshots you provided , finally, I have figured it out the cause of the issue you experienced.</p>
<p>=========================== </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Issue1:</span></p>
<p><span>You can't deploy add-ins referring to: </span><a href="https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/publish/publish-task-pane-and-content-add-ins-to-an-add-in-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Publish task pane and content add-ins to a SharePoint
 catalog</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Cause:</span></p>
<p><span>You don't have SharePoint Online license, so when you create the catalog site , after loading for a while, you are returned to the
</span><span>"Manage site collection" page</span><span>, </span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>but the site
</span><span>you</span><span> entered does not appear. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Resolution:</span></p>
<p>To use this method to deploy add-in centrally, please subscribe a SharePoint Online subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Issue2:</span></p>
<p><span>You can't deploy addin using Office 365 admin center. Refer to: </span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deploy-Office-Add-ins-in-the-Office-365-Admin-Center-737e8c86-be63-44d7-bf02-492fa7cd9c3f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Deploy

</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Resolution:</span></p>
<p>To use this method, you need to subscribe a plan including <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-365-ProPlus-in-the-enterprise-9f11214c-911d-4e3c-9993-a566f12b1a68?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 ProPlus</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have the licenses I mentioned above, you are not able to centrally deploy add-ins. By the way,<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have tested both methods with your add-ins and the method works. You can

<h2>            Outlook 365 not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I have two accounts in outlook 365. On my personal account, everything is working, except that the folders I added to organise my emails are not showing at all. On the second account, no emails are coming through and I can't view anything, even though I
 know there are emails in the inbox. Both accounts work fine in the Mail app on windows 10 and the web version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried deleting the second account and re-adding it, but nothing changed. I am not very technical, so please keep explanations and instructions as simple as possible, so that my brain doesn't explode.
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
