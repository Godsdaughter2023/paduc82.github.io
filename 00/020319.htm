<p><span><span>Hello agled,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you say that you are allowed to chose where to save the file and then “nothing”, what do you mean?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Does the download window close without warning?<span>&nbsp; </span>Does the download hang with no sign that data is transferring?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Or, does the download appear to complete but when you go to the folder where you saved the file it is not there?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please include this information in your reply.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the mean time I would like for you to reset your IE settings to default so we can rule out this as a cause of the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Reset Internet Explorer Settings to Defaults</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer</span></p>

<h2>            How do I subscribe to my office calendar using a https&#58; URL and .ics</h2>
                    I have published my work calendar (we use Office and Exchange) using Outlook, and sent the URL to myself on my Mac. I'd like to subscribe to that calendar in Outlook.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Help in Outlook says to click on the link, which causes iCal to offer to subscribe rather than outlook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The URL looks like this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>https://calendars.office.microsoft.com/pubcalstorage/r991pnpz1200349/---private---.ics</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This works fine in iCal, but I can't see how to achieve the same in Outlook for Mac.</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Bill,
<div><br />
<div>My understanding is that it's not currently possible to subscribe to web-based calendars in Outlook 2011. If this is a feature you'd like to see in future versions of Office for Mac, be sure to send your feedback by clicking "Help" &gt; "Send Feedback..."
 in any Office application or by clicking on the link below:</div>

            You have two separate and unrelated quesitions
<br />
<br />#1 - Re: Intellitech Graphiics 
<br />
<br />Just going by their website - they are a 3rd party graphics design vendor of which there are likely thousands. One positive sign is that they provide a physical presence on their site but that by no means guarantees anything. Personally have no experience with the company but on a general level, no matter how good any company is there are going to be cases where some people will be dissatisfied. That's going to be true for any vendor in any category.
<br />
<br />#2 - Re: Is the Community part of Microsoft
<br />
<br />The "community" in terms of "forums" are part of Microsoft in terms of being run by and hosted by Microsoft which are designed to be a place for questions to be asked/answered on a "peer-to-peer" basis. The forums should not be considered to be "official" Microsoft support replacing direct contact with the company when a situation warrants it. Virtually all forums are also frequented by MVP's (Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals") an award given out to individuals or their expertise and contributions to the community but who are not Microsoft employee's.

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />That doesn't sound right at all and wouldn't be a number I'd call and in now way would it be a "Microsoft" support number. There are a whole number of outfits that "claim" to provide "Microsoft Support" that, how shall I say this in a politically correct way, "leave a whole lot to be desired". 
<br />
<br />That said, the website I was looking at for "Intellitech Graphics" is the following and don't see anything related to "Microsoft Support" - <a href="https://www.intellitechgraphics.com/contact-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intellitechgraphics.com/contact-us....</a>. 
<br />Since I have no idea what URL are/were looking at, impossible to say whether or not the two are related.

            Hi MINERVALAI,<br />
<br />
We can’t use RMS to protect shared OneNote notebooks in Office 365.<br />
<br />
Given the situation, I suggest vote for your requirement via the link below, and it will help better our products and services.<br />
<a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327186-onenote-for-windows-windows-phone/suggestions/8467711-add-rms-support-in-onenote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add RMS support in OneNote</a><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, to prevent users from downloading OneNote notebooks to local computers, you can consider sharing them with the “View Only” permission.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing Bian

            I have internet Explorer. I have done the reset thing the first email instructed for windows 7, and it didn't change anything. Why when I've been using this same computer for years with this email and now all of a sudden you say something is wrong with
 my computer??&nbsp; I don't buy that for a minute! You guys screwed it all up when you made everyone go to "outlook'.&nbsp; There was absolutely nothing wrong with the email service before that. So now I ask again, how do I get my email back to where I can use my contacts
 the way it was a day ago? If that's not possible, I'll copy my contacts from the "mobile" whatever and go to another provider for my email. This is ridiculous. I will expect an answer on how to return my email contacts list BACK TO MY EMAIL . By the way, my
 husband has one too, its *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and his is not working correctly either. What is the link for his contacts so if you cannot fix our emails, we can copy or contacts and move elsewhere.

<p><span>Hi, not really a question but a request for future releases.<br />
I installed the technical preview on my Surface 3. To my surprise the network drivers (And other drivers) for Surface 3 was not included.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>An easy workaround is to use a USB to WIFI adapter (In my case I used a D-Link DWA-140) and use Windows Update to download the necessary drivers.

<p>I did the same yesterday, installed build 10074 on the Surface 3 (not pro), used an external adapter to get onto the internet but Windows Update did not install any of the drivers I needed, I had over 20 devices listed under "Other" with no drivers installed...
 No touch screen/pen either. You were able to download all the drivers to the point where there were no missing drivers in device manager? If so maybe I'll try it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it behaving for you currently? Is it usable? Any issues with the pen/touchscreen or responsiveness?</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I own an HTC Surround, and my work has public wifi access for employees and residents. It's an unsecured network, but still requires login through Internet Explorer. I have tried logging in both on the secure and unsecure sights (it gives you an option).
 Either way, once the default user name and password are entered, IE loads an about:blank page. I have tried using Desktop or Mobile version, saving cookies, not saving cookies, deleting history, etc. Nothing works. I have had this problem with other public
 wifi spots at times, but it is consistent at work. They use an HP Procurve wireless network if that makes a diffference. Any help would be appreciated as I need my mobile phone for my job. IT here is clueless as to problem. Am I just "stuck with it?"</p>

<p>Some WiFi networks will provide you with a web page where you enter a username and password and then once that is entered there will be a pop up where you might have to enter another code.</p>
<p>Try getting on that WiFi via a laptop or PC to see what happens, my guess is that there is one more step for you to authenticate.</p>
<p>But if you have an IT department just asking them to whitelist you might be an option as well.</p>

<h2>            HTC 8x stuck in Bluescreen loop. Can&#39;t get phone to turn on.</h2>
                    As of late my phone has started to bluescreen, and I don't know why. I have the HTC 8x and I've put in all the new updates for 8.1. I also had this happen before, and I waited after the phone turned off for about a half of a day to turn it back on. That
 ended up working, and when this happened again, I did the same, although this time it is still having the same issue. I tried hard resetting the phone twice, but to no avail. I am trying the Lumia software recovery tool, but I can't get my phone to turn on
 to connect it to my laptop. Where do I go from here?

</p><p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you've really run through everything we'd really be able to try.&nbsp; As far as the Lumia Software Recovery Tool goes, that actually only works with Lumia model phones, so even if your phone was being detected by your PC it wouldn't work since
 it's an HTC model.&nbsp; As far as I'm aware, HTC doesn't have an equivalent utility to reinstall the phone's firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, your best bet would be to contact HTC support.</p>

<h2>            Windows OS Advice, Windows OS scandals and a message here.</h2>
                    <div>Apology from a Windows User&nbsp;and&nbsp;Insider.</div>

<div>(Feel free to comment)</div>

<div>Microsoft is either playing games or the developers are having a hard time releasing the appropriate windows to moved on some in progression. Personally, A&nbsp;short time ago, there was an edition called Windows 10 Enterprise Insider Preview 11082 or a couple
 of build instances. The edition of Redstone has the&nbsp;name of the disc&nbsp;and is the last build but&nbsp;with default key for&nbsp;enterprise.&nbsp;</div>

<div>While it is still there... Go to getintopc.com... And ask them.</div>

<div>May I hate to say this online, though we know what the real VL edition or key for the default is that was installed be online? I recommend this as a last resort though I hate asking at the same time for permission here on&nbsp;being legit after a bunch of scandals
 were pulled against everyone who paid for an operating system where various updates were done with system and forced...
</div>

<div>Check the BIOS. If you got an 8.1 key that activates itself on your pc with a disc&nbsp;or a windows 8 disk that is 9200 or 9600 for enterprise and one can still update hopefully from 8 unless that is gone... um... let me mention to the providers that I will
 not list what brand or name I have.</div>

<div>cause idiots to those of hacker rings at Team OS tried to generate it and those who gave earlier fluke un-finished windows to many people or something of the sort during a windows 8 crisis to the final chance to upgrade at the end of 2015, (hopefully extended
 is the time after a mess.). </div>

<div>Since the issue of reputation and distrust among companies or tech providers to many and lack of support to dignity or chance with lack of online support... (I am simply not going to explain this history because many had tested and evaluated windows before,
 during and after this mess.)</div>

<div>This happened during a crisis really to what the heck people were doing back then.</div>

<div>Regardless. If one upgrades from 8.1 to ten, you should end up with it, but then you cannot use it as the key for update or the specifics will not complete. This is just a theory in my mind.&nbsp;Where Microsoft said that 7.x-8.x key was to be given. May I
 remind people the default key for enterprise can be found online but that is the install&nbsp;key. If you are legit and own a machine model that you did not take from someone else or had bought an OEM... or actual system.</div>

<div>They will be mad at me for this, but perhaps I can admit, that someone was screwing around and reset it to much. I had evaluated the editions and am not playing games when I say whoever put the key in my machine, I am unsure. The Bios surpasses the hardware
 to also influences the virtual memory and compatibility of the software.</div>

<div>But I read that key was an upgrade key. If so that be true to what stunt was pulled. Everyone trying to upgrade from 7 to 10 right? It will not work unless you got the right key provided from 8.1 or a disc of 8 enterprise,&nbsp; or you have 7 enterprise or
 Ultimate. (no kidding.)</div>

<div>Windows 7 framework is windows 10 protocol with 8. But I figured it is based off of 8.1 as well.</div>
<div>For your machine to be genuine. The providers offer Pro up to Home.</div>

<div>I have an enterprise key and this finishes a matrix of a headache after my Windows had to be repaired to hopefully.
</div>

<div>When I had it taken to the shop, I did not know I had the key until later and noticed the keys were blocked and would not work as one would work on default.</div>

<div>They gave me a wrong edition or something happened. (Apart from this, the CD has to be downloaded or slip-streamed according to some not legally. But windows 8 fake or patch messed up peoples' machines a while back.)</div>

<div>My CD key, was given to me after someone in my family paid for windows or a lot of editions to my stress insanity&nbsp;though there is no sense paying for a free system to what each had provided. I was given a windows 8 a while back a long time ago for a different
 reason a while back.</div>

<div>I may have found an answer to this mess, but hopefully surely stop with the Windows 10 Evolution and edition project garbage for Pro.
</div>

<div>If you are looking for Pro updated, you are playing around with Team OS. -_- I know better than to join your site admin, by that I mean who knows who. -_- Some of you knew the site remasterOS. or that of someone who kept up with the news. Surely, I have
 evidence of this. Enough of the games.</div>

<div>There needs to be more consumer to company trust rather an apology from the company more. But, it was a self-help-manual-experience to who knew?</div>

<div>Windows 10 is a sham of an OS if you are looking for privacy and security because they know what you do. - Whoever in the departments of you did what I mentioned with ripping the people and us off&nbsp;ought to be fired.</div>

<div>I do not trust Microsoft development labs. I do not trust the OS Hacker rings. Do not think I will listen to a&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;rules or domain legally&nbsp;when others know what they do. This message, I trust the departments of people who do not know compared
 to those who tested and ruined others machines.</div>

<div>Everyone from XP on up deserve an upgrade but determine this among us who one of you actually owned the parts and or OS&nbsp;were legal about it, or tried to fix what was caused to us.</div>

<div>This is what I will say regardless or not. July 25, 2015 and when was the system built again?</div>

<div>Look... I would do a few background checks and check for what ever damage had been done. At least who is the head of a company or more that were careless.</div>

<div>Can anyone be trusted with online support? -_-</div>

<div>As I would acknowledge that a company had a good reputation, at least at one point.</div>
<div>Until it violated peoples' rights to concern.</div>

<div>I do not blame the company as a whole... This is all I will say.</div>
                </div>

    <title>dot in linked csv file heading name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pikeyspikey  say:</h3>
<h2>            dot in linked csv file heading name</h2>
                    have an Access table linked to a csv file in a different folder.&nbsp; Each day using vba this csv file is replaced and is re-linked (the link is deleted then re-linked).&nbsp; Two of the headings in the csv file contain a dot (.) and on re-linking this shows as
 a # in the field name in the linked table. &nbsp;How do I prevent this happening? &nbsp;I set this linked table up by selecting ‘New’ table, then ‘Link Table’ and so on.

            If Access is converting the dot (.) to an octothorpe (#), I don't think there is anything you can do about it. What you CAN do is create a query from the linked table and use Aliases to replace the field names.

            <p>The annoying thing is there is already another linked table in the database which links to a similar daily file in the same folder which works; ie on re-linking it does not convert the dot to #.&nbsp; Unfortunately the person that set this up is no longer around!&nbsp;
 There has to be a way of doing it which he obviously discovered...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried using a correct field name on setting this up in the wizard and that is fine till the table is re-linked when # shows!</p>

            Maybe this could be accomplished when you create an Import Specification and set the field names. Then you can link using 1 line of code: DoCmd.TransferText.

    <title>Changing Windows Live Account Info &#40;password&#41; on WM6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bellevue_22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Windows Live Account Info &#40;password&#41; on WM6 Smartphone</h2>
                    I searched for other threads on this, but I didn't find what I needed - if it's here, please direct me accordingly!<br />
<br />
Recently I changed the password on my Hotmail/Windows Live Account - how can I change this on my Windows Live Messaging Account on WM6?<br />
<br />
When I go to Windows Live under Messaging, the settings info only gives me message preview size and the option to send messages immediately, no account info.&nbsp; Thought about deleting and setting up a new account, but 'Delete' is not an option (grayed out).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't remember back to how I set this up in the first place!&nbsp; Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

            It's not possible to change the password on the device. You can only do that in Hotmail online. To manage Windows Live on your device, open Windows Live in Start - Programs and click Menu - Options.

<br />
So, I have changed my password online ... will this automatically reflect on my device to be able to check email?&nbsp; When I go to Messaging -&gt; Windows Live -&gt; then Menu -&gt; Send/Receive it finally comes back after 3-4 and says "Failed to synchronize the folder
 list.&nbsp; The server didn't respond."<br />
<br />
If it's not my recent password change - what would cause this, do you know?&nbsp; It just goes to 'Syncronizing folder list" status finally comes back with the error.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, you mentioned managing Windows Live on device - is this the method for WM6 on the Smartphone?&nbsp; I don't have Windows Live under the start menu - also don't have programs, but I do have applications which doesn't include anything related to Wiindows Live.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            I have a Moto Q Global from ATT and there is no Windows Live Icon in Start Menu. &nbsp;It only becomes&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;by setting up a new email account (in the messaging area) with a msn or hotmail @. &nbsp;Then you can access it from the Home Screen. &nbsp;If I may jump
 around a little, I have had difficulties with my Live Mail syncing after restarting the phone. &nbsp;After a restart, I have to delete the account and add it all over. (using "change account" in the Live Mail menu. &nbsp;I have seen a few posts complaining about this.
 &nbsp;I have tried a hard reset to no avail. &nbsp;I am currently stuck having to "change account" after each restart. &nbsp;Any thoughts.

No, I don't have a Windows Live incon in the start menu.&nbsp; I don't really remember back, but I think I just set it up as a new messaging account.<br />
<br />
Now that it's set up though, there are no options to modify account (other than message preview size and whether to send messages immediately) and the option to delete account is grayed out.&nbsp; So, I am kinda stuck with what I have unless I end up doing some
 kind of reset.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

            You know, I don't recall the options at the time.&nbsp; I set it up about 2 months ago but I don't have anything on my home screen, so that must answer that question!<br />
<br />
It worked just great until I would select send/receive and it would download messages/headers.&nbsp; Now it sits for several minutes with synchronizing folder list before I finally get an error.&nbsp; I changed my password around that time, but if I change it back to
 the old (by going online) it still sits at the same point before getting the error.<br />
<br />
It just doesn't appear to have an options available to change, modify, or delete aside from the reset options.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as syncing, it doesn't sync with Windows Live any longer - if you are talking about with the mobile device center, so issues there.<br />

            You can change your home screen to include windows live. Start/Systems Tools/Settings/Home Screen/Home Screen Layout/Windows Live.&nbsp; Then from the home screen you should be able to get into windows live settings.

I have ownded my E66 for the last two months, and apart from it being a gr8 phone all in all (sleek, cool, feature-rich) but I cant help being disappointed by the software packages for the E66.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine recently got an E71 and I noticed that his copy of QuickOffice enabled editing and saving of files while mine didnt!!<br />
<br />
Now why would that be the case as I chose to buy an E-Series Business Phone, and paid almost same premium for the E66 (as they both retailed for the same price), so by choosing the smaller phone, I subsequently dictated that I wouldnt get the editing-able QuickOffice
 suite? why is that?<br />
<br />
I also read somewhere that the Nokia viNe service could also be available for the E71 but not the E66?!?!?<br />
<br />
Awaiting your feedback<br />
<br />

<p>quickoffice is an amazing application...the app which comes preinstalled with nokia e66 is just a viewer but it can be updated...i had bought a nokia e66 and was tryin hard to find a fully functional quickoofice and finally found the way out...GO TO
WWW.QUICKOFFICE.COM....u need to register urself first on quickoffice.com..INSTALL THE QUICKOFFICE LICENSE MANAGER PROGRAM AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE FOR UR NOKIA E66...THEN RESTART
 UR PHONE...DOWNLOAD THE TRIAL VERSION OF QUICK OFFICE PREMIER 6 ON THE WEBSITE OVER UR COMPUTER....INSTALL IT USING A DATA CABLE OR BLUETOOTH....THEN RESTART THE PHONE...e66 comes with a predefined IMSI number for quick office which it automatically feeds
 into the trial application and makes it fully functional...be sure to register the app when u use it for the first time by giving a valid email id which u had given over the website during the initial online registration on quickoffice.com....MY QUICKOOFICE
 PREMIER VERSION 6 IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL...hope this solves ur query...wish u gud luck...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Quickoffice is discontinued. You can still use the version that comes with the phone, but cannot upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Nextbook Ares 8 tablet touch screen problems</h2>
                    I have my nextbook for nearly 2 years and it has been in great condition until now. I dropped my nextbook on the road while heading to my friend's house. The screen was covered in cracks, but when I turned it on it worked perfectly then I tried unlocking
 it but it didn't respond. I tried many ways to fix it, such as restarting the tablet, but nothing worked. Would there be a chance of me fixing it without using much cash?&nbsp;

<h2>            After upgrade to Visio 2016, many options are greyed out</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded an end user from Visio 2010 Standard to Visio 2016 Standard. Now the ability to set the default lines options on all lines is greyed out and he has to select each line individually. Which was not the case with Visio 2010. &nbsp;Please see
 the attached image below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bf1ebd6-bd64-4a22-8457-a436b5e92f82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bf1ebd6-bd64-4a22-8457-a436b5e92f82" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a repair on the install, which did not fix the issue. Checked the installation that every option to Visio was installed to the hard drive. Also I have uninstalled and reinstalled with no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help to fix this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Why you set line options for each shape individually ? Just set all shapes which you need change line options and change these options one time ?</p>

    <title>Using doughnut charts in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> becky sw.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using doughnut charts in Excel</h2>
                    I'm trying to create a personal monthly budget based on <a href="https://templates.office.com/en-gb/Personal-Budget-TM10000089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this Excel template</a> supplied on the Microsoft website. However, whenever I create a copy of the worksheet and edit it, the doughnut chart stops working. Clicking on 'Select data' reveals a chart data range of ='Chart Data'!$B$4:$B$5 but I have no idea where
 this is coming from nor how I should edit it to work correctly on a new sheet! Can anyone help?

<p>You (MS) need to increase the maximum number of members to a group. </p>

            <p>Hi SRIMANNARAYANAK J V,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; understand that your device is overheating when you do a basic task ?</p>
<p>Did you try to soft reset your phone ? </p>
<p>To do a proper soft reset, press and hold VOLUME DOWN + POWER buttons for 10-15 seconds until the phone vibrates and turns off by itself /!\ Do not Slide down to power off /!\
<br />
After the phone reboots, make sure that your date and time settings are correct. Also, if those settings are in automatic configuration, set them to manual</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your issue persists, then try to perform a hard reset, but don't forget to do a back up first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back up:</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>If your issue persists after the hard reset, contact a nokia care center:</p>
