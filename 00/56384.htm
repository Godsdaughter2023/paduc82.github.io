            <p>Hi there, Dagemaster786,<br /><br />Have you checked to see if there is any dirt or debris that may be affecting the left&nbsp;stick of the controller? Does this issue seem to occur&nbsp;across various games and apps, or does it seem to occur with one particular game or app?&nbsp;Also, we'd recommend checking to see if there are any available updates for the controller.

<h2>            Windows 7 64-bit Install Asking For Hard Disk Driver</h2>
                    I am in the process of installing Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit on a system that had Windows XP Home 32-bit. It has gotten to the part where it is asking for the drive to install it on and is saying that it cannot find a driver for the hard disk. The hard
 drive is recognised ok in the BIOS and it is listing the drive ok. Why does it need another driver for my system hard drive?<br />

<h3> icurehangovers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Ideapad Y500 - Installing Windows 8 to SSD &#40;Upgrade&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, tomorrow afternoon I should be getting an mSATA 120GB SSD from Amazon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop already has a 1TB HDD installed and I would like to use this for most applications and storage, etc. However, my main goal is to move my OS over to the SSD for faster load up and all that jazz.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue stems from this. I would like to know if anyone could recommend a good method to do this. I found (through a bunch of searches) that there is no consensus anywhere on the best way to do this. Some say just clone it. Others say that to avoid issues,
 do a fresh install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation is this: Windows 8 x64 came pre-installed with a recovery partition. I used the recovery media creator on windows 8 to create a recovery media onto an external drive I own. My computer did not come with recovery discs. I also do not have a disc
 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to do a fresh install of Windows 8, I would need a copy of either OEM or Retail Windows 8, of which I do not have a copy of. Does anyone know if there is a free version that Microsoft might have made available to people in my situation? Obviously, my
 Windows 8 key is embedded into the motherboard. There is no tangible key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the recovery media I made, besides tutorials on how to make it, I cannot confirm whether anyone has used this to successfully replace a HDD. Can anyone confirm whether this method can work in my situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of these are an option, I can always just clone the HDD. This would be my most preferred method but I have no idea what software to use. Can anyone recommend good software (free is better lol) to clone my HDD to the SSD? My laptop came with an mSATA
 slot with a 16GB mSATA SSD. I am replacing that with the 120GB one. Which means both drives will be installed at the same time so cloning will be simple... I suppose.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who can help, I would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

</p><p>I am trying to basically clone my HDD to the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have another issue though. While trying to shrink the partition for the OS, I got stuck. The OS is holding on to almost half a TB (460GB to be exact). It will not allow me to shrink it any further even though the OS partition is only using 85GB of
 those 460GB. My SSD is only 120GB. What can I do about that? I got clonezilla to work but it will not let me clone my drive since the HDD's partition is too big for the destination drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is a way to get a .iso file of Windows 8 to do a clean install. Again, there was a recovery partition but that's not an option since I'm not doing a restore or recovery to the same drive. I need to install windows 8 to the new
 drive and have it read the key that is embedded to the Bios on my laptop. </p>

            Alright. It did not work. It helped me lower the partition size by half of what it originally was. However, I still need it lower than that. I am now going to just have to pay to have Windows 8 installed. This could all have been avoided if manufacturers and Microsoft were still giving physical copies with their products. This all digital **** is great... until it isn't. Thanks for trying but after spending my entire sunday afternoon trying to get chkdsk to lower it further and getting nowhere, I am done. Thanks Babu for trying. I just wish there was a legal way for me to get a copy of windows 8 to just install the damn thing. Thanks for nothing Microsoft. Now I have to pay $140 to TigerDirect so they can install it. It's not as bad as the $220 that best buy wants for the same procedure. All they are doing is installing Windows 8 to the new drive as a clean install. Sheesh.

<p>They can 'prove' how much work they've done - after all, removing 500 entries must be a good thing (ignore the fact that Windows becomes non-genuine, Updates won't work, and if you're really unlucky,Windows won't boot at all!)</p>

            <p>I absolutely share your concern, especially those apparently leading to failures of system utilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it begs the question that one might ask which specific registers were damaged, such that this problem resulted?</p>
<p>The literature is rife with warnings that registry cleaners are generally bad and will eventually trash your system, etc., etc..&nbsp; I am inclined to agree, but I also must profess ignorance about either side of this issue.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Show me the facts:<span>&nbsp; </span>Are there explicit "smoking gun" research articles that clearly proved a particular, high-popularity registry cleaner did indeed flag *these specific registers* that were critical to Windows Update, or any other O/S function
 for that matter?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do these exist?<br />
<br />
Au contraire, if I were selling such application software, it would make sense to do thorough regression testing to identify the type of registers to stay away from; otherwise, I would be out of business soon.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If we can make jillions of virus definitions to do AV screening, then surely the characteristics of critical registers could also be screened.<br />
<br />
Comments?&nbsp; Suggestions?&nbsp; Links to smoking gun articles?</p>

            For every one story I hear about how great they are, I hear two where they don't work as advertised or worse: damage to the system. I don't trust them. They may have been decent in Win 9x days, but Windows has gotten a LOT better at maintaining the registry

            <p>I personally deal with at least one problem every week provably down to the use of Registry CLeaners - and since I only deal with WGA problems as a rule, that's an area where Registry Cleaners have no business making the sort of wholesale changes I see -
 deleting the WGA services from the registry.</p>
<p>At one point the number was higher - either new versions of the cleaners have finally come out fixing the issue, or people are beginning to learn the truth about them.</p>

            Noel, that is an excellent illustration that a problem exists, but it needs more specifics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you able to identify specific registers that were flagged by the Registry Cleaners whose removal clearly led to the problem with specific WGA services?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
A solid way prove the recklessness of using registry cleaners is to reproduce the problem, then make it go away by "undoing" the cleaner's deletion.[1]&nbsp; For example, back up the registers, then reproduce the problem by allowing the RC to selectively remove
 specific documented groups of RC-flagged registers.&nbsp; Next, show that restoring the same flagged registers makes the problem go away.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have now acquired irrefutable "smoking gun" facts.<br />
<br />
You could then publish these "smoking-gun" examples that demonstrate the damage of a specific RC's actions.&nbsp; In fact, you might have a great article that shows how several different RC's do this kind of damage.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this would be an excellent way to drive
 home the problem of registry cleaners.&nbsp; It would also turn the screws on the vendor to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Again, this would scientifically separate the facts from the hearsay warnings. <br />
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Roebear's excellent link (above) does this in an indirect way, but it needs to demonstrate Lolo's before-and-after damage by using it to show it clearly flagged and damaged these specific registers, which can be restored to make the problem go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Buttons on keyboard slowly starting to not work</h2>
                    So about two or three weeks ago, I was typing something and I noticed that my left shift key wasn't working, though my right one was. Though I was concerned, I didn't try to do anything and just used the right one. Last night, I was trying to turn the
 brightness down by using my laptop's brightness buttons, and of course, they weren't working. Now just a few minutes ago, I was typing in something in Notepad and my three button wasn't working, so I went and cleaned the keyboard. Afterwards, I went to use
 it, and none of them were working. Now, I looked it up earlier and I heard that you might need to actually find someone to replace your keyboard. I don't really want to do that, so is there anything I could try to do to fix the keys without replacing the keyboard?

            Hi,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />4: Turn off filter keys in Ease of Access
<br />Type ease in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Ease of Access &gt; Click Make the Keyboard easier to use &gt; Ensure Turn on filter Keys is not checked  
<br />

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Do you have access to a spare keyboard and check if it works? If so, you might have to replace your keyboard.

<h2>            Change size of Desktop Icon</h2>
                    I clicked something unknowingly on my WIN RT tablet (ASUS VIVO) while viewing the desktop screen. The Recycle Bin icon suddenly jumped to 1.5 inches square. This is a minor issue, but does anyone know how to change back to smaller size?

<h3> c. campisi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brand New Asus will not complete initial start up</h2>
                    <p>I have just bought a new Asus N552VW-FI061T and was running the initial set up. I changed the language to Italian and went ahead with the installation. I completed the step of connecting to wifi and I set up a new microsoft account, which is this one I'm
 posting from. I skipped the installation of the assistant Cortana. Everything was going smoothly until it said that there was an error and would need to restart. I saw the Asus page with the logo and then it moved into a holding 'just one moment' screen where
 it has been for 5 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to close it and re-open it and it remains stuck on this screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have much experience in setting up computers but even I know that this is unusual. I would appreciate any help you can give me, given that I really want to get started with my new laptop!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h3> palladium edge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game crash and sends me back to dashboard. Even corrupted my data once.</h2>
                    
<p>This has happened to me quite often (around 20 times if not more) while playing Dragon Age Inquisition. I got corrupt data because of this problem once and i'm finding it hard to invest hours upon hours if my save is just gonna get wiped. So far I have been
 lucky and the crash always happened shortly after an auto save and only once <em>
during the save (</em>when the data got corrupt<em>)</em>, but I don't really feel like taking a chance with losing my saves again so if there is a solution to this, it would be great to know. I tried a hard reboot (even unplug and everything) and tried clear
 the storage thingy but it just crashed again so it's not fixed... help?</p>

                    <p>Broken links in windows explorer - takes me to system32 folder rather than requested task (print, set up back up, etc).</p>
<p>This has been a problem since I got the laptop 6 months ago but not all links are broken so I have found ways around them. Was looking to set up a regular back up through Windows though and don't know a way around this. Thinking it is about time I sorted
 out the problem.</p>
<p>Running Windows 7 64 bit. Have run SFC but said there were no problems -&nbsp; not sure if this would have been a possible problem but thought it was worth a try!</p>
<p>Any other suggestions appreciated. Hoping to avoid having to completely reload my computer using factory discs.</p>

<br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>a. Go to <strong>Start</strong> Screen.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Select a Live tile</strong> that you want to turn off. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the
<strong>tile</strong>, it will show you some options at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>c. Select “<strong>Turn live tile Off</strong>” option. Now Live tile will be turned off.
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the issue occur with all the app tiles?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you are able to open the app but unable to view the live pictures even after turning on the ‘Live Tiles’ option, then I would suggest you to check the app size. The ‘Live tiles’ option is applicable only for medium,
 wide and large sized tiles. If the app size is set to ‘Small’, then it will just display the heart symbol on the orange background. To resize the app, right click on the app in the start screen and then click on the ‘Resize’ button the app bar.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>If the above steps didn’t help, then I would suggest you to try the steps suggested in this article and check if it helps.</font></font></font></span></p>

<h2>            I need to know how to delete a program without having the password.</h2>
                    A new antivirus program strongly recommended that I delete a program called Trend Micro Office. To delete it I need a password which I do not have. I even paid for a password recovery program which doesn't work. I don't know how Trend... got on my computer.
 I am the only user and I did not order it or download it. How can I get rid of it? Thanks for any help.

            <span>Hi Benjamin,<br />
<br />
Your PC might have come with a recovery image that’s used to refresh or reset your PC. The recovery image is stored on a dedicated recovery partition on your PC, and is typically 3-6 GB in size. To save space on your PC, you can delete the recovery image from
 your PC and use a recovery drive instead. <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> includes a built-in tool to create a USB recovery drive. Windows will let you know how big the recovery partition is, and you'll need a USB flash drive at least that big. If you still want
 to create a recovery drive on your internal hard drive, then I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link.
<br />
<br />
Create a USB recovery drive<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When you create a recovery USB from the above link, instead of USB you can select the drive you want to create.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Post us the results once you try the above steps.</span>

    <title>Non-existent primary alias - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mag1an  say:</h3>
<h2>            Non-existent primary alias</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I would like to change my primary alias, as it is not an email address that exists. &nbsp;However, in order to change my primary alias, or add new aliases which I can switch my primary alias to, I must first "verify" my primary alias. &nbsp;Doing this claims to
 send additional verification steps to the email address that's pointed to by the alias which... doesn't exist! &nbsp;Hence my reason for trying to get rid of it. &nbsp;There does not appear to be an alternative verification option or really anything else that I can
 do. &nbsp;Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            windows.edb keeps growing to huge file size.</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 10 ver 1511. The windows.edb file keeps growing. There is almost nothing installed and only 21,300 files to index, but every day it gets a little bigger. Currently 12gigs. Rebuilding seems to work, but again as the days pass, it just gets
 bigger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The size is in the half gig range after a rebuild and it completes its indexing. But each day it grows more, I assume when the indexer updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried the troubleshooter with no luck. I tried again as you described, and again no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this windows install is on an Intel NUC PC with just a single MSATA drive and a single C: partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was however able to mount a 3 Gig RAM Drive. I have successfully moved the index location to the new RAM drive (E:\windows) and I am going to let it run for a while. It will be at least a couple of days before I know if it is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will respond again once I know its status either way.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After the first index process it was around 350MB which is good, but a few hours later it was 500MB and then later 750MB. By Sunday evening it was 2.1GB. Again it is still only indexing 21,300 files, so why it keeps growing I don't know.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the long delay, but I have figured out the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-purposed the old NUC and performed a windows 10 reset. After which the indexing problem is no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new NUC which replaced the old, exhibited the same issue after being set up. This led me to the obvious conclusion that the indexing issue was being caused by one of the few apps that are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I discovered was....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small old program which traps the network traffic information and logs this data to a daily log file. It is only one file a day but it has tens of thousands of entries each day and windows indexing was trying to index the contents of these files.
 Apparently this is too much for the indexing process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now added an exclusion to the indexer to ignore the folder containing my logs. Now my .edb file is less than 200MB and stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for your assistance, time and patience on this matter.</p>

</p><p>In Win 10 mine also grows pretty quick to about 30Gb then seems to stop, but then seems to grow uncontrollably (I've seen it at 180Gb) until I kill it or it corrupts and starts reindexing again.&nbsp; And so the cycle goes . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even for my 750k items
 (all up) mine should be no more than say 15Gb.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if that was the case I'd be wrapped - but its not.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I'm now using&nbsp;a free search tool called Everything (not a Windows Search replacement because it only searches file/folder names and not content), and I've been playing&nbsp;around trying to see if its a log file issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can see is OneDrive Business that creates a crazy huge amount of logfiles, and obviously it's modifying the file metadata of exactly the same files Windows Search is indexing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wonder if there is a compatibility issue between Windows
 Search and OneDrive.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you could see the content of whats actually being indexed - is there a viewer, because I know it's an available API.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise log files is also where I'm at too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any thoughts.?</p>

<p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;After I realized the problem had to be associated with a program that I had installed and nothing to do with windows, it was easy to realize which one. I had only installed a couple of programs at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The program I was using records all of my network traffic in and out of my internet router. These are very detailed log files. Again there is only 1 new file created each day but because it adds thousands of lines of data, the windows indexer was going
 crazy trying to keep up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>original title:Funny phone call</p>
<p>I live in PA and got a phone call from someone who didn't speak English as a first language telling me I had malware and virus' on my computer and that he was a tech from Microsoft.&nbsp; He asked if my computer was on...I said no...he told me to turn it on and
 he would fix it.&nbsp; sounded funny to me so&nbsp;I asked which computer...he said mine...I said which one...he again said mine...I again said which one...that made me very wary.&nbsp; I have 6 computers in my house...if he was from Microsoft and there actually was a problem,
 he could have told me which one...I hung up.&nbsp; Fortunately for me, I have been working on computers since 1982 and I do not have online banking for that very reason and since he couldn't tell me which one (an error code would have given him my exact computer)
 and which operating system it used.</p>

<p>Cybercriminals often include the names of well-known companies, like ours, in their scams. They think it will convince you to give them money or your personal information. While they usually use e-mail to trick you, they sometimes use the telephone, instead.</p>
Common scams that use the Microsoft name
<ul>
<li>"You have won the Microsoft Lottery" </li><li>Microsoft "requires credit card information to validate your copy of Windows"</li><li>Microsoft sends unsolicited e-mail messages with attached security updates </li><li>Someone from "Microsoft Tech Support" calls to fix your computer </li></ul>
Avoid these dangerous hoaxes
<p>We do not send unsolicited e-mail or make unsolicited phone calls to request personal or financial information or fix your computer.</p>
<p>If you receive an unsolicited e-mail message or phone call that purports to be from Microsoft and requests that you send personal information or click links,<strong>delete the e-mail or hang up the phone</strong> .</p>
You have not won the "Microsoft Lottery"
<p>Microsoft customers are often targets of a scam that uses e-mail messages to falsely promise money. Victims receive messages claiming: "You have won The Microsoft Lottery!"<strong>There is no Microsoft Lottery. Delete the message.</strong></p>
<p>If you have lost money to this scam, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/protect/lottery/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
report it</a> . You can also send the police report to Microsoft and we will use it to help law enforcement catch the criminals who send out these e-mails.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/protect/lottery/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Report Microsoft lottery fraud</a> . To help protect yourself from these e-mail hoaxes, you can use the same general guidance that you use to protect yourself from phishing scams to help protect yourself from these e-mail hoaxes.</p>
Microsoft does not request credit card information to validate your copy of Windows
<p>We require that your copy of Windows is legitimate before you can obtain programs from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Download Center</a> and to receive software updates from&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=3646728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Update</a> . Our online process that performs that validation is called the Genuine Advantage Program.<strong>At no time during the validation process do we request your credit card information.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, we do not collect information that can be used to identify you such as your name, e-mail address, or other personal details.</p>
<p>To learn more, read the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=68985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Genuine Advantage Privacy Policy</a> . To learn more about the program in general, see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/downloads/whyvalidate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">About Genuine Microsoft Software</a> .</p>
Microsoft does not send unsolicited communication about security updates
<p>When we release information about a security software update or a security incident, we send e-mail messages only to subscribers of our security communications program.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, cybercriminals have exploited this program. They have sent fake security communications that appear to be from Microsoft. Some messages lure recipients to Web sites to download&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/spyware/whatis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">spyware</a>
 or other malware. Others include a file attachment that contains a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/antivirus/whatis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">virus</a> .<strong>Delete the message. Do not open the attachment.</strong></p>
Legitimate security communications from Microsoft
<ul>
<li><strong>Legitimate communications do not include software updates as attachments.</strong> We never attach software updates to our security communications. Rather, we refer customers to our Web site for complete information about the software update or
 security incident. </li><li><strong>Legitimate communications are also on our Web sites.</strong> If we provide any information about a security update, you can also find that information on our Web sites.</li></ul>
<br />
===========================================================
Microsoft does not make unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer
<p>In this scam cybercriminals call you and claim to be from Microsoft Tech Support. They offer to help solve your computer problems. Once the crooks have gained your trust, they attempt to steal from you and damage your computer with malware including viruses
 and spyware.</p>
<p>Although law enforcement can trace phone numbers, perpetrators often use pay phones, disposable cellular phones, or stolen cellular phone numbers. It's better to avoid being conned rather than try to repair damage afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Treat all unsolicited phone calls with skepticism. Do not provide any personal information.</strong></p>

<h2>            My photo is not centered in the circle</h2>
                    I uploaded my photo. I'm trying to reposition the photo in the circle but it won't let me. It wants to upload another picture. Is there a trick to this?
