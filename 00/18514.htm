            Turn on your Ruler (View &gt; Ruler) and then indent the selected text you want from there.
<div>Or select the text and choose Format &gt; Paragraph and from the dialog you can set it from there.</div>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business - Sync to Sharepoint causes slow file open&#47;save&#47;close</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Microsoft -&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a power user, just started using OneDrive for Business as my work fllestorage/backup solution. &nbsp;two issues:</p>
<p>--when i open, close, or save files, it seems to take much longer. &nbsp;i'm assuming this is because of the inherent Sharepoint reliance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>--when i'm offline, i've experienced some problems in opening up LOCAL FILES (that are synced) - won't open, or takes forever. &nbsp;</p>
<p>--even when online, the "saving to sharepoint" comes up - i thought it would save locally first, quit, and THEN sync</p>
<p>--Dropbox seems to do this - save locally, then sync later. &nbsp;I find Dropbox to be seamless and better to use so far</p>
<p>--My OneDrive sync client keeps telling my "syncing 12 files" even though i have all green checks on the top level folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>--I copied my local files to OneDrive in 4 batches</p>
<p>--seems like after each batch, the fixed "syncing" went up by three (3 files after first batch, 6 after second copy /sync complete, etc.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>--Should I worry about this or ignore? &nbsp;seems to be a non-problem other than annoying</p>

<p>thanks for your help!</p>
<p>doug</p>

<p>hi doug,</p>
<p>to answer your questions:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">major point 1</span>:</strong><br />
1. considering read-only mode issue, since you mentioned the top yellow bar and bottom right corner appear in office client, can you check if the behavior is the same as the images below?<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76b169fb-587e-4707-b06c-b9c48116fa67" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76b169fb-587e-4707-b06c-b9c48116fa67" /></a>&nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01ec76e2-b001-40db-a1e2-7487012aaa6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01ec76e2-b001-40db-a1e2-7487012aaa6c" /></a><br />
if it is, office should work as designed. if not, please upload the screenshots include
<strong>top yellow bar</strong> and <strong>read-only notice</strong>.</p>
<p>2. for the “take forever” issue, as spike’s rely, onedrive for business syncs the files from cloud to local. when it is done, the synced files in local folders are regarded as local files and are opened directly from local. it is the normal behavior.<br />
if it “takes forever” for you, we’d like to know if onedrive for business works correctly. if possible, would you please take two sample word file copies as a test in both your local onedrive for business folder and other local folder (e.g. c:\test\), and check
 if it has large difference in speed when opening these two files offline?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">major point 2</span>:</strong><br />
1. if there is no orange exclamation marks on the sync client, it means that the client works correctly and the client does not find any issue. so no “view sync problems”/”repair” button will be shown.</p>
<p>2. as you want to sync over 20,000 files, the onedrive for business sync client is not feasible to do that. considering your situation, the best practice i recommend is that separate all the files into two divisions:
<strong>division a</strong> is that you want to access them offline or use frequently, while
<strong>division&nbsp;b</strong> is that you don’t need them that often or need them when you are online. you can then put files belonging to division a in several folders and sync those folders. for division&nbsp;b, you can either access online or use map network drive
 to map the onedrive for business library to manage them.</p>
<p>the benefits of this workaround is that, when every time you go back to online, onedrive for business do not need to take long time to go through all the 20,000 files and check if they are modified, and also the size of local cache/files will be smaller
 .</p>
<p>if you would like to sync all those 28.000 files, you may use both <strong>onedrive for business</strong> and
<strong>sharepoint online libraries</strong> (up to 5,000 files per library)/<strong>onedrive</strong> (if there is no sharepoint license) to accomplish the task.</p>
<p>3. for the top yellow bar and bottom right corner in office offline mode, if it is the same as images shown, it is a by-design behavior.</p>
<p>besides, here is another thread with similar concern about onedrive for business sync client for your reference:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/352092</p>

    <title>Hyperlink Edit in Word for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcsilverfox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlink Edit in Word for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I create a hyperlink (to a 'local' doc) in a Word for Mac 2011 document and save file as Web Page. I close it then open the page in browser and click on hyperlink. It works.</p>
<p>Then I reopen the Word file, add a new hyperlink and save. When I reopen html file in the browser and click on the first link, I get a 'can't find' message. It shows the pathname for the file it is looking for has a colon instead of the forward slash when
 designating the last folder of the pathname. On re-checking the Word file and hovering over the link, it shows that any spaces (normally shown in html as "%20") in the path replaced by "%2520". Consequently and naturally, with these changes, the required hyperlinked
 file can't be found when clicked in the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can a Word file with hyperlinks be edited without destroying the pathnames of previously saved and working hyperlinks (problem occurs in Firefox and Safari, so doesn't appear to be browser-related)?</p>

            <p>First, I can replicate this behaviour on Mavericks 10.9.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried with Chrome and Safari set as the default browser - it does not appear to make much difference. What I have not tried is a system with no browser other than Safari.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensuring that the "Update links on save" Web option is unchecked) makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seem to me to be two problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. each time you work with the HTML format file, and change/save/close/reopen, you get an extra "25"</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. initially, Word inserts what looks like a "relative pathname" such as</p>
<p>my%20folder/my%20file.docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it changes it to&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my%2520folder:my%2520file.docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it changes it to&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>file://localhost/my%252520folder:my%252520file.docx</p>
<p>As soon as it introduces the file://localhost, it can't really be interpreted as a relative hyperlink, but the path is now likely to be wrong (e.g. it should probably be</p>
<p>
</p><p>file://localhost/Users/myname/Documents/my%20folder:my%20file.docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>or some such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, I can only see two workarounds:<br />
&nbsp;a. you always work with a .docx, then save separately as a web page (in that case, Word seems to re-impose the full file:// path name in some circumstances) or</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. you insert the full pathname as a file:// path from the beginning, using %20 and other escapes as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Edit: incidentally, Mac Word seems even more aggressive than Windows Word when it comes to replacing the hyperlink address in the HYPERLINK field)</p>

            Sounds like you found a System Bug Pete if so you need to go to where ever Apple's Bug reporting is and File a Bug. If you go to Apple's Support Forms and then choose Mavericks and post your findings I'm sure someone will point you to correct URL to report
 the Bug.&nbsp; Though it may not Matter a new system is due in the Fall which I dread. More changes. More IOS-fication.

            <p><span>Peter ... thanks for your prompt reply to my problem. You have understood it perfectly and included pathnames that illustrate exactly what happens (I should have probably included those myself in my initial post, but evidently what I wrote must have
 been understandable!). I have tried your suggested approach of working from a docx version of the file, then Saving As a Web Page later, but still no success.</span></p>
<p><span>When I edit such a file by for example by adding a new hyperlink in a new place in the doc and then attempt to save first as a docx then as a Web Page, I get an error message: “A file error has occurred. Check your network connections or make sure
 the disk is properly inserted and not defective”. There are no such connections or disks associated with the file (even with a test file that I set up). When I then close Word and go to open the test html file in a browser, it opens, the new hyperlink works,
 one of the previous ones works, but the other previous one shows the pesky colon again! Hence it doesn’t understand the link and doesn’t open!</span></p>
<p><span>I also have an older laptop running Leopard 10.5.8 (!) with Word for Mac 2008. When I write and save a test file as a Web Page there, it seems to work ok, even when I edit/save/close Word/open browser.</span></p>
<p><span>But when I transfer my ‘real’ files &amp; folders via a USB stick to the old and attempt to edit a hyperlink then Save, I get the same ‘file error’ message.</span></p>
<p><span>Seems to be a problem emanating from Word for Mac 2011. When I first started this rather long family history file on the old laptop using Word 2008, I had no problems with editing, changing etc the hyperlinks. The problem has only developed when I
 have updated everything to Word 2011. Must be a bug there somewhere which I can’t seem to work around.</span></p>
<p><span>The other thing that happens whenever I open the htm file in Word 2011 is that any text surrounded by a border is given a second border, then a third one if I close and reopen again!</span> Not quite such a problem as the hyperlinks as I just copy
 the text within the first border, paste in lower in the doc then delete the double border text. A nuisance but at least able to be worked around.</p>
<p><span>Guess I’ll just keep the current family history file and accept that I can’t make further changes.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again for you prompt attention to my request.</span></p>

            <p>I think the "Stick with .docx" idea would work if I was planning to start a new file. I would always write and save it in .docx first, then do Save As Web Page. If I later wanted to add or edit, I should do it in the docx file and save it in that format
 first, effectively keeping it as the master file, then again Save As Web Page to replace the old htm file. In other words, I shouldn't open the htm file in Word and expect to be able to edit it then re-save it in that format. Working directly in the htm file
 and saving it 'as is' (either as a docx file or as a web page) seems to be where the problems come in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This still shouldn't happen, even when done that way, if Word actually allows an htm file to be opened and edited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note to self for future ... use docx as the Master and do any later editing directly in there. Presumably then the links etc wouldn't be "internally tinkered with".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add further to the list of glitches (even in the older Word 2008) ... when a file contains a picture (e.g. jpg) which has been inserted amongst the text then Saved as a Web Page, it appears ok later in a browser. But then if further editing is done,
 the picture may or may not still appear in the htm opened in Word! If it doesn't appear (and this only seems to be a random thing) then the (empty) space where the pic was is still there, and clicking in the area shows a black frame where the picture should
 be. So I have to delete the empty frame and again do Insert/Photo/Picture from File where the original one was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think I should have just taken a deep breath 'way back' and bought a dedicated web writing program in the first place!</p>
<p>Thanks again Peter for your efforts!</p>

            <p>I originally did some tests on Snow Leopard that suggested that the problem might not exist there. But I was using an old Dutch language version of Mac Office there. So I wondered whether the problem was new in Mavericks, or only affected some language versions,
 or was somehow linked to the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, experiments since then suggest that</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. It's just Word 2011</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. I'd probably done something wrong during my original experiment on Snow Leopard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary,</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. the problem appears with a clean install of Mavericks, brought up-to-date, and a fresh install of Office for Mac 2011,brought up-to-date</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. the problem also occurs on Snow Leopard with every Dutch and English language version of Office for Mac I tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note to self for future ... use docx as the Master and do any later editing directly in there.
</span></p>
<p>This is what I meant in my suggestion. But...</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&gt;&gt;Presumably then the links etc wouldn't be "internally tinkered with".</span></p>
<p>...Mac Word aggresively modifies the text in the HYPERLINK field. FOr example, if I have a link like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ HYPERLINK "<span>file://localhost/Users/myname/Documents/myfolder/my file.docx</span>" }</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
and I delete&nbsp;</span><span>file://localhost/Users/myname/</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>when I click outside the field, Word re-inserts the text that I just removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
But it does seem that when working in a .docx, Word inserts a link text that will be correctly transformed when you save as a "Web Page". Precisely what your browser will try to do when you open that Page and click on the link is another matter - it will depend
 on the browser, what is set up for the specific file type (.docx, say) for that browser, and possibly what plugins you have. For example, if I generate the .htm from the above, open it in Safari, and click on the link, a new Windows opens in Finder showing
 the contents of the "myfolder" folder. If I do the same in Chrome, Chrome "downloads" the .docx</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I believe that this is an error in Word - although I couldn't find a report of this particular hyperlink problem, it seems unlikely that it has been unreported since Word 2011 was first released.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>The problem, of course, with not allowing "relative links" is that when you move your files around, the links point to the wrong place, a problem that anyone trying to provide Word documents
 linked to external files tends to encounter sooner or later.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
I take your word for it as far as 2008 is concerned, but at some point I'll have a look back there too, as I'd like to see whether relative links were better handled.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:<br />
As a final point, most of the time I've been looking at what is visible in the HYPERLINK field. However, when dealing with hyperlinks in Word it's sometimes necessary to pay attention to the "display text" and the tiptext as well.</p>

            <p>Hi Phillip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to check a bit further and as you can see from my later message, I don't think it's actually Mavericks (or OSX) that's doing this, unless Word is relying on an OSX service of some kind to generate the link.</p>

            <p>Again, thanks for your continued efforts and investigations. It will be time consuming to redo all my family history files into docx format so I might leave it as it stands for the present - there are only a couple of very minor links which I wanted to edit.
 I'll know which way to deal with things if I begin another project - "docx is the ongoing Master"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding various OSXs: I recall having the same or similar problems with Snow Leopard (Word 2011) but they didn't deem quite as intractable as now, although they weren't easy fixes either. But changing from SL to Mavericks and to Word 2011 may have made
 it more difficult to identify the source of the problem for me (although I did have Word 2011 for a while with SL and experienced some problems). I think at one point I might have gone through and changed all the links in 'one go' and they worked when viewed
 in the browser. I can't remember if I changed the links individually in the htm view in Word or whether I chose html view in Word and did a Find/Replace All there for" %252520" to "%20", etc. I certainly remember doing the latter but it was some time ago and
 I don't recall now what process was successful at the time! In summary, maybe at least the problem has become "more aggressive", as you say, within either Mavericks, Word 2011 or both in combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly when I try the Find/Replace All idea now in HTML Source view, and then attempt to Exit HTML Source back to the htm format, I get the message indicating File Error (check network or disk etc). Alternatively, if I tried to save the HTML Source view
 first, it did that but just saved it literally as the text shown on screen and retained it as pure/plain text when I closed HTML view and/or closed then re-opened Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only mention these extra things to indicate what other activities I have undertaken and I don't expect that you should carry out further investigations on them as well! Nevertheless a solution to my original problem would be nice, although I get the impression
 that it is a deep structural issue within Word and hence not resolvable.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seems to be originating from Word 2011. All the problems re-appeared in Word for Mac 2011 running on OS X 10.6.8 on two different Mac Pro machines. One Mac substituted slashes (/) in the hyperlinks, while the other substituted colons (:). The
 remaining description of the problems is identical here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we prompt Microsolft to fix it ASAP? Frustrating.</p>

                    Please, can someone get off their b#@ and respond to everyone having Bluetooth issues with the Lumina 920 " Almost Great" phone. I am on my second one in 12 days. Both had Bluetooth connect issues with various devices , even Nokia's Advanced Car Kit. Pairing
 issues with 2011 Porsche PCM system, connection loss after 1-2 minutes on Jawbone speaker, Motorola Car Kit and Nokia's latest Advanced Car Kit. Two new phones in a row. This has got to be a Microsoft issue? I love the phone, but I have got to have Bluetooth.
 I guess I will return to AT&amp;T to swap for a third one. Maybe AT&amp;T will put pressure on Nokia/Microsoft to fix this. Latest firmware and multiple resets with multiple reboots.

            <p>Same here... My Nokia Lumia 920 will connect flawlessly and stay connected right after a reboot of the phone. Often, however, the Bluetooth will connect and then disconnect after 10 seconds. Once&nbsp; I reboot the phone, it will automatically connect and stay
 connected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, I have not been able to play music via the Porsche PCM system like I was able to with my Windows Phone 7.5. Other phone sounds like incoming text messages and other voice commands do play via the PCM system.</p>

<p>2. Nokia Lumia 920</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; My Nokia Lumia 920 will connect flawlessly and stay connected right after a reboot of the phone. Often, however, the Bluetooth will connect and then disconnect after 10 seconds. Once&nbsp; I reboot the phone, it will automatically connect and stay connected.
 Successful connection happens 100% after a reboot. The undesired behavior (disconnect after 10 seconds) happens about 90-95% if I have not rebooted my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4a. OS Version: 8.0.10211.204</p>
<p>4b. 1232.5957.1308.0001</p>
<p>4c. 1.0.202093.3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. I did not have this issue with the OS that was delivered with the handset. It started a few months ago. I do not remember if this coincided with a specific update.
</p>
<p>6. This is my third Nokia 920 handset and all of them had this exact same issue. As a result, I believe it to be software not hardware. This issue does not happen with my Bose Bluetooth headset. This issue does not happen with my Samsung 7.5 Windows Phone
 in the same car or with my wife's iPhone 4S in the same car. Thus I believe it to be specific to my Windows 8 handset.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the same problem, both with my HTC 8X and my Nokia Lumia 920.&nbsp; The 8X worked for months, before an update about 3 months ago, then it stopped and exhibited the same errors as described above.&nbsp;

<p>Hope we can sort this out, as my iPhone works great so am currently forwarding incoming calls from Nokia to iPhone when I'm in the car purely to receive calls whilst driving - cumbersome and not a great advert to friends/wife who I'm trying to convert to

            <p>I have the below issues on a 2012 Lexus IS 250</p>
<p>Currently with AT&amp;T Nokia Lumia 920</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When is Nokia going to roll out a FIM update to repair all the Bluetooth issues with my cars audio system? This is very frustrating and I've already had the car at the dealership in an effort to resolve. I have a 2012 Lexus IS250 and according to them the
 product is not supported or tested.</p>
<p><br />
Issue: Between songs the system hangs, the song on the car system will count to about 04 then start over at 0 while the phone freezes at 00. This remains in a loop and nothing plays. You have to keep forwarding until it unlocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS version 8.0.10211.204</p>
<p>FIM 1232.5962.1314.0001</p>
<p>Radio 1.0.20209MT.3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other phones paired to the car seem to work including my Windows 7 Samsung phone and an Iphone.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Detection:</p>
<p>Make sure that your audio system, GPS and make and model are compatible with the bluetooth from the phone. Some other connectivity issues are that the car kit cannot decode the Bluetooth device that it is trying to connect. This decode means that the system
 cannot recognize the name. This is a frequent problem when devices have been upgraded. While your system may have worked fine before, upgrades can cause problems because the compatibility all of a sudden changes. This is an issue that has not really been addressed
 by the manufacturers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Dropped Connection:</p>
<p>Another frequent problem that can occur is that the bluetooth will connect but then it will not stay connected. Many times this can be a hardware issue. For example in 2010 there seems to be a widespread problem with iPhone 4 and Bluetooth. This is actually
 been proven to be a problem with the iPhone and the company is trying to determine the problem. Some other issues to consider include the Bluetooth car kit as a wire or connection may be loose. If you lose connectivity over bumps or when turning that means
 that a wire may be bad or is loose.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Audio Does Not Work:</p>
<p>So the bluetooth device can connect but it does not work properly. In this case there is an issue with the stereo connection to the Bluetooth unit. There is nothing actually wrong with the bluetooth or devices but this is a software issue. To fix it see
 if the manufacturer is offering any updates. If one person has had the issue then you can bet that many people will have the problem. This is a problem with the car kit software as no matter which phone or earpiece you use the audio will not play from the
 speakers. Check that the vehicle supports bluetooth audio as some only will support bluetooth phone calls. These are 2 very different things.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Settings:</p>
<p>Most of the time, look into the settings for the bluetooth and the car system. If the car battery should die then the system may reset to the defaults. This means that all of the current settings will be lost and need to be reset. Not only will you need
 to check the settings in the car system but also in your phone or other bluetooth device. In order to correct the bluetooth settings the device will need to be connected to the computer</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            Sadly... I just purchased a Nokia Lumia 1020 and the same issue occurs. What a bummer. The 920 and 1020 are such great phones. Too bad they cannot get the Bluetooth right!

<h3> rich lewis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turning off updates box that keeps coming up in Office 2010</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to disable the box that comes up asking you if you want to turn on the updates or make no changes?&nbsp; Because this is a school system students do not have certain rights.&nbsp; If you click "make no changes" and hit ok the box goes away.&nbsp; Restart
 the system and go back in and the box returns.&nbsp; We cannot have this box coming up every time someone logs in and goes to Office.&nbsp; Never an issue with Office 2003.&nbsp; There must be a setting that allows you to prevent this box from appearing each time you go
 into Office.&nbsp; I like what Office 2010 brings so I really don't want to downgrade back to Office 2003 or OpenOffice if I possibly help it.&nbsp; Is there a help line for education that doesn't charge for the first 90 days or so after a school district spends the
 money to upgrade all the systems to Office 2010?&nbsp; Hope someone can help.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

We can't see the screenshot as the link points to a file on your PC - you must put the file somewhere on the 'net for everyone else to see it.

            This post made me laugh. I think we're a few to understand french here. To answer your query, it is not possible to change the language on the device unless you manage to get a rom that was built with the language you are looking for. In french: Il faudra
 obtenir un rom en francais de ton revendeur. Ce n'est pas possible de changer de langue autrement.

<h2>            PC-Suite update breaks BlueTooth connectivity</h2>
                    
<p>A couple of days ago I went into PC-Suite and it said there was an update available and so I installed it.&nbsp; Now it doesn't recognise my BlueSoleil stack (registered v6.4.314.3, which is the latest build of a few days ago).&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'phone pairs up with the
 stack without any problem, but PC-Suite tells me that there is no BlueTooth connector available.&nbsp; I don't use it very often, but it has always worked before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows XP Pro 32 bit, SP3 Core 2 1.8, 2Gb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Uninstalled it and went back to 7.1 and now everything is hunky dory again.</p>

            Unplug bluetooth stack, uninstall PC Suite, Clean Windows Registry (CCleaner), Reboot, Download and install PC Suite Latest version, plug in Bluetooth stack, try to connect.<br />
<br />
IF STILL NOT WORKING try to uninstall Bluetooth driver, reboot, install driver, and try to connect.

    <title>Lumia 640XL randomly reboots by itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glasofruix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 640XL randomly reboots by itself</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a week ago i got a lumia 640XL for my sister who just looooves giant phones (don't know why, but well). The phone is quite nice but has one enormous giant flaw, it keeps rebooting at random. It reboots mid conversation, it reboots in a pocket, on a
 table, at night, when taking photos, redacting an sms/email whatever, it's unreliable as coitus.
</p>
<p>Now, i'm not a newb in the whole IT and telecommunication field so i've tried to fix the darn thing myself and i failed. I've tried pretty much everything (short of installing win 10 on it but since it's not finished), soft reset, hard reset, different sim
 cards, different sd cards, swapped stuff around, let it sit without battery for a couple of hours, reinstalled the firmware from scratch, tried to search for updates (no updates)etc... classic stuff (yes i turned it off and on again :D).
</p>
<p>A couple a days ago i've found microsoft's fix it solution that promised to fix the reboot problem, i fired it up on my PC plugged the phone in and let the magic happen and needless to say, the magic was a bust. After about 30 min it decided that "the repair
 process took too long so we stopped it" and now it says that the phone cannot be fixed, great.</p>
<p>So now we decided to return it to the online retailer since we're still within our 14 days grace period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i might return here if they decide to bugger us sideways and send a replacement 640xl or say that there's nothing wrong with it....)</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Installation Error Code 30180-4</h2>
                    <p>After several hours of frustration, I have decided to post directly to the community.&nbsp; My wife and I are taking over my son's HP since he recently had an upgrade to a gaming computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP is only about 1.5 yrs old had a Microsoft Office Trial version on it but was never utilized.&nbsp; We are now trying to install Office and we first tried using the current program's "Purchas" option.&nbsp; My wife put 4 good hours into it an even with a Microsoft
 tech on the phone couldn't get it done.&nbsp; I didn't have all the details but today I do as I have been at it for 4 hours myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to install, the <strong>Error Code 30180</strong>-4 is given with a "Sorry, we found a problem"...&nbsp; Took me awhile just to find out what that code is and I still am not sure exactly what it means, but I have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Uninstalled all previous versions of Office</li><li>Turned off Antivirus and Firewall</li><li>Restarted computer</li><li>Tried the "Microsoft FixIt Tool"</li></ul>
<p>So at this point, I'm out of options.&nbsp; I really can't believe that Microsoft would make a simple download of a software application this difficult especially with one of its biggest partners, HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any words of wisdom!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brothepro</p>

            <p>Hello Sushma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; However, my problem is not with "uninstalling" Office, I have already done that (please see my original question above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install the current version of Office 365 which I believe is the Office 365 2016.&nbsp; I am trying to install directly from the web, so I have no product keys etc... .&nbsp; The error I'm getting seems to want to tell me that it cannot download the
 files it needs to.&nbsp; The only thing that has been downloaded is the "setup.exe" file and I have deleted that as well to try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:&nbsp; Do I need to be logged in as Administrator to install these files?&nbsp; As I mentioned, this computer was originally purchased for my son, so his user profile is still on the computer as the "Administrator".&nbsp; However, we are trying to download this
 under my wife's profile.&nbsp; However, the download process does ask us to enter Admin password so I assume we don't need to be logged in as Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate additional advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>I am trying to install the current version of Office 365 which I believe is the Office 365 2016.&nbsp; I am trying to install directly from the web, so I have no product keys etc... .&nbsp; The error I'm getting seems to want to tell me that it cannot download the
 files it needs to.&nbsp; The only thing that has been downloaded is the "setup.exe" file and I have deleted that as well to try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:&nbsp; Do I need to be logged in as Administrator to install these files?&nbsp; As I mentioned, this computer was originally purchased for my son, so his user profile is still on the computer as the "Administrator".&nbsp; However, we are trying to download this
 under my wife's profile.&nbsp; However, the download process does ask us to enter Admin password so I assume we don't need to be logged in as Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate additional advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Dear Sushma, or any Microsoft Engineer or support tech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not received any additional responses or advice.&nbsp; I can only assume that you too are perplexed by the complexity of downloading a simple bit of software.&nbsp; I have already tried the advice you have provided, yet I continue to receive the same ERROR
 MESSAGE - <strong>Error Code 30180</strong>-4 is given with a "Sorry, we found a problem"...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid that if no one can help me download the software, then I will need to cancel my subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.&nbsp; Obviously, it doesn't make sense to pay for a software subscription when you can't even download the software to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Signed......completely baffled....</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender Scan Settings</h2>
                    <p>In Windows Security Essentials you could set the scans to run on start-up, etc. Windows Defender does not appear to have that option unless it has been hidden somewhere. Anyone know the fix as I always did a quick scan on start-up automatically.</p>

</p><p><span>The Windows Defender scheduled scan is now included in the Automatic Maintenance package of scheduled tasks. Unlike the MSE scheduled scan, the Automatic Maintenance engine utilizes the full-automation
 capabilities of Task Scheduler – so no user interaction is required. However, you do still have the option to set the run-time for Automatic Maintenance:
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/windows-10-how-do-i-set-windows-defenders-scan/f399bb87-37c9-4a74-bb35-1d7e3d3c2436"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/windows-10-how-do-i-set-windows-defenders-scan/f399bb87-37c9-4a74-bb35-1d7e3d3c2436</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you leave the Automatic Maintenance schedule at its default setting, and you power down your PC at the end of the day, as you should, Automatic Maintenance will automatically run a Windows Defender
 Quick Scan at startup. There’s no “fix”, or manipulation of the settings, required for that behavior. And that’s something that you actually can’t do with the MSE scan unless you resort to editing the registry or putting a batch file in your Startup folder.</span></p>

<h3> naois  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to cancel subscription&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am getting charged for a subscription to Office 365 Home - I have no transaction history in my account and I have spoken to the accounts &amp; billing department and they cannot see my history either. According to the accounts &amp; billing department this
 subscription was cancelled June 2013 yet I received an invoice in the post today (21.07.14). I want to cancel with immediate effect and I would like someone to explain how I have been charged for something that Microsoft has no records of.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have not been able to find contact details to query this anywhere on this site - the person I spoke to in accounts &amp; billing said that there are no email address for Microsoft customer support/help? The phone call I received
 was extremely unhelpful and frustrating as the person I spoke kept repeating that I was not being charged. I stated numerous times that I could see the charges on my bank statement and I was told that this was my banks fault. She then asked me to give her
 my credit card details which I find highly unusual and when I refused to do and asked if I could speak to a manager/lodge a complaint I was told that there was no way to do this and directed to this site.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am extremely unhappy with the service I have received and if anyone could help I would really appreciate it.&nbsp;</span><br />

            I have already done this, the conversation I spoke about above was after I followed the above steps. I could not get any help by following these steps and I am still being charged for a service that even your accounts and billing department can not find
 any transaction history for. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
