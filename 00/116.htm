<h2>            Using Excel on a 55&#34; monitor with a touch screen</h2>
                    <p>I would like to display a spreadsheet on a large 55" monitor that has a touch overlay that incorporates a stylus so my employees can come and update a table that we use daily. &nbsp;Would I need to have an external keyboard to do this so numbers could be entered
 into cells? &nbsp;Or is there a way to call up a virtual keyboard that you could use the stylus to touch the numbers after highlighting a cell?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<br />
Windows XP provides an on-screen keyboard that is acessed by going to Start | Run and entering "OSK" in the dialog.<br />

Don't know if this will work with your setup.&nbsp; Also, later Windows version may have been "improved" - so good luck.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>MS will never offer a user that option. There whole dubious business model relies on adware and spyware (which are by their very nature - MALWARE).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are options hidden away in the excuse for a control panel replacement, however, you can be assured that your data will continue to be sent ! - not only to MS but to many many third party websites and companies as well.</p>
<p>It has been proven that turning off ALL so called 'privacy' settings does little to stop the massive invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The absolute best way is to remove windows 10 completely from your system. &nbsp;Upgrade to Win 7 and NEVER use MS programs where possible - ALWAYS use a third party browser, - the MS browsers are one of the biggest data collectors around. ! - NEVER use windows
 defender - this is also a data collector with access to every single site and page you visit and everything you do on line. Even changing browser will have no effect if this 'malware' is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use blockers with your browser - such as 'adbock' plus and 'disconnect'. There is also a lot of information on the web for blocking most of the ms spyware sites in the host file and on a firewall. (NOT the MS firewall - use a third party or external one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often you have to chose the lesser of two evils. Google Chrome for instance is a FAR FAR better browser than ANY MS product. It also is a &nbsp;harvester of information ! - however, you at least get something back for using chrome - firstly - it is a superb browser,
 secondly - google products are worth the hassle imho .. Google maps is the best map platform on the planet - street view is unique - google search engine far far surpasses the bing thing. and the list goes on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can never block all the spyware &nbsp;(you can block MOST of the adware!) but at least you can get something in return using google.</p>
<p>With MS and win 10, you get absolutely nothing tangible. The touted features of win 10 such as 'cortana' 'spartan' 'the metro tile things' &nbsp;are absolutely useless in the real world. Win 10 has not even got a good user interface, it is an inflated interface
 for a 5" phone !. &nbsp;MS have even removed the start menu and replaced it with a franken menu 'start thing'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lack of uptake of win 10 will mean it will not be around a long time. MS will HAVE to replace it with an OS that people actually want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has only expanded the completely failed and rejected win 8.X model. Many people intimate that desktop PC sales are reducing rapidly - ! more focus on the 'mobile world' ... this is mostly rubbish. The largest reason by far that desktop sales have been
 reducing is the simple fact that people do NOT want to buy something with windows 8.x on it, the same applies to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 7 will be about when win 10 is dead and buried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I worship the ground it is coming to. !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIGGEST mistake - BY FAR ! - that MS has ever made.</p>

<h2>            OneNote and Outlook Integration</h2>
                    Do others agree that there should be tighter integration of OneNote and Outlook?&nbsp; The example I stumbled over this morning was when putting a "note" into Outlook.&nbsp; I really wanted to just link to OneNote, but I don't know how to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I ended up
 putting note-like info in two places--in OneNote (the master for all my note-like info) and in Outlook.&nbsp; The opposite happens too:&nbsp; I'll be putting in notes in OneNote, realize a lot of that info is contact-like info, and I wish there is some way to share
 that so the info is mastered one place but visible in both.&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The preinstalled version could be the same version which you are referring to as ‘free version enclosed with the tablet…'. As most new computers come with pre-installed free versions
 of Office from the manufacturer. Check if you have purchased a full version license for Office 365 or 2013.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, in order to confirm the version of Office currently installed on your computer and identify whether it is a preinstall free trial version or full version you may check in
 the following location on your computer:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the <strong>Windows logo key</strong> <strong>+ X</strong> to see a list of commands and options. (Basically a quick way to get to
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> in Control Panel.)</li><li>
Click <strong>Programs and Features</strong>. </li><li>
Check the version/edition of Office 365/2013 installed on your computer. <span>
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Let us know the result.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I see some incongruence between how advised on internet and on the box and I found that the seller replaced the windows 8.1 with bing with 8.1 pro for I don't know what reason... I reset the tablet and now I have windows 8.1 with bing, so i should have 1
 year of office 365 as written on the box (the tablet is brand new), but now windows don't activate and give me error 0xC004C003, product key locked... but the product key isn't linked directly with the tablet? why I can't activate my original version of windows?
 perhaps I don't know if the windows serial is correct because it isn't written anywhere on the box...</p>
<p>There is a solution for this problem? it's so difficult to have a working version of windows (that perhaps it's also free for the producer because the screen is 8 inches...)</p>

            <p>Thank You... now I'm able to activate windows with the original serial but I don't understand how to install and activate the free version of Office 365 tha comes with windows 8.1 for bing... on microsoft website they ask me for the office serial, that I
 don't have... I see that many other tablet that have windows 8.1 for bing don't have neither office pteinstalled or the office serial... so, hoe it works? on microsoft website this topic is not threated at all (windows 8.1 with bing and office)...</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

    <title>O365 licenses suddenly missing from random users - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            O365 licenses suddenly missing from random users</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company recently finished its O365 migration in February.&nbsp;We began this project in November. Since we started we have, seemingly at random, had users suddenly lose their O365 E1 license. I log into the O365 admin portal site, re-assign it, and they are
 good to go. Is there any reason for this to be happening? We cannot pinpoint what is causing it and it is a pain point for the IT team. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint losing images.  &#40;Image cut and paste disappears&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Version 15.36 (170702) PowerPoint on a MacBook Pro with a 365 account. &nbsp;I have created files over the last several months with images I pasted in from a "Grab" application image capture. &nbsp;The image was there for several days with multiple changes made
 and saved. &nbsp;Then all of the sudden all the images are lost and in their place is a message, "The image part with relationship ID rID2 was not found in the file". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to go back and perform all the cut &amp; paste operations will take many hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me there is a quick fix to this. &nbsp;</p>

<h3> brockleggins  say:</h3>
<h2>            W2 template in Excel</h2>
                    I am looking for a template to print W2 forms. We have the sheets necessary to print on, we just need a template in which to put the information. I have found a few sites which linked to (apparently now formerly available) templates from Microsoft, however,
 the templates are no longer available. Does anyone know why? Or where I can find them? I have 2010. Word templates would be fine also.

            <p><strong>[Edit January 2015]&nbsp; See my last posting below with link to files that were developed to fill this need.&nbsp; It has a link to a 'discussion' posting which in turn has links to the files.&nbsp; Now -- my original response:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, so far all I've found are .pdf files to be filled out.&nbsp; I suppose in desperation you could set up an Excel sheet with cells aligned to the form and push data into those cells and print on top of the printed pdf file (or your pre-printed W2 form).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That method requires a lot of trial and error - I'd make a bunch of copies of the form you've paid money for to do the trial and error process with.&nbsp; One 'hint': to begin with grab a LOT of columns and set their width down to about 2.&nbsp; Then you can (heaven
 help me for saying this) merge cells to align with mis-aligned areas on the W-2 form much easier.&nbsp; Keep in mind that when you click "Merge and Center" it will center the entry, but you can then over-ride that by clicking the other alignment icons in the Alignment
 section of the [Home] tab to left or right justify the entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other hints: start out by filling the cells on the Excel sheet with numbers or letters to identify them, then print that out onto a copy of your W-2 form and take note of cells that do align or might just need a little adjustment in column widths to get
 aligned properly.&nbsp; Adjust row heights to move rows into proper position on the form.&nbsp; Make all your column width/row height adjustments from left to right and top to bottom, that way changes you make later don't mess up alignments you've already gotten correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a tedious process, trust me, I've been there often enough myself.&nbsp; I have to do this kind of thing several times a year for a variety of inputs that we get to work with.&nbsp; Lots of ink, lots of holding up to the light, lots of tweaking of alignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final hint: always do your printing of these setup outputs on the same printer that you will use for the final product.&nbsp; Variations in printer drivers and interpretation of font sizes and such can really ruin your day - your nicely laid out spreadsheet that
 printed on a W-2 perfectly on the little Brother printer next to your desk goes to pieces when printed on the heavy duty Canon printer down the hall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of thing is actually much easier in Access: you use a scanned graphic file of the form as the background of a Report and put the data cells over the section of the form it needs to show up in and just run a query to do the job rather quickly.&nbsp;
 As you hinted at, even Word might be better so you could set up a Mail Merge from an Excel data sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone else will be better at tracking down an Excel template for you.</p>
<p />

    <title>Require password to buy apps in marketplace&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Require password to buy apps in marketplace&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've seen the old posts about this, but I am checking to see if there is any resolution as to whether there is some kind of option for windows marketplace that would require a password in order to buy an app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased my daughter the Nokia Lumia 900 last night, and TWICE in the 30 seconds between her setting it down and walking away and her phone locking, our 4 year old has purchased apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use an iPhone and this can't happen on an iPhone.&nbsp; This could be an extremely expensive lack of feature and may need to return the phone.&nbsp; Please advise if this is still a flaw in the windows phone design. The posts on this topic are older, in 2011, so
 I hold out a bit of hope that there may be an update or a workaround for this in the meantime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>There is no lock in place when purchasing&nbsp;apps in the marketplace.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's&nbsp;a couple of things you could do to prevent easy access to the marketplace:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the phone's lock screen up to require a password before any aspect of windows phone can be accessed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove (delete) the Marketplace tile from the home screen. Then you still get to the marketplace by going to the applications list.</p>

<p>hitting the back button takes me to the same page I wish to step back. (simply is a repeating button)</p>
<p>all settings are reset to original, still just repeating. hmm.</p>
<p>no wonder, my primary browser is the prince of browsers. CHROME.</p>
<p>I kind of getting used to win 8, but Ubuntu x64, yeah you guessed right and its FREE.</p>

<p><font><font>Does this happen with all the websites? or is it specific to a particluar website?</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>Does this happen with any other browsers eg: Google Chrome?</font></font></p>
<p><font>If it happens with all the websites, then check if this is due to any systen file damage. Run an SFC Scan and check if that works. For this you need to enter the command "sfc /scannow" in the Command Prompt (Admin) windows and hit enter.</font></p>
<p><font>You can also try uninstalling and reinstall IE 10 if required and check if that works. For this you need to open the "Turn Windows features on or off" window and then uncheck the check box next to IE and then recheck it again. Do not forget to restart
 the computer in between.</font></p>

            <p>I have this same issue.&nbsp; I've had IE10 for about 6 (glorious) months now and it took me awhile to realize that more and more sites were stealing my back button and causing it to 'repeat' websites.&nbsp; Now I'm realizing that it's almost 100% of my&nbsp;surfing that
 repeat in the back button.&nbsp; Not every page but every unique site.&nbsp; Only way out is to hit back twice quickly and many times that ends up taking me back two pages!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that programmers can manipulate the back button and I hate that&nbsp;it is possible to do, but I'm beginning to wonder if suddenly programmers all over the world are doing this or if IE10 is doing it somehow.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that companies/website
 developers are spending the time and effort to modify their sites to do this thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone else have some feedback on this topic?</p>

            I have this, and other problems, with IE10.&nbsp; What helps, when it gets to bad to put up with, is to "uninstall," or "turn off" IE10, then turn it on again.&nbsp; It means resetting the home page, but the other settings seem okay.

            <p>I have another open post about this issue I believe, it is here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_8/ie-back-button-doesnt-work-multiple-clicks-to-go/597a5b1c-5788-4a0e-bc3e-fc37dce3986f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_8/ie-back-button-doesnt-work-multiple-clicks-to-go/597a5b1c-5788-4a0e-bc3e-fc37dce3986f</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HERE'S A COPY OF MY POST:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, this problem has been well documented across the web and on these forums, but I am still looking for a fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;On multiple websites, when I click on the back button, it just lands me on the same page I've been viewing.&nbsp;After browsing the page, in order
 to go back to the previous page, I have to double click or even triple click at times in order to back out of the page.&nbsp; Clicking the back button once just seems to refresh the page I'm on.&nbsp; This is getting more annoying every time I am using a search engine
 (both Google and Bing) and surfing through several different pages, as it's beginning to happen quite often.&nbsp; People are also seeing doubleclick.ads being inserted as "extra" links into their back button's history as well.&nbsp; So, is this an IE problem or a GoogleAds
 problem.&nbsp; Since Firefox does not seem to have this issue, it could indicate that IE isn't keeping up with their coding and stopping events like this from happening.&nbsp; Or, it could mean that these&nbsp;ads and redirects are occurring because Google&nbsp;and other ad makers
 are&nbsp;using bad code and the people at Firefox have figured out how to thwart it.&nbsp; Either way, Microsoft should do the same-put out a fix for this nuisance or end up losing IE users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One&nbsp;example is:</p>
<p>From Google search page, typing in "best autobiographies"</p>
<p>Scrolling down and selecting the goodreads.com site from the results</p>
<p>After spending about a minute on the page, clicking the back button once just lands me back on the goodreads.com page</p>
<p>Double-clicking will take me back to search results page</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second example:</p>
<p>Here's a screen shot of what occurred on the abcnews website.&nbsp; At first glance, the URL history is normal and I can go back to the previous page, but after being on the page for about 30 seconds or so, that link gets inserted so that then I am forced to
 double-click to go back to my previous page.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3df4160-67c1-4864-9f26-e141fe9019e7" /></p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15ba32e4-bddb-46a3-a85e-3041713cf973" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My attempts to fix:</p>
<p>I have reset IE, I even used Microsoft's IE Fix tool, I tried putting doubleclick.ads link into my restricted sites, I disabled scripting, I enabled 3rd party, I scanned for viruses and did registry fixes, scanned for adware and malware, updated my tracking
 protection lists for IE, don't have any add-ons, and more.&nbsp; To no avail.&nbsp; Still happening on both my pc's, one has IE9 and the other has IE10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possible cause?</p>
<p>After some intense reading about this problem, someone suggested it was a scripting problem with the ads themselves that these sites are putting up.&nbsp; So then, are these individual sites the one's we should be complaining to?&nbsp; (It'd be easier for a fix, Bill...pleeeeeze)&nbsp;
 So anyhoo, these ads that are running on the page you are visiting contain code that is inserting an extra frame into your browsing history (or so the suggestion went) and after further investigation, I found this HTML website giving directions on how to disable
 someone's back button using frames.&nbsp; Could this be the problem Bill?&nbsp; And what is the fix for this ANNOYING type of code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/buttons/article.php/3478911/Disabling-the-Back-Button.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/buttons/article.php/3478911/Disabling-the-Back-Button.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the tutorial that is referenced in the above link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISABLING THE BACK BUTTON</p>
<p>This tutorial is kind of a misnomer. You technically cannot disable the Back button on someone's browser, however, you can make it so that the button isn't available or continues to load the same page.</p>
<p>I should say up front that this is an effect that you may not want to use a great deal as it traps your users, however, the effect is used a great deal today and I get tons of email asking how to achieve the effect...so here it is. I simply offer it as code.
 You do with it as you please.</p>
<hr />
<p>Three Methods </p>
<p>I know of three methods to somewhat disable a browser's Back button. Now, please understand that none of these methods are foolproof as the Back function can always be achieved by right clicking on the page and choosing to go back. Furthermore, the user
 can always get out of the system by leaving the domain altogether or right clicking on the back button and choosing a page two or three back in the browser's history.</p>
<p>That said, here are the three methods. </p>
<p>The first really doesn't deserve more than a few lines in that you most likely already know how to do it. Set up a link that opens a
<a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/openwin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new window</a> that doesn't have a back button. You can get that effect by setting the "toolbar" to "no" when you configure the new window.
</p>
<p>It's boring, but it works. The problem is that the user can just simply close the new window and get back to the parent. That's where method two comes in.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Method Two: Open and Close </p>
<p>Method two also incorporates the new window but it goes one step further. It closes the parent window once the new window opens.
</p>
<p>You get the effect but setting the open window code to a function. After the function runs, you set a
<font color="#800000">self.close()</font> command to close up the parent window. The code and the text link that fires the code looks like this:
</p>
<p><font color="#800000">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;<br />
<br />
function goNewWin() {<br />
<br />
//***Get what is below onto one line***<br />
<br />
window.open("backbuttonnewpage.html",'TheNewpop','toolbar=1,<br />
location=1,directories=1,status=1,menubar=1,<br />
scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); <br />
<br />
//***Get what is above onto one line*** <br />
<br />
self.close()<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
&lt; /SCRIPT&gt; <br />
<br />
&lt; A HREF="javascript:goNewWin()"&gt;Click to go to a new page&lt;/A&gt;</font> </p>
<p>I can show you the effect right here, but this window would close so here's what we'll do. I'll spawn a new window that contains the code above. Take that as the parent window. You'll click on the link in that window and it'll span yet another new window
 and then close itself.</p>
<p>Confusing? Maybe. Let's try it.</p>
<p>The effect works pretty well across browsers, but it does have one downfall. MSIE browsers now often ask if you want the main window closed when it received the self.close() command. That pretty much kills the effect.</p>
<p>If you'd like the effect to occur without your user clicking a button, set the function "goNewWin()" in the BODY tag and trigger with an onLoad Event Handler.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Method Three. </p>
<hr />
<p>Method Three: Frames Trap </p>
<p>This is how I've seen the effect achieved numerous times. Again, it is not infallible. Users can get around it, but it is pretty clever in terms of coding.</p>
<p>Here's the basic thought process. You set up a two-frame format that has one frame set to 100% and the second, of course, set to zero. It doesn't matter if you use columns or rows. One frame is totally hidden anyway. I used columns. The code looks like this:
</p>
<p><font color="#800000">&lt;FRAMESET COLS="100%,*"&gt;<br />
&lt; FRAME SRC="goback.html"&gt;<br />
&lt; FRAME SRC="fillerpage.html"&gt;<br />
&lt; /FRAMESET&gt;</font></p>
<p>You'll notice that in the frame set to zero, I still make a point of adding a page. You still need to do that simply because it stops the browser from throwing a page not found and slowing down the process. The page is blank.</p>
<p>OK. In the 100% frame, I have a page named "goback.html". The user will never see that page mainly because it is nothing more than a redirect to the page I want. The page "goback.html" contains no visible text but rather the code:
</p>
<p><font color="#800000">&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT=".0; URL=nobackpage.html"&gt;</font>
</p>
<p>See what's happening? The user logs in and the two frames load. The page "goback.html" immediately redirects the 100% frame to jump to a new page, "nobackpage.html".</p>
<p>If the user clicks Back, the "goback.html" page loads and the "nobackpage.html" page pops right back up.
</p>
<p>Again, it can be thwarted by clicking quickly or right clicking on the Back button and jumping back past it. Even so, it's a new effect.
</p>
<p>That's That .........</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I'm not sure that this is an effect you'll want to use a great deal, but there it is. How you find a decent use for it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Enjoy! </p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, ME AGAIN!&nbsp; So, tell me that's not a problem, cause that is exactly what's been happening on these websites.&nbsp; It seems there are no fixes coming out from Microsoft, and there are no tweaks that are working for us. HELLLLLP!</p>

<p>Go to TOOLS/INTERNET OPTIONS/SECURITY tab</p>

<p>Close your browser and reopen and test a couple sites it has been affecting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Found this on a few sites and it said "could&nbsp;affect a normal re-direct from a website trying to get you where you want to go".&nbsp; So, also be on the lookout for it affecting possibly
 shopping or search results/sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did notice I am still getting some weird google.com inserted between the search page for "best autobiographies" and the page I clicked on "goodreads 2012".&nbsp; However, the problems with googleads.g.doubleclick.net seem to be gone on the FoxNews website.</p>

I followed Twinkly's suggestion and eagerly opened up IE only to find the same behavior on the very first site I went to. 



Oh, well - still at M$'s mercy...... 



Ya gotta wonder who's in charge at a software company that writes programs that REQUIRE 'security' updates on a way-too-regular basis.  If I wrote code like that my boss would dump my ****.

            <p>OK, still researching and found this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It could be due to ad scripts that are designed to get around third-party cookie blocking. Basically a site will redirect to the ad network site where the cookie is now a site cookie and thus not blocked, and then redirect you back to the original site.</p>
<p>Pressing Back would briefly take you to the ad network site and immediately send you back to the site you came from."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SO, until IE can come up with a fix like Firefox for these types of scripting issues (whether being done on purpose by the ad companies OR the site themselves) our only option is to complain directly to the website owners or webmasters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried every suggested fix out there to no avail, however I have seen 4+ websites that had this issue and when they took off the ads, the problem was solved for their users.&nbsp; Wow what a pain that we have to send emails to a webmaster (and hopefully
 they would even bother to look into it).&nbsp; But, very very surprising that since this has been going on so long MS hasn't been able to keep up with this ad technology.&nbsp;

<p>Alas !&nbsp; the second time I ran the back-up copying procedure, the routine that checked to make sure I didn't copy an existing file didn't work, for it was now Summer (in the UK), so "it" copied every single file again, with the new suffix as British Summer
 Time !</p>
<p>So I now have every file twice, as e.g.</p>
<p>C:\myFolder\myFile 20091225132502.jgj and</p>
<p>C:\myFolder\myFile 20091225142502.jgj&nbsp; - timed an hour later</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So.... Now I'm trying to write a routine that will run through every folder, deleting the duplicate with the older suffix....</p>
<p>But, for some reason, "it" won't work...&nbsp;&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")<br />
Set ff = fs.getfolder(myFolderName) </p>
<p>With ff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Case .Files.Count&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Is = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "No files were found.&nbsp; Sorry!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Is = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Chr(34) &amp; .Files(1) &amp; Chr(34) &amp; "&nbsp;&nbsp; was the only file ."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For N = 1 To .Files.Count&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Check each file in turn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For M = 1 To .Files.Count&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Run through all the other files<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If M &lt;&gt; N Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp;.Files(N).Size = .Files(M).Size Then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>etc., etc., etc....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is at that last line that things grind to a halt....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.Files.Count works, but not .Files(N).Name, nor .Size, nor .Drive</p>
<p>Nor&nbsp; .Files.Item(N).Name</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help ! ?</p>

<h2>            How do I recover deleted skype conversations on Mac&#63;</h2>
                    I need to look back at some old important conversations I've had on Skype. I didn't realize the importance of the conversations at the time, and I frequently cleared my messages to reduce lag. Now, I regret clearing the messages. I'm using the same account
 and laptop I used when I had the conversations, and can't figure out how to restore them. Please help.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/254e3f71-39f1-487a-9976-aa5b8b6f947f" title="xenegg">
<p>
</p><p>If messages were deleted from the Skype app, it is no longer possible to retrieve it unless you manually exported the chat history prior to deleting it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, exporting chat history is only available using Classic Skype which is the old version. If you are using the New Skype then messages are only saved on the cloud but once deleted, it also deletes the messages from the cloud storage real time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to say that we can no longer retrieve them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other questions.</p>

<h2>            Disable right click menu</h2>
                    <p>I want to prevent users from accidentally intervening database. So I have some code to hide navigation panel, ribbon and status bar on start-up. But I need to do one more thing : Disable right-click menu because it allows to access different view mode. I
 think that is enough for the purpose of preventing accident action&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please show me how to do that ( I don't expect highly security protection solution).</p>

<h2>            Windows Mobile 5 keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happened to the Windows Mobile 5 keyboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I can remember it, is was fairly good looking, on WM6 how ever I have this quite plain looking keyboard.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was just wondering if there is a setting or something somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running Windows Mobile 6 on a HTC Touch, and I just reset to default settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank, roketjack</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Install on samsung series 3 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _jamesfuller_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Install on samsung series 3 laptop</h2>
                    Windows 10 as of right now is not the easiest thing to install. With the 10 tech preview on a flash drive formatted correctly, my laptop did not want to recognize the flash drive as a bootable device even after I removed all other options from the boot
 menu. This may just be something that Samsung decided to lock down although I could not see why they would care to do so. Next, I tried to remove the hard drive and put it in my gaming rig that normally runs windows 7 ultimate. I disconnected my main rigs
 drive and plugged in my laptop drive, went through the install process, and got 10 running. I then put the laptop drive back into the laptop and turned on the laptop. It did not recognize the drive with a full OS on it. Attempt # 3: I caved and went to Walmart
 to buy a DVD, sad right. Came back, burned the iso onto the disk and it worked first time. Using 10 is very good and is much better than the bloated Samsung version of windows 7 I have had no problems and see 10&nbsp;as my next OS

            <p>I have a Samsung series 3 laptop, too, and have been running windows 7. &nbsp;It has proven to be wonderfully stable.</p>
<p>I recently followed the update prompt and installed Windows 10. &nbsp;Now, I know how model-specific Samsung is with its drivers, especially graphics drivers and was both disappointed , and not surprised, to learn that Windows 10 drivers are not available on
 SW Update (or Samsung Update, as it's now called). &nbsp;After the Windows 10 download, my laptop was intermittently lagging, and crashing. &nbsp;I reverted back to the safe harbour of Windows 7, wondering if Samsung will ever issue drivers for this particular series.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this not an issue the OP had to deal with?</p>

</p><p>On my 2 page&nbsp;&nbsp;column page, the 1st section break contiinuous seems to be linked to the header of page 1.

<p>Each section break stores section formatting, including headers and footers, for the
<strong>preceding</strong> section, which means that deleting a break will delete that information. (For more on this, see&nbsp;<a href="https://wordmvp.com/FAQs/Formatting/WorkWithSections.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://wordmvp.com/FAQs/Formatting/WorkWithSections.htm</a>,
 but note that the article hasn't been updated for recent versions of Word.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, headers (and footers) may be linked to the corresponding header (or footer) type in the preceding section, and therefore you may lose headers (footers) that you would like to keep earlier on in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, perhaps it would be easier to leave the section breaks intact and just change the number of columns for the section. Click in the section and then click Layout | Columns | More Columns. Make sure that "Apply to" says "This section" and click
 the "One" preset.</p>

<p>The option you proposed, is not applicable, there is no option for currency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if I change my billing address? could it be possible that payment currency is associated with billing address?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook.com keeps putting e-mail in &#34;Other&#34; and &#34;Spam&#34;, even after repeatedly moving it from there</h2>
                    <p>I have an e-mail from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** that outlook.com "smartly" thinks is spam. However, when I manually move it from "Spam" to "Inbox" outlook is not smart enough to realise I want all emails from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in future to be in my inbox, not my spam folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same deal with "Focused" and "Other".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any quick fix?</p>

<p>The issue occurs either due to a wrong installation sequence during factory load,
</span>instead of the driver officially released by Fujitsu).<br />
The problem is therefore not caused by a Hardware defect, and neither repair, nor Hardware replacement are necessary.
</p>
<p>To fix the error, please download the correct WebCam driver from the Fujitsu Support Web site (see link) and then install it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>I would like to know if the highlighting in the document show in Print Preview.</p>
<p>If yes, then you may change the default printer to OneNote or Microsoft XPS writer following the steps from the link below and check if the issue occurs:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/change-your-default-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/change-your-default-printer</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If changing the printer works fine. Then you may have to contact your Printer manufacturer for updated drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also follow the troubleshooting steps for the print issues in Word from the article below:</p>

<p>Let us know the details and hope the suggestions provided are helpful. If you need further assistance, reply and I will be glad to assist you.</p>
