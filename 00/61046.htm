<p>Hi Tuon,</p>
<p>Firstly, check if your <strong>windows time service</strong> is running. To check the status, click on start; in the start search type
<strong>Services.msc</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. Highlight <strong>Windows Time</strong> and check if the service is running or not. If it is not running, right click on it and start the service. Then try to synhronize your system clock with Internet
 Time Server.</p>
<p>Which <strong><em>Anti-virus software</em></strong> are you using?<br />
Some times, this issue occurs due to some third party anti-virus/firewalls (in particular McAfee) which blocks
<strong>W32Time Service</strong> (The W32Time service synchronizes an authoritative time server with an outside time source). I would suggest you to
<strong>disable</strong> your Anti-virus/Firewalls completely and then try to update the time.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Do not forget to re-enable the security software once you’re able to figure out what is causing the problem.</p>
<p>You can also try changing the default Internet Time Server (from <strong><em>time.windows.com</em></strong> to
<strong><em>time.nist.gov</em></strong>).</p>
<p>To do so,<br />
1.&nbsp;Right-click on the system clock in the system tray, and then choose <strong>Adjust Date/Time</strong> from the menu.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click on the <strong>Internet Time tab</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;Now click the <strong>Change settings</strong> button.<br />
4.&nbsp;In the <strong>Internet Time Settings dialog</strong>, you can change the default server by choosing an item from the drop-down, or you can type in a new entry (for ex:
<strong><em>time.nist.gov</em></strong>) You can also test it immediately by clicking the
<strong>Update now</strong> button.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to update the time and you still receive an error, then try the following steps to stop and start the time update application.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Start</strong>; in the <em>start search</em> type <strong>
cmd</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Right click on <strong>Cmd.exe</strong> and choose <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;Type the following command. After typing each command press enter.</p>
<p><strong>net stop w32time<br />
w32tm.exe /unregister<br />
w32tm.exe /register<br />
net start w32time</strong></p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if this worked.<br />

    <title>Multiple Games Freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bouchard96  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Games Freezing</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, since Monday night, after an update to my Xbox via the dashboard, my Xbox has been freezing way more often than normal. While playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, I first noticed some graphical glitches, where there would be these stretched triangles
 coming off random corners of an object. This also occurred while playing NBA 2k11, and it something that usually never happens when playing 2k11. My Assassin's Creed froze on me after about 15-20 minutes, so I decided to play my old save on Mass Effect 2.
 After playing it for awhile, it also froze, and when I got back into the game, my save was corrupted and no longer playable 10+ hours of gameplay was wasted just like that.</p>
<p>Next, I played some Call of Duty: Black Ops online, after a few minutes into a game, it froze. I was starting to get pissed off, but I assumed I was just getting a bad string of bad luck. My NHL 2011 works fine. I'm able to play it without hiccups or freezing.
 Last night, I bought Mortal Kombat and attempted to play it. The game loads up fine, gets into the menu, and allows me to select fighters. After the match loads, it shows the fighters enter the screen, perform their animation, but shortly after the sound goes,
 and it plays a repeated, anooying buzzing sound before the game freezes completely. No matter what game setting I go into, freezing happens. I have not been able to play Mortal Kombat on my 360 yet.</p>
<p>So I tried some troubleshooting. First, I cleared the cache. Still freezes. Then I tried it without a harddrive. Still freezes. Then I tried deleting the Mortal Kombat files. Still freezes.
</p>
<p>So I called up a friend of mine, and we were able to play Mortal Kombat with no problem on his Xbox.
</p>
<p>Next, I called Xbox, and was basically told to wait until the update that was initiated today went live and see what happens. So I did, downloaded the update, and it still freezes. I tried some other things, like deleting my ME2 corrupt save and deleting
 some unneccessary files. I also tried using different xbox cables to see if that was the problem, but still, it freezes. Today, I called Xbox today, and argued with one woman because she said that I would have to pay for my Xbox to be repaired. I asked for
 the supervisor. He said that my situation was "strange" multiple times, and he couldn't figure out what was wrong. He told me that he was receiving some serial numbers from microsoft about today's firmware update and wasnt sure if mine was on the list. He
 told me to hang on maybe another day, then call back.</p>
<p>So my question is, is it possible that I downloaded the firmware update too early on Monday? Could that be having an effect? is my GPU or CPU dying? Why should I have to pay for another broken xbox (now my 4th, by the way). I had nothing to do with these
 failures, and I have strong reason to believe that its all happened since that update on Monday night.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

<p>It sounds like you've tried all of the steps found in the disc-guide troubleshooter. If installing the games does not alleviate the issue, be sure to check that the console is in an open, well-ventilated environment. If it is already, then it will likely
 need a repair. You can check your warranty status and set one up <a href="http://xbx.lv/alhhR6%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>

<p>My warranty status is over but that shouldn't be the issue. This problem started happening ever since I installed an update. Why should I have to pay money for something I couldn't prevent? I pay for Xbox Live, and without installing updates, I can't play
 on Xbox Live. Ever since the update, I've had the problem.</p>
<p>this situation is driving me nuts. When I called Microsoft, they acted as if they had never heard of this problem.

<p>Also, last night I tried Halo Reach. The game loaded fine, I searched for an online game, but once the loading screen came up after finding a game, an error message popped up that read "this disk is unreadable." Does this qualify me for the firmware replacement

<p>There are actually a few things that might be causing this issue, the don't require a repair. &nbsp;First, have you clear the system cache since you installed the update? &nbsp;Sometimes, as with all computer systems, installs and updates do not clean themselves up
 tidily, and can leave chunks of information in the cache. &nbsp;Clearing the cache will clear any linger chunks of data, and can dramatically improve system performance. &nbsp;This is done by doing the following:</p>
<p>System Settings&gt;Memory&gt;Highlight Hard drive&gt;Press Y&gt; Select Clear System Cache&gt;Select Yes&gt;Restart the console.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work, there is another option available that may resolve the problem. &nbsp;I will monitor this thread for a response</p>

<p>I did a few testing of my own with different games. Here are the results. Is it possible these games are freezing because they are related in some way? (ie: use the same engine, graphical tools, or disk format)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Games that Freeze:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. FIFA 10 - Freezes at start</p>
<p>b. Call of Duty: Black Ops - Freezes few minutes after gameplay</p>
<p>c. UFC Undisputed 2010 - Freezes at start</p>
<p>d. EA Sports MMA - Freezes at start</p>
<p>e. Halo Reach - Freezes after game loading, gives “Disk is unreadable” message and allows me to return to dashboard
</p>
<p>f. Mortal Kombat - Freezes right after match loading with sound glitches</p>
<p>g. Read Dead Redemption - Freezes after game loading</p>
<p>h. Call of Duty 2 - Freezes after game loading</p>
<p>i. Fallout: New Vegas - Froze after about 10 minutes, but I hear freezing is common with this game</p>
<p>j. Grand Theft Auto IV - Froze after just a minute in the game</p>
<p>k. Crackdown - Freezes during game loading</p>
<p>l. Crackdown 2 - Freezes at startup</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Games that don’t freeze:</p>
<p>a. The Orange Box</p>
<p>b. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</p>
<p>c. NBA 2K11 - Works, but has major graphical glitches</p>
<p>d. Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood - Works, but has graphical glitches</p>
<p>e. ESPN NFL 2K5</p>
<p>f. NHL 11</p>
<p>g. Gears of War</p>
<p>h. Borderlands</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Dark Souls 3 Any Pyro Experts.</h2>
                    
<p>So I bought DS3 the other day, great game. Very intense, very hard, very complex. Which is great, however it is a little too complex at the minute. Bare in mind I have never played a DS game in my life. What with buffs, soft caps, scaling etc'. There seems
 to be a lot of information on the tinterwebby, yet its either the real basics like " this hand burns stuff, t'other hits stuff ". Or the other extreme of complete experts with things like " Soft Cap Astoria with 20/20 int/faith buffing at 25 with A/S/D/E/G,
 so scale with dex/vig ". I get some of the acronyms but it's all rather complicated to me.<br />
<br />
I'm currently lvl 33. Have my faith and int both at 20, If I'm correct in understanding the flame powers are " soft capped " at certain int/faith levels. Vigor is around 16/17, Dex is about 16, Att is maybe 15 I think, enough to get three Catalysts loaded anyway.
 Att is quite low at 14 I think.<br />
<br />
Does anyone play as a Pyro?. I could just do with a little advice on where to go with the build and if I'm understanding things correctly.<br />
<br />
Much appreciated Maple.</p>

<p>I'm currently playing through with my son as a pure pyro, at about 40 int/fai you start seeing soon good damage and I think about 60 on both is where it soft caps, with some choice item stacking you can break the pve side of the game, sages ring is also
 a must unless you want to spend points in dex.</p>

<p>Ah good man Jambo. What was your weapon of choice through the first bit of the game?. I have a Raw Astoria+3. Got my Pyro to +3 too. Also what gear did you wear, I seem to go +70 with anything other than a my Cleric Robes and end up fat rolling. My other
 issue is aiming with the Fireball. I'm currently taking on that fat Rotten Cursewood dude, its pain as I can't specifically aim at the certain orbs on his legs and a$$, so I have to go in with the sword, rendering any Pyro useless with this dude.

<p>Hey Maple.</p>
<p>I think you'll struggle to defeat the Cursed Rotten Greatwood with either a Pure Pyromancer or Pure Caster approach because the game doesn't really allow you to target the sacks you need to pop to damage it's health.</p>
<p>Especially early in the game it is essential that casters and Pyromancers alike have conventional weapons they can fall back on.</p>
<p>Your sword is a good choice because you can get in multiple swings before you run out of stamina.</p>
<p>Don't plan to fight this boss with Pyromancy, or if you can get some Pyro hits in early, go for those and then plan to do the rest of the fight physically.</p>
<p>Before going to confront the boss, go see Andre the Blacksmith and allot all your flasks into Healing Estus. &nbsp;Give yourself ZERO Ashen Estus. &nbsp;You can switch it back after.</p>
<p>Then all you'll need to do is attack the sacks on the boss.</p>
<p>Watch a youtbube video of someone doing it to get an idea of where the sacks are so you know you get them all.</p>
<p>You want to find a nice open area in the Fire Link Shrine, and practice swinging the sword just to count how many swings you can make until you have just enough stamina to roll away and then attack it like that.</p>
<p>So if your stamina is all gone after the 5th swing, run up to the sacks, swing 4 times and roll, then move while your stamina regenerates and go back and do it again.</p>
<p>With the extra Estus you'll have a couple of extra heals or more available to you.</p>
<p>As mentioned above after you've beaten him you can go back and reallocate your Estus split any time you like.</p>
<p>Whatever you're wearing you want to be 70% or less for your equipment load.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the game as I'm moving to different sets I have to just not wear the helmet for a level or 2 to just make 70% which isn't a bad trade.</p>
<p>It's your Vitality that improves your equipment load so why not just travel to the High Wall Of Lothric bonfire and farm the enemies there down to the 4 Lothric Knights. &nbsp;Rinse and repeat until you have enough souls to increase your Vitality.</p>
<p>If you go in Emberred you can summon help.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>If you go in Hollow and are doing well but health is looking shaky and the boss is down to 1/4 health, using an ember will give you a full heal as well as providing the additional health.</p>
<p>Hope some of these tips are useful.</p>

<p>I used the starting axe untill I felt I didn't need melee anymore so cant really help there although I do have a thrall axe infused with simple for the fp regen and it does 400+ dmg due to the scaling that simple adds.</p>
<p>For armour anything that kept me below 30%, with my health pool &nbsp;being so low I figured it was better to just not get hit, it wasn't long before I was 2 shotting most mobs so faster stamina regen and better mobility didn't have many downsides.</p>
<p>For rotten cursewood second phase just workout the distance you need for the arc of fireball for the rear orbs and bait him into standing and start circling ready, for the front of him you can hit the hand, easy fight once you get the knack.</p>

<p>Oh those crabs were a pain.</p>
<p>I couldn't get them with my Butcher's Knife and had to go back to them when one of the Cathedral Knights dropped his Mace.</p>
<p>That thing smashes crabs silly.</p>
<p>One of those crabs has a ring you will really want as a Pyromancer. &nbsp;It's the one near the castle bit that has a Black Knight in it.</p>
<p>The other 2 don't drop any special loot.</p>

<p>Yeah it's the Great Swamp Ring. I'd would've left the little buggers otherwise. I got most of the loot whilst dodging them. I went in a large room for something at the back end and a Red Eye Ghoul snook up on me. Got 7k souls back there. I'm only level 34
 so 7k is nearly another level. </p>

<p>I'm now nearly 50. It's getting a little easier now with the upgraded Pyro Hand to +4. Anybody use the Dark Hand?. I bought as I thought it's be cool draining people Ala Vadar, however it seems quite pants. What miracles and Sorcery are you guys using?.
 I'm just getting toward the end of Catherdral of the Deep, got one giant left to kill.

<p>I had levelled up my Faith and Intelligence up to 10 each so I could use Pyromancies.</p>
<p>Specifically I was concerned with imbuing my weapon with fire for a permanent Fire Buff.</p>
<p>Ended up the weapons I use don't allow you to buff (early game, Butcher Knife, Later on Black Knight Greataxe) so ended up not really being necessary.</p>

<h2>            Dual monitor issue - every window on app on 2nd monitor opens on 1st monitor</h2>
                    Help! &nbsp;I am running 2 apps simultaneously, one on the primary monitor and one on the 2nd monitor. &nbsp;The app on the primary monitor is fine. &nbsp;The problem I'm having is that the app on the 2nd monitor does not work on there. &nbsp;It will not stay there or operate
 there. &nbsp;It opens on the primary monitor. &nbsp;That part is no big deal because I just drag it to the 2nd monitor. &nbsp;However, every time I click to view a new page, the new page opens on the primary monitor, completely blocking my view of the primary monitor. &nbsp;When
 the app is open on the 2nd monitor, why does each page click on it open up on the 2nd monitor? &nbsp;Why does it keep opening up on the primary monitor? &nbsp;It is very frustrating and counter productive to drag every single page/window back to the 2nd monitor. &nbsp;I
 might as well not have a 2nd monitor!! &nbsp;What can I do to keep this from happening? &nbsp;It completely negates having a 2nd monitor if each page click within the app wo

<p>&nbsp;It is there but it's so far to the right you can't see it, move pointer to the right until you can't see it and click for desktop.&nbsp; You may just to be able to see a faint line after last icon that's where it's hiding. Also you can right click the taskbar
 and select Show Desktop and then click Show Open Window to return to where you were.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp; Glad to help. I suppose they expect everybody to use the right click in taskbar to access&nbsp;their desktop who knows?Also if you go to Settings&gt;Personalisation&gt;Taskbar in the list there is a switch which if you set to on you can peek at you desktop by placing
 the pointer to the extreme right of the taskbar,&nbsp;the purpose of this I'm not sure of as you can only glimpse the desktop and not actually do anything with it, I suppose it could be useful should you need a quick check to see if you have a certain thing on
 your desktop.</p>

            <p>I&nbsp; had set mine to ON to see what would happen.&nbsp; I did not see anything happen!&nbsp; That was because I did not see that tiny white line.&nbsp; So thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This change, the removal of the desktop icon and its replacement with a tiny white line and minuscule space, is one of the most bizarre changes to Windows.&nbsp; I think they have a lot of coders who have nothing to do, and unfortunately, they let them do things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many changes to Windows that removed really well-designed features from previous versions.&nbsp; Change for the sake of change?&nbsp; Hiring coders so young they had not experience with older versions?&nbsp; Keeping them busy?&nbsp;&nbsp; Who ever is supervising seems
 disconnected from most of us users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Complaints about Windows 10 are legion.&nbsp; that's too bad; it's pretty good.&nbsp; But many of those complaints are justified!&nbsp; Don't get me on the subject of Windows media Player.&nbsp; And why have they not fixed the "USB disconnect" issue which has been a problem
 since Windows 7?&nbsp; (Sofware Upgrades disconnect some USB devices).&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp; The peek button will work with the pointer to the far right it may take a couple of seconds to activate, hopefully.&nbsp; I also saw a post from you about the clock not showing in the taskbar and about poor choice of colours for taskbar. I colour my taskbar
 by Settings&gt;Personalisation&gt;Colours (not themes)&nbsp;and using the accents chart to colour it and make transparent should you wish, it colours the title bar as well but there is an option to not colour said bar.</p>

            <p>I found the colors option and it did help somewhat, although the choices of colors was so limited a good contrast was not found.&nbsp; The solution is choosing a font color for the clock, or just choosing black or&nbsp; white, an adequate solution.&nbsp; White is available
 if you don't choose "small icons" but not available if you choose "small icons."&nbsp; Strange choices.</p>

<p>Hello all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. IF you are unable to do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft factory reset</a>, where you keep games and apps. Then we suggest doing an <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
offline update</a> that will require a Windows 10 PC and a USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Well you have fixed it. However the fact that I have received no communication from a representative of Microsoft, not even an automated message, plus the fact that rather then removing the additional transactions you simply set my "beginning points balance"
 for August down to 150 I feel as though I have been stolen from.</p>

<p>I completely agree, i just contacted microsoft about this issue for the second time today. i was first told that because i bought a wp7, i recieved these points, the second time i called was because they removed the extra points. they explained people where
 given to many points and thus the points where removd to witch i responded what if i had spent the points? the representitive explained i would get to keep what i baught. what a crock microsoft. get your blam in order. why give the people that spent the points
 something for free and just take away from those that knew it was some sort of error.... &nbsp;</p>

<p>i think thats pretty unfair. i think if they are going to allow some people to keep the points then so should everyone else get to keep them, how can such a financially stable company be so sincerly stupid.

<p>So do you owe points or anything if you bought something or what because i bought something for 320 and now my beginning points balance is -970, however my account still has 30 MSP that have been there since the start of the year</p>

<p>Should say I didnt realise it was a mistake until the next day when my points were back to 30 my account says I had over 1000 MSP when the most I had was 440 (thought we got extra as a promotion or something since it was my first pay out)</p>

            <p>Yes you'll have to pay back any points that you have spent. &nbsp;Also, if your account is showing a negative (-), that means they have already deducted the points. &nbsp;I can't say for sure but more than likely you'll eventually not be allowed to download any new content until that is replaced. &nbsp;You're best bet is to contact support and ask to speak with billing about it. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 takes a long time to shutdown and startup.</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows 7 slow shutdown</p>
<p>My shutdown/restart has recently become much slower than it was previously ( it now takes exactly 70 seconds to either power-down or restart my computer.)<br />
I have tried the clean boot trouble shooting technique described (posted by Chris H.) It never seems to make any difference what services and or start-up items I disable - the time it takes to shut down remains constant. However, I have no problem with start-up
 ( from the time I enter my p-word and enter it to the time the desk&nbsp; top appears is approximately 1-2 seconds. I've seen no error messages. I'm also a fanatic about system maintenance and keeping drivers and other software up to date. Any other trouble shooting
 tips I might try? Btw my other system is much older than this one and although it has considerably fewer programs installed on it, it has hella more hardware and shuts down in 10 seconds flat.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) except
 mouse and the keyboard and check if the issue persists. </span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur with the external device connected then, try connecting one device at a time to check which hardware
 causing the issue. If you come to know the hardware device which is causing the issue then try updating the drivers for the hardware device and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><b><span>
</span></b><span>Let’s run the performance troubleshooter and check if that helps.</span></p>

<p>Hi Naveen,</p>
<p>1. For example, in One note online I can insert photo from camera, but One Note 2016 or other like Word, I am not able to do that because the button is not there. And I would like to insert photos directly from the app One Note.</p>
<p>2. Yes, I can access using other application. For example, Camera App.</p>
<p>3. Is Microsoft Surface Pro 5. New generation</p>
<p>4. Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Olha, se o jogo foi baixado, logo o problema não é a net. O problema consiste no momento de salvar o arquivo logo após o download, portanto creio eu que o problema seja no seu dispositivo de armazenamento, algum problema no hd/pendrive ou algo do tipo. Verifique
 se o mesmo erro ocorre usando outro disp. de armazenamento.</p>

            Hi Daniel_Silva123
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you get into computer, share dump file on Onedrive. (C:\Windows\Minidump )
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<div>TDR stands for <strong>T</strong>imeout <strong>D</strong>etection and <strong>
R</strong>ecovery. A timeout happens when graphics ('video') processing comes to a halt while some problem is being addressed. If too many timeouts happen in a row, a BSOD occurs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The blue screen references a driver file that is involved with the original problem, although the file itself is not necessarily the cause. It's likely to be atikmpag.sys or nvlddmkm.sys or igdkmd64.sys, depending on whether your graphics chip is from
 AMD, nVidia or Intel. (AMD was formerly known as ATI.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first step in fixing this problem is to update your graphics driver. Go to the Intel website and install the newest Windows 10 driver for your Intel graphics chip. (If you have a laptop you probably need to get the driver from the laptop manufacturer.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>If Intel isn't supporting that graphics chip on Windows 10 - there's no Windows 10 driver for it - you may have success with a Windows 8.1 driver. Otherwise, it's probably time to update your graphics hardware.</div>

            Hi Daniel
<br />
<br />igdkmd32.sys is your Intel HD Graphics device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Try booting into Safe Mode and uninstall that driver, then see if Windows will boot correctly. If it does, download and install the latest version of the Intel HD Graphics for your PC from the support page for your PC the manufacturers website . .. 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down

<h2>            Lag Problems &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having many lag problems and it's getting very frustrating. I usually play Black Ops. When I join a game it can go a bit without lagging. I have 4 bars most of the time but at least 2 times in between games it would drop all the way down to one
 bar. Nobody in my house uses the internet while I play. Can anybody help?</p>

<p>If it's wifi, make sure that you don't have anything else connected to it whilst playing, this can help your connection :)</p>

<h2>            error O2 Connection Manager error 633.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: broadband 633</p>
<p>I have been using O2 Connection Manager For Years until four days ago when suddenly a pop up showed up reading 'O2 UK (Error 633), sorry connection Manager has found a problem, close connection manager and re-start it.....'<br />
I have downloaded and installed this KB2618301, still with No Promising results! Surprisingly, the Modem can easily be detected, as well as the the 3G network.<br />
Tried a repair windows 7 install, this one too wouldn't go on as version installed is newer than the the Upgrade.<br />
I therefore need Urgent Help.<br />
Thank You<br />
Ernest</p>
