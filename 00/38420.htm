    <title>best powersave configuration, sleep vs hibernation&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            best powersave configuration, sleep vs hibernation&#63;</h2>
                    So when setting up a battery profile for to conserve power while using battery, and while plugged in the profile uses the least amount of power to allow a drained battery to charge more than it would with say a maximum performance configuration.
<br />
The question I have has to do with the time inactive sleep vs. hibernate setups. I need some advice on what would be the best way for a power saving profile to choose which to use if not both in both plugged in and unplugged in. the hibernation setup seems
 like it would be the one to use while using battery, where the sleep option would be great for when the computer is plugged in, but I don't understand how it works if say you have it set to sleep while plugged in after say 10 minutes of inactivity and then
 were to set it to hibernate after 15 minutes. Would the computer go to sleep and then when it hits the 15 minute mark wake up to go into hibernation? or Just simply go from sleep to hibernate, or would it not hibernate at all since it is already sleeping?
<br />
So perhaps a silly question, but it seems to be messing with my mind a tad, so any info on this or recommendations on how to set it up in a way that is tried and true that will conserve the battery span and while plugged in I can choose or remain on this power
 saving profile and will optimize the charging of the battery the most in the least amount of time.
<br />
Thank you in advance for your consideration of this issue, and for the moment of your time in reading it,
<br />
Truly. <br />

<h2>            Blue screen pointer ref and mouse stopped working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this laptop just over a year ago and this past month I am assuming it's on it's way out already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire E1-571 and this past month I have had it experience &nbsp;a problem where when I would type a letter there would be two characters appear. For example if I typed 'p' I would get an apostrophe an p. For some reason this fixed itself twice
 but I expect it to return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways two days ago I got a blue screen with the words 'pointer_ref' appearing. The computer restarted and then today the mouse just stopped working. I couldn't move the cursor around while browsing but I turned the computer off and on and it worked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. I cannot afford a new computer and a year with a computer working is ridiculous. I bought this computer new and a week after the warranty ended it started doing the keyboard ****.</p>

<p>Hi manny1704,</p>
<p><br />
To check the compatibility of the game with the Windows Vista Operating system visit the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=sacred&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=sacred&amp;os=32-bit</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=sacred&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=sacred&amp;os=64-bit</strong></a></p>
<p>Since the game is not listed in Windows Vista compatibility center install and run the game in compatibility mode by following this step.</p>
<p>Install the game and run in XP Compatibility mode and check if it works.</p>
<p>Program compatibility is a mode in Windows that lets you run programs written for earlier versions of Windows.</p>
<p>If an older program doesn't run correctly, the first, and easiest, thing to try is the Program Compatibility troubleshooter. It can automatically detect and fix common problems that prevent older programs from installing or running correctly.</p>
<p><br />
Open the <strong>Program Compatibility troubleshooter</strong> by clicking the<strong> Start</strong> button, and then clicking<strong> Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under <strong>Programs,</strong> click<strong> Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.
</strong></p>
<p><br />

    <title>Windows 10 issue with multiple monitors and KVM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fultonian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 issue with multiple monitors and KVM</h2>
                    I have a personal laptop and a work laptop. I use the built in LCD screens on the laptops as the main screen for each.<br />
<br />
I also have an external monitor that I share between the two laptops with a KVM switch. So, whichever computer is selected by the KVM has the external monitor as a secondary display.<br />
<br />
I have happily used this configuration for months.<br />
<br />
Recently, I upgraded the personal laptop from Win7 to Win10. The work laptop is still Win7.<br />
<br />
Now, when I switch the external monitor from my personal laptop to the work laptop, everything that was being displayed on the external screen for the personal laptop is transferred to the main screen of the personal laptop. This means that when I switch back
 to the personal laptop I have to move the programs I want displayed on the external monitor back to the external monitor. It still works properly on the work laptop (Win7), so I am concluding that the issue is Win10. Is there some setting that I can change
 so that when I switch from the personal laptop to the work laptop it doesn't move the programs displayed on the extended monitor back to the main display?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!

<div>So - how to disable connected standby? Don't tell me "it's a part of windows experience" bla bla, the 'experience' is half baked so far...(to put it very diplomatically). I want to shut connected standby down, completely - and use good, old, normal windows
 7-style sleep. Is there a service, registry key, anything i can do to disable connected standby?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On connected standby, I've got battery drain with airplane mode, no user apps open (anything that can be shutdown - shutted down), most metro apps deleted, just 4 left (metro IE10, Windows Store, Music, Photos, S-Camera), no nfc, no bluetooth, no usb accesories,
 no keyboard dock, all task scheduler stuff not only not allowed to wake the computer, but disabled at all, no auto syncing anything in widndows 8 (not syncing tiles, user account stuff, no push mail in outlook 2013), no auto updates to OS, anything (except
 for samsung own s-update service - it's fine, it's been long before and it didn't cause problems), no anytvirus, windows defender disabled..&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Nothing interesting in the event viewer, with anything power-related filtered from the system logs..</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I mean, man... What the ....?! How to find this something that drains my battery? I've been looking at cpu cycles (task manager and ProcessExplorer), and it's not conclusive, the most cycles is OS stuff.. some "hardware interrupts and DMCs", but not nearly
 enough to cause such drain...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm suspecting wifi drivers a little bit.. some weird logs I've seen in the even viewer.. But I'm going into connected standby &lt;on airplane mode&gt;. Wifi off. I even checked, I disabled the wifi driver in the device manager and still, battery drain on the
 connected standby&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yes, I'm all over updated. I'd even say updated too much from MS... This been working fine before.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some powercfg -batteryreport (s) in the links below. Yup, played with powercfg /waketimers, device manager power and wake settings, powercfg /devicequery wake_armed (all turned off, nothing here from a loong time) and powercfg -requests. Clean.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On these pictures from powercfg -batteryreport, the columns are date/type of activity/lasted for how long/battery drain in %/battery drain in mWH. Suggesting you have a look at the last one. It's a record there... 18% battery drain in 4 hours. "Sleeping".</div>

</div>
<div>The tablet is lying on my desk, just sitting there, doing I've got no idea what, and 4 hours later boom, where all that battery juice went for?! I've got problem with the windows home button, it gets triggered in my bag accidentaly when I carry the tablet
 around, but it's a separate problem how to disable this windows home button. The connected standby battery drain is a different thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Much worse.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So:</div>
<div>QUESTION 1:</div>
<div>- how to disable this crappy connected standby thing that drains my battery and drives me nuts?</div>
<div>QUESTION 2:</div>
<div>- if it's not possible to disable directly, how to go around that? I don't need a button to do this. Telling what to do with windows registry is good enough.</div>
<div>QUESTION 3:</div>
<div>- if connected standby cannot be disabled in any way - how to diagnose which app/process uses cpu cycles, battery juice? I've been all over ProcessExplorer and Event Viewer, but maybe you know something I don't know...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And please spare me suggestions of clean boot, when I revert to "normal" state I'll have a ton of bloatware I don't need running with the OS.. there is a reason why a little bit tech-savvy people use such things as services.msc. De-bloating! Nope, I didn't
 touch the system services.. Yes I know it can cause a ton of problems, it's not this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't need a clean boot, I need a way which device in the device manager uses so much power, what driver, what app, what service, what process, what thread, where it's located in the filesystem, at which times it's been active, how much cycles on the
 CPU it got since then...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And if MS doesn't already have such app in windows, there should be one, cause power issues on the clovertrail windows 8 tablets are ..... plague. For instance - this is exactly the problem (a review of similar win 8 tablet with the same connected standby
 issue) here -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.umpcportal.com/2013/02/connected-standby-battery-life-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.umpcportal.com/2013/02/connected-standby-battery-life-problem/</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When even bloggers and tech reviews write about it, you know there's something in it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But I guess stupid finger painting apps like freshpaint are more important as a selling point.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Just to let you all know that I have found the registry key to turn off connected standby. So you can all stop raging and take a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power. There is a DWORD called "CsEnabled" which you should find set to 1 and changing it to 0 will turn connected standby off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 and can confirm that since making the change my battery life has dramatically improved. Also on the battery meter, previously it just showed the percentage remaining but now it shows the time remaining (e.g 8Hrs, 30 mins) as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only disadvantage of doing this is when I close the type cover&nbsp;and re-open it, the surface logo (normally blue windows logo) appears and performs the old style wake up from sleep. Obviously this should not be a problem for any of you though although
 as most laptops normally do this..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously when I opened the cover, the screen would come back on and I would be back at my desktop (or metro app, whatever was last open) just as before - similar to pressing the lock button on and off on an iPad, tablet or phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps everyone all out. Please like and mark as solution if this fixes your problem :D</p>

            I would suggest you update the bios. There's been two recent releases of bios from Samsung for ativ 500t1c. The first wrecked my battery meter and didn't fix connected standby battery drain, the other fixed the battery metter and the drain. After a year
 from the release of the device. Finally... And it was crappy bios drivers all along...

<h2>            Price of the game</h2>
                    <p>Good evening!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i have been thinking about buying Mad Max for my Xbox One. But i've been bit confused by the price. I just noticed it costs 19.99 Dollars but 69.99 Euros. Even on Steam its 19.99 Euros. Why the price for console version is so expensive ? Please don't
 get this the wrong way. It just feels really weird and confused to me. And i dont want to pay for now older game 69.99. Just released new games do cost less. Why is it so?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually think this is a glitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;€69.99 is rather too high.&nbsp; Mad Max game on the UK Xbox Marketplace is £29.99.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would advise to wait to see if it's corrected, or just buy the game on disc, it's quite cheap now.</p>

<p>There is a massive difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;€</span>69.99 Euros equals&nbsp;$79.16 U.S Dollars or £61.26 GBP.&nbsp; That price just isn't right at all.</p>

            That price is even a little for the Australian store, and we're always done hard by with "distance tax" and exchange rates. It would be $100 AUD or about 71Euro. It could be about right, having said that.&nbsp;

            the price varies greatly depending on the producer, the type of the game, whether it is a triple A, and mainly the country.

<h2>            Microsoft Train Simulator vs. Flight Simulator X powered by Steam</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left">Does anyone know why Microsoft is supporting Flight Simulator X with Steam but not Microsoft Train Simulator? These two simulators are about 4 years apart so I don't know if they are going to or have supported Microsoft Train Simulator
 already. I just downloaded my childhood favorite train simulator on my latest and updated laptop and MSTS doesn't work. I download FSX and it works fine and discovered it is supported by Microsoft and Steam. I have tried to update MSTS from other sites (like
 Trainsim) and unable to find direct support from Microsoft so far for MSTS. Does anyone have ideas?</div>

            FSX is now under the control of Dovetail Games (Licensed from Microsoft). &nbsp;Dovetail Games updated FSX so that it now runs on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 without any problems and also created a new multiplayer server.&nbsp;Dovetail Games has it's own train simulator
 called TS2017 (available on Steam) and they are bringing out a completely New train sim (64 bit) using the Unreal4 game engine in February 2017 called Train Sim World.

<p>Picture of the problem: http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/183/wuprob.jpg</p>
<p>OS is Windows 7 Ultimate x64 RTM (up to date).</p>
<p>Unfortunately i dont remember exactly what i installed or did before the problem occured so i can't troubleshoot it properly.</p>
<p>Still.I tried to reset the WU components and as far as i can tell it worked but problem still persists.Tried both the Fixit 50202(both regular and agressive) and manual method as described in here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</p>
<p>Manual method had some problems(cmd output seems litle odd since i had enabled "@ echo off"):</p>

<p>Namely the "netsh reset winsock" should be "netsh winsock reset"(both without quotemarks of course).Then it works.</p>
<p>Also the first two renames worked albeit throwing errors on cmd output but third didnt work since there is no "catroot2" folder in Win7(atleast i dont have it).So i did the third manually.</p>
<p>Also regsrv32 was unable to register or find several files:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried even wiping the entire C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution folder clean but the problem remained.</p>
<p>I also lokked over several similar threads here and tried all the suggested things but still no luck.I dont have any GP rules set and im admin.</p>
<p>i have the latest Windows Update Agent v.7.4.7600.224 installed too.</p>

<p>Whew i managed to get it working again.Here's the solution that worked for me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Open regedit.exe</p>
<p>*Navigate to <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</strong></p>
<p>*Delete subkey named <strong>NoWindowsUpdate </strong>(if it exists)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No restart needed.Windows Update should now work fine.</p>

<p>I had this problem when I first played it at launch. I ended up playing it non stop start to finish so the bug wouldn't get me. I Still play multiplayer now that it's fixed and plays better. I agree I thought the campaign save bugs would be fixed. Im not
 in a hurry to play it or BF3's campaign again.</p>

<p>I just got BF-4 free by buying CoD Ghosts/Black Ops II from GS. I've yet to play BF-4, but was wondering if these problems discussed here with BF-4 were limited to X1, or is it the same for the 360?

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">No doubt BF4 was a huge disappointment when released and was broken in so many places but honestly the Campaign was the very, very bottom of any concern. Odd though, I played it and never had the missing Save issue.<br />
<br />
Meh, MP finally works and that's all that is really important. Too bad it took them almost a year to get the Game working as it should have been at Retail. I will agree DICE/ EA shot themselves in the foot and could have dominated the FPS Genre this Gen if
 BF4 worked upon Retail.</span></p>

<p>The BF4 SP campaign issues weren't specific just to the One. I had my saves disappear or corrupt on the 360, One and PS4. If it's still occurring for people on the One you probably aren't going to find it working better elsewhere.</p>

<p>Still curious as to what caused the non saves.. I finished the SP on 360 on both easy and hard.. as well as on the X1 easy &amp; hard and not once did I loose anything... Also early on.. I never seen the issues people had with coding and lag and not being able
 to jump over a rock... &nbsp;Somehow I think a majority of it was just local issues with people expecting too much from a game.. not sure...</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I wouldn't say "absolutely superb" but instead very acceptable. It still has a few issues that are minor but not trivial none the less. The constant Yellow Notice for a new Unlock showing time and time again is one. Another would
 be the constant showing of Completed Assignments with a recent status notice at the end of the Match. It little things like this that are still annoying.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It was kinda the problem at Retail Launch that if enough small but as individual problems occur it lowers the over all quality of a Game. That I believe was BF4 worst problem. In the end it just makes for a frustrating experience.</span></p>

    <title>Vectorworks 2010 will not start on Windows 7 pro. after running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vectorworks 2010 will not start on Windows 7 pro. after running Outlook 2007.</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 pro on my Toshiba Satellite laptop.&nbsp; Everything is working great.&nbsp; I have all the latest drivers available.<br />
<br />
I purchased an upgrade to Vectorwork 2010 (<a href="http://www.nemetschek.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nemetschek.net</a>) when I upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; The program installs and runs&nbsp;great.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vectorworks runs&nbsp;until I&nbsp;start Outlook 2007.&nbsp; After running Outlook when I try to start
 Vectorworks I get a busy cursor for a few seconds and nothing happens.&nbsp; I do not get the program splash screen, any errors, nothing.&nbsp; I do not see the program running in the task manager.&nbsp; I have been working with Vectorworks support but they are out of ideas.&nbsp;
 I can create a new user account on my laptop and run Vecotworks in that new account without issue.&nbsp; As soon as I start Outlook 2007 in that new account, Vecotworks does not start.<br />
<br />
I have tried safe mode and get the same results.<br />
<br />
I cannot determine what interaction there is between Outlook and Vectorworks.&nbsp; Is there any startup diagnostic tool I can run to see where Vectorworks is failing?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<h2>            c&#58;&#92;....&#92;system32&#47;config&#47;system keeps gone missing or corrupt</h2>
                    hello everybody,<br />
<br />
i have windows xp (sp3) on a gigabyte (GA-945PL-S3) motherboard. <br />
so recently just before this file missing problem come up i noticed that windows freezes when opening folders . (i dont know if this freeze is related to the missing file problem or not .but i felt its good to mention it).<br />
and one day i was working as usual on windows suddenly the system crashes and reboot and i get this message (\system32/config/system missing or corrupt).<br />
so i format drive c: and did a fresh install of win xp and intalled the updated drivers. 1st day everything was okay and normal and the freeze is gone&nbsp; , but next day when i started winxp it crashes again and give me the same message .<br />
i've tried replacing the missing files with the same result. tried two different WinXP CD's with same result . so i figure its not an installation problem!<br />
<br />
the wired thing is the system works normally after installation in first day and i install the windows updates just fine. but the problem keeps showing up in the 2nd day (crash reboot and file missing) .i dont have any special programs on system just Firefox
 and vlc.<br />
<br />
i dont think its a virus because i scanned my pc with 3 different anti-virus programs with no results .<br />
which made me think is this a hardware problem ?<br />
i've checked and updated my Bios and they look fine !<br />
i've checked the hard drive and fined some bad sectors but i dont know if they are related to the problem !<br />
and one more thing i noticed on the startup boot screen this message lately (CpuID 0f49 patch id :0003) sometimes it appears and sometimes not.!<br />
<br />
sorry for the long story and thanks<br />
<br />

            Usually that message means that XP just can't find the file - probably due to some corruption in the NT File System (NTFS).&nbsp; File System corruption can occur from things like power interruptions, using the power button on your system while XP is running,
 aborted restarts, ungraceful shutdowns, etc.<br />
<br />
When your system is running normally, if it crashes or you locks up and you have to use the power button or unplug it to get it going again, you need to stop doing things like that and figure out what the real problem behind the crashes is and fix that or you
 will just keep having this problem.<br />
<br />
When you do see it, you can see if running a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) from the XP Recovery Console will straighten it out.&nbsp; That is alot easier than reinstalling XP, but until you find out why it is happening and fix the real problem, you will
 probably just see it again.<br />
<br />
If you check the HDD and are finding bad sectors, some could be for the reason listed above or it could be that your HDD is just starting to fail or has already failed and needs to be replaced.<br />
<br />
I don't think your message CpuID 0f49 patch id :0003 has anything to do with XP - it has to do with your Gigabyte GA-945PL-S3 motherboard so you might want to look in the Gigabyte help forums for ideas on that.<br />

    <title>Sound device disappeared after last MS update... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markswantkowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound device disappeared after last MS update...</h2>
                    <p>My external sound device [ Schitt Modi 2 ] has disappeared as a playback device on my desktop WIN 10 computer after a recent MS update, and I have tried everything to get it back with no results... &nbsp; This device is a stand-alone external USB DAC [digital
 to analogue converter] that sends a signal to my HI FI system so I can play my Pandora Radio on that system... This device always shows up on the 'playback device ' page, but is no longer there...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to restore my computer back a week or so, and the device showed up for a short time until my computer tried to redo the update that had been undone by the restore... So I'm pretty sure it was the MS update that was responsible for my Modi 2 disappearing...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help at all would be appreciated...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, regards, Mark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be due to an outdated driver. Since it worked fine when you did a system restore, and the issue reoccurred after the update, let’s try updating the sound driver. Check the device manufacturer’s website for an updated list of drivers compatible to
 the new version of Windows. Then check if it will work after updating the driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance. </p>

<p>The Modi 2 does not require a driver for normal operation; that is for 24 bit 96K. It does, however, have an extended setting for 24 / 192, and it does need a driver for that, which I have already tried to update... Note: When I tried to update the extended
 mode driver, the process was stopped by the following messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Please connect the Cmedia USB2.0 audio device [ did that ], then</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Audio device does not exist</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, essentially, the Modi 2 does not exist as far as the computer is concerned...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even in basic mode, which does not require drivers, the Modi does not show in my sound devices... It is not there...&nbsp; &nbsp;(m.)</p>

<p>Thank you for the update and sorry for the delayed response. If the above solution did not work, it can be that the device is not compatible to the new Windows update. We suggest contacting the manufacturer of the computer directly for hardware diagnostics,
 as it might be that the sound card is having issues with the compatibility of the new update and your sound device.

    <title>Third-party icons in the Sytem Tray are not appearing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vyper2112  say:</h3>
<h2>            Third-party icons in the Sytem Tray are not appearing.</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed that certain programs no longer display their system tray icons. I've tried editing the registry and restarting Explorer.exe as mentioned in other help articles, but all that did was reset all of the icons in the list to always show. I've included
 an image that illustrates a program which should have an icon and the tray area where the icon should be displayed, but is not. The program in question is System Mechanic Professional. There are others though, like the graphics adapter icon. I've searched
 all over and all I ever can find is the solution of deleting the registry entries and restarting explorer.exe. I'm at a loss.<br />
Possibly of note: I had a windows update fail and performed a system restore. I then used System Mechanic's registry restore function to go back about a week or two before the windows update error. This did not make my tray icons return.</p>

<div>I have win 7 Home Premium. My HDD is divided into&nbsp;<strong>C:Drive</strong>&nbsp;which
 has the OS and a<strong>B Drive</strong>&nbsp;which is an extended drive. It
 also has a&nbsp;<strong>Recovery Partitiotion</strong>. I shrunk some space from
 B drive which now shows up as Free Space within the extended drive before the B drive. I want to make a new Logical Drive from this Free space but get this error " there is not enough space on the disk to complete this operation". What do i do?</div>
