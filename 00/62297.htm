    <title>A Genuine Windows is not Genuine...&#63; But why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A Genuine Windows is not Genuine...&#63; But why&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased an HP-mini notebook which had Windows 7 Starter pre-installed on it. Now, not to mention it was a genuine windows. I got it crashed because of virus so I recovered my system image (because I didn't want to lose Genuine Windows even if it was
 Starter, because in Pakistan it is very difficult and costly to get a genuine software package). Now its the third time I recovered system image. It never asked me for genuine validation but now all of a sudden it says 'your windows is not genuine'. It is
 bound to be genuine because its the pre-installed version and I don't believe Hewlett-Packard are faking it. How to overcome this difficulty?<br />
<br />
Your help will be appreiated.,<br />

            <p>I've never seen ANY MS participant in the Answers forums who could properly read an MGADiag report.</p>
<p>The nearest exception was Darin Smith - who was 'let go' at the bginning of last month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recreating the Licensing store fixes less than 25% of the errors I see - and is possibly unneccessary in half of the ones it does fix, since a Key Change forces a rebuild anyhow.</p>

            <p>Which course are you doing?</p>
<p>If you want to learn some of the fundamentals of MGADiag -reading (from the school of hard knocks), have a look in the WGA forums at
<a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/genuine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/genuine</a></p>

            "Microsoft Support Professional" we know we're going to be doing premium tech support, but we don't know where we will fit into microsoft as of yet. That was the method we were instructed to take if the MGADiag failed. I do have all the internal info on
 the tool as well, so I have a good idea on how it works. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>(I don't suppose you could let me have the internal stuff? &lt;g&gt; - there's diddly in the public domain! I'd be quite happy to sign an NDA.)</p>
<p>If they are actually training people in MGADiag that's a very Good Thing!</p>
<p>FWIW, the reason that I said 'wrong order' in my inital post was simple....</p>
<p>There is no point attempting ot repair&nbsp; the licenisng store in a corrupted file system - so my usual order would be CHKDSK &gt; SFC &gt; Licensing Store - assuming that the Licensing Store was implicated at all (which most of the time, it isn't) - although I do
 take a shortcut and try the licensing store if the poster sems certain that there are no other problems.</p>
<p>Either way, it's always best to wait for the MGADiag results, or you could be making a poor situation worse.</p>

                    <p>I have a missing <strong>MSCOMCTL.OCX</strong> on my <strong>Windows 8.1</strong>. Could somebody explain to me how to fix/install/solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been playing this game and it plays perfectly, then the next day, this message shows up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Component 'MSCOMCTL.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also seen a lot of solutions to this problem for Windows 7 and lower but I don't seem to see any solutions to
<strong>Windows 8.1</strong>. Microsoft has these files for <strong>MSCOMCTL.OCX</strong> in their help sectionbut it's only compatible for Windows 7, XP, and even waaay down to 98. I'd appreciate any help. Also, could you dumb it down a little (for the one
 who'll answer)? Thanks in advance :D</p>

            <p><span>Hi Gerard,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>MSCOMCTL.OCX is a set of 32-bit controls that were provided with the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 programming environment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Go to this location- <strong>C:\Windows\SysWOW64</strong> directory and see if
<strong>MSCOMCTL.OCX</strong> file exist. If yes then follow the below steps: <br />
<br />
Open an <strong>elevated command prompt</strong> – In the start page type <strong>
Command Prompt</strong> in the <strong>Search box</strong>, <strong>right-click</strong> Command Prompt, and then
<strong>click Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
<strong>password</strong>, or click <strong>Allow.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When the black window opens with your command prompt, type this in:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>CD C:\Windows\SysWOW64 directory</span></strong></li><li><span>Press <strong>Enter</strong></span></li><li><span>Next Type - <strong>Regsvr32 MSCOMCTL.OCX</strong></span></li><li><span>Press<strong> Enter.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><span><br />
If you get a Window that pops up and says, "DllRegisterServer in mscomctl.ocx succeeded" then click
<strong>OK</strong> and then try to restart your system and check if you can play the game again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above steps do not work, then try to run the <strong>SFC</strong> (System File Checker)<strong> scan</strong> on the computer to fix the system file errors on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is <strong>SFC (System File Checker)?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>System File Checker</span></strong><span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To run <strong>SFC scan</strong>, follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Open an <strong>elevated command prompt</strong> - Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<strong>Search</strong>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to <strong>the lower-right corner of the screen</strong>, and then
<strong>click Search</strong>. Type <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the <strong>
Search box</strong>, <strong>right-click</strong> Command Prompt, and then <strong>
click Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
<strong>password</strong>, or click <strong>Allow.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Next follow the below steps to perform <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>1. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<strong>sfc /scannow. </strong></span><span>The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command will scan all protected system files, and replace corrupted files with a cached copy that is located in a compressed folder at
<strong>%WinDir%\System32\dllcache</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong>%WinDir%</strong> placeholder represents the Windows operating system folder. For example, C:\Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To know more about SFC scan you can refer to the link below:</span></p>

    <title>The Application Data folder for Microsoft Visual Basic Express could - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theasker099  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Application Data folder for Microsoft Visual Basic Express could not be created.</h2>
                    <p>
<strong>Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit</strong></p>
<p>
After installation of Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 Express and running the executable, the following message appears: Visual Basic 2010 Express The Application Data folder for Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 Express could not be created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Things I tried to solve this:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Fixing the APPDATA keys in</p>
<p>
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders (
<em>but they were already OK</em></strong><em>&nbsp;<b>)</b></em></p>
<p>
Getting full permissions on <b>C:\ProgramData</b> ( which I had full access to already )</p>
<p>
Getting full permissions on <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%</b> ( which I had full access to already )</p>
<p>
Running Windows update</p>
<p>
Running vbexpress.exe as Administrator</p>
<p>
None of these solutions worked.</p>
<p>
I DID notice that when I open vbexpress.exe ( in \Common7\IDE\ ) , it creates a folder in</p>
<p>
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft called 'VBExpress' ( which has blue font ),</p>
<p>
VBExpress contains a folder called '10.0' and 10.0 has a file named vspdmc.lock, with the content '{8603A3A2-D182-4916-BF8B-80A2C531F4D5}'. That is all I could really notice. I tried running Sysinternal tools but it caught more than 10 million events and counting
 so I kinda gave up on that. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you</p>

<h2>            How do I type in Russian &#47; Cyrillic&#63;</h2>
                    I'm a new Russian language student and would like to be able to type word docs in Russian. I have the letters stuck on the keyboard in the Russian standard and that's as far as I've gone.<br />
What next?<br />

<span>&gt; English in Word 2007 running on a Vista laptop configured with UK </span>
<br />
<span>&gt; regional settings, is this possible please? </span><br />
<br />
</span>Sure, no problem. Vista has Russian support out of the box. <br />
He just needs to install a Russian keyboard from "Control Panel" - "Clock <br />
Language and Region" - "Change keyboards or other input methods" <br />
(or "Control Panel" in "Classic view" - "Regional and Language Options", <br />
"Keyboards and Language" tab) <br />
"Change keyboards" button then "Add" button, select "Russian", then "OK" <br />
twice. <br />

<p>I have this error. It started when I tried to connect to Xbox Live. It prompted me to download the Xbox Live update so I clicked yes. After downloading the update from Xbox Live, it tried to apply the update then the screen went blank for a while and showed
 a message "System Update failed. Can't update your console. Please visit www.xbox.com/support" with a status code: 3151-396B-B380-0401-C000-0022. No matter how many times I restart my console, it tries to apply the update and then the message pops out from
 the start and freezes. Currently, I can't do anything to my xbox 360 and updates from pendrive don't response. &nbsp;Please help me solve this problem, thanks.</p>

 I tried doing the verifier and now I can not boot up. It goes directly to stopcode Driver Verifier detected violation. I have tried going back to previous point but it is not successful. I am able to bring it up in safe mode. I have uploaded zipped dmp files

            Hi carrie
<br />
<br />The minidump files indicate CLVirtualDrive.sys as the cause of your System Crashes
<br />
<br />You should uninstall any Cyberlink software you have installed on your PC and see if your system stabilizes. 
<br />
<br />If so, and you still want to run that software, check their website for an updated version and install that . .

<p>I am trying to install the update 1607 on my windows 10 pro system but it always stops at 93% after the second or third boot and then windows is restored to the previous version 1511,</p>
<p>I tried many ways to update : manually, by windows update or by installing the ISO file. when using the last method I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We couldn't install Windows 10</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Succeded yesterday after some learning. Using the MS customer support was worthless and the expert from Macecraft did not provide a solution. Numerous attempts with Windows Update Assistant and the ISO-file via media creation tool did fail - each time at
 93% and reported soomething like this: "0x8007042B - 0x4000D The installation was not successfull. An error occured in the phase SECOND-BOOT during the process MIGRATE-DATA" (translated from German).</p>
<p>The grunts from MS CS went through their 7 - 12 Q&amp;As and recommended a clean install. The expert went through several changes, trials with general tools and recommended to wait for MS to make changes. I tried out all the good advise on the net: SFC, DISM,
 etc.. Nothing helped.</p>
<p>I solved my problem with the following steps:</p>
<p>Stopped all non MS antivirus programs and cleaned them out of registry</p>
<p>Stopped all non MS processes via terminal &amp; msconfig</p>
<p>Stopped all autoruns via task-manager</p>
<p>Stopped windows update via terminal &amp; wuauserv</p>
<p>Deleted old installation files in C:=Windows&gt;SoftwareDistrubution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I came across a very detailed and helpfull explanation of the upgrade process: https://technet.microsoft.com/pt-br/itpro/windows/deploy/resolve-windows-10-upgrade-errors. This explains a number of key log-files for the process. In C: &gt; $WINDOWS.~BT
 &gt; Sources &gt; Panther there are the logs</p>
<p>setupact.log for the entire process</p>
<p>setuperr.log for the errors</p>
<p>MigLog.xml for the migration process</p>
<p>These files are very helpfull in finding out, what exact went wrong during the process. The migration-log exactly reported towards it's end with "success=failed" that there was a problem with the file Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime 1.3_1.3.23901.0 in the x64
 version on my machine.</p>
<p>With Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime being part/basis for various windowsapps (see C: &gt; programs &gt; WindowsApps) I used this guideline from GitHub https://gist.github.com/BradKnowles/bba232ebbe7c7fc02ccb to remove most of the WindowsApps, which included&nbsp;Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime
 1.3_1.3.23901.0. </p>
<p>After this removal the W10 AU via the update-assistant went through smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all cases, where the file Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime 1.3_1.3.23901.0 does not show up as the cause for the failure, it is recommended to study the 3 logs in detail. They report any other possible issue.

<p>Hello Edge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue involving the status of the account stating that the online status is unknown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you clarify what platform you're playing on, is this occurring on a Windows PC or an Xbox One console?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this message occur within the game itself, and does this error occur on any other games?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you maybe experiencing an issue with being able to sign in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our suggestion here is to attempt all variants of <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restarting the console</a></strong> if on an Xbox One, and if on a PC simply restart

<p>
</p><p>Clarify this information and let us know the results of the provided link.</p>

            <p>Hi neilmobley,</p>
<p>Do you notice this issue&nbsp;if you select any of the other Settings, are you unable to see the menu options? If you haven't already, restart your computer. If that does not help, complete the following steps to run an SFC scan.
</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Start screen, type <strong><em>command</em></strong>.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (If using a touchscreen press the<strong> Command Prompt</strong> box and drag down until you see a check mark in the upper right-hand corner)</li><li>Select <strong><em>Run as administrator</em></strong></li><li>At the command prompt, type <strong>SFC /scannow</strong> (there is a space between
<strong>C</strong> and <strong>/</strong>)</li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong></li></ol>
<p>Let us know if this works. </p>
        </p>

            ran the scan said everything was fine. no integrity issues. I am unable to see menu options unless I scroll over them on the left on the right I can only see the little blue on/off buttons but I cant see what it says also if I act like I am cutting (highlighting)
 I can see the letters and can read the descriptions

            I did the same and found no problem either. 100% integrity. I appear to have the exact same issue. Out of curiosity neilmobley, did you do a fresh install of windows 8 or did you save all the files? I saved my files. Maybe some process is in the way of
 it working properly?

I can confirm that the problem is caused by nvidia geforce display driver 310.33 BETA. After uninstalling it, the 'Change PC settings' menu is displayed fine.

<div>Unconfirmed. However, something interested happened whilst trying.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Uninstalled graphics driver, but while doing so there was a power surge and my computer shut down... 30 minutes later I managed to get into safe mode to complete uninstalling the driver (Couldn't boot normally into Windows 8).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I got back into Windows normally, the beta driver was automagically reinstalled (I'm also using 310.33, R130). So, I'm now using the beta drivers &amp; my PC Settings screen is back to normal.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I guess a normal reinstall works? Somehow?</div>

<h2>            Bluetooth - connect a mouse to pc</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have a Gateway M1629 running Vista Home Premium and the pc came with factory installed Bluetooth / wireless radio.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to connect a Bluetooth Mouse (Rocketfish RF-ABTMSE bluetooth wireless laser mouse)&nbsp; to the pc but can't seem to do so.&nbsp; I do not
 seem to be able to make the bluetooth discoverable.&nbsp; If I go to control panel and click the bluetooth devices there is no options tab to select in order to make sure the
<strong>Allow Bluetooth devices to connect to this computer</strong> check box is selected.<br />
<br />
When I open the Bluetooth Devices and click on bluetooth settings nothing happens and if I click on add a wireless device I get a screen to pair a wireless device but there is nothing listed there.<br />
<br />
I have checked out <br />
<span><strong>Troubleshoot problems with Bluetooth enabled devices:<br />
<span><strong>Troubleshoot problems with Bluetooth enabled devices:<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/11a74104-645d-40d4-b933-bde5d15537bb1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/11a74104-645d-40d4-b933-bde5d15537bb1033.mspx</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
I have checked the pc's reference guide and in order to turn it on I can just slide the switch located on the side of the laptop to the on position and an icon (little wireless radio tower) showing that the bluetooth is enabled and that icon is lit</strong>
</strong></span><span><strong><strong>.&nbsp; I can also turn it on by pressing the fn + f2 key<br />
<br />
I have also checked the windows mobility center and the wireless network is on.<br />
<br />
</strong></strong></span>How do I make sure that the Bluetooth device is set to search mode. I have read that in order to do so, I have to open the Bluetooth software installed on the computer and set it on SEARCH MODE or ADD a BLUETOOTH DEVICE.&nbsp; How do I do
 that?<br />
<br />
I did try contacting Gateway about this since the laptop is just under a year old but all they said was that to get help that support is fee based.&nbsp; If I had known that when buying a laptop I surely would not have purchased a Gateway.&nbsp; (emergency situation
 and needed to buy a pc immediately so did not get to research it first).<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p><span><span>Hi lnjr<span>&nbsp;
</span>,<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Answers Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>Is the device switched on when you try to search for the device?</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried installing the latest drivers for the device? If you haven’t tried that, please update the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may occur because the Bluetooth drivers that are provided by Microsoft support a different set of profiles than the drivers that are provided by
 some third-party vendors. The Microsoft-provided drivers are also signed and will therefore be installed instead of a third-party driver for supported Bluetooth adapters. The Vista OS will try to detect if a third-party driver is present. If the third-party
 driver is installed, the Microsoft-provided Bluetooth drivers will not install. This action makes sure that an existing configuration is not modified. If both provided drivers were installed, and the Bluetooth were connected to the computer, the Microsoft-provided
 driver would load because it is signed.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact the driver provider (the manufacturer) for your adapter. Follow these steps to find the driver provider:</span></p>
<p><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.</span><span>‌</span><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted fo</span>r an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Double-click Bluetooth Radios to expand that section. </span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Right-click the Bluetooth adapter (radio or transceiver device), and then click Properties.
</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click the Driver tab. </span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Next to Driver Provider, you will see either Microsoft or another provider's name. Contact that provider for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If nothing works you need to contact gateway or visiti their site for more answers
</span><span><a href="http://support.gateway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.gateway.com</span></a>

    <title>Scanning multiple pages into one PDF document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrb9019  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scanning multiple pages into one PDF document</h2>
                    
<p>I used to run a Laptop with Windows XP and have an all-in-one printer. With this I used to scan multiple page documents and file them all in one PDF file. Great.<br />
<br />
Now, last week I purchased a new Laptop with Windows 7 and suddenly find that this is no longer compatible with my printer - so my printer manufacturer doesn't support Windows 7 - therefore I cannot download their software....<br />
<br />
Yes, I looked around and found that there was a "scanning work around" (use Windows Scan and Fax) but find that I can only scan and then file one page at a time.</p>
<p>Is this correct? Is there a workaround? <br />
I would be really be grateful if you could let me know. <br />
Many thanks</p>

            I had the same issue but with a more current Brother printer.&nbsp; They supplied new drivers but not a new version of the "PaperPort" software that supported the merging of scans into a single pdf.&nbsp; In my case I was able to install the new drivers from their
 site, then the old version of PaperPort from my original Brother disks, and it worked as before.&nbsp; If that isn't an option there are a number of free utilities that will allow you to merge multiple pdfs into one pdf.&nbsp; It isn't as convenient since you first
 have to scan to individual pdf files and then merge&nbsp; them later.&nbsp; Search the internet for "merge pdfs" and you will find a number of free options.

    <title>Slow Performance When Laptop Plugged In - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zaharimarinov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Performance When Laptop Plugged In</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I've read many forums(including this one) looking for a solution, but I still haven't found one.<br />
Recently my original laptop charger broke, when there was a black out, while it was plugged in. It stopped charging. I was too greedy(and busy) and didn't turn off the laptop, so I drained the battery completely. The other day I went to the laptop repair shop
 and the technicians bought a new charger. They said "This one is perfect", even though it wasn't the original one. It was a replacement one. After 2-3 days I decided to upgrade to Windows 10 Insider Preview and also update my drivers... A week later while
 watching a youtube video, I noticed, that the fps is lower than usual(until then I haven't have started any heavier programs). I plugged out the charger and the fps went up. I opened task manager and noticed, that when the charger was plugged in the processor
 speed was ~0.79GHz and when plugged out it immediately rose up to its maximum speed of 2.4GHz. I looked up the internet and I played around with power options, tried everything, including maximising maximum and minimum processor speed in advanced power plan
 options, when on "High Performance", but still the same. I started the laptop with the battery out, charger in, but the performance was still bad. The heat is not the problem, because I have a cooler and the change in processor speed is very fast(&lt;1s) After
 2 weeks of searching and trying with no success I decided to post this question. I'm still not sure if the problem is in the charger, or it is something to do with the software.<br />
Laptop: Lenovo G510<br />
Processor:&nbsp;Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4000M CPU @ 2.40GHz<br />
RAM: 4GB <br />
BIOS Version/Date:&nbsp;LENOVO 79CN49WW(V3.08), 6.8.2014<br />
(still not sure if the GPU is also affected)

            Thank you for your support! :)<br />
The maintenance definitely fixed some things, but that was not enough to restore the processor's power. Then I decided to call a friend and use his charger(he has the same laptop) and everything was OK(kinda...) :) So... it is time for me to buy a new charger
 and close this question :)

    <title>XBOX LIVE Gold Membership - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kefdude  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX LIVE Gold Membership</h2>
                    
<p>So, i would like to upgrade my account, but i can't. Tried to get the deal in dashboard (the 60% off), but it said the transaction could not be completed for some reason i dont know. Then i tried to pay for the membership in the web, but that didnt work
 either - said something about my credit card number being wrong, but it wasnt.</p>
<p>Then i started thinking that it could be my region. Because i live in Estonia but i couldnt choose it for my region and therefore picked the closest thing to it - Finland. Now everything is in Finnish and i reckon the payment doesnt work because the card
 was issued in Estonia... or what?</p>
<p>Im not happy about the region thing at all... why is it so messed up? Its like we dont get xboxes here &nbsp;=S</p>

            <p>That is exactly what the problem is. &nbsp;You live in one area and the deal is only available in the other. &nbsp;The reason the card does not work is because it has and Estonia address and you are trying to purchase something in Finland. </p>

<p>anyways generally you want to purchase the correct cards for your region.</p>
<p>but you do not live in an xbox live region. you could always buy finland xbox live cards but you cannot get that deal without living or having a finland creditcard</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Activation Error code&#58; 0xC004C003 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim knipe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Error code&#58; 0xC004C003</h2>
                    Windows 10 Activation Error code: 0xC004C003 - I received a "Free" Windows 10 activation offer from Microsoft but after installation I attempted to Activate it and received the error message listed stating the Key Code was "blocked". No other software
 changes were made to my system and I see from other responses I'm not alone. I'm particularly frustrated since one of the "solutions" is "buying" a new activation code for $119. Had I known this before "upgrading", the upgrade would never have been done. Sounds
 like a deceptive practice to me. Next step - contact the "BBB" or the PA Attorney Generals Office.

<p>ok...the exact SAME ISSUE. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did EVERYTHING according to the handy-dandy Microsoft instructions. Received my free upgrade through an ACTIVATED Windows 8.1 Pro installed on my home PC. THEN I did a clean install....after the upgrade was activated of course. And, SURE ENOUGH....I got
 the "Type in your product key" message we were assured we would not get if we did all these ridiculous steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I now get&nbsp;Error code: 0xC004C003. now it says that my Product Key has been Blocked by YOU. I am dying to find out why. This should be entertaining to hear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have noticed that Microsoft can't seem to afford telephones any more. Or we....you know....the customers.....are not important enough to provide that information to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very Shady business model you all now have.</p>

            I was in the Insider Program since Feb. At Build 10162 I could no longer update, then was told to download the Windows 10 rtm, put in on usb stick &amp; upgrade from there.&nbsp; After the upgrade the system was activated &amp; All was fine until a MS update 2 weeks
 ago for another Insider Build (that was not labeled as such) crashed my pc with--bad system config.&nbsp; After 2 weeks of trying, gave up and did a clean install.&nbsp; Shouldn't have been a problem since MS says&nbsp;my system is recorded by them but after an easy installation
 its been telling me to 'Activate Windows' for several days.&nbsp; Incase anyone is not aware of the bad system config error, there is absolutely nothing you can do on many pc's that will bring Windows 10 back to life.&nbsp; System Restore magically loses any &amp; all restore
 points so that's useless, some have had success with the cmd prompt &amp; moving some lines that way but it didn't work for me.&nbsp; Startup repair quits with an error, etc.&nbsp; Abou

 is because the activation is only for upgrade, and only for 1 year, after the one year if you want to continue to use Win 10, you will have to pay for it, the win 10 upgrade is actually just a free 1 year trial period. I have the complete conversation from
 Microsoft for anyone who would like to see it</span>

<p>Dave, sounds like Cheryl was the same person I chatted with who didn't know what&nbsp; they were talking about. &nbsp;There has been so much false info put out by users but it's even more troubling when MS can't even put a simple line on a screen to their frontline
 responders.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is--if you start out doing a clean install of the public release of Win10 you will not be activated. &nbsp;If you upgrade and wait for it to activate, you can then do a clean install if you desire as MS activation servers record your system.
 &nbsp;I did this myself when the RTM came out and all was fine until Windows crashed &amp; I got a 'bad system config error' and nothing would work. &nbsp;Eventually decided to bite the bullet and do a clean install and now it won't activate--even though Windows.old has
 my previous configuration on the hard drive. &nbsp;It's no wonder MS doesn't want to hire tons of&nbsp; phone support as they just read off the screen when you tell them what your issue is. &nbsp;If they come across something that's too in depth, they tell you they're "doing
 more research" which is corporate-speak for they're trying to get in touch with someone who knows what they're talking about.</p>
<p>So again--if you UPGRADED and were activated, you CAN do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was from an email from Gabe Aul but since my pic crashed, I lost all of those informative emails I had. &nbsp;In the future I'll be sure to take a picture with my more reliable IPad so I can save this kind of important info forever. &nbsp;BTW, when I mentioned
 Gabe Aul to the MS chat person that was helping me, she had no clue who that was. &nbsp;Goes to show the intelligence of the people giving you support.</p>

            <p>If you can figure out now, here is the full conversation from Microsoft support,</p>
<p>
</p><div>Hi, thanks for visiting Answer Desk! I'm Cherry L.</div>
<div>7:59 am</div>
<div>hi</div>
<div>7:59 am</div>
<div>May I have your first name to address you properly?</div>
<div>7:59 am</div>
<div>dAVE</div>
<div>7:59 am</div>
<div>Dave, how may I help you today?</div>
<div>7:59 am</div>
<div>I am receiving the error code Error code: 0xC004C003 after having to do a clean install of win 10</div>
<div>8:00 am</div>
<div>I’m really sorry to hear that.</div>
<div>8:00 am</div>
<div>the computer orriniginaly was upgraded to win to from Win 7</div>
<div>8:01 am</div>
<div>May I know, how did you installed the Windows 10?</div>
<div>8:01 am</div>
<div>from thumb drive</div>
<div>8:01 am</div>
<div>You did a clean installation?</div>
<div>8:02 am</div>
<div>yes</div>
<div>8:02 am</div>
<div>Ohhh, Actually David, doing a clean installation for Windows 10 is not supported for the free upgrade.</div>
<div>8:03 am</div>
<div>In your case you need to have a License for Windows 10.</div>
<div>8:03 am</div>
<div>If you want to have a License for Windows 10 I can process it for you :)</div>
<div>8:04 am</div>
<div>so Microsoft gives free upgrade, to those that have win 7 8 or 8.1, and if there is a problem and have to do clean install they have to pay for the upgrade</div>
<div>8:04 am</div>
<div>Is that actually Free?</div>
<div>8:05 am</div>
<div>Yes David, For you to have the free upgrade you need to follow the right path of upgrading to Windows 10</div>
<div>8:05 am</div>
<div>And that is using the Windows Updates and not doing a clean installation.</div>
<div>8:06 am</div>
<div>so eventually everyone that has the free upgrade will have to pay for win10.</div>
<div>8:06 am</div>
<div>For those who did a clean installation only</div>
<div>8:07 am</div>
<div>You need to follow the right path for you to have the free upgrade.</div>
<div>8:07 am</div>
<div>After 2016 when you do not give the free upgrade and they need to reinstall windows. they will have to pay for win 10 if they want to continue using it</div>
<div>8:08 am</div>
<div>Yes, because the free currently free upgrade now is only for 1 year.</div>
<div>8:09 am</div>
<div>then it really is not free is it?</div>
<div>8:09 am</div>
<div>And after 1 year, if you want to continue the Windows 10, you need to have a license for it.</div>
<div>8:10 am</div>
<div>For 1 year YES</div>
<div>8:10 am</div>
<div>But after 1 year, its not free.</div>
<div>8:10 am</div>
<div>so basically Microsoft is only giving the win10 to customers for a 1 year free trial</div>
<div>8:11 am</div>
<div>Yes David.</div>
<div>8:11 am</div>
<div>then what is the point of the customers to even want to upgrade to win 10</div>
<div>8:12 am</div>
<div>So now, would you like to have the License for Windows 10 for you to activate your Windows?</div>
<div>8:12 am</div>
<div>No, I theink I will just go back to Win 7</div>
<div>8:12 am</div>
<div>think</div>
<div>8:12 am</div>
<div>Okay..</div>
<div>8:12 am</div>
<div>Is there anything else?</div>
<div>8:12 am</div>
<div>I guess not, I think the free upgrade is just false advertisement.</div>
<div>8:13 am</div>
<div>I thought false advertisement was illegal.</div>
<div>8:14 am</div>
<div>No David its not illegal.</div>
<div>8:15 am</div>
<div>&nbsp;I am sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you.</div>
<div>8:15 am</div>
<div>Hope you understand David.</div>
<div>8:15 am</div>
<div>You did a clean installation that why you cant get the free upgrade for 1 year.</div>
<div>8:16 am</div>
<div>No this is only going to give Microsoft more of a bad reputation</div>
<div>8:16 am</div>
<div>and if I install win7 again, after 1 year if I want to keep win10 I will have to pay for it</div>
<div>8:17 am</div>
<div>Yes David, because windows 10 is free for 1 year only.</div>
<div>8:17 am</div>
<div>so ether way your word free upgrade is actuall free trial, not free upgrade</div>
<div>8:18 am</div>
<div>Its the same thing David :)</div>
<div>8:19 am</div>

            Apparently you're not listening, or you don't know who Gabe Aul is. &nbsp;I'll say this again, whether you were in the Insider Program or not this is the way it works---if you successfully upgrade to Windows 10 and it was ACTIVATED you could then do a clean
 install whenever you liked because MS records the hardware info from your pc. &nbsp;Read what others are saying--most who are having this issue DID upgrade AND were activated yet they are still having this happen. &nbsp;In my case, I was in the Insider Program and upgraded
 to the RTM and it was activated. &nbsp;I know this because under the activation section of Windows 10 it said ACTIVATED. &nbsp;If it didn't say that I wouldn't be here.

    <title>Can&#39;t get a refund for buying the same content twice. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dreamchaser&#10004;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get a refund for buying the same content twice.</h2>
                    So I already owned the Destiny 2 and all DLC game from launch. Then recently bought the Forsaken Season Pass but thought it contained the Forsaken DLC along with it when it was on sale. Come to realize that it didn't and the season pass was useless. I
 requested a refund and after a couple of days waiting for a response I seen and bought the Destiny 2 Complete Package that contained the Forsaken DLC and Season Pass on sale in XBox store. I was turned down for the original season pass purchase and not sure
 why I couldn't get a credit refund. Did I do something wrong in my request or is Microfoft that much of a crook when it comes to thier most loyal customers? My argument is that the Forsaken season pass never said it does not contain the actual DLC. So now
 I'm stuck with paying for the two that are the same content..

            Hi. You can only get a refund once per account. There is a policy that a refund is only issued once.

            If you requested a refund using the refund link here https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund and you were refused, then you can reply to the email that was sent to appeal against it. Just explain why
 you want the refund and provide the order numbers (can be found on account.microsoft.com), and hopefully, they will issue the refund.

<p>umm... its tricky,&nbsp; because any content added to the store by the publisher/developer is controlled by the publisher/developer, (including the information of what the content will have) right. Then also because, all purchases you want to make in the Microsoft
 store are controlled by you. Microsoft, in my words, just tells you that said content, chosen to be purchased, set up by the game developer, whether or not it gives anything to you, wont be refundable. After that being said choosing to proceed with the purchase
 would then mean that, even if the content you are purchasing, whether it can give you all the content for that game ever, or instead give everything you already own in-game, is something you completely have agreed to pay. I'm sure if Microsoft had the power
 to revoke your progress in said season pass to give you that credit they would, but any progress, achievements, perma-unlocks, history, or any in game experience is controlled by the game Devs, and that would be the only satiable way to give credit back, right?
 I mean the season pass had some content and the DLC had other, so then if all that was wanted was said DLC, anything included in the game pass would have to be also refunded, no? That's why I say its tricky, because in the customer service industry that would
 be completely wrong, but in the entertainment industry, its fair, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I don't think you did anything wrong for asking, and
</span>I am not completely sure, but in my advice, to recieve the credit refund you are searching for, you might find it be better handled by the actual game developer/publisher, who added said content to the Microsoft store and didnt make it clear on what
 was being sold. To me its just on who to ask, rather than what.</span></p>

<h2>            Trying to restore previous password reset in error</h2>
                    Because of the hideous cross contamination between skype and microsoft I thought I had forgotten my skype password, not realising it was my password for my lap top too, so I changed it. I didn't want to change it, and now I want to restore it from this
 awful temporary one I had to make up in a hurry. I would like to speak to a human being who can further my request sanely and without disambiguation. Thankyou.

            This is not a question that can be answered to my satisfaction. I now know this and am humbled. Of course I realise I'm only a customer, and I realise it is physically impossible for somebody to press a short sequence of keys on my behalf, although having
 worked in an office myself I can conceive of it being theoretically possible. And I realise that this disconnect between my beliefs and reality in itself is indicative of the very real loss of control we have experienced in the latter part of the twentieth
 century, even while indicative of the violent change that must inevitably come from this constant stressor. But I also realise that the United States Corporation has led the charge here, and I also realise that MS is not only the most powerful entity on the
 planet, it is also inhuman, and uninterested in our human desires and needs. It is not interested that I spent several hours over two days trying to revive my Skype account, only to lose my one element of control over my world, my password, to be tricked into
 a second top up of skype before it offered a way to restore my existing credit, and having to search endless forums for answeres to a question so dumb nobody bothers to ask it, which makes me feel really good about myself, eventually having to uninstall yet
 another unasked for invasion by chrome; it's like a horny little dog that one, I look round for five minutes and there it is again busy humping my leg. I also realise more profoundly that I must make it my remaining life's work to change my operating system
 on my three computers to shareware and get a cantenna and steal internet, broadcasting endlessly about the alternatives to being under the heel of a giant boot all the time. Don't you find it depressing? I used to find it depressing, then I discovered New
 Wonderclean, it's almost as good as having a life. I now live on a small farm halfway up an inacessible track halfway up a large mountain. I get my own water and electricity, grow much of my own food, I am surrounded by prolific wildlife and experience some
 of the highest air quality in the developed world. Amidst the chaos and disorder of the breakdown of society, surrounded by the violent resistance to the march of acquisitive capitalism, I am having literally the best time I have ever had. But do you think
 I can have the password I want?<br />

<p>I followed your instructions, everything up to capcha, then there was no option but to change to yet another new password. I don't want a new password, that's the whole point, I want my old password, I only changed it then because the microsoft site is the
 same as the skype, which is the same as my login for this lap top, which I didn't realise. If I had I wouldn't have changed the thing. Jeez, one password AND login for all three, no wonder you guys are paranoid, who thought that up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then this site went weird and it took me several tries to get this to take a reply, it kept referring me to the microsoft login page asking me to log in, then saying I was already logged in on the drop down. Nothing is easy with MS, it used to be, it isn't
 anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just saying is all...</p>

<p>I did what you said and i getting the same results. In my system restore i got about 25 things saying&nbsp;<span>windows modules installer. I deleted all but one. In my task manger&nbsp;</span><span>windows
 modules installer take up between 15% to 25% of my cpu cycle. All the drivers are up to date and windows is up to date. I didn't have this problem with the old hard drive. It started right after i put the new one in and reinstalled&nbsp;&nbsp;windows 10. Like it's trying
 to install something it can't over and over. If i end task it will stop for like 5 minutes the restart back up. I scan for virus and stuff and nothing. The only stuff i put on there is ccleaner and fortnight and world of warcraft and i got auslogic disk defrag
 too and of course chrome and java.&nbsp;&nbsp;When i first installed windows i let windows format and setup hard drive since my laptop has secure boot on it. Here the spec of my laptop if it will help.</span></p>

                    <p>Using Win10 Pro 32 bit version 1709 build 16299.192 on an old laptop. </p>
<p>I thought that this build provided the Meltdown patch but on checking with&nbsp; Ashampoo<sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup> Spectre Meltdown CPU Checker I find that the Meltdown flaw isn't patched. (hoping that dell will put out a bios update to fix the Spectre flaw but
 I doubt they will).</p>

            Do you have an AMD or Intel processor?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click System then look under Device specifications.
<br />
<br />There are reports of the patch saying its failed, but its actually installed.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />See if KB4056892 is installed or not. 
<br />

<p>The laptop has an Intel core 2 duo cpu and KB4056892 is reported as being successfully installed.</p>

</p><p>Well MS has put out a new Cumulative Update KB4073291 Windows 10 v1709 Build 16299.201 -

</p><p>After applying it this is what I get:</p>

<h2>            Window update error 80070005 &#38; device manager driver update - access denied</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three optional updates keep failing to install with the error code 80070005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2709981)</li><li>Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2830477)</li><li>Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2592687)</li></ul>
<p>From a bit or research this generally has to do with permissions but I am using an administrator profile and I was able to install today the update Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2929437).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Windows Update Troubleshooter but to no avail. I did a quick scan with both Windows Defender and my Norton 360 software and no malware turned up, so I am at a bit of a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately, I am also trying to install driver for a Logitech M175 wireless mouse and the driver for the USB receiver wouldn't install. I went into device manager to update the driver but it tells me that the driver was located but couldn't install because
 "access was denied". A little yellow exclamation mark shows up with the USB receiver entry in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume the two issues are related but I can't seem to locate a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine is a Toshiba Satellite Pro L650 notebook with Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running <strong>Microsoft Security Scan </strong>in the solutions section of this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968003/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968003/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not infected, then try downloading each update separately. To find each update, type the KB number in Google, followed by Windows 7 x64.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the update installer from the hidden Administrator account in Windows. To do this, open an elevated command prompt, and type in
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Log off, and you'll see the account. Note that there is no password.</p>
<p>Install the updates in that account, once you're finished, disable the account by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open an elevated command prompt</p>
<p>2. Type in <strong>net user administrator /active:no</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ahmad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a full Microsoft Security Scan and it turned up no infected files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the hidden administrator account method you suggested and it worked for update KB2709981 but not for the other two. I tried the other two updates individually via the hidden admin account also but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem shows itself when my notebook shuts down and Windows configures both updates on the restart. Both updates configure to 30% but then state configuring the updates failed and that it reverting back to the old setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, do you have any ideas about connecting the Logitech mouse problem I am having?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>These updates add the new features of Remote Desktop 8.0 in Windows 8 to Windows 7 Professional and above. If you do not use Remote Desktop in a corporate environment, there is no need to install these updates. They are optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Logitech Mouse, unfortunately, I do not know what's going on. I do know however, that the two issues are not related. The access is denied issue is registry-related, and might be a little complicated. I'm sorry I couldn't help you with that issue
 :(</p>

<p>Just posting here to confirm I have seen another case of this, and it appears to be since some Windows updates done on 10-11th of April. Since that time, any new driver installations fail with "Access Denied" and Windows Updates fail also. I would suggest
 that while the solution might be different for each, they are, in fact, related in the cause of the issue.</p>

            <p>I might just add that this isnt just new devices: if I take a working USB device, and plug it into a new port, it will attempt to install the existing driver for the new port and fail with 'access denied', even with default microsoft drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All driver installations fail.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Error code 80070005 is displayed for the updates when they do not install. The updates will sometimes say installed and then on restart it goes to 30% and fails. It says reverting.</p>

            <p>Hi Darcy,</p>
<p>I would recommend you first backup your computer. Then afterwords, perhaps try a system restore to the date before the updates that caused the issue? This didnt work for me, perhaps because system restore was messed up by the same problem, but you might
 have more luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO Other than someone from Microsoft debugging what went wrong, the most straightforward way to fix is a format. Perhaps we can get some more input for someone more experienced here?</p>

            I can't even back up because the computer wont accept my portable hard disk (the USB problem). &nbsp;I guess I could use a DVD?
