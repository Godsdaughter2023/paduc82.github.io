ashraf al kharabsheh</a>. Is there any error message when you try&nbsp;tapping the attention required? You may try checking if your phone system apps are all updated by going to
<span>Store&gt;Menu&gt;Downloads and updates&gt;Check for updates. Also, try rebooting the phone by pressing and holding both power and volume down keys simultaneously for 10-15 seconds. If the issue still persists, try uninstalling the apps and reinstalling it again.
 Let us know the outcome. </span></p>

 should have your phone turned on. Press and hold the <strong>volume down </strong>
and <strong>Power </strong>buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts. Please note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest to try uninstalling and installing your Twitter and LinkedIn Account. You might also want to try checking if your using a correct email address or user name as well as the password. The issue might be with the account.</p>

    <title>PowerPoint will not save to external drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charles radanovich  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint will not save to external drive</h2>
                    <div>
Hello all,</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I'm looking for advice on a perplexing problem.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I'm running Dropbox on my iMac, OS 10.8.5.</div>
<div>
I'm using VMWare to give me virtual Windows 7 on the PC side. Using PowerPoint 2010.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I have been keeping my Dropbox folder on the Mac desktop and sharing it with Windows via VMWare for the past 2 years without any problems. But as my Dropbox has grown (it nearly exceeds the 1T size of my Mac hard drive), I've been using Selective Sync to save
 space.This has worked fine except that when I need to access old projects I have to re-sync them and that takes time. My Dropbox has unlimited storage, but my computer does not!</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I thought I could solve that problem by using a new external LaCie 3T drive for my Dropbox files. I purchased one and formatted it for Fat-32 which is not recommended by Dropbox but according to LaCie, is the format to use when sharing between PC and Mac. The
 tech support at Dropbox said it should work ok as Fat-32 (on a MacBook Pro, I have an NTSC LaCie drive connected to the PC side, but I cannot write files from the Mac, only read them).</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I re-located my Dropbox to the external drive following Dropbox instructions and it worked fine although it took a few days as my former selective sync settings were no longer being used.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Here's my problem: I shared the Dropbox folder via VMWare and checked all my share setting both on the PC and Mac side. I have full permissions to read and write with my normal log on. I can read and write Adobe files to the external drive, but PowerPoint documents
 can only be read, not saved to the external drive.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I can save them to my PC desktop and then copy/move them to the external, but I cannot save directly to the external drive. As soon as I try, I get a message saying there is an error accessing the file (showing the full path to the drive/folder etc.). If I
 try a second time, it changes the file to read only and tells me to save it under a new name, but even that doesn't work. When I give the file a new name, I get the same sequence of messages.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I have been through all the security options within PowerPoint, but nothing seems to work. Oddly enough, I can open and re-save older format PPT files, just not PPTX files. I also can save other Office documents, so this is definitely a PowerPoint issue.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Before I give up and go back to my old setup with Dropbox on my Mac desktop, I wanted to check to see if anyone on this forum might have any ideas about this.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Thank you in advance,</div>
<div>

            I am answering my own question.
<div><br />
<div>After much trial and error with no satisfactory results, I installed PowerPoint 2013 and am now able to save to my external drive. Not the solution I was looking for, but it works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I checked all the security settings and they look the same between the 2010 and 2013, so I'm at a loss as to why this occurred to begin with, or why it works with the new version.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If anyone has thoughts on this, I'd still appreciate the insight.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards.</div>

    <title>2700 Classic &#47; Series 40 - Missed Call &#47; Missed Message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marina75---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            2700 Classic &#47; Series 40 - Missed Call &#47; Missed Message Notification</h2>
                    
<p>Hello from Germany!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with my new 2700 Classic phone. After a few seconds the screen is completely dark and there is no information about a missed call or a missed short message... You always have to hit a button to show the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any hint to solve this problem or does anybody knows a Java-Soft, that will indicate a missed call/message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Series 60 there is a very good soft "Remind Me" - it can notify the owner by light- or sound-signals - but there is no version for Series 40 Mobile Phones...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me - thanks in advance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marina</p>

<p>Hello jimmy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thx for your reply!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no option on my 2700 classic for lightning the dpad and there is no indicator light at the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you know if there is a hint to deactivate the deep standby (the screen is completely black) - so you can have a look on the "desktop" of the phone without clicking on the pad ... and see the notifications on the screen...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back on this matter but as my question states it is the<strong> folders
</strong>that are gone not any emails.&nbsp; I am referring to the personal <strong>folders</strong> that I have created to store emails in.&nbsp; I was just on my Hotmail account on Friday and on Saturday the account was no longer a "Hotmail" account it was a "Outlook"
 account.&nbsp; Everything was different and <strong>all of my folders </strong>were missing.&nbsp; The only folders on the left side were:&nbsp; Inbox, drafts, junk, deleted and sent.&nbsp; I had created probably 20 plus folders that I used almost every day.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did end up chatting with Microsoft Helpdesk and was told that they would do a deep scan and get back to me in 24 - 48 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, fingers crossed they can retrieve the folders!</p>

</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us. Please be informed that once an email folder has been deleted or lost, there is no way to recover it. What you can do is to manually&nbsp;recreate it. Also Outlook.com is the new interface for Hotmail, emails and other folders

<p>
</p><p>Again thanks for your input.&nbsp; The folders and all contained emails were indeed lost in the transition.&nbsp; I was hoping the missing folders (which contained many emails&nbsp;I wanted to keep) could be recovered "intact" but I am guessing created email folders aren't
 on the server, just the emails that they contain are.&nbsp; Am I correct in thinking this?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be watching for an answer to my server question....</p>

            The join is done when you email from the address (in gmail for example) which is listed as the primary email address in Facebook. Let's be honest, outlook.com caches the picture which will come back no matter what you do. I haven't tried de-activating
 my Facebook account yet that would be a radical step but I don't believe it would make a difference to an outlook account that already had cached the picture. This is May 2014 and I just discovered it for myself, amazing that outlook.com has done nothing about
 the problem. It's a security issue because they are caching information forever. If you disable third-party that does't stop anybody else for enabling the same thing in their account. They could see the picture you had at some point in time put on Facebook,
 but now do not wish to be public. &nbsp;I may run a test and see if even a newly created outlook account could access the picture - which would mean it is cached for every user of outlook.com in the world to see. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbs

            <p>Thanks for following up on this. There was a time lag but finally Outlook stopped showing my Facebook picture.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, I was sending a message from a gmail address that I forgot I had given to Facebook as a primary email address. I wasn't using Facebook I was using a gmail account for sending emails. Facebook requires a primary email address but I had assumed
 that was for communication between myself and Facebook. Since Edward Snowden there are a lot of people that don't want Outlook to be able to query Facebook with their email address and obtain their picture, and I am in that number.</p>

    <title>Ipad Will Not Sync OneNote with OneNote online or Mac version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alseattle_680  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ipad Will Not Sync OneNote with OneNote online or Mac version</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a large file on my iPad that I was adding PDFs and marking up in OneNote on my iPad. It was syncing well between my Mac and my iPad. However, i think that it started to not update the two versions and eventually has become too far apart so that the
 iPad version will no longer sync to OneNote online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked and my other notes/sections can still sync well. I have tried to copy the iPad note to a different section in hopes that this would reload it and save a new copy. It will try for awhile and then say that it cannot copy or move it and that
 I need to make sure that I have all my files synced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried letting the iPad sync all night uninterrupted in hopes that this would allow it to fix itself, but it never does. When i try to copy the OneNote&nbsp;iPad note to a different section, it tries for about ten minutes, then OneNote fails and I have
 to reload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to log out of my iPad and log back in. This has not allowed it to sync. I have tried to log out of my Mac OneNote and reload, and this has not solved the problems. I wondered if maybe there were "old" versions being saved in my iPad that were
 preventing the upload, but I am not allowed to access these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned about losing all the work on my iPad OneNote section as it has extensive notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi alseattle_680,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for all the trouble it has caused. May I ask whether the issue persists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since other notes/sections can sync without any issues, I think we could focus on the problematic pages. If you still cannot sync the pages, here are some suggestions you could try first:</p>
<p>1. Copy the sections to a new notebook.&nbsp; If copy/move within the notebook not working, you could try a new one.</p>
<p>2. If copy section does not work, I think the best solution is to copy all the content within the pages that fail to sync and paste them to a new notebook. This may take an amount of time but it should be able to sync the notes and you could edit and merge
 them again in OneNote Online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to share any updates with us at your convenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. I had reposted this question and received a response but alas I am still having troubles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All your suggestions are things that I have tried. I cannot copy/move outside of the section in question as Onenote for the iPad will shut down after thinking for a few minutes. I was able to get it to copy within the same section, but it still would not
 sync even after allowing it to try overnight uninterrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi alseattle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If copying sections cannot work, could you copy the content such as text and images within the pages and paste them to other pages or notebooks? Will these content sync in a new workbook?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since it is not feasible to open the notebook cache on the iPad, I think copying the content is the way we have left. Maybe double tab the text and click Select All would help?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;alseattle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you could try adding some content into the pages see if that forces the syncing process, such as a line of text. Other than that, there is nothing we can do from our end. Sorry for all the trouble.</p>

            Adding content does not seem to force it to sync. It tries, but fails every time. Is there no other options that i can try? Is there a way to export onenote files from ipad that are not pdfs?

<h2>            Forced update to Office 365 form Mac Office 2008, no longer able edit files</h2>
                    I have had MS Office for Mac 2008 for years, and I've always installed the updates without a problem. However, today I installed an update, and now I can't even edit my own documents. It's forcing me sign in for my free month of Office 365, and then I
 have to pay after that? WTF? Why can't I still use my Office products and edit my docs on my mac the way I always have been able to without having to pay?

<p><span>I've seen several reports of this in the past few days. I suspect this is an attack and is not legitimate.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Office 2008 has been discontinued for years. There haven't been any updates for a long, long time. There are no recent updates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All 2008 licenses are perpetual and do not expire. You can continue using Office 2008 forever as long as you or Apple don't change hardware or Mac OS in a way that breaks it. So far, Apple has broken only the installer, which no longer runs in current
 versions of Mac OS X.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest that anyone using Office 2008 turn off AutoUpdate. To do this, open Microsoft Word 2008, go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates. This launches AutoUpdate app. Set AutoUpdate to Manual and then close AutoUpdate.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Next, make sure your suite is up to version 12.3.6 by going to the Word menu and choosing About Word. If you're not up to 12.3.6 you can download the updater here:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36897</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Finally, if you received the pop-up informing you that you must update, don't fall for it. You don't have to update, and I suspect they are taking you to an illegitimate site for getting Office 2106 for Mac. If you do want to update, buy Office 2016
 as either a permanent license or via an Office 365 subscription (my personal recommendation because Office 2016 is nearing the end of its life) from a legitimate vendor such as Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, Walmart.com or any of thousands of other legitimate vendors.
 Also, check to make sure your hardware and Mac OS versions support Office 2016 before spending any money on it. See system requirements (below).</span></p>

<h2>            Hacked Outlook Email Account</h2>
                    <p>I have been told that my Outlook Email account was hacked into because I cannot access my email account.&nbsp; (When I typed in the word hot mail.com, mail was spelled "maill.)"&nbsp; I tried several times and received a strange message that asked me to enter a security
 code.&nbsp; I don't know what this message means.&nbsp; I don't have a security code. When I called Hotmail Customer Service I was told that it would cost $120.00 or $70.00 to get my password recovered by a level three technician.&nbsp; Is there someone who can help me recover
 my email password and email messages without a charge?</p>

    <title>Usage of a PIN number is not an option in login screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Usage of a PIN number is not an option in login screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello all. </p>
<p>I have installed Windows 10 Tech Preview yesterday and applied all the available updates (today). Because my password is really long&nbsp;and difficult I'm using a PIN to login in my local PC. I have set up properly a PIN number&nbsp;and seems it's working (Settings&nbsp;&gt;
 Accounts&nbsp;&gt; Sign in options , reports that "You are currently using a PIN to sign in to Windows, apps and services) , but I cannot see an option in login screen and thus, I can not use it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use the "Fast preview builds" installation, hence I don't know if a fix is already released for this.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            how to change MS Office 2011 language settings&#63;</h2>
                    I installed my MS Office 2011 with Finnsih settings but would need to change it into Swedish. How do I do it? How do I change all settings, bars and so on into another language so that the bars and settings are named the same with my other office-programs.
 I knew how to do it in Office 2008 but now that I upgraded my software I don't know anymore how to access those settings. Please help me...

            Microsoft Office is language-specific, which means that the language of the product which you buy is also the language which you will get when you install the product.<br />

<p>If the template you downloaded is from Avery's website, don't use it. The correct layout for 5567 file tabs is built into Word.</p>

<p>For the product number, note that the numbers are sorted "alphabetically", so the four-digit number 5567 comes after a batch of five-digit numbers.</p>

<h2>            Not receiving email</h2>
                    <p>I was using Outlook Express until Microsoft required me to change due to discontinuing the Outlook Express product. Until April 30, 2015 all was working well. Around the middle of April, I received a message from my ISP (Verizon) that they are changing their
 pop3 and smtp server names. They said I need to change them in my email settings to be able to continue to send and receive email. I have not yet been able to find these setting for Outlook.com unless I add an account with send and receive access. When I try
 to add an account, I get an authorization problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send email just fine, but nothing comes in. I send an email to myself and nothing arrives. If I send from a different email account, here is a portion of what comes back to me:<br />
</p>
<pre><p>Reason: LMTP transmission failure has occurred<br />Diagnostic code: lmtp;550 5.2.2 Delivery failed: Over quota</p><p /><p>Things were all good. I had well over 40 pages in my inbox so I began deleting things that I did not need, all the while new messages were being delivered as normal. When I got down to about 3 pages left in my inbox, this message started getting generated and sent to anyone trying to email me.</p><p /><p>I know if I can locate the pop3 server setting for my current (primary) email account, I can correct this issue.</p><p /><p>Any ideas?<br />Thank you in advance.</p></pre>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sync emails or create account in Mail for Windows 10 after upgrade from build 16299.0</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a known issue in Mail for Windows 10 that prevents some users from creating a new account, syncing email, or prevent you from viewing email settings. This only affects users that have upgraded from build 16299.0 to 16299.15.&nbsp;This occurs
 because one of the main components for email functionality is a Function-on-Demand (FOD) package that may have been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have recently upgraded and are experiencing any of these issues, please follow the steps provided in the following article:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><a href="https://support.office.com/article/16299-0-7a11484b-4d6f-4db5-b7fd-4128e3374b63" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Can't sync emails or create account in Mail for Windows 10 after upgrade from build 16299.0</a></p>

<h2>            Determine which Live account email address OneNote is logged into&#63;</h2>
                    I used to have a desktop and ipad logged into the same windows live account to sync OneNote to each other. I recently replaced the desktop with a laptop and mistakenly logged into OneNote the first time with the wrong windows live account. I need to match
 the laptop's account with the ipad's account but I don't know what the email address is that was used to log onto the ipad. I know the username, but not the email address. How do I find out what the email address is that is tied to the iPad OneNote's username?

<h2>            Not happy about loss of Zune support</h2>
                    <p>Even though my Zune devices continue to function perfectly, Microsoft has elected to stop supporting them. &nbsp;And I'm not happy about it. &nbsp;I knew this day was coming, but I had hoped that there would actually be a decent replacement for those devices by now.
 &nbsp;But there is not. &nbsp;Not even close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own several Windows Phones, but that in combination with Xbox/Groove Music is nowhere near what the Zune device and services were. The Zune software still has yet to be surpassed in terms of either features or usability, despite multiple attempts. &nbsp;Using
 a phone just doesn't cut it as a music player. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who really listen to music, a dedicated player is essential. &nbsp;Not some random phone with a really crappy headphone output. Phones do not suitable music player replacements make. &nbsp;But MS doesn't offer a dedicated music players any longer. &nbsp;It's
 a real shame.</p>
<ul>
<li>The D-A converters in phones are horrible. &nbsp;None of them sound good. &nbsp;Every one of them is very noisy and has a less-than-flat response.</li><li>I don't want text message, phone calls, and other alert sounds interrupting my music. &nbsp;But I can't turn the alerts off because I have to be accessible.</li><li>MS Phones don't have single connections which transfer both power and audio over a single cable. &nbsp;To use a phone to play music in a car without killing the phone's battery you have to hook up two separate cables, which are usually on opposite ends of the
 device, making it very awkward to deal with. &nbsp;Not cool.</li><li>Playlist support in Groove is absolutely awful compared to Zune.</li><li>Podcast support in WP8 is abysmal.</li><li>Groove is still really, really buggy. &nbsp;It fails to work about half the time. &nbsp;(It appears to be down even as I'm writing this post.)</li><li>Groove does not handle large collections very well. &nbsp;Much of my music never shows up in my collection.</li><li>Most phones don't have enough storage for a decent collection of apps and music. &nbsp;And MS makes it worse by not including MicroSD card slots in their higher end ("enthusiast") phones.</li><li>MS expects users to control music playback on a phone using the touch-screen interface. &nbsp;Which is VERY dangerous to do while driving. &nbsp;An option for a remote with dedicated tactile buttons is a must for safety.<br />
</li><li>Bluetooth audio is not suitable for high quality sound. &nbsp;It sounds awful.</li><li>The lack of a "10 free tracks each month" subscription takes away my desire to continue my subscription.</li></ul>
<p>Microsoft has made it pretty clear at this point they don't want music enthusiasts using their services. &nbsp;Because they certainly aren't doing anything to try to appeal to them or even try to keep them around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got absolutely no interest whatsoever in moving my subscription to Groove. &nbsp;You've lost a customer at this point, and I've been one of your biggest supporters. &nbsp;A lot of people have purchased MS products at my recommendation in the past, but that won't
 be happening any longer.</p>

            I feel exactly the same way. I loved being able to use my Zune as a dedicated offline music player that I only occasionally needed to reconnect to download new songs or update the license. It was a great lightweight device I could take anywhere and save
 my phone from having a battery drain or deal with headphones plugged into all the time as I am using it. Even the little features like gap-less playback don't seem to exist on any of the phone platforms. Now that I can't even use the Groove subscription pass
 with the Zune that I still have working perfectly fine I really see no reason to transition to that service. There are much better options out there to use for a lesser price in the music streaming world. The only advantages of being able to use it on my Zune
 and keep 10 songs a month were the only things making it worth paying the extra money for.

            I am still confused on this. Will we not be able to use the Zune at all to put music on it, even music we downloaded using the Zune software? Will the music we downloaded using the Zune software transition to the Groove software so we can at least listen
 to it and put it on a phone, or will we have to download everything again?

            <p>yep. everything you said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>zune software is superior in every way and form to groove music.</p>
<p>Zune music takes seconds to load new content.</p>
<p>Groove music is slow as hell, and wow on phone its pathetic, 2 days later still loading my music and play list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 extra was the main reason I held out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After I get migrated and my months run out, I am canceling my services. Sorry MSFT I am not paying you for a subscription services that moves backwards every year, and has application development restarts every year. When you get your stuff together and
 finally are serious I might come back, for now I am switching to rdio or apple music ( I am only looking at apple music because they are serious and actually improve on stuff, even though I hate apple)</p>

<p>I too have the original Zune 30, HD, WP7 on release day, a Nokia 930 (will be my last WP) and a new Surface 3.

            <p>I will still use the Groove software probably because I don't want to have to download thousands of songs again using another software. If all the songs I downloaded using Zune and my Zune Pass can work with Groove software so I can listen to it on my computer
 and put the music on my phone, I guess I will have to do that. I really hate we can't use the Zune device, though, because now if you take your music with you on your phone it will just drain the battery faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. So, will we not be able to put any music we downloaded using the Zune software on the Zune device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Will the music we downloaded using the Zune software transition to Groove, or will we have to download it again using Groove?</p>

            <p>Well, here's my sad story. &nbsp;I've had a Zune 120 since 2008. &nbsp;In November of 2014, I bought a new desktop computer. &nbsp;Downloaded the Zune software. &nbsp;Because when setting up my computer to use Windows it asked me to create a Windows live account, I did, and
 used the new password to log into Zune (because of this: &nbsp;<span><span><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">Use a&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)"><strong>Microsoft account</strong></span><span><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">&nbsp;to
 sign in to Microsoft products and services, and your settings, address book, and documents will follow you to any device”.</span></span></span>. &nbsp;I realized a couple of months ago (because I had been listening to newly downloaded songs) that the previous songs
 were not syncing. &nbsp;I'm talking about 2,854 songs. &nbsp;They don't sync, and they don't play. &nbsp;I get message that says "Please sign in with the login and password you used to purchase this item." &nbsp;I tried to log in with the password I had used from 2008 through
 2014, and it does not accept it, so I can't get to them. &nbsp;I've only used one email address during all this time. &nbsp;I had email conversations with XBox people, and after telling me numerous times that Zune no longer is supported, they said XBox works okay. &nbsp;Yeah,
 Xbox works okay, but Zune player will not sync! &nbsp;I sent a fax a few days ago to the CEO and the COO and have not had a reply. &nbsp;The Xbox people closed my case out and told me there was nothing they could do. &nbsp;I can't believe there isn't a way to delete or dis-associate
 any passwords related to my Zune account and create a new password for me so I can access all I've bought since 2008. &nbsp;I'm 69 years old, handicapped, and listened to music on my Zune ALL THE TIME. &nbsp;And I'm also wondering what they're doing about the fact that
 we had to sync every month or so in order to update usage rights. &nbsp;Also, I can't upgrade to Windows 10 because they did away with Windows Media Center. &nbsp;I have 8.1. &nbsp;No cable, so I use Windows Media Center to record TV shows. &nbsp;I am so pissed, frustrated, disappointed
 . . . . &nbsp;So unless they fix it so I can access all my songs, when Zune software no longer works, I'll have to take a hammer to my beautiful Zune device with the etched butterflies and my name on the back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just counted the number of "Purchased" items under "Settings", "Account", and there's only 42 songs . . . because the bulk of them, about 750 are not accessible to me because of the password issue.</p>

</p><p>One of the possible reasons why thumbnail previews for your images are not showing is due to the configuration of the settings. To troubleshoot your concern, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>File Explorer</strong> &gt; Choose the drive for your device. </li><li>Click on <strong>View</strong> &gt; Under <strong>Layout</strong> select <strong>
Extra large icons,</strong> <strong>Large icons</strong>, or <strong>Medium icons</strong>.</li><li>Check if the thumbnails are now appearing.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the thumbnails are still not showing,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>File Explorer</strong> &gt; Choose the drive for your device.</li><li>Click on <strong>View</strong> &gt; Select <strong>Option</strong> &gt; Hit <strong>
Change folder and search options</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>View</strong> tab &gt; Under <strong>Files and Folders</strong>, make sure
<strong>Always show icons, never thumbnails</strong> is uncheck.</li><li>Hit <strong>Apply</strong> then <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Check if the thumbnails are now appearing.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the status of the issue.</p>

<p>i tried this but it did not help.&nbsp; I have tried clearing the thumbnail cache, opening pictures to edit, and every suggestion i can find.&nbsp; None have allowed the thumbnails to display instead of icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this is some OS limitation on the thumbnails.&nbsp; I know the thumbnails can be shown because when opening a picture folder, the thumbnails display for a brief moment before being replaced by the icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a problem that Microsoft is addressing?</p>

<p>Someone who seems to be having related symptoms (on production FCU) demonstrated that your case (no thumbnails) can be emulated by a Performance choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-files/black-rectangle-shapes-instead-of-thumbnails-for/ee5ac440-5efc-4f4a-ad3a-68ee0714179f#LastReply">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-files/black-rectangle-shapes-instead-of-thumbnails-for/ee5ac440-5efc-4f4a-ad3a-68ee0714179f#LastReply</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is that performance choice being used partially now to satisfy a different one?&nbsp; (Assuming you are not using
<strong>"Adjust for best appearance" </strong>or if you are that what you get is somehow "best appearance" for unknown reasons that may be known only to the owners of the source.)</p>

</p><p>What advantages does a new Notebook has compared to a section group? Why would you chose one above the other? Because basically they do exactly the same... ??</p>

            <p>A section group introduces a new level of the notebook hierarchy, so it is an element of structure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have many sections in a notebook you get a problem of visibility: too many tabs to be seen at once or cut off section names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A disadvantage especially on Onedrive is that section groups tend to blow up the notebook's size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of Onedrive notebooks I'd prefer creating more notebooks, not section groups.</p>

    <title>Excel formula to count number of active users each month - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lori d_1974  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel formula to count number of active users each month</h2>
                    <p>I have a large sheet of data, each row contains a variety of data, but includes a start date and a leaving date.&nbsp; The leaving date field remains empty if the user is still active e.g. if there is a date in the leaving date field the user is now inactive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to produce some stats on a separate worksheet (still in the same workbook) which will dynamically count for each month how many active users there are, which would include those with a leaving date that month or where the leaving date is
 blank e.g. a user would be counted as active each month until a leaving date was entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that makes sense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<div>
<p>I would like to help you but,</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to find solution or guide you on your question with the current information</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>1- Request you prepare and upload a sample / dummy file with no confidential / sensitive data</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>to Onedrive,DropBox... and share the link?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2- Or post a screenshot of your worksheet without any confidential / sensitive data?</p>
<p>Also post the results expected.</p>
<p>Make sure that your row numbers and column letters are visible in the screenshot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This would help us to understand your problem better and come up with a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Insider release 14931 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Insider release 14931</h2>
                    <p>For the first two days after the install of 14931, everything seemed to be working normally. then suddenly a black screen crash. It would not restart, and showed only trying automatics repair. this was shown three more times before the unit rebooted and
 it seems, "seems"&nbsp;, to be functioning normally at this time. I was playing a moderately graphics intensive app Bejeweled Bliz at the time'.</p>
