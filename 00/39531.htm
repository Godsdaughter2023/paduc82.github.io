    <title>USB sound&#47;midi device not recognized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> music manrx  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB sound&#47;midi device not recognized</h2>
                    <p>I have a Technics PR804 keyboard attached to my Windows 10 laptop through USB.&nbsp; I've installed the drivers that came with my keyboard by entering compatibility mode to Windows ME, but the device manager won't recognize the hardware when it's turned on and
 plugged into my laptop.&nbsp; I've seen instructions online indicating that device manager should identify the keyboard as a sound device, and that I should be able to choose folder location for correct driver, but can't complete this step as device manager does
 not list the keyboard as an available device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi Roohi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp; I had tried both of those options as well, with limited success.&nbsp; I ran the driver setup file from my CD in compatibility mode for Windows ME/98 and it successfully ran and installed the drivers, but even with hidden devices
 shown, my Technics keyboard doesn't seem to show up.&nbsp; There is a 'High Definition Audio Device' that shows up, which I had hoped would be it, but when I select the driver folder from both the installed location on my C drive as well as straight from the CD,
 I get a response from the device manager that says "THE BEST DRIVERS FOR YOUR DEVICE ARE ALREADY INSTALLED: AUDIO ENDPOINT", so I have guessed that it may not actually be my device after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try uninstalling the driver, then reinstalling in Windows Vista mode to see if that helps, and if not I'll contact the Technics support group through your link and let you know what I find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            Airplane mode stuck on. On my desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have a dell XPS8100 w/ win 7 ultimate. I upgraded it to win 10 a couple weeks ago. As I used it more and more I was getting kicked off the internet. I would reboot and be back online, but it was happening more often, like every 1/2 hour, until now. I can't
 get online at all. I am wired into the back of the router. Red X in lower right sez I'm not connected, so I look and see The airplane mode is turned on! On a desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have tried several ways to turn the a/p mode off, with no luck. I am not sure this is my connection problem, but I know it shouldn't be on.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; How can I shut this off, and hopefully get my connection back?</p>

            <p>I just fixed this issue on my Dell after getting the major runaround from their tech support.&nbsp; It's NOT A VIRUS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to:&nbsp; <strong>support.dell.com</strong> and find your service tag.&nbsp; You may need to download their diagnostic program which will then show updates available, patches, etc.&nbsp; You can run a scan on your computer for recommended updates.&nbsp; I updated the BIOS,
 misc applications, and a specific Airplane Mode update (can't remember where it was exactly, if you run their scanner it should find it for you).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then adjusted the network adapter to not allow the computer to turn it off (found that solution in another thread) and also<strong> disabled the Airplane Mode switch in Device Manager/Human Interface Devices/Airplane Mode Switch.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few reboots and misc other driver updates here and there, it works fine.&nbsp; I think the key is the updates from the Dell website.&nbsp; Then you can disable the switch.</p>

<h3> kipar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exit Safe Mode without Log in &#40;Forgot Password&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently locked out of my laptop. I have my start up settings boot my computer in Safe Mode every time. Unfortunately, to log in to Windows I have to use my Microsoft account password which I have forgotten. Even though I have used my phone to reset
 the password I am still unable to log in to my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, I usually use the pin code or fingerprint scanner to log in but these options are not available in Safe Mode. Is there a way I can enable these so I can log in?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last resort is to refresh my PC or do factory reset which I don't really want to do since I have many important files and programs for school. Is there another way to manually exit Safe Mode without having to log in to Windows? Thanks!<br />

<p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the

<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>

<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>

<h2>            Malware or Virus or what&#63; Follow-up Email Survey - armed with malware &#40;in case you&#8217;re not nice&#41; and questions for Procmon users.</h2>
                    <p>What type of malware/virus do I have? Typing the 1st character of my password into my admin account - shuts down my computer.
</p>
<p>My very first time using this forum. please forgive the mistakes. </p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>After talking to customer service of a well known online company about a purchase I made, I received a follow up email later that day.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I opened it and seen they had only given me credit for half of my purchase. Also in the email was a short survey of two questions. (May have been more , but I didn't make it pass the 2nd question) #1 how well I could understand the person in customer service
 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> question was my overall rating for customer service. I remember asking the guy to repeat himself several times because I couldn’t understand him. So I clicked on the “poor” button. The next question brought out my anger because they
 were trying to screw me out of half the credit they had agreed to earlier. I believe there were five buttons from “terrible” “poor” “average” etc. for each of these questions. I went back and changed the “poor” to “terrible” on the 1st question then clicked
 “terrible” on the 2<sup>nd</sup> question. The very instant I clicked the 2<sup>nd</sup> “terrible” button, my computer screen went black. Then all sorts of weird things started to happen after that. My computer would shut off, then turn back on by itself,
 then only the video would go out (black screen with “no signal” message on my monitor) no blue fan lite, no red drive lite. This randomly went on for about 20 min. then ran okay for a while. Being a electronic technician, my first thought was; I have a hardware
 problem. Power supply, microprocessor or some other hardware. I spent the rest on that evening trying different things to see if I could narrow down my problem, before turning in for the night. It seemed to be working okay when I shut it down.
<span>Next evening, it still had the same problem.&nbsp; I ran Windows Defender quick scan - okay.&nbsp; Ran full scan, 3/4 way through, it started shutting down again I canceled Windows Defender and clicked on details of scan which brought up my admin account asking
<span>Next evening, it still had the same problem.&nbsp; I ran Windows Defender quick scan - okay.&nbsp; Ran full scan, 3/4 way through, it started shutting down again I canceled Windows Defender and clicked on details of scan which brought up my admin account asking
 for the password. I can reproduce the shut down by typing the first character of password into my admin account EVERY time.&nbsp; Which tells me I have a
</span><span>malicious software <span>&nbsp;</span><span> </span></span><span>problem and NOT a hardware problem. How do I fix it!</span></p>

<p><span>Another odd symptom; the second day of this problem I was able to run Windows Defender while the computer was shutting down, losing video, etc.. After each incidence, the computer would come back on with the lock screen on, clicking would bring me
 to the welcome screen and typing my password (using a standard account) would instantly bring me back to Windows Defender.

<p><span>Thanks Bill,</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your help in resolving my problem. This is a computer I built myself while attending an A+ Hardware course at the local Technical College. It has system restore, which I could run myself. I am faced with a dilemma. If I run system restore,
 do I destroy the evidence that this company’s customer service department injected malware/a virus/malicious software into my computer? What I really need is some forensic tools to be able to prove I got the unwanted software from a specific email. I am sure
 the respected well-known company that sent me that email doesn’t want a despicable scumbag representing their customer service department.
<span>&nbsp;</span>How many senior citizens or other unsuspecting people have had to deal with this guy and ended up taking their computers to a repair shop or buying a new one, maybe even giving up on computers altogether? Because they thought it was only a coincidence
 that they lost video the instant they pressed that button on a survey.&nbsp; Why don’t we go on offense and get after the guttural filthy characters that do this? Get some of these scumbags fired and/or prosecuted. I wonder if I had clicked the “poor” button, instead
 of the “terrible” button – would I have gotten a lesser version of this malicious software? I open my emails using a standard account, if I had opened them using a admin. account, would I have gotten a more fatal version? I went back to that same email and
 found an additional clue that convinces me it was the source of my problem. I will share that later in this feed. In the meantime, thanks again.</span></p>

<p>My additional clue from that email was a temporary fix<span>. After 3 days of dealing with the shutdowns, no video, etc. symptoms I decide to start collecting screenshots for evidence for a complaint to send to my
 state’s Attorney General. I turned on the infected computer and tried to get into my Admin Account, typing the first character of password STILL shuts it down (illusion). When I got it running again, I went to the email from customer service that had installed
 the malicious software and opened the same email. Instead of clicking the “No” button and getting the survey that resulted in my problem because of a “terrible” rating.<span>&nbsp;
</span>THIS TIME I pressed the “yes” button, it went to the next page which said “it looks like you already responded to this survey”<span>&nbsp;
</span>– my infected computer seemed to blink.&nbsp;<span> </span>Opened the email again and pressed “no” – same message as the “yes”.&nbsp; After that I was able to type the full password into the admin account and start Microsoft Security Scanner. The quick version
 found nothing. So I took some screenshots and attempted to run the full scan of&nbsp; Microsoft Security Scanner.&nbsp; The green band in the scan that shows "progress" got all the way to the end, but the scan just kept running and counting files and the elapse time
 kept increasing. I finally cancelled it after several hours. The next day, my password problem was back, but I found a work-around for it.&nbsp; Except for the first character, I can type the remaining part of my password into the box. With my cursor positioned
 on the first character and my mouse pointer positioned over the "YES" button, I can<em> simultaneously
</em>type the first character and press the yes button and activate my admin permission.&nbsp; Perhaps this clue can help someone else down the road. Since the infected computer is a secondary computer, I may try to repair it myself and keep this feed going to update
 or as reference for myself. I haven't decided yet.</span></p>

<p><span>Its been awhile thought I would update this. I believe this malware is somehow activating the hibernation mode on this computer. (screen goes black, a few seconds later I get “no signal” message on screen, then all lights turn off. If I press the power
 button, fan and fan light turns on, green power light blinks 7 times just like initial turn on, but NO Start Beep, it comes on with the lock screen, press enter or click mouse to get to the welcome screen, enter password and I am back to whatever I was doing
 before.) I was able to run Microsoft Safety Scanner full version – nothing found. Event viewer shows nothing unfamiliar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am giving myself a crash course in Process Explorer and Process Monitor.
</span></p>
<p><span>Malware will activate when I:</span></p>
<p><span>Enter the first character of my password to my admin account or any other time I enter that character</span></p>
<p><span>When I press the Win key + PrtScr to get a screenshot (captures the ss okay)</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise it seems to activate itself randomly – most when I first turn it on and less after it has been on awhile
</span></p>
<p><span>Problem affects all desktops (accounts)</span></p>
<p><span>Tried a virtual desktop – affects that too</span></p>
<p><span>One night I just turned it on and counted the times it turned off and back on by itself. - 45 times in 2.5 hours.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Longest it stayed on was 10 min, longest it stayed off was 5 min</span></p>
<p><span>There were a few times when It worked okay for the evening. (I could enter password to admin account WITHOUT activating malware) The first time I downloaded Microsoft Safety Scanner – run okay for remainder of evening. Next evening, I tried again –
 it activated itself several times during the scan. </span></p>
<p><span>When I first downloaded and ran Process Monitor – it worked okay until I shutdown. Next time I ran Process Monitor it activated several times.</span></p>
<p><span>The first time I got into the System Restore. Kept page minimized in task bar – it ran the next 2 hours (rest of evening okay)</span></p>
<p><span>Next night - I was able to do a system restore back to a date before the infection. The malware activated itself several times during System Restore (thought I was screwed) took about an hour, but was able to successfully restore to earlier date –
 STILL HAD PROBLEM After System Restore. </span></p>
<p><span>That’s where I am now. </span></p>

    <title>Anyone here have one of the MW3 branded Turtle Beaches&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ordealbyfire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anyone here have one of the MW3 branded Turtle Beaches&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>What do you think? I got a set of Foxtrots today, and decided to type up a review for those maybe thinking about getting a pair. If you have a pair of any MW3 Turtle Beaches, share your opinions.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After going through several stock Microsoft headsets, I finally decided to get something a bit more durable - what I ended up getting is the Limited Edition Turtle Beach MW3 Foxtrot Headset.<br />
.<br />
Out of the box, I was pretty quickly satisfied with the design and the feel of it. It's well-made, yet lightweight. Hook-up is also quite simple, but if you need instructions, they're there for you. As this thing is wired, it doesn't take batteries; it simply
 plugs into one of the USB ports on your 360.(I recommend the one in the back, just because. Well. It's in the back.)<br />
.<br />
On the cord, there's a little box that allows you to adjust game sound, chat sound, toggle mute, adjust bass, and this thing that says "Expander" ... I'm ignorant as to what this thing is supposed to be, all I know is that when you turn it to on, you get a
 bit more static than when it's off, doing nothing from what I can tell other than lowering the audio quality. There's also a little 360 controller on the box, which is where you plug in the little included adapter cord, so you can talk to people over Xbox
 LIVE.<br />

It's really quite incredible what a solid headset does for you - how much it changes the game. You really have to hear it to believe it. While this isn't the absolute best headset on the market, or the cheapest, it's not too bad at the price of about $100.
 While this headset doesn't have Dolby 7.1, it has "amplified stereo," as well as an awesome thing I mentioned above - the bass boost. This thing makes the headset all-the-more worth it. Turn this up, and any game you're playing instantly becomes better. In
 Call of Duty or Battlefield, every shot you fire from your gun rattles your eardrums ever-so nicely, as does a nice big explosion. Perhaps even better, is using this headset while playing Rock Band or the good ol' defunct DJ Hero - never has the music sounded
 so good. And of course, the bass just makes it better.<br />
.<br />
Another thing that's included with the Foxtrot Headset is "chat boost." The chat boost is a built-in thing that is supposed to adjust the volume in the people you're talking to's voice, to the sound in-game. While this is great in theory, I've had issues with
 it. While playing Modern Warfare 3, I had the game volume about 3/4 of the way up, and chat at half way. Seemingly randomly, the chat would suddenly get incredibly loud, so I'd turn it down. After doing so, it was so quiet, I couldn't hear anybody to talk.
 I had to do this over and over again, and it resulted in quite a bit of frustration. What I have noticed is that the lower your bass boost, the less likely this will happen. Regardless, it seems unavoidable if you're chatting with people, and it can be either
 a minor annoyance, or an ear-bleeding hell of an experience.<br />
.<br />
So... would I recommend this headset? Yes. Are there other and better, cheaper options? Yes. The main reason why I really prefer this headset to other Turtle Beaches, is that it just looks nice with its sleek design. I should also let you know that even though
 this says it's a Modern Warfare 3 headset, the only spot you can really sense that it's a Call of Duty headset is on the box on the cord, where it says Call of Duty MW3, and on the top of the headset itself, where it has Call of Duty pressed in. Overall, it's
 just aesthetically pleasing all-around, and the audio quality isn't too shabby either.<br />
.<br />
+: That brand new "out of the box" smell, solid sound quality, bass boost, looks pretty cool.<br />
.<br />
-: Cord is pretty freakishly long, the chat boost has its issues, may not be the best option for the price it is - shop around first.<br />
.<br />
4/5</p>

<p>Decent review. Glad you're happy with your purchase. I have both the X3(4yrs and still going strong) and X41 and I'm more than happy with both of them. I actually prefer and still use my X3's more.

<p>Thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>I got a 2-year warranty for the Foxtrots only because I'm so used to having terrible luck with headsets... (PS2 stock, 360 stock.) So far so good, and there really is no comparison here in build quality between this set, and a stock 360 mic.</p>

            I am still having problems.
<div><br />
<div>Windows Update Troubleshooter says it fixed issues, but updates still won't install successfully.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried the following (from support.microsoft.com/kb/2509997) under the clean boot startup:</div>
<div>- I tried running the System Update Readiness tool, but it wouldn't run. </div>
<div>- I tried running the System File Checker tool, but it said something else was currently running/scanning and the tool needed to be run at a different time.</div>
<div>- I tried to reset the content of the Catroot2 folder, but it said it couldn't find this folder.</div>
<div>- I tried to remove any incorrect Registry values, but none of those values existed in my registry.</div>
<div>- I tried to register the Windows Update files, but updates still won't install successfully.</div>
<div>- I temporarily disabled my anti-virus software, but updates still won't install successfully.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried to manually install the following updates from microsoft update online, and here are the responses I got.</div>
<div>KB2585542 - not applicable</div>
<div>KB2645640 - not installed</div>
<div>KB2654428 - not applicable</div>
<div>KB2660465 - not applicable</div>
<div>KB2640148 - not installed</div>
<div>KB2660075 - not installed</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I use Windows Update from my machine (and not online), I usually get error code 8000FFFF, but a few times I also got 8007045D.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was able to successfully download an update for Microsoft Silverlight (KB2668562) and Microsoft .NET (KB2600217), but I can't download the security updates and general updates for Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will run chkdsk tonight.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The performance suggestions did not help in my case as I don't have many programs, except my anti-virus, that run at start up. I still have microsoft office programs that file to open the first time with error message "Failed to send command to program."</div>
<div>My computer still runs slowly despite being only 1.5 years old.</div>

<div>Windows Update runs much faster now, and successfully installed 1 update for Windows defender, but 8 other updates failed. At least it only takes 3 minutes to run instead of 3 hours.</div>

                    <p>Original Title: Problem with Touchpad</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I've upgrade my DELL Laptop(Inspiron 15, model 3542) from windows 7 to windows 10. The touch-pad is stopped working. When I run back to windows 7 it is coming back to work, but it is stopped working again when I upgrade to windows 10. I repeat the process
 several time, the same result I found. Actually I've installed many touch pad drivers concerning my PC type and windows 10, unfortunately the problem remained unsolved.
</p>
<p>Thanks for any help. Hopefully there is a simple fix for such problem.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your assist... Indeed what you are mentioned I did several times. I really sure that there is a problem with my touchpad device, but I'm not sure whether it being with the device itself or with its own driver. Concerning with current OS
 it is windows 10 (32 bit) in fact. I never receive any error message&nbsp;when I try to use touchpad on Windows 10. I check the the system compatibility to install windows 10 before I upgrade and the result was OK. As long as your 'Method 1' is concerned, I did
 it many times... the OS troubleshooting can't define the touchpad device, it called "unknown device" and windows 10 can't find a driver for it. Furthermore I've visit the Dell website and downloaded the only one supported driver named "Input_Driver_D2KVP_WN32_19.0.15.15_A01"
 but the problem still unsolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to hear from you</p>
<p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the</span><b><span> Start</span></b><span>
 button, click </span><b><span>Control Panel</span></b><span>, click
</span><b><span>Hardware and Sound</span></b><span>, and then click

<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the device that's not working, and then click Remove.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Add, press the reset button on the device (or make it discoverable following the manufacturer's instructions),
 select the </span><b><span>My device is set up and ready to be found</span></b><span> check box, and then click
</span><b><span>Next.</span></b></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the device is not found, repeat the previous step. When the device is found, select it, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the rest of the instructions in the wizard.</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the device is turned on and that the batteries don't need to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the Bluetooth adapter for your computer is attached and turned on, and that the device is turned on
 and discoverable. If you're not sure how to turn on discoverability, read the instructions that came with the device or check the manufacturer's website.</span></p>

            Option 1:
<br />
<br />
<br />Run the following troubleshooter:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />
<br />    Add through the control panel or search for “lusrmgr.msc” and open the Microsoft Common Console Document. Select “users”, right click “users”, choose the option to “add new user”.   Type in the required information
<br />    Add through command prompt as an administrator.
<br />        Click Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.
<br />        If the User Account Control dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click Continue.
<br />        Type net user username password /add  replacing the word username with the new account username and the word password with a password for the new account that meets Windows 10 complexity requirements.
<br />        If successful, Command Prompt will populate a message.
<br />        Now, add that newly created account to the Administrators group. Type:  net localgroup administrators username /add  replacing the word username with the new account name created in step 3.
<br />    With Crl+alt+del , select “ Sign out” to sign out of your account and then sign in to your new account. 
<br />
<br />If you can now open Settings, move your personal data and files to the new account.
<br />
<br />Make the new account an administrator account:
<br />
<br />    Under Settings à Account à Other users, select the account you created &gt; Change account type.
<br />
<br />    Under Account type, select Administrator &gt; OK.
<br />
<br />    move your personal data and files to the new account.
<br />
<br />If you were using a Microsoft account to sign in before, associate the Microsoft account with the new administrator account. In Settings &gt; Accounts, select Sign in with a Microsoft account instead and type in your account info. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, perform a repair upgrade:

            Hi Mrs. Lee.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Start Menu troubleshooter:   <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/startmenu.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F2...</a>
<br />
<br />Re-register the Settings app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Disconnected from XBL when playing Halo Wars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattsafc73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disconnected from XBL when playing Halo Wars</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I play a game of Halo Wars online with my brother, it kicks me from the game saying I've been disconnected from XBL. It can take between 5-30 minutes to get kicked off, but it happens every time without fail. It's only started happening for the
 past couple of weeks, because before then it was perfect. I've done everything Xbox Support have told me to; deleting and re-downloading my profile, reinstalling the game, deleting my wifi settings on the console and nothing worked. Anyone else having this
 issue?</p>

            <p>Hey there MattSafc73!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issue! Just to clarify, is the issue only occurring with Halo Wars? If you haven't already, I suggested attempting to play a different game to see if you run into disconnects. If you are running into disconnects with multiple titles, I suggest running through the steps listed in our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/random-disconnect-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Xbox One Disconnect Solution">Xbox One Disconnect Solution</a> page. Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It only disconnects when I'm playing Wars. I don't know if it's just that game though, because it's the only back compat title I've played online. My connection is great when playing Halo 5 Warzone though, no problems whatsoever. I've already been told to
 do them steps on the page you suggested, and all the results came back good. I've since done a reset on my console, getting rid of everything but my games and apps and the problem is still there.

<p>this issue ruined the backwards compatiblety system for me. :/ downloaded halo wars and played it with a friend, 20 min or so into the first game it says i'm not connected to live anymore though abvioulsy i am. And after this happened i can't play any other
 online 360 game on my xb one. It just tells me that I need to sign in even though I already are. Games such halo reach and gears of war will no longer rocognize my profile unless i get signed in .. But I am!!¿</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But I needed to test out a new SNES controller for a project, and found it was not reading correctly. Or so I thought.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I tested another with same results. Stranger thing is that I have a KIT controller that you make yourself, which is recognised as a "Generic USB controller" which works just fine. So I plugged in my old
 Logitech dual action controller to test that, as it was working in the past. I was thinking that my new SNES controllers were faulty. But my Logitech was also acting up. The right analogue stick moves the mouse around the screen, other buttons trigger the
 enter key, tab key, back key ……. and so on. I currently have no modifier software installed that would be doing this. And as I have not used them in a while, I have no idea when it might have happened. A Windows 10 update perhaps? If so, how to fix?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how difficult it is, when the device won't work in the way it should. If the controller isn't working properly, or if you have accidentally calibrated your controller with the wrong settings, I'd suggest you to reset the Game Calibration to
 its default and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset Game Controller Calibration to its default:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Connect the controller.</p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>Start</strong> icon.</p>
<p>3. Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click on <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices and Printers</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Right click on the controller and select <strong>Game controller settings</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Click on <strong>Properties</strong> button.</p>
<p>7. Under <strong>Settings</strong> tab, click on <strong>Reset to default</strong>.</p>
<p>8. Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplug the controller and plug it back and check if it makes any difference. Repeat the same steps for all the other controllers and update us on the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>I did try that before, and in case I did it wrong, I have just tried it again as you directed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it has not fixed anything.</p>
<p>Having buttons mapped to keys might be something if a setting or setup was in place to cause it, but not the mouse curser!</p>
<p>My Logitech should not ( and has not in the passed ) control my windows mouse without my wanting it to.</p>
<p>Only a guess , but could it be down to something it the "touch" controls for windows?
</p>
<p>Currently I am not using them as I am in desktop mode, but will later when I unpack my touch monitor in the future.</p>
<p>Never had this before, but looks like others are having the same issue ( even if not known as such ). I only noticed as I have many different controllers to test between..</p>

<p>
</p><p>Still no news. As an extra bit of info, as the controller is selecting stuff, one selection brings up the touch keyboard.</p>
<p>And only the controller (or touch screen ) will close it as the mouse can not access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having touch compatibility is great, but please can you create a fix for this issue as I am sure many have it.</p>
<p>If not a BUG, then how do I trouble shoot it to find out why?</p>

    <title>Turtle Beach XP500 Headset. Interference from WIFI. Ideas&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Turtle Beach XP500 Headset. Interference from WIFI. Ideas&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Turtle Beach XP500.</p>
<p>I am a fairly knowledgeable user. I have a simultaneous dual band N router setup in my home. It is in the central part of my house where my Xbox is also located; along with my Xp500 setup. The XP500 tower is 8ft from the router.</p>
<p>I am getting some random cracking and popping with an occasional drop out.</p>
<p>I have changed up the channel on my router to try and find a better channel.</p>
<p>I have reset the router to factory settings. I have paired the headset over again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I sit about 4ft away from the tower, with no obstructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was wondering if any of the tech heads out there have any suggestions for doing something I might have missed??? Router settings? Anything???</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the two devices could interfere with one another by colliding on the same RF channel, but you could try adjusting the wireless channel of your wireless router and see if a certain one eliminates the problem. Some routers use a dynamic wireless
 channel system, if that is true in your case perhaps a fixed channel could fix your problems. Turtle Beach lists the range of the XP500 as 2.404-2.476GHz, and my wireless router seems to span from 2.412-2.462GHz depending on the selected channel.</p>

<p>Brotha! Thanks! I haven't tried it but I have been searching the default channel for the XP500 and couldn't find one listed. I will try that and Post back, But if I understand the way channels work and overlap... that range covers all channels 1-11; and
 even 12 and 13 that are not regulated in the states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you have stumbled upon the frequency in which the wireless base will operate. Overall.</p>
<p>I'm going to try setting the router on channel 11 and see how it works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One note, I have a friend that used to own X41s which were also 2.4GHz RF and he had interferance that he just couldn't get rid of. He works IT too. If the problem persists, I recomend getting a wireless headset that runs at 5.8GHz which is becoming ever
 popular. I'm not sure why they left the IR signal that X4s used. To be honest. IR was perfect, no 'noise' over the air and the only thing I had to make sure was that it was line of sight. Of course, I just decided to go wired anyway.</p>

<p>This is very disapointing to hear about&nbsp;this because this is the premium choice for Turtle Beach headsets and something I am still planning on getting. &nbsp;Just like you I purchased a new dual band N router.. the Linksys E3000. &nbsp;I have 7 devices total and only
 2 of them use the N and 5Ghz band, the Xbox 360 and my Sony Bluray player.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other 5 devices all run off the 2.4 Ghz band so I'm very worried.. even though they are not in the same room as the router and the PX500's would be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm just how bad this is and if simply just choosing a different channel on the router will stop this hiss? &nbsp;Again, Im asking because I am seriously considering the XP500's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>As a side note, I currently am using the DX11's which are basically the wired equivilent of the X41's. &nbsp;I don't know if anyone else has noticed this or not, but whatever kind of wires Turtle Beach uses have a severe tendency to get tangled up and kinked,
 almost as if they have a mind of their own. &nbsp;No matter what I do to straighten out those wires, they get tangled up again and again like some strain of spider ivy on steroids!!!</p>
<p>This will be the last time I ever buy a wired turtle beach product because of this. &nbsp;I would go as far as to say, I would rather put up with a hint of hiss (depending on how bad it is of course) &nbsp;than to put up with these wires. &nbsp;Yes really, they are that
 bad.</p>

<p>Just a side effect of everyone using the 2.4Ghz band since the FCC has it set as a freespace for microwave ovens, but does put a power restriction on devices that use it. 5GHz is really what you want as it's set aside and regulated a bit more. Side note
 the wireless 360 controller and headset work in the same 2.4GHz band. There are some free programs you can use on a laptop or to analyze the whole wifi range and find the least congested portion. If where you live there are a lot of other Wifi networks that
 show up with a strong signal it may be impossible to escape the wifi noise.</p>

<p>I solved it, guys. Thanks. I set the 2.4Ghz band of my router on channel 11. Now there is no interference and the headset works flawlessly! I have the majority of devices in my home on the 5Ghz band; even my 1 of my xboxes through a wifi adapter. The 5Ghz
 is SO much faster. The only thing that is on the 2.4 is 2 iphones and a kindle fire. I would not let this post discourage anyone from buying the XP500. It is a exceptionally well made headset. The sound quality on games is fantastic. The Bluetooth functionality
 is great. Beig able to switch presets and even customize them is one of the coolest things I've seen in gaming.

I believe what BritnNunn was saying her October 28th message above was the same problem I have with iTunes in Windows 7 (64 bit).&nbsp; That is, how do you uninstall software that's not listed on the Uninstall or Change Programs screen, even though it functions
 to some degree (i.e., is resident in the computer somewhere).&nbsp; I'm not getting an error message, just need to uninstall iTunes so I can reinstall and try to get it working properly/completely.<br />

<p>Hi BritniNunn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m sorry to know that you are facing issue with iTunes. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these question:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the complete error message?</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When exactly do you receive this message to uninstall iTunes?</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What do you mean when you say “there is nothing to uninstall”?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are facing issue with iTunes then you may try uninstalling the program and reinstall iTunes in Windows 7 Compatibility mode and check how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> I would suggest you to try uninstalling iTunes and check if it helps. Follow the steps to uninstall iTunes:
</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select <strong>iTunes</strong> and click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Follow these steps to install iTunes in Compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Download the latest iTunes setup file for Windows 7 from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong>Right click</strong> on the setup file of and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” Tab.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Place a check mark next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and select
<strong>Windows 7</strong> from the drop down list.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Let the iTunes install and then check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check for any utility present with iTunes. Refer the below mentioned link and check if this helps:</p>

<p>I tried all the steps and I cannot get beyond the point where it says "An installation for Apple Application Support (64-bit) is currently suspended. You must undo the changes made by that installation to continue. Do you want to undo those changes? Hitting
 Yes does absolutely nothing except bring me back to that statement. Hitting no closes the iTunes dialog box, but does not uninstall.

    <title>Windows 10 user accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crwdad3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 user accounts</h2>
                    I will be working to upgrade our small business computers from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The present computers have a minimum of two User accounts, one an Admin and the other a normal User account. This helps keep the users from adding software, and other
 things, that we prefer they should not be able to do. The User account is a general User account (called User), not assigned to a specific individual. Is that possible in Windows 10? I am trying to plan this upgrade completely, and things like this are important
 for our operation.

<p>Good question!! If this is the case, this will be&nbsp; a major issue for my company's people, since NOONE uses their computer while logged in as an Admin, not even me.<br />

<h2>            Skype 2010 was elegant, efficient, few bells and whistles, but worked better then this current version.</h2>
                    <p>I know programmers need to work. I have used Skype since it arrived online, over 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Hiring wantabee programmers to work on something that did work causes problems.</p>
<p>Now you have a Skype that would feel proud if we had not ever had Skype.</p>
<p>Your software programmers are like folks hired to do something they do not really like to do.</p>
<p>The folks at the original Skype loved taking on the big guys in the VOIP market.</p>
<p>They won. Then the Microsoft improvement programmers got to work.</p>
<p>Microsoft Skype makes me think they lost because of your amateurish attempts to make a more useless user interface!!</p>
<p>This latest rendition may have given employment to some pretty good young folks but they are not programmers.</p>
<p>Efficiency counts.</p>
<p>User friendliness counts.</p>
<p>Your guys go for looks over performance.</p>
<p>Real programmers go for performance over looks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention. The GUI looks and works crap too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allan</p>

<h2>            Some &#39;Apps&#39; have stopped working - Windows 8</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 8 a couple of days ago and all of the 'home screen' apps worked fine. &nbsp;Yesterday Finance stopped working and today Weather has also stopped. &nbsp;Both tiles show details but clicking and attempting to access the apps either leaves it
 at the timer, Weather, or a blank white screen. &nbsp;Have tried the troubleshooter app but no difference. &nbsp;No anti virus other than Windows Defender. &nbsp;Any suggestions welcomed. &nbsp;Thanks

            Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;I receive no error messages, the tiles themselves appear to show up to date dates and information however clicking on them doesn't open the app.

<div>No changes, other than automatic updates have been made.<br />

            Prior to receiving your reply I uninstalled both apps and reinstalled Windows 8 and then the apps. &nbsp;So far it seems to have cured the problem.

<div>Thanks for your help and hopefully I won't be back in touch :)</div>
