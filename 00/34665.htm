<h2>            Unable to sign in to the Windows 10 PC as fingerprint scanner is not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have always used the fingerprint scanner to log on for years. Now I can't do that for some reason, and Windows now asks for my password or pin - which I have forgotton.</p>
<p>The reset details (my old phone number and old email address) Windows 10 want me to use are now obsolete and cannot be used.</p>
<p>I am completely stuck up the creek without a paddle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even use the command prompt to gain access without my password!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can do to log on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi MarkSavage2,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand the situation must be difficult for you when the fingerprint scanner doesn't work as it should.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get clarity on this issue:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you aware of any changes made to the PC prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the error code or message you get while using the fingerprint scanner to login?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you using an external fingerprint scanner or the built-in fingerprint scanner?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you have any other user account on the PC using which you can login?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us try these methods one by one to check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Check the Fingerprint scanner.</span></p>
<p><span>Please check, if there is any grease on the fingerprint scanner. If so, use a clean cloth to wipe it down and keep it as clean as possible. Once the
 scanner is clean, try to login and check if that helps. </span></p>
<p><span>2. Check if there are scratches on the sensor screen. If the fingerprint sensor is damaged seriously, it is recommended to send the device to repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Further, I also understand that you
 are not able to reset the password as the old phone number and email id are now obsolete and cannot be used. I suggest you to refer to the steps mentioned in this section ‘<strong>I can't get a verification code</strong>’ from this article ‘<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12429/microsoft-account-sign-in-cant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">When
 you can't sign in to your Microsoft account</span></a></strong>’ to check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: You might be asked to fill out a security questionnaire. You’ll be asked for info, like the subject lines of email you recently sent from your
 account, your birthdate, credit card info, and other details only you would know. You don't have to know every answer, and it's ok to be close if you don't know the exact answer.</span></p>

<p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>I was a bit luckier than you, I only had 100 stolen by the same fraud. Unfortunately I have had absolutely no help from Microsoft/Skype in the matter.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you who stole my account as the email will be asterisked out by the moderators because of privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is becoming farcical.</p>
<p>The account that was stolen is known to Microsoft Security Team to be my account because they sent me the email saying so.</p>
<p>But for some reason Skype don't understand this and are allowing the thief to use the same method to steal from other Skype customers.</p>
<p>I was a victim of this on 5th October, as was at least one other customer on here, when was your money stolen?</p>

</p><p>Microsoft's compatibility database is continually being updated with new data. What you can do is periodically run another scan to see if the database has updated information about your hardware. Even though you might get this message, you can always run
 Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also try performing the upgrade manually:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft recently released updates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 improving the stability of the upgrade experience for Windows 10. Please ensure you have the update installed for your respective version of Windows:</strong>

<h3> trina81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Critical update May 26th 2018 screwed up my graphics card and display drivers rendering my laptop useless.</h2>
                    <p>I updated win 10 yesterday and after the update my display drivers would not work my laptop went to windows basic display driver tried everything with my nvidia GTX 1050 TI and Intel hd graphics and nothing then could not use my mouse on the laptop computer
 completely crashed on me. And tried to reboot and it wouldn't even reboot I've had to now restore back to factory settings, which means I've lost everything, My laptop isn't even a year old and this is the second time in a year a critical update has screwed
 up my laptop, after how much i forked out for this laptop i am more than annoyed at this and Microsoft do nothing to sort out their issues. The error code i got was Display drivers failed to start error code 43 after this so called update, now I've reset back
 to factory settings and my drivers are fine so Microsoft care to explain to me what your playing at?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sick and tired of getting forced updates that render my laptop completely useless, luckily i could restore to factory settings seens as rolling back my display drivers was grayed out and nothing else worked. Now I've got to waste time all day reinstalling
 bloody everything from games to apps from apps to vr basically my whole laptop. I want an explanation and i want to know what Microsoft plan to do to fix this screwed up update. If it happens again I will be sending Microsoft the bill for repairs.</p>

<p>OK. Did you update your bios to the latest available from Dell. I would make sure that drivers are up to date from Dell's website, if they provide their own drivers for any part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked with Dell to see if they know of any reason for the problems you are experiencing.</p>

            This entire update is stupidness. I haven't&nbsp;been able to put my $2000 laptop to proper use because my graphics card is apparently "not good enough" even though my computer is just over a year old, and worked perfectly fine before Windows janked it up with
 this update.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled and re-installed the graphics drivers (both Intel and NVIDIA) and re-installed the new Dell BIOS update (several times). Yet, nothing is working.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Literally, my eyes are in a constant state of&nbsp;eye-rolling at this point, and I'm low key ready to send this laptop out the window... BECAUSE THIS UPDATE IS DIRT.

<p>I figured out to fix the graphic card problem, after about 5hrs of playing around with the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall graphics drivers in Device Manager. The problem is that the computer seems to believe that the drivers are up to date, but the update removed the updated versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the graphic card brand website, download latest versions of the graphic driver for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system may require a restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that works for you like it did me!&nbsp;</p>

                    Pin to taskbar is not working. It worked once, but when I rebooted, the program icons were gone. Then accessed gsedit.msc and enabled a feature there&nbsp;there that made icons pin on taskbar again, but then I rebooted, came back and icons had disappeared from
 the taskbar. What is causing this and how do I fix it? This is a huge usability issue for me. Please help!

    <title>Windows 8 start up screen password while offline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hubertmb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 start up screen password while offline</h2>
                    I have a HP Pavilion G6 and have no t turned it on for some time. &nbsp;I turned it on yesterday and it asks for my password which I put in but it says the PC is offline and I need to use the last password I used to sign in. I tried it and I am still unable
 to sign on. I use my password to log into other Microsoft sites like right here and it works perfectly. &nbsp;How do I get passed the password requirements in my start up screen so I could use my laptop? Thank you

            <p>Since the computer isn't connected to the internet, it can't call out to the server to get the new password you use on these sites.&nbsp; So it needs you to use the last password the computer knew about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't know what that password was, there's no immediate way to bypass it.&nbsp; Otherwise, someone could steal your computer and simply bypass your password, which is obviously not a good thing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's another account on the computer, you can login to it instead, then go into Control Panel and reset your account's password.&nbsp; If there are no other accounts on the system, you can boot to Safe Mode to access the Built-in Administrator account.&nbsp;
 From this fail-safe account, you can force-reset your account's password.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+I</strong> to display the Settings charm menu.</li><li>Click the Power Options icon, then hold down the Shift Key while you click the Restart option. Keep holding shift until the screen says it is restarting.</li><li>On the first screen that appears, select Troubleshoot, then select Advanced Options. Finally pick Startup Settings and click the Restart Button.</li><li>On the next screen, press the Number 4 Key to choose Safe Mode.</li></ol>
<p>Now that you are in safe mode, you can use the built-in backup Administrator account to perform you necessary recovery. The built in Administrator account should not be used for any other purpose, or it won't be available in situations like this when you
 need it.</p>
<ol>
<li>At the login screen, click the Arrow Icon and select the Administrator account.</li><li>After Safe Mode starts, press <strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+W</strong> and open Control Panel / User Accounts.</li><li>Select Manage another account and select the account you wish to change to an Administrator account. You can also use the Change Password option here to reset the other account's password.</li></ol>
<p>When you're done, restart the computer normally.</p>

    <title>Administrative password bypass - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james_c.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Administrative password bypass</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've reset my Microsoft account password many times, and signing into my pc isn't a problem, but when I want to install some program(s), it won't let me install. It says "need administrative password"; however there isn't any place for me to enter my password.
 I'm the only user on my PC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't backup, can't change settings, can't&nbsp;update software, and I'm completely stuck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately I would like to back up my files first and format (HDD if necessary), and reinstall Windows7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes I installed Win 10 with 64 bit. Bought the barebone PC about 1.5 years and installed Win 7 64-bit professional when arrived. The free upgrade to Win 10 wasn't offered for some reason. So then around November 2015, I downloaded a series of windows update
 so that I can install Win 10. Upon completion of installation, my monitor screen has been flickering every 10 seconds (Believe me..I have adjusted the refresh rate..but still doesn't work).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the browsers, I mainly used Edge. Sometimes use Google Chrome. Nothing else is installed. And of course I still have Internet Explorer 11 (from Win 7), but never used it since upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the adobe Flash:&nbsp;You have version 20,0,0,286 installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my PC, I have installed Avast AntiVirus, MalWare Bytes, Ad-Aware, and CCleaner. I had run those applications occasionally to keep PC in shape and sometimes clean the registry with CCleaner. I did those even when I was still using Win 7, and doesn't cause
 me any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing works, I'll have to reformat the entire drive (if that isn't even possible, I'll probably have to change out the HDD, and reinstall everything from my back up drive)</p>

<h2>            Private Offline Networking with current wifi router despite with connected modem-router from Provider</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to ask about making a network connection in Windows 10 for just offline sharing files and streaming from my PC with my mobile devices using my current wifi router over Ethernet LAN besides through modem router from Provider. Is that possible
 and how to setting it up ?</p>
<p>I have recently subscribe to an ISP (Cable or Optical broadband service) and they install a modem+ wifi router connected to my PC, I can connect online fine through wifi usb on my PC but when I also connect my Ethernet LAN port to my another wifi router,
 the internet connection &nbsp;seems to be have problems and cant connected to the internet. When I unplug the Ethernet, then the connection back to normal again. I ask the support staff from the provider and they said the two Routers might have the same Ip address
 and could be conflicted and they suggest I change the other router with a different Ip address, would that solve and how to set up the Lan on the other router beside the modem router from Provider?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be more secured and comfortable for me if I could still use my own current router which brand is Cisco Linksys 1500 rather than the Router modem from Provider, because on the setting page of the modem router we can't change the login and password
 which I have asked the support and they confirm to me that the login on the setting page using only username and password which is general, even though we can change the SSID and password from the setting, but I still am not so comfort about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please anyone could share the ideas, and experience about how to use both modem/router and another router together but have no connection at all, the wifi router only for offline sharing and streaming privately from PC and the modem router for connecting
 to the internet. &nbsp;Thanks for sharing ideas and support.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Encountering 0x8007000A when updating Microsoft Store apps</h2>
                    <p>I am getting error code 0x8007000A when I attempt to update Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition. I have had this problem before and it made my system unusable. I had to make an entirely new user profile in order to resolve the problem, and now it has happened
 again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(By unusable,&nbsp; I mean the taskbar froze completely, the computer was really slow and every time I clicked something, I got a "Not Responding" message for at least 2 minutes. I do not want this to happen again!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a bit of research, I have gathered that 0x8007000 errors are due to corrupt system files (although these sites did contain infectious software download links, so these people may have been trying to scare me).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running version 1607 because my laptop is not compatible with any further versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For now, my system is usable however I am not sure if this will change. Before it does, can anyone provide a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Programs should always be installed to C where they integrate themselves into the registry so should remain part of the system image.  Files (including User folders from their Properties &gt; Location tab) can be offloaded to another drive but USB is not optimal because there is a speed bottleneck with USB that doesn't exist in internal drives.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure how you installed the game to an external but it may have damaged System Files.  If you cannot repair them after confirming the image integrity with DISM and then running SFC three separate times, I would do the repair install:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows-10-using-in-place-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows...</a>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several ways to connect a printer to your computer. Which option you choose depends on the device itself, and whether you're at home or at the office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may want to refer to <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SupportTaskIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;taskId=115&amp;prodSeriesId=4066042&amp;prodTypeId=18972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Setup, install, and configure</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-a-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Install a printer</a>&nbsp;and check if that helps.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums. I'm sorry to hear that this game is not able to download. I'd be happy to try and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I recommend deleting the&nbsp;damaged file from your hard drive and the go ahead and
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/console/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clear the system cache</a> on the hard drive that you are downloading the game onto. Follow that guide for the steps on how to properly clear the cache on the hard drive. After you do that, power off the console and then unplug the console from the power supply.
 Wait a few minutes, turn the Xbox on and then go directly into your network settings. Select configure network and then select Test Connection. Make sure the test completes without any errors. Then go ahead and try to download the game again from your Download
 history.</p>

<h2>            error code 0x81000033</h2>
                    
<p>The error code is as follows "Windows backup skipped backing up system image because of the Critical Volumes is not having enough free space. Free up some space by deleting unnecessary files "&nbsp; I am attempting to back up to a external HD which shows 211
 GB free of 232 GB, I would think this is enough space.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to windows 7, the tech that did the install is stumped on this one. I have attempted to contact MS, all I can find is that they are aware of this yet they have not posted a update. It seems that this problem has been in around for at
 least six months</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some help on this one, I am not a tech therefore I would ask, if possible step by step instructions on a repair or patch.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>A jay this stuff is way over my head. I am only a computer user not a tech. I am trying to get in touch with the technician that upgraded me to windows 7, it seems that he has disappeared. let me ask you this,if i cannot get him over to do this fix can i
 just re-install my windows xp media that came with the computer when i bought it, and if so what would need to be done? would i just insert the operating system disc that came from dell?</p>
<p>or being that "backup" is set to backup to my external hard drive would i just need to partition it and create a new letter for that partition? If that is the simple fix could you tell me how to do that?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>yes i need further assistance. The tech that upgraded me to windows 7 is nowhere to be found. Msft is aware that backup and restore does not work and all I get for support for a product I paid for is that it will cost me more money to speak to someone from
 tech support.</p>
<p>Your link took me to a suggestion that is way over my head, I am not a computer tech that is why I paid someone to do the upgrade.</p>
<p>The assistance you can provide are a set of simple to follow instructions on how to re-install my XP without loosing my docs,pics, etc. I have a external HD which I am sure would fit into your instructions, better yet would be a remote repair. Let me know
 how to contact you and we can set it up. That is what MSFT can do for me.</p>
<p>In the meantime I also paid for a upgrade for MS office and two weeks later it is telling me that it is not a legal copy. I do not have the disc from my older version and therefore cannot install it. I am at a loss as to what else to do, If I have to pay
 someone to make backup and restore fuctional then&nbsp; I will have put more money into this computer than I paid for it.</p>
<p>By the way, on another forum a MSFT&nbsp; support person also offered more assistance, when I asked her to contact me, she too vanished.</p>
<p>Long story short,MSFT is aware of this problem and yet they do not seem to be willing to go the extra mile to help, will you?</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Yes, Windows 10 will certainly be available as a digital download of course. You can always create your own backup copy too either on a USB thumbdrive or blank DVD. Microsoft has recently provided an updated Media Creation Tool for Windows 8.1 which streamlines
 downloading setup files for Windows 8.1 32 and 64 bit in different localizations. The media creation allows you save a .ISO file or create a bootable copy on a USB thumbdrive.</p>

</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. Once you upgrade, its yours forever at no additional cost.&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been a issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware.

My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back to your previo

<h2>            I bought something on the wrong account.</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Xbox one S and I created an account on it when creating this account it wanted a parent account and I couldn't deny it which is really stupid. So I created a parent account and wanted to buy a game called rocket league. I couldn't buy it on the child's account (and I didn't know how to change this until now) so I bought the game on a parents account. Now when I want to play rocket league I can't because I bought it on the stupid parent&nbsp;account which I DON'T EVEN FREAKING NEED. No one else is going to be playing my Xbox and it doesn't even need a parent account. So this now means I need to buy ANOTHER COPY OF A GAME I ALREADY BOUGHT FOR $27?!?!</p><p>This is really stupid and if someone can help me get the game over to the other account PLEASE help me.</p>

            is your second display enabled after reboot, or do you have to go to the control panel to enable it again?

            <p>I have this exact same issue . it is HIGHLY ANNOYING. I have searched and there seems to be no solution to this annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it has something to do with the resolution changing for some reason and windows is not smart enough to keep my icons where I put them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is ridiculous behavior, but the kind of thing&nbsp;we just have to live with because usability is a low priority these days. I would like to find a solution for this, but there appears to be no solution.</p>

            <p>I also have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 4 monitors, besides taking icons off of monitors 2, 3 and 4, it also rearranges all of my icons on monitor 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This rearrange part started with my 4th monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using WIN 7 professional.</p>
<p>

            This most probably is due to a faulty charger or a battery.
