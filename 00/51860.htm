<h2>            Watchdog Violation &#47; Dots on screen</h2>
                    I bought a new pc about 2 months ago, (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/iBUYPOWER-Computer-Desktop-i7-9700k-9230/dp/B07J5RPC32/ref=sxin_2_ac_d_pm?keywords=ibuypower&amp;pd_rd_i=B07J5RPC32&amp;pd_rd_r=9225b13c-1892-41c9-9d7a-fc947b4c70e9&amp;pd_rd_w=Mwzld&amp;pd_rd_wg=Sf9sK&amp;pf_rd_p=64aaff2e-3b89-4fee-a107-2469ecbc5733&amp;pf_rd_r=MHY8YMXV6EDZETC0YVK2&amp;qid=1561844390&amp;s=gateway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/iBUYPOWER-Computer-Desktop-i7-9700k-9230/dp/B07J5RPC32/ref=sxin_2_ac_d_pm?keywords=ibuypower&amp;pd_rd_i=B07J5RPC32&amp;pd_rd_r=9225b13c-1892-41c9-9d7a-fc947b4c70e9&amp;pd_rd_w=Mwzld&amp;pd_rd_wg=Sf9sK&amp;pf_rd_p=64aaff2e-3b89-4fee-a107-2469ecbc5733&amp;pf_rd_r=MHY8YMXV6EDZETC0YVK2&amp;qid=1561844390&amp;s=gateway</a>)
 And for the past 2-5 days ive has "dots" appear on my screen occasionally when i play the games "Heroes of the storm" or "world of warcraft". It would make my screen go black sometimes and run really slowly. I have reset my computer and reinstalled the game,
 and the black screen issue seems fixed, but the dots are still there. They are small to medium sized and are varying colors appearing in the top left and top right of my screen. My computer crashed at one point and gave me the BSOD saying "DPC_Watchdog_violation"

            Hi One.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Can we see a screenshot of the artifacts?  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) Adjust the screen resolution until it fits and looks best at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />4) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />5) Especially if you're not already on the latest version   then I'd run a Repair Install by installing Media Creation Tool to choose Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place.  It also advances you to the newest version which you need anyway, and by the most stable method.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />6) But If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:   
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi thatonehaloguy
<br />
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            I dont have a screenshot right now, it mainly happens in the one game, but ive had small symptoms of black shapes appearing on my screen very faintly in other games. If its not too much of a hassle, im not the smartest computer wise, so how would i go
 about updating all my drivers individually and such?

            Since it looks like a Custom Build, unless iBuyPower gives you a Support Downloads webpage where they keep the drivers updated, I'd start with the Intel Driver Updater to get the chipset  here:
<br /><a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />Follow the steps carefully to install and run it from your browser.  
<br />
<br />Then do the same with the Nvidia Driver update utility here:
<br /><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />
<br />Now do the same for the audio, wireless or LAN driver, and any others that are not new  by checking each one's make/model in Device Manager, go to the maker's Support Downloads web page to download and install the latest.  
<br />
<br />All ways to update drivers are also illustrated here:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />Let me know if there is anything else you need help with to complete all steps I gave.

            Hi thatonehaloguy
<br />
<br />The minidump file indicates your Nvidia graphics card device driver as the root cause of your system crashes, most likely Windows 10 updates is installing a version of that driver that is incompatible with your system, an older version of that driver may stabilize your system . . .
<br />
<br />1
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />2
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<h3> jchd tech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Problem with Printers &#38; Scanners</h2>
                    <p>After rolling out the latest Windows update (1903), we can no longer manage our printers via Printers and Scanners (Under Settings).&nbsp;&nbsp; When we click on the Manage button, nothing happens.&nbsp; The highlighter simply goes to the next printer in line.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our printers are deployed via a GPO and are addressed via a Windows Printer Servers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows devices (One Note) work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we go to Devices and Printers (via Control Panel) we can still mange the printers are expected.&nbsp; If we can the default printer in Devices and Printers, we can see the change in Printers and Scanners (but we can't change it there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else seeing this issue and found a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3> vengince  say:</h3>
<h2>            Good alternative controller for Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know of a good, high quality controller for the Xbox One that has durable bumpers? I bought a new controller after my left bumper quit working. Four months later the same issue has happened on the new controller. After researching I can't seem to find an official Microsoft controller that does not have this issue (I checked elite and newer versions) so I am looking for a third party controller that matches or exceeds the overall quality of the Xbox one controllers, but with more durable/reliable bumpers.&nbsp;</p><p>So far it seems my only option would be the Elite controller or something similar where I can map the left bumper to an extra underside button (or whatever they are called).&nbsp;</p><p>I would also like to keep the price no higher than $100.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 doesn&#39;t see the PCIe sound card I put in</h2>
                    <p>I just bought an Asus Xonar DGX audio card. &nbsp;I have Windows 64-bit home premium. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer will not recognize it so the driver won't let me install it. &nbsp;It's also not listed in device manager. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked that the card was ok by putting it in an old Vista computer I had and it was recognized right away, listed on device manager under other devices before I installed the driver and then I was able to install the driver and use it. &nbsp;Then it was listed
 under sound and I was able to do somethings I currently can't do on the sound card built into my mother</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every piece of advice I could find - I've disabled the motherboard audio in the bios first, I've even reset the motherboard by taking the battery out and still the same error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>please plug-in asus xonar dgx audio device</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the PCIe slots and same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated. I don't know if a replacement sound card would work any better. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<div>
<p>Normally, you can download items from your download history for no additional charge. Make sure the item is in your download history. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your console, sign in to Xbox LIVE. </li><li>Go to&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>Account</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Download History</b>. </li><li>Select the item in your download history and select&nbsp;<b>Download Again</b>. </li></ol>
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;If an item does not appear in your console’s download history, it may have been purchased using a different Xbox LIVE account. To see what you purchased on your Xbox LIVE account, see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/check-xbox-live-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check
 your Xbox LIVE bill</a>.</p>
<p>If an item appears in your download history with the option to Buy Now, try the solutions below.</p>
<p><b>Solution 1: Restart your console</b></p>
<p>Restart your console and sign in to Xbox LIVE. If the item in your download history still appears with Buy Now, try the next solution.</p>
<p><b>Solution 2: Purchase the item again (you should not be charged)</b></p>
<p>Go ahead and select the Buy Now option to download the item again. Even though it seems like you’ll be charged again, you should not be charged any additional points because you already purchased the content.</p>
<p>To make sure that your Xbox LIVE account was not billed a second time, learn how to&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/check-xbox-live-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check your Xbox LIVE bill</a>.</p>

<p>Hey guys !</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Lizarddd x already stated that the downloaded game does not show up in his download history and that he has not switched accounts, so those methods will most likely not be too helpful for him :( However LIzarddd x I would definitely recommend checking your
 Xbox Live Bill to confirm it as a purchase. Here is something else you could try :</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Lizardddx can you please go to the game section of the marketplace, locate Resident Evil : Code Veronica HD and click on it. Now, where it would normally state a price to purchase the game, does it say "Download again"?</p>
<p>If this is the case go ahead and click "Download Again" to re-download the title.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps!</p>
<p>--</p>

            Hi JuggzAt0mz,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your HOST file question.
<br />
<br />Since it is not being used, it is probably safe to delete the HOST file if everything appears to be running fine.  However, I must ask the reason for wanting to remove.  Relative to all other system files, it is small.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

    <title>Microsoft Sudoku Freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t patrick culp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Sudoku Freezes</h2>
                    Microsoft Sudoku Freezes then if I try to run Task Manager, Sudoku will auto terminate. Everytime I reload the MS game nagger runs first. According to this Community hundreds of others have the same problem. It appears to be related to the nagger time
 out.<br />
I have tried all the Community "fixes" but none work. Microsoft knows the Nagger is causing the problem but correcting it seems not to be cost effective.<br />
Is there any NEW fixes for this NAGGING problem?

            Hi T.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You didnt' mention if you'd tried to reset at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Soduku &gt;  Advanced Options &gt; Reset.
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            I moved the amd64 and i386 folders to another partition, later deleted them there, and now have 0-byte copies still in my recycle bin which refuse to go away or restore.</h2>
                    I found folders containing these subfolders on my C:\ drive, and thought I'd move them to another partition, since they were not referenced in the registry.&nbsp; Years later I deleted those same folders, and then delated then deleted again from recycle bin.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But they refuse to go away... remaining as 0-byte files with attrib C.&nbsp; Will not restore.&nbsp; Recycle bin has no security tab by which I could take control of these nuisances, and Unlocker didn't work.<br />
<br />
Any way to rebuild Recycle bin or otherwise clear the decks?&nbsp; The files remain an embarrassing reminder of my foolishness, but otherwise my system is still fine.

            See if this sounds like your situation and respond accordingly:<br />
<br />
When some programs (including Windows programs) installs things, it may create a temporary folder consisting of 20-30 random letters and numbers or random numbers and letters in the root drive of the volume with the most free space.
<br />
<br />
This explains why sometimes the folders are on your C drive or on some other drive - which one has the most free space?
<br />
<br />
For example you may see a folder similar to or called: <br />
<br />
D:\9470bb12e8a4f3447657236478e41c5<br />
<br />
There may be other folders and files under that main temporary folder such as amd64 and i386.<br />
<br />
These should normally be removed when the installation is complete, but sometimes they are not - especially if the installation fails.&nbsp; They are harmless but annoying.&nbsp; You may think something is wrong when there is not or be afraid the files are really needed.&nbsp;
 To avoid confusion you can delete the temporary folders.<br />
<br />
If your installation failed or the installation does not delete the randomly named folder when it completes running the installation again will make another randomly named folder.
<br />
<br />
You may be able to identify the installation (for curiosity) by looking at some of the folder contents and decide if that installation was okay, just delete the files/folders.&nbsp; If the installation did not work properly for some reason, running the installation
 again will just create a new randomly named temporary folder so the old temporary folder is really of no use.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the folders are stubborn to delete.&nbsp; Even if you are an Administrator on the system you may get a "sharing violation", "access denied", "being used" or similar type message when trying to remove the temporary folders.&nbsp; Installations sometimes use
 different permissions than a regular user with Administrator group might have.<br />
<br />
There are many methods to try to remove the folders and some involve third party programs to install or changing certain Windows settings that may compromise your system security if you don't change them back when you are done.<br />
<br />
Booting your system in Safe Mode (pressing the F8 key repeatedly right before XP tries to load) is a good method to try and remove the folders since it doesn't involve making any changes to your system configuration or downloading any third party programs.<br />
<br />
If Safe Mode does not work you can change the security of the folder when booting in Normal Mode to give your user Full Control over the folders by browsing to it in Explorer, click Tools, Folder Options, View and in the Advanced settings window, uncheck (at
 the very bottom of the list) Use simple file sharing (Recommended), and click OK.&nbsp; This turns off the recommended simple file sharing on your computer so you will want to turn it back on when you are finished doing whatever you are doing.<br />
<br />
Right click the folder(s) of interest, Properties and click the now visible Security tab.&nbsp; Alter the Properties however you need to (for example, Select your user name and check the box to allow Full Control), click OK to apply the changes.<br />
<br />
With the Use simple file sharing enabled (Recommended) box checked the folder Properties tabs are:<br />
<br />
General, Sharing, Customize<br />
<br />
With the Use simple file sharing disabled (Recommended) box UNchecked, the folder Properties tabs are:<br />
<br />
General, Security, Customize<br />
<br />
Now try to manipulate/delete the folder.<br />
<br />
It is a good idea to go back into Explorer and put the check back in the box for Use simple file sharing (Recommended) when you have finished doing whatever you are doing.<br />
<br />
If none of the above work, try a popular third party tool called Unlocker.<br />
<br />
Unlocker can be download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/</a><br />
<br />
If you use Unlocker, be careful installing it since it wants to add a bunch of options, addons, shortcuts, and other extras you don't need.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You will need to add the shell extension so when you right click on the offending folder, you will have an Unlocker option to choose.&nbsp; I would just install it long enough to clean up those leftovers and then, I generally just uninstall it and all parts of it.&nbsp;
 You can always install it again some other day if you need to.<br />
<br />
Unlocker can be uninstalled when you are finished using it.<br />
<br />
Reboot when you are finished to be sure the annoying folders are really gone.<br />
<br />

                    <p>I did not like Win 10 - too many problems.&nbsp; Went back to Win 7.</p>
<p>Tried using iTunes - asked to update - said in&nbsp;could not find&nbsp;a "iTunes6464.msi" to update.</p>
<p>Tried to reinstall iTunes by uninstalling and reinstalling iTunes.&nbsp; Now is says it needs to find the old version - which I uninstalled - before I can install 2.3.1 version of iTunes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Worked with ITunes - spent a lot of time.&nbsp; Now they are telling me it is a "Microsoft" problem.</p>
<p>Help?</p>

            <p>Not sure I follow 100%, but this may hopefully give some pointers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest version of iTunes ( 12.3.1 ) is available here - <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><em>( I've never used the 'older version' links, not sure how accurate they actually are, or if they are just dead links actually leading to the latest version? )</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>iTunes can leave bits of itself behind after apparently being uninstalled. It may be that odd bits were retained by your W7 system. This gives some advice from Apple -

            <p>The <em>("itunes6464.msi")</em> .MSI is an installer file. If its needed for iTunes, Apple should supply it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you download the latest installer as above, you get this missing "itunes6464.msi" message?</p>
<p>Did you try the complete removal of iTunes as per the Apple document above?</p>

    <title>Blue Screen During Sleep Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cortalatorta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen During Sleep Mode</h2>
                    
<p>Lately I've been having a problem where my laptop gets the blue screen while it is in sleep or hibernation mode. It has never happened while I have actually been using the computer.</p>
<p>I ran BugCheck Analysis on the Crash Dumps and came up with the following results:</p>
<p>the crash that occurred on 8/30/10 was probably caused by iastor.sys</p>
<p>the crash that occurred on 9/6/10 was probably caused by pci.sys</p>
<p>the crash that occurred on 9/14/10 was probably caused by pci.sys</p>
<p>I can post the actual debugging results as well as the critical error messages if needed. What needs to be done with these files in order to fix my blue screen problem? I should point out that I'm not extremely computer savvy and that I consider getting
 this far an accomplishment in and of itself, so don't hesitate to talk down to me.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Good idea would be to update all major drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drives. Doing that<br />
would likely correct the issues the system has now and help prevent others in the future. Check<br />
with your system maker (motherboard maker&nbsp;for custom systems) and&nbsp;the chipset maker. You<br />
can also determine the&nbsp;chipset maker&nbsp;and model by using Start&nbsp;- type in the&nbsp;Search box -&gt;<br />
System Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and double click on it.</p>
<p>Are you using any Roxio or Nero programs? These have been known to cause this problem even<br />
if they were working well for a long period of time. If so check with their support.<br />
<br />
==============================================================<br />
<br />
Check this thread for information on using BlueScreenView, MyEventViewer, and other methods to<br />
troubleshoot BlueScreens -&nbsp;top 3 replies (+1 other). There is also information on updating drivers.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990</span></a><br />

<br />
More troubleshooting help though the key is updating as mentioned above.<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See next message for my<br />
generic driver update methods.</strong></p>

<br />
See the troubleshooter links posted above for methods to update drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi appinger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums. I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set to block name sharing completely by going into your Xbox Live privacy settings and setting the option to share your name as Blocked. Follow this support article to help you with name sharing and how to block it:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/real-name-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/real-name-sharing</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as far as the chat issue in Sea of Thieves, I found a support article on their support site that walks you through how to set it up but I did also find two threads on Sea of Thieves forums and Reddit stating there are issues with the voice chat so you're
 not the only one. For this matter you will need to get in contact with Rare. Here are the links for reference:</p>

<h2>            Using ISO file to do an inplace repair of Windows 10</h2>
                    Can the Windows 10 ISO file be used to repair an existing Windows 10 OS and have user Installed Apps remain installed and operational? I can't find anywhere where there is a clear consensus on that issue.<br />
<br />
If the answer is yes to my first question Is there a webpage with clear instructions on how to perform this operation?

            <p>Stanley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had found that site prior to posting this question, but (unless I'm just missing it) it doesn't appear to answer the question I have on user installed apps. I'm "assuming" that this should work just like an upgrade install (I used the ISO method on my
 Windows&nbsp; 8.1 Pro PC, that was taking its good old time giving me the option to upgrade to Windows 10, and it kept all my self installed apps).
<br />
<br />
If this works like I think it will I don't understand why Microsoft doesn't either give this option in the Windows recovery and repair options built into Windows 10 or at least make it known this is the option to try first before resetting Windows or starting
 all over with a fresh install.<br />
<br />
I'm in this pickle because the Edge browser crashed (and now having problems with a couple Windows Store Apps) and none of the options I've found for repairing Edge or the Store have worked completely.</p>

<p>You asked, "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Can the Windows 10 ISO file be used to repair an existing Windows 10 OS and have user Installed Apps remain installed and operational?</span>"<br />

<p>The web page states, "<span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">The options above are great for what they are intended for, but you could also do a repair install of Windows 10

            Sorry Shenan, I copied and pasted your name wrong. :(<br />
<br />
I've done all those suggested fixes (including going back to a restore point, but since I seldom use Edge I'm not sure when it became corrupted). SFC /scannow doesn't find any problems so I've never tried the DISM tool and I had tried all the Edge fixes, which
 made Edge partially functional, but it is still buggy (it won't save cookies, shows a "Can't clear all...try again" when clearing history options, and some webpages don't load completely).

            I tried resetting Edge but it did not correct the problem (Edge went from not working at all to not working correctly).
<br />
<br />
I finally used the Windows inplace upgrade with the ISO file and other than having to uninstall and reinstall my Norton Security and&nbsp;not being able to use my PC for over an hour everything seems to be working&nbsp;fine (it even fixed a couple annoying little glitches
 I had been experiencing).

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu not showing results - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu not showing results</h2>
                    <p>Well as it says in the title I upgraded to windows 10 and for the first month or so it was working epic... i loved it. then problems came like the WiFi issue that many people have been having (search windows 10 WiFi fix on YouTube). Now i just installed
 razer cortex which is a cool game booster but when i open the start menu to search or even when i use the search button( cortana isn't available in my area) and type in ANYTHING if its something that doesn't exists on my PC for sure or even something like
 uninstall. It just shows the 5 dots racing across the top of the bar which i suppose means loading but the results never pop up. I have tried searching the windows forums and also google and YouTube but no one had made a video or post on how to fix this. Since
 i cant search i cant uninstall things either. But i can still use settings and file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks- Dark</p>

    <title>360 Slim HDMI will no longer show up on older plasma &#40;50Hz&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mad ady  say:</h3>
<h2>            360 Slim HDMI will no longer show up on older plasma &#40;50Hz&#41; TV&#38;&#35;39&#59;s after connecting to new 60Hz 4k TV.</h2>
                    
<p>I have about 5 or 6 xbox 360 Slim's in my house.</p>
<p><br />
My main Slim that I use the most myself, has developed a fault where it will no longer display any video/audio through HDMI after I connected &amp; used it on a new 4k TV.</p>
<p>It works through HDMI on my new TV and a new-ish monitor, both of these support 60Hz signal. The older Plasma's don't work on this one however.</p>
<p>If I connect another 360 Slim to the same HDMI cords &amp; plasma TV's, it works fine. Yes, I have tried all the resetting of display settings, and tried manually entering the display resolutions etc.</p>

<p>I have connected it with a HDMI/VGA cable, RCA, Composite etc &amp; it works fine on other displays, it just won't work on HDMI with older TV's any more.</p>
<p>I've forced 50Hz by using an old Composite/TV cable &amp; switched to "TV" to get 576i/50Hz, but when I plug in HDMI it defaults to 60Hz.</p>

<p>Testing different display resolutions when connected to my new TV or monitor, I can set a resolution &amp; it will set @ 60Hz, then test @ 50Hz, which it works on, but then the display output reboots @ 60Hz.</p>

<p>Almost 100% sure it is a frequency issue, as the older TV's/Plasma's are most likely 50Hz displays.</p>
<p>I have exhausted 'chat support' on the issue, and they suggested posting here to see if anyone else has had the issue &amp; maybe if they have found a solution.</p>
<p>They have also agreed that connecting another 360 to the new display may have the same effect - causing the 360 to block 50Hz displays from then on.</p>

<p>This would seem to be a software/update issue preventing the console from booting into a 50Hz resolution/output when connected to a display that only supports 50Hz. Resetting the display settings has not resulted in getting a picture.</p>

<p>According to Support, there is no factory reset feature for the display drivers/firmware/software.</p>

<p>Any suggestions???</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>My 360 Slim WILL display on older TV's when I use an Xbox One in pass-through or TV mode!</p>
<p>Interestingly, when I power on the older TV with the XBone, it momentarily displays 60Hz on the screen, so I think that the TV will display 60Hz fine. Rebooting the TV confirms that it is receiving 60Hz signal fine, plus when I change between resolutions
 etc on the XBone, the TV handles all settings no probs.</p>
<p>This means that the 360 is somehow not detecting the TV &amp; applying the correct HDMI output to get a signal. The 360 Slim HDMI must be detecting the XBone as a valid HDMI receiver, &amp; the One is then handling the 360 output to suit the TV.</p>
<p>Points more &amp; more to an issue with the Slim Box's HDMI management. Forcing manual settings still doesn't work - if I plug the Slim into the TV after seeing it work through the XBone, there is no signal.</p>
<p>What do you make of that???</p>
