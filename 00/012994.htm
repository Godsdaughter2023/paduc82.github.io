    <title>Word Documents Open to a Page Full of Highlighted Dashed Lines - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word Documents Open to a Page Full of Highlighted Dashed Lines</h2>
                    <p>Hello there. Does anyone know how to fix this issue within Word (see screenshot) where documents just open to a full page full of highlighted dashed lines? I've been trying to solve this for almost a year! I cannot find anything on the internet and so I'm
 finally asking the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dual monitor set up. The strange part is that when I drag the Word doc to the main monitor, it works fine. However, when I only have one monitor set up, the dashed lines are seen when the page is in minimized view but goes away when maximized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone out there dealt with this? Thank you!</p>

            Well, that is certainly weird, but here is one thing you can try: Go to <strong>
File | Options | Advanced: Display</strong> and check the box for "Disable hardware graphics acceleration." If it's already checked, you could try clearing it, but this is not likely to help, but you might try updating your video driver.

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade disk request&#63;</h2>
                    Has anyone determined if we can purchase a disk for each version of Windows 10 (Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Home) to use for upgrading machines on slow/metered connections (Hughes Net).&nbsp; I have 3 computers I will have to upgrade which HAVE to use Hughes
 Net due to their locations. <br />
In addition, what if I need to reinstall at a later date or build a new system and want to use the same product key (disposing of current PC)?<br />
Regardless, I like having the disk and do not mind paying a fee for the actual disk to accompany my free upgrade needs.<br />

            <p>You want an installation disk, just make one. &nbsp;That is standard procedure. &nbsp;Use the Media Creation Tool to make either a dvd or usb installer, or make both. &nbsp;Make all you want. &nbsp;No need to spend money for postage and packaging anymore. &nbsp;The cost of a dvd
 is half a buck, maybe.</p>

 Finally after awhile it said to reboot and when I did it came back with 16215 and Windows Update saying again&nbsp;"<strong>Status</strong>: Installing - 54%"</p>

<h3> eric sauvageau - mep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013&#58; how to import digital signature from a received Email</h2>
                    In previous Outlook versions, when you received a signed Email you were able to import the digital signature into your contacts by right-clicking on the Email address and telling it to update the contact.<br />
<br />
In Outlook 2013 this option to update doesn't exist anymore.<br />
<br />
My contact sent me an Email with his new digital signature.&nbsp; How do I update the entry in my Contacts to add this new digital ID to it?<br />
<br />

            I guess we may have to wait if there is an update on this from MS. As we are also facing the same issue (no option to save the digital signature) in Outlook 2013.<br />
<br />
I hope they release an update for same as they did for Outlook 2007 in July 2010:<br />

            So Microsoft broke a pretty important feature of Outlook (the ability to properly use Digital IDs), and nobody seems to know anything yet as to how to work around, and no hotfix from Microsoft either.&nbsp; I wish they would spend less time trying to find new
 ways to confuse existing users by rearranging the UI, and more time making sure that the existing feature keep working.&nbsp; This is even more frustrating when you realize that the feature was broken due to UI changes, not even due to actual code or functionality
 changes.<br />

            It doesn't appear to be solved yet. The only way that I've found that adds an ID is to create a new Contact for this person. I've been deleting old ones and then adding them back as new. PITA.

<p><span>A fix for this very scenario was released as part of the April 2016 CU for Outlook 2013..

<p><span>The fix work for Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016 were carried out through the following QFE bugs, and the fix for Outlook 2016 has been checked into the following build :</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">

<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">User Scenario: Detailed Repro Steps</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><br />
<span>1 - Receive a signed mail from an external sender.
<br />
</span><span>2 - Right click on the external sender and Add to Contacts.
<br />
</span><span>3 - Go to the contact and delete the certificate.
<br />
</span><span>OR <br />
</span><span>3- Have the sender send you a signed email with a new certificate.
<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>Now we're in the repro scenario. <br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>4 - Try to figure out how to get the cert from the signed mail to the existing contact.
<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Explain Defect:</span></strong><span>
<br />
</span><span>The ability to modify or update the certificate field on a contact is not available in the contact card.
<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Explain Fix:</span></strong><span>
<br />
</span><span>Fix is to show the "Add to Contacts" menu option to the user if they set the policy reg key TurnOnLegacyGALDialog=1. By doing this all the fields are available to the user and they
 can update the certificate."</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>I DID apply the registry fix to enable the Legacy GAL View and can once again see the "Cerficate" field on the contact card.&nbsp; I
 received a signed email from someone who had previously sent me a signed email(so I already had a cert captured for this contact).&nbsp; Performed a right click on the contact in the email, opened the Outlook Contact Card, and the Certificates selection is now
 available again.&nbsp; If I save the contact, Outlook sees that I already have an existing contact and performs an update... of the certificate data for the contact!&nbsp; Of course, it was a REPLACE and not an update, so the old certificate is now gone.&nbsp; Two steps
 forward, and one step back.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Progress.... now we have to work on retaining the old certs too please Microsoft!</span></span></p>

</p><p>I created a folder and shared it with the rest of the team, however, we are currently not able to share anything as once we want to upload a document from our phones through the One Drive App(iOs), the shared folder&nbsp;is missing from the list of folders they
 have, they can upload it to existing&nbsp;folders they created on their account only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps we're going through:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the App, </p>
<p>they access the shared folder, </p>
<p>take a picture of a document to be added in it,</p>
<p>OneDrive ask for the folder</p>
<p>Can't find the shared folder in the list of existing folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your support.</p>

            Hi Danitto,
<div><br />
<div>Since you posted in the Outlook forum, I'm assuming your first question is concerning Outlook and iCloud. Outlook for Mac does not currently support syncing iCloud contacts or Calendars. You can read more about this on the link below:</div>

            Hi. Do you mean that this error message only appears when using the Internet Explorer? If yes, it is possible that the message is a pop-up message from a website. Aside from this, do you have other issues with the phone or does it display odd behavior?
 Let me know by responding to this thread.

    <title>How can I get pivot tables in Access 2013&#63; What kind of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mnh1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get pivot tables in Access 2013&#63;  What kind of programming do I need to learn&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;First off, is there any way for me to build&nbsp;pivot tables in Access&nbsp;with SQL or to&nbsp;link to&nbsp;pivots built&nbsp;in Excel without exporting my entire (rather large) database?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My office upgraded everyone to windows 7, and immediately all of my data connections between Access and InfoPath (both&nbsp;the 2003 versions) stopped working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; It turns out the use a different language than Windows 7 and so&nbsp;can't communicate with each other when run on the newer OS, but the newer versions of Access and InfoPath work just fine with Windows 7.&nbsp; Okay, that makes sense.&nbsp; I really didn't expect Windows
 to keep everything backwards compatible forever and after 10 years, it makes sense that they might&nbsp;change their&nbsp;programming language.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;my company&nbsp;upgraded me to Access 2013, InfoPath 2013, and 2010 versions of the rest of the MS office set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened Access 2013 for the first time and discovered that all my lovely automated reports have been destroyed.&nbsp; I was expecting to need to work out some bugs, re-establish some connections, etc.&nbsp; I was not expecting to lose the ability to view pre-existing
 pivot tables and reports.&nbsp; I hadn't thought I would completely lose my automated reports&nbsp;even if I kept the database file in the older version's formatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't go back to the older version of Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access 2003&nbsp;can't communicate with our central database when run&nbsp;in Windows 7 (making it useless) and since IT just spent the last month moving the datacenter and everyone linked to it to Windows 7..&nbsp; Changing
 back isn't an option.&nbsp; Since I'm stuck in Windows 7 and with the newer version of Access, I need to either figure out how to build new pivots and automate them or get rid of Access completely and find something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My database is large enough that exporting the&nbsp;query results&nbsp;to Excel for formatting everytime I want to check a trend isn't really practical.</p>

<p>Everytime I've updated/upgraded MS software in the past, I've enjoyed new features and increased functionality. This time, the&nbsp;program's compatibility with Windows 7&nbsp;is the only&nbsp;new feature it has that&nbsp;I want and I'm worried I've lost everything else that
 made the program worthwhile for me.</p>

            <p>I know&nbsp;pivot tables&nbsp;have been removed.&nbsp; That's why I was upset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First--I was looking for suggestions on how I can get similar results using SQL.&nbsp; Someone had suggested I could use SQL with InfoPath to both add new files to my database and to get summary results similar to a pivot table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone else suggested I could use SQL and cross tab queries to the same end, but as far as I can tell, cross tab queries are a pretty darn awful&nbsp;substitute for pivots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I take the time to learn SQL, I was hoping to find out if anyone else has had good results using it this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second-- I keep reading that Access 2013 got rid of it's data analysis functions because Microsoft expects users will use Access to manage their database and use Excel to analyse date from it.&nbsp; If that's their expectation, I'd hoped they had built in&nbsp;a less
 painful way to link the two than to just export/import data back and forth, and I had just missed it, or that someone had figured out a better way to do that with code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third-- Since the other reason Microsoft dropped so many features from Access was to make it more appealing for use with sharepoint and&nbsp;cloud computing, I was hoping they might have also worked on some sort of expansion pack that would restore full functionality
 for those&nbsp;of us&nbsp;who will never be using sharepoint&nbsp;or for whom security issues just&nbsp;make cloud computing a bad idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the boards where people usually expect to be coding solutions to their software issues don't have much of a forum for&nbsp;fixing issues with MS 2013 yet, so I thought I'd try the official community.</p>

            <p>1st... SQL with InfoPath, never tried it so can't give help there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crosstab queries do not come close to Pivot tables, though I suppose with some hair pulling, you could get something to work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd... Not sure where you are reading that but for me, that would depend on the data and what I am doing with it.&nbsp; ( times out of 10 I do everything in Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3rd... I'm not sure where you got that from but in my opinion it was to let Excel do what it does and let Access do what it does.&nbsp; I have never used Access for Pivot tables, never thought they belonged there.&nbsp; I even hate it for charts unless the End User
 just wants some simple pie chart, again, that is what Excel is for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wish I could say I come across someone who has some coding to assist but I haven't...</p>

            <p>The old, late, much-missed&nbsp;pivot charts and tables in Access were very quick, conveneint and easily automated.&nbsp; I'm just really not fond of having to navigate back and forth across different programs to get some very basic statistics the one program used
 to&nbsp;generate&nbsp;by itself.&nbsp; Mostly, I just don't like going through all the pain and downtime associated with&nbsp;upgrading/changing software only&nbsp;to&nbsp;end up&nbsp;with more work than I had before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I'm just moving everything&nbsp;over to SQL server.&nbsp; Using infopath as a front end and SQL for the rest&nbsp;will make generating reports quicker in the long run even if there's some cost now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a&nbsp;positive point, even if the 2013 series is more limited, the new&nbsp;layout and themes are very pretty.&nbsp; It looks so clean, crisp, and minimalist&nbsp;I wouldn't mind using&nbsp;most of the 2013&nbsp;programs&nbsp;on a tablet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For everything else, I'll adapt.</p>

            <p>I just purchased the newest version of Access 2013 for my home use, to see what's on the horizon.&nbsp; How disappointing!&nbsp; I've used and imbedded pivot tables and pivot charts in most of the applications I've built over the years because it's such a powerful
 tool for even the most novice user.&nbsp; Not having this functionality greatly impedes the use and ability for shop floor users who may not be capable of switching softwares.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be requesting my money back.&nbsp; If I had known the functionality would be missing, I would not have updated my software.&nbsp; As a db application builder for my company, I'll have to stop using MS Access and switch to another option.&nbsp; There's no use continuing
 to go down a dead end road.&nbsp; That's several hundred liscenses - what a screw up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had wanted to put&nbsp;data in Excel, I would have done it to start with.&nbsp; I'm really disappointed in Microsoft!&nbsp; No market research was done before making this change!</p>

            It isnt as nice as having the pivots directly in Access, but you can have an excel spreadsheet link to your access datasource.

            &nbsp;
<p>One way too overcome this problem of misisng pivot table function is to use the sql function together with the group function, count&nbsp; or sum function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give an example below:</p>
<p>SELECT Table1.F1, Table1.F2, Count(Table1.F2) AS CountOfSite, Sum(Table2.Sep2014) AS SumOfSep2014</p>
<p>FROM Monthly_Extract1Oct2014 INNER JOIN (Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 ON (Table1.[F1] = Table2.[F1]) AND (Table1.F3= Table2.Country)) ON Monthly_Extract1Oct2014.Location_Name = Table1.F2</p>
<p>GROUP BY Table1.F1, Table1.F2;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>you may use Create-Query Design to come out with a simple SQL, then modify from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope it helps.</p>

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;
<p>One way too overcome this problem of misisng pivot table function is to use the sql function together with the group function, count&nbsp; or sum function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give an example below:</p>
<p>SELECT Table1.F1, Table1.F2, Count(Table1.F2) AS CountOfSite, Sum(Table2.Sep2014) AS SumOfSep2014</p>
<p>FROM Monthly_Extract1Oct2014 INNER JOIN (Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 ON (Table1.[F1] = Table2.[F1]) AND (Table1.F3= Table2.Country)) ON Monthly_Extract1Oct2014.Location_Name = Table1.F2</p>
<p>GROUP BY Table1.F1, Table1.F2;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That's merely a simple aggregating query.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pivot table view is more akin to a crosstab query, e.g.<br />
<br />
TRANSFORM FIRST(Evaluations.Recommendation)<br />
SELECT Employees.Firstname, Employees.Lastname<br />
&nbsp;FROM (Employees INNER JOIN Evaluations <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ON Employees.EmployeeID=Evaluations.EmployeeID) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INNER JOIN Positions <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ON Evaluations.PositionID=Positions.PositionID<br />
GROUP BY Employees.Firstname, Employees.Lastname<br />
PIVOT Positions.Position;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>which returns the recommendation for each employee in relation to each position for which they have been evaluated, returning the evaluation at the inresection of the employee row and the position column.</p>

            Thanks for your reply; unfortunately SQL can't provide the solution, which is a form, selectable from a menu which produces a data driven 'spreadsheet' indefinitely wide and deep that my users can filter at will without any further development from me.
 &nbsp;How do you explain to executives who have invested heavily in a bespoke system that their management reporting tools have just been 'deprecated', to use Microsoft's weasel word. &nbsp;I expect new versions to be better and with more features than their predecessors.
 &nbsp;That way my application code isn't shoved into an evolutionary dead end for no good reason.

</p><p>Have you received an e-mail from Skype confirming successful processing of your credit purchase?</p>
<p>Please check your account dashboard (portal) at skype.com first to see if the credit appears there ... sometimes when this happens, people have more than one Skype account and have purchased the credit on their "other" account.</p>
<p>If not, check with your payment method to see if there were any problems processing the payment.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>After checking all of the above, then contact Skype Customer Service.</p>

<p><span>According to the error message,
</span><span>It seems the Azure AD has federated domain here. If the invited user is not present in the cloud tenant, Azure AD tries to create the user. If user domain is federated, we don</span><span>'</span><span>t have
 permission to create the user. In such scenario whoever is invited, should contact their administrator to sync their identity to cloud and then they should be able to accept the invitation.</span></p>

    <title>Saving emails to a computer folder from Outlook 2016 under Win 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arthurcrump  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving emails to a computer folder from Outlook 2016 under Win 2010 produces pdfs with msg extensions&#33;</h2>
                    When I save an email from Outlook 2016 (on Win 10) to a folder on my computer it gets saved as a pdf and has the pdf symbol attached to the left of the filename in File Explorer although it retains the (.msg) extension. &nbsp;When double-clicked it tries to
 open in Acrobat, but fails as an error message says it's incompatible, which I understand because it's a msg extension. &nbsp;I tried changing its file association from Acrobat (which was automatically set when I saved the file) to Outlook but I can't see how to
 do this. &nbsp;The problem is that all the other emails, representing years of important client records, previously saved from my previous Outlook 2007 have automatically defaulted to 'Acrobat msg' files too.<br />
<br />
I would REALLY appreciate your assistance please. &nbsp;Many thanks. &nbsp;Arthur

<p>Hello Arthur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the concern is file association related. Just to confirm; when you go to your computer's
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Default apps</strong> and then click on
<strong>Re</strong><strong>set</strong>, are you encountering any error messages?

<br />
Please elaborate on your symptom.&nbsp; E.g. is there a Taskbar icon for IE at this time or just the iexplore.exe task in TM's Processes tab?&nbsp; Also, is there only one iexplore.exe running then and if so, is Crash Recovery disabled?<br />
<br />
The fact that IE is running fine in safe mode with Networking means that something that you start normally isn't running then and that something is causing the interference.&nbsp;&nbsp; One example would be misconfigured security software such as Windows&nbsp;Live Family
 Safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I once had that installed and screwed up so badly that it caused the symptom you are reporting.&nbsp; Another one which used to cause it long ago to me is jusched.exe which is used to check whether Sun Java is up to date.&nbsp; Etc.<br />

            Thank you for replying.

<div>I have already gone into msconfig and chosen diagnostic startup. This disables all non&nbsp;essential&nbsp; services (inc parental control) and startup items. This did not assist.</div>

<div><br />
<div>When I try to start IE, the mouse pointer gets the blue circle above for a few moments the iexplore.exe task appears in &nbsp;task manager, then the mouse pointer goes back to normal. IE screen does not open at all. tried clicking on ie 20 times, I get 20 instances
 of iexplore.exe in the task manager but nothing else.</div>

Obviously there is still something running then which is not running in safe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have to make lists and compare them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tip: &nbsp;both msinfo32.exe&nbsp;and Process Explorer (aka ProcExp) enable the capture of their displays which can make such comparisons
 more practicable.&nbsp; ProcExp can show you all your loaded drivers in the DLL display for the System task.&nbsp;&nbsp; So your diagnostic startup should be a good start at reducing the number of items you will need to compare.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

    <title>Internet Explorer 9 32bit stops responding on Windows 7 64bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nada_clue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 9 32bit stops responding on Windows 7 64bit</h2>
                    Exact same thing here. IE 32-bit will throw up a normal-looking window (if you have the home page set to blank). But it can't access a single URL. It just 'stops responding'.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not only that, but, after being driven nuts when it happened initially, I did a clean reinstall of Windows and all 200 programs -- which completely solved the problem FOR ABOUT 6 WEEKS, only to have the EXACT SAME THING HAPPEN AGAIN.</div>
<div><br />
During this second go-round, after it started screwing up, for a while it would load local HTML files, but now it won't even do that.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>The 'problem event' is always either&nbsp;AppHangB1 or&nbsp;AppHangXProcB1. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not know if, in my case, it's associated with a windows update, because I use multiple browsers and a day or two can easily go by without my ever using IE 32-bit, so I can't pinpoint exactly when it happened.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My other computer, which is older hardware but otherwise configured almost exactly the same, has no such problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I too have tried EVERY KNOWN browser 'fix''. Disable all add-ons/BHOs, disable/reenable services, Reset, nuke all the caches, reconfigure TCPIP, check hosts file, re-register all the DLLs, try different zone/security settings etc. I too rolled back to
 IE8, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Nothing helps. IE 32-bit is completely non-functional And yet every other browser works fine: Chrome, Firefox, Firefox Nightly 64-bit, Opera, Safari, and of course IE 64-bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Come on, Microsoft, this is a HUGE BLACK EYE for you. This is not the only post to mention this problem; it's obviously happening to more than a few user. Every time you run a TV ad for IE9 and its 'beautiful web', I want to buy a shotgun and pull an Elvis
 on it.</div>

            I will try all those this weekend and report back. Or, actually, RE-try them, because I already did try that stuff--back at the end of Feb, the first time this problem came up. Well, I didn't try the safe-mode-networking. But the clean boot, the turn Windows
 features on/off -- I tried all those. Nothing helped at all. The only thing that fixed the problem was a full clean reinstall.
<div><br />
<div>[edit] BTW, one other 'obvious' thing I tried a few days ago was to create a brand new user account, just in case mine was somehow corrupted. Didn't help. And now I can't delete the damn folder for that account! Even though I created the account, I then
 deleted the account (after determining IE wouldn't run there, either), and I took possession of the folder. What's with that?? If I delete the folder (in 'Users'), Windows re-creates it every time the PC boots, even though the account is completely deleted.</div>
<div><br />
<div>[edit] UPDATE: I tried the safe mode w/ntwkg today (4/26). No difference. IE32 cannot do anything other than throw up its blank window. Attempting to browse either local files or the internet crashes the app, even in safe mode.<br />
&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Btw, OTHER software that I presume SHARES some of IE32's underpinnings -- dlls and system hooks and call functions, etc -- is UNAFFECTED.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows Live Mail, for example, works fine (the standalone app, the component of 'Windows Live Essentials'). It is ONLY IE32 that doesn't work. I can't even do 'file, open' with it--I can get the little 'open' box but the minute I enter an address, or
 even click the 'browse' button to browse for a local HTML file, the app crashes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fact that I can't even browse for a local file without crashing the app makes me think this is more fundamental than a networking problem. It's as if some very basic part of the processes by which IE32 hooks into THE SYSTEM, its most basic call functions,
 has been corrupted or short-circuited somehow.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You ask, when did this happen? That is, for the second time. (Remember, this same problem happened back in late February and was so frustrating that it forced me to do a complete clean reinstall the first week of March.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know exactly -- some time last week. I was very deep in a complex project for about 8 days that required a lot of local-machine drudge work but hardly any internet usage, so I barely touched any browser for more than a week.There were some Windows
 updates during that period, and I may have run my email once or twice, but that's all. When I finally came up for air, suddenly IE was no longer working. It makes me suspect something in one of those updates, but I have no hard evidence.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for security, there is no current security other than Windows defender, so it's clearly not a conflict with a security suite. (And no, it's not an infected PC, either;I did run a local scan with 2 difft standalone no-install malware/antivirus; no problems
 found.) Previously, back when this same problem with IE32 happened in February, I was running Msft Security Essentials. But I had not reinstalled that particular program when I reformatted the PC 7 weeks ago.</div>

            <div>
<div>All right, here’s my update - it’s EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The same problem has now hit my OTHER computer, the older one I call ‘backup’. That one had been out of commission for almost a month with a bad motherboard. When the replacement arrived, it worked again. But during the month it had been out of commission,
 some Windows updates, an Adobe acrobat/reader update, and a video card driver update had built up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Somewhere amongst/betwixt/between those updates, the SAME IE 32-BIT unfixable disaster has now hit it as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All those same updates had been applied on the first computer, the one which prompted my original post. The two machines have the same video card, a Radeon 6870, though they have different-generation CPUs/chipsets. Both have multiple monitors, and both
 are similarly configured in terms of software (the big Adobe suite is only on the main PC, tho).</div>
<div><br />
<div>And, BTW, both computers had been exhibiting a LOT of graphic-driver crashes for at least the past few months. A lot of system-tray popups saying ‘graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered’. That’s why I’ve been manually updating the graphics
 driver every time a new release comes out, in hopes it would fix that problem, which appears to be a known issue — Msft KB2665946, at least, seems to acknowledge the issue and provides one lame temporary ‘band-aid’ fix. It is allegedly due to the recent preponderance
 of hardware-accelerated browsers. I use ALL browsers, and use the dev builds, so I guess that’s a lot of demand for hardware acceleration on my part.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only other possible suspects — changes I can track down that have been applied to both computers recently — would be a silent Google Earth update; installation of Microsoft’s Bing Bar; something called ‘mozilla maintenance’ which appears to come with
 the Firefox 12 update; an update to Flash Player to v 12.2.202.233; and a video downloader called Freemake that I’ve installed (but never used) on both computers. Uninstalling ALL the above, as well as uninstalling every Windows Update going back several months,
 makes NO DIFFERENCE. Neither does rolling back IE9 to IE8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, on BOTH computers now:</div>
<div><br />
<div>• Same problem event: AppHangB1 or AppHangXProcB1.</div>
<div>• Same symptom: IE 32-bit simply ‘stops interacting with Windows’. It appears unable to make basic calls to the system.</div>
<div>• It throws up a window with nothing but borders, everything else whited out.</div>
<div>• It cannot load either local or internet (although it CAN still load a local .gif file).</div>
<div>• It consumes 100% of the cycles on one core of CPU.</div>
<div>• It shows a little pop-up message at bottom claiming the ‘site’ is not responding, but that’s almost surely wrong. It is rather IE that is unable to make the request.</div>
<div>• Event Viewer shows all the hangs, but is otherwise of no real help.</div>
<div>• Nothing unusual shows in task manager or Process Explorer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No known IE ‘fix’ makes any difference. (And I know just about all of them.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>• This includes ‘no add-ons’ / ‘clean boot’ / ‘safe mode’ / reset browser, among many other kinds of troubleshooting.</div>
<div>• uninstalling ANY/ALL of the above mentioned updates does not help</div>
<div>• neither does uninstalling ALL windows updates dating back two months or more</div>
<div>• neither does removing IE in CPL’s ‘turn Windows features on and off’</div>
<div>• neither does uninstalling IE9 and reverting to IE8</div>
<div>• Every other browser works fine, including IE 64-bit, as does Windows Live Essentials.</div>
<div>• Neither computer is infected, at least not with anything detectible by either F-secure EasyClean or Clamwin or Windows Defender.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Really, in almost 20 years of using Windows PCs this is the poorest, most inexcusible showing on Microsoft’s part I’ve seen. I don’t care what or who ‘caused’ the problem. It’s Microsoft’s responsibility, and especially if they’re going to charge triple
 the cost of other operating systems, to assure robust and reliable basic OS functions. These must include, at the very least, three bottom-line indispensibles: instantiating and running hardware and software; keeping the machine safe and secure; and providing
 bulletproof navigation tools for both local and external files and assets.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But Microsoft seems unable to guarantee either function in that last category. When I google ‘high cpu use’ or ‘is not responding’, the greatest number of hits reference either Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer. Thousands and thousands of hits.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Shame on you, Microsoft. Forget spiffing up the interface of Windows Explorer in windows 8, or making your Internet Explorer more standards-complient or hardware-acceleration-friendly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Those are nice, but make them BULLETPROOF FIRST.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And while you’re at it, put up a REAL complaint/suggestion box on your site so users like me can at least feel we’ve done our best to ALERT you to new problems, with some degree of confidence that SOMEBODY THERE reads it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I’m the last person I know who still uses Windows—at least, of all my friends with income &gt; 50K, they’ve all long since switched to Apple. I’ll never do that, because I don’t like the closed-system model and hate cults, and because I want my choice in
 hardware. But my days as the last holdout who speaks up for and DEFENDS Windows against their derisive dismissals are over. And if I could switch to Linux, I would do it in a second. Unfortunately, despite what they’d like you to believe, Linux-universe productivity
 and media software just doesn’t measure up to what’s available on Windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I guess this means is that in future, when all my PCs will have a smallish SSD boot/OS drive, weekly or biweekly disk imaging of that small drive will have to become a necessary part of my backup routine. There appears to be no other way to protect
 yourself against Microsoft’s unreliability.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If Windows is truly this unreliable, maybe Microsoft should rethink the ‘reset’ feature it’s baking into Windows 8 and provide a built-in disk imaging feature as well. For people like me who know enough to keep their documents and stuff safely sequestered
 from the get-go, ‘reset’ is no better than reinstalling the operating system. You still have to re-install hundreds of programs and make whatever customizations to them you’ve come to depend on.</div>

            <p>I am a retired E/E with 23+ years at IBM. I did mainframe design, both electrical(digital) and U-Code development. I too have always defended Microsoft, but this combination of MS 7 and IE-9 64bit&nbsp; software/firmware has exasperated me! With NO source&nbsp;code
 listings,&nbsp;we are at the mercy of a group of engineers who don't talk to each other. What else could explain all the incompatability problems?&nbsp; First, they force MS-7 64 bit on you, by having product&nbsp;manufacturers as HP, Dell, etc. preload all their machines
 with the latest operating system (now it's MS-7 64 bit) and browsers(now IE 9 ).
<strong>Then they Beta test on their customer base</strong>, knowing that 95%+ of the public is not able to trouble shoot&nbsp;the expected problems.They then just wait for the calls and the assured sound of &nbsp; Ka-Ching (the sound of cash registers totaling up the
 money for support of DEFECTIVE firmware / software).&nbsp;If they had a better&nbsp;than just "average" beta test program, fully 80%+ of these problems that are not fixable without waiting for MS to respond with a new software&nbsp;release, or software fixes labeled as&nbsp;updates.
 We will never know how many hardware problems are fixed with firmware or software patches. If they have a race condition in hardware, yes we do still&nbsp;have them, it is far less costly if you can cover it up with a few blocks of code, than to redesign hardware
 on every machine that exhibits this problem. Yes, I know there are software programs to pre-test&nbsp;hardware by varying clocks, voltages,&nbsp;etc. But they don't catch 100% of all close tolerances, that add up over trips through long digital logic chains, which may
 add up due to the configuration of different switch settings and options. It is IMPOSSIBLE to find all of those, "in house", therefore a comprehensive Beta test program is
<strong>essential</strong> to try and flesh out those types of problems. MS is responsible to do that, and sadly to say they do NOT,&nbsp;ergo many of these problems are shipped to the field. Then the public has to pay, both in frustration and money! These are my
 opinions and conclusions, based on my education and experience. If a competative operating system comes along,<strong> and it will</strong>, MS will wish they had listened to their few remaining loyal customers.</p>

Try using ProcMon for better clues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Local files are working that suggests Networking is involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; ProcMon, using just the Process and Threads and Networking filters would allow you to see which modules were involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that in all entries, including
 Profling--if you need to get down to that level, you can get pseudo Stack Back Trace listings (essentially lists of modules involved with that event) or at least&nbsp;lists of the modules loaded by that process.&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I am suggesting you stay away from Registry
 and File activity until you find something interesting using the higher level traces.&nbsp;&nbsp; OTOH if you were finding other diagnostics helpful, such as the IE9 Developer Tools, then you may find that the FileMon portion, in particular Operation Is WriteFile,&nbsp;provides
 a better view of&nbsp;your whole test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>i'm having the same problem with KB2719177.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IE32 freezes up, most menu options are greyed-out and IE in general is non-responsive. I tried clean boot, and uninstall/install, IE (No add-ons) and still no go.</p>
<p>IE64 works fine, but IE32 is the default browser which makes it a major pain in the upper thigh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalling KB2719177 solves the problem, until Windows 7 (64 bit) decides to reinstall it again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would love to have a solution for that (other then the normal restart computer, do a 360 in place, pray to one god or another, run around).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not have that problem earlier this year, and i appreciate all good instentions and understand them, but it looks to me pretty obvious that KB2719177&nbsp;is to blame.</p>

<p>I could set my Hotmail to sync at set intervals but I find it easier to sync manually then I kbow my Calendar is up to date.</p>
<p>So far, everytime I sync, my Hotmail, contacts and Calendar are updated and it has been flawless.</p>

1. Flick left to <strong>S</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>ettings,</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; then tap<strong>E**mail &amp; Accounts</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; . 2. Tap the account that you want to change. 3. Under<strong>Content to sync</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; , tap the check box next to

<p>The primary Windows Live ID (the first one you setup on your phone) only<br />
allows you to choose whether or not to sync email. The calendar and<br />
contacts will always sync, you have no choice there, which is why you don't<br />
the calendar sync listed as an option there.</p>
<p>Do you have more than one calendar on your Windows Live account? WP7 will<br />
only sync the primary calendar.</p>

            <p>Hi Gabriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information. To help us with the investigation, please provide answers to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Where are you sending your emails? Do you sign in on the web (https://outlook.com) or are you using an email client (Windows Live Mail, Microsoft Office Outlook)?</p>
<p>- If you're getting the bounce message when using an email client, do you get the same bounce message when you send emails on the web (https://outlook.com)?</p>
<p>- Do you get the same bounce message when you send to any of your contacts regardless if they're using Microsoft domains (@outlook.com, @live.com, @msn.com, @hotmail.com, etc.) or 3rd party domains (@gmail.com, @yahoo.com, etc.)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using your email address with an email client, I suggest that you remove and re-add it to make sure it's using the correct settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what you'll find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rhyan</p>

            <p>Hi GabrielLindskoug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate you for giving us more information regarding this matter. Based on the bounce message "Status: 5.6.3" that you are getting, that means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The message contains more than 250 attachments. More than 250 attachments cause the MAPI_E_TOO_BIG error.</li><li>Mail that had a malformed addr822 header was sent.</li></ul>
<p>To troubleshoot this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the number of attachments in the message, and then resend the message.&nbsp;
</li><li>Correct the header. This error is misleading because it indicates that the NDR occurs because of the malformed P2 headers.</li></ul>
<p>Furthermore, the bounce message indicates&nbsp;that you failed to send the email to a @gmail.com address. Have you tried sending them to other&nbsp;Microsoft accounts such as @Hotmail.com, @Outlook.com and @MSN.com?&nbsp;What we also need you to do is to send a self test
 email to your own affected email account to check whether you will receive it or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response along with the outcome of those troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Francis S.</p>
