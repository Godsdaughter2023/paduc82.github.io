<h2>            External cd drive will not load software cd but wil play music cd</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new Aspire One netbook with Windows 7 Starter. I also have a brand new external cd drive. It will play a music cd fine, but when I try to load my new Windows 7 Home Premium software, it won't read the cd. It keeps saying "Insert a cd into
 the drive"</p>
<p>What do I do now?</p>

The Windows 7 install disk is a DVD - you can not use a CD drive, a DVD drive is needed instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have Windows 7 Starter you don't need the install disk, you can use Anytime Upgrade.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Anytime Upgrade Using An Already Purchased Retail Pro/Ultimate Key</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>In Windows 7 Home Premium, type Anytime Upgrade in the Search programs and files box in the Start menu and click on the Windows Anytime Upgrade icon. &nbsp;From there, you can enter your retail
 (Full or Upgrade) Windows 7 Home Premium/Professional/Ultimate product key and perform a simple upgrade.
</span><span>Online Anytime Upgrade is not available in all countries.
</span><span>All programs and files will stay on the computer, no disk is needed and it takes about 10 minutes.

            <p>Why not just use the Windows 7 Home Premium key and do an Anytime Upgrade from Starter to Windows 7 Home Premium? You can't do an in place upgrade from Windows 7 Starter to Home Premium using the disc.
</p>
<p>Click Start, type Anytime Upgrade, click the option to enter a key, enter the Windows 7&nbsp;Home Premium&nbsp;key when requested, click Next, wait while the key is verified, accept the license agreement, click upgrade, wait while the software upgrades, (it might
 take 10 minutes or more depending on if updates are needed), your computer will automatically restart, after restarting, Windows 7 will notifiy you its updating the computer, the computer will restart one more time automatically and the upgrade will be completed,
 a windows will pop up notifying the upgrade was successful and your computer is ready to use, click close, you should be upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium your files, programs and settings preserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Anytime Upgrade fails, Windows Anytime Upgrade Fail:</p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=947821</a>
</p>
<p>If Anytime Upgrade still fails, disable User Account Control:</p>
<p>1. Go to User Accounts in Control Panel</p>
<p>2. Change User Account Control Settings</p>
<p>3. Pull the Slider down to lowest level possible</p>
<p>4. Reboot the PC</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the following:</p>
<p>1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade</p>
<p>2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)</p>

<p><br />
If all the above fails, install Windows 7 Service Pack 1 then attempt the Anytime Upgrade again:</p>

            Hi Joshua.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you update the latest Audio driver from the PC or device maker's Support Downloads web page?  
<br />Please run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.  
<br />
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows

<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />
<br />Do you see any exclamation signs in the device tree?
<br />
<br />If you do, you might need to update essential drivers software such as:
<br />
<br />Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters, Audio.

            Hi Vlad, the Asus M5A78L-M PLUS is not a standard motherboard and as such Windows Update will probably not supply the drivers you need. 
<br />
<br />You should definitely install the drivers from the Utility Disk that came with your Mobo . . .

            &gt; Is it necessary to install them, or are all the needed drivers installed when the system update task is run?
<br />Two things:
<br />Windows do not install all drivers.
<br />Windows often install incorrect drivers.
<br />
<br />I would also skip drivers from the disk as they might be too old. Go to the manufacturer's site to get the latest firmware and driver updates.

            As I can see there are two video cards in the system
<br />One is inbuilt to the motherboard of AMD
<br />One is the external one in PCI E Slot of Nvidia that is supported with Windows 10.
<br />The one of AMD is not being supported with later versions of Windows.
<br />What does Device Manager&gt;Display devices say? Is AMD Graphics enabled?

            <p>Hi Jetto,<br />
<br />
<span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span><span><br />
<br />
I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur only with the downloaded files?<br />
2. Did you make any change to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Method 1: Run the program that you use to save the file as an administrator</span></b></p>
<p><span>1. Right-click the shortcut that starts the program, and then click</span><b><span>Run
 as Administrator</span></b><span> to start the program. If the
</span><b><span>Run as Administrator</span></b><span> option is not available, follow these
 steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Right-click the shortcut that starts the program, and then click</span><b><span>Properties</span></b><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the
</span><b><span>Shortcut</span></b><span> tab, and then click</span><b><span>Open
 File Location</span></b><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right-click the executable file for the program, and then click</span><b><span>Run
 as Administrator</span></b><span> to start the program.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>
 If the program was installed by using an .msi package file, you must locate the executable file for the program to run it as an administrator. For example, a shortcut to a Microsoft Office program does not include the
</span><b><span>Run as Administrator</span></b><span> option.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Save the file</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Save the file to the Documents folder and then move it to the destination folder</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Save the file to the
</span><b><span>Documents</span></b><span> folder.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click the file that you saved in step 1, and then click</span><b><span>Cut</span></b><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click
</span><b><span>Start</span></b><span>Collapse this imageExpand this, click
</span><b><span>Computer</span></b><span>, right-click the destination folder, and then click</span><b><span>Paste</span></b><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type the administrator password when you are prompted<br />
<br />
<b>Method 3<br />
</b>If the issue occurs only with the downloaded files, then you can try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
</span><span>Try to open Internet Explorer 10 in no-add-ons mode and check if you’re able to load the websites.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows+R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the Run window type
<b>‘iexplore –extoff’</b> and click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Now try to open the websites to check if you’re able to load the websites.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4<br />
</span></b><span>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />

</span><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature
 might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet
 Explorer Settings feature.<br />

<p>done the following and sorted it;</p>
<div>I figured out the solution to this problem in Windows 7. I assume this will work with other OS too.</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;Right-click on the drive that is causing the problem.</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Left-click on Properties.</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;Click on the Security tab.</div>
<div>4. &nbsp;In the first window click on Administrators (your computer name-PC Administrators).</div>
<div>5. &nbsp;Just below the window click on Edit.</div>
<div>6. &nbsp;Click on Administrators (your computer name-PC Administrators) again.</div>
<div>7. &nbsp;Here's the key to making it work. If Apply is grayed-out, check a box in the Deny column. It will then bring up Apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>8. &nbsp;Check a box in the Allow column. It should check all of the boxes except the last one and uncheck all of the boxes in the Deny column.</div>
<div>9. &nbsp;Click Apply. It should run a scan of the files in the drive. When the scan is finished, click Ok. The first box should still be open.</div>
<div>10. In the first window, click on Users (your computer name-PC\Users) and repeat steps 5-9, of course clicking on Users (your computer name-PC\Users)</div>
<div>instead of Administrators (your computer name-PC Administrators).</div>
<div>NOTE: &nbsp;You may not have to click in the Deny column after the first scan is completed for step 10 as indicated in step 7.</div>

<p>Mine was solved after I've changed user account control settings.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel&gt; user accounts &gt; Change account type &gt; Change account control settings&gt; set to never notify</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to make my account as administrator first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround: if you are downloading from IE or whichever you are downloading with, run that program as an administrator.</p>

<h2>            Widows Optional Update shows AOC International &#40;Europe&#41; GmbH-Display-AOC V22 instead of F22</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Widows update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Community friends, quite a while since I used Microsoft Answers, hope I do it right. SILVER SURFER. I have recently upgraded to Windows 7, I am busy re installing programs and sorting my folders/files etc, and basically getting used to Widows 7. I have
 a AOC f22s display connected to my PC, at the moment I see that the display is using a Microsoft 2006 driver. My Windows update shows me an optional update for display as follows : AOC International (Europe) GmbH-Display-AOC V22 Released MARCH 2010, Published
 27/12/2012 ( I believe this may be an updated DRIVER). My concern is the V22, is this an error with Windows update ( as my Display is an F22s) I am a bit apprehensive about downloading and installing this update in case I&nbsp;mess up my new operating system, (if
 it is the wrong DRIVER for my Display, I am not too accustomed to installing DRIVERS). I would be most grateful if anyone out there can give me the right advice as to whether to proceed with this update. Thanking you Bitbop.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to add some more information to what <strong>Anannya </strong>has already provided. I hope that provides some more information about the behavior in your question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A digital media file has associated metadata. If you right click on an mp3 file
<em>(or the tracks you are playing)</em>, click <strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;and go to the
<strong>Details</strong> tab, you will see this metadata. If you are using Windows Media Player to play these tracks, and Windows Media Player is displaying the file information as Track 1, Track 2 etc., I believe, in the Details tab for these tracks, the&nbsp;<strong>Title</strong>
 for these tracks is specified as Track 1, Track 2 and so on. Your car CD Player display the file name because it just reads the file name for these tracks, not the metadata associated with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this explanation helps you understand the issue better. Do reply if you have any further concerns with Windows, we will be glad to be of assistance.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do the following steps once and let me know the information that I am asking for below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Put the CD with those songs in your computer.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>File Explorer </strong>tile on your Start Screen.</p>
<p>3. In the File Explorer window, please browse to your CD and <strong>right click</strong> on any song in there that shows the behavior that you mentioned.</p>
<p>4. Now click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Then click on the <strong>Details</strong> tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, <em><strong>What information is there against the "Title" option in there?
</strong>Do you see the song name or is it some track number like "Track 01" etc listed against the "Title" option?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do get back with this information if you need further help on the issue. We will be glad to be of assistance.</p>

    <title>Upgrade install or clean custom install. Which is the better way&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lesnh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade install or clean custom install. Which is the better way&#63;</h2>
                    Thanks for reading this. I just did an upgrade to windows 7 home premium from vista home premium and I am not sure I did it the best way. This is what I did and I am interested in knowing if I should re-do it. I moved all my files to an external drive
 then I took the Vista cd that came with my dell desktop and reinstalled it as a clean installation. Then I put in the windows 7 upgrade disk and just did the regular upgrade. I did not choose the custom install that I believe does a cleaner install. My question
 is: Being I did a clean install of vista first and then just upgraded to windows 7, did I get the same clean install that I would have if I did the custom install of windows7. If this was not the best way is it worth re-doing it with the custom install as
 everything seems to be working well since I upgraded. I don't seem to have any issues. My printer works, my router works all seems OK. Any advise would be helpful. If you do suggest that I re-do it, it asks what drive to install it

<p>If your system is functioning just fine, I don't see any need in doing a custom clean install. In place upgrades (which is what you did) exist for a reason. Its convenient and guarantees less down time.</p>

            Thanks Andre: Being I did do a clean install of Vista first where everything was removed and then installed the windows 7 upgrade is the other installation using the custom install actually a cleaner install or did I actually wind up with the same results?
 Just curious.. I also had an old windows office installed on my machine before I upgraded but microsoft said it was not genuine and I lost the disc, could you recommend a free program that I could use to replace that. Office is too expensive right now. I need
 a word document program and powerpoint. I am using windows live mail&nbsp;2011 for my e-mail but I don't really like it. You can't change too much on it and I don't like the side by side view. I guess I am used to the view where&nbsp;the preview&nbsp;is&nbsp;below the mail. Is
 open office a good program or am I better off with works which I do have the disc that came with this computer. Thanks again for your advise. Any suggestions would be helpful. Should you put the install in the "D"

<strong>A custom install deletes the previous installation of Windows along with your personal files, settings and installed applications. It will move the installation to a folder at the root of the drive called Windows.old. I assume what you are aiming for
 is a low level format where the partition is cleaned of any trace. Although you can do that, you would be achieving the same results with a regular custom install. Since the Windows.old folder can be easily deleted.</strong><br />

<p>Andre, thanks again for your advise and for responding. I will do as you suggested. My last question though and I am not trying to beat the dead horse is that I&nbsp;DID NOT&nbsp;do a custom windows 7 install but only the regular upgrade after I reinstalled vista
 clean. Will I notice anything different in the operation if I re-do the install as custom or is the difference not noticeable enough and not worth the trouble? Thanks again and Merry Christmas.</p>

Hi Andre: Thanks for your suggestions. I am trying open office and I&nbsp;will see how that goes. I was only able to get 3.2.1 for free and not 3.3 as I think they only have the 3.3 for sale at this time as 3.3 is still in testing for the free version. If that is
 wrong please let me know.I notice on some powerepoint slide shows with music that some play the music and some don't. I don't know why but the photos are working well. Any suggestions on this point? I am also trying Thunderbird and it is similar to outlook
 but certainly not the same. The fonts in the mail are smaller and the look is not exactly the same. When I hit the next button it goes to the next mail but when I hit the previous it seem to only go to the previous "un-read" not to the previous that I just
 read. That's a little annoying.&nbsp;I guess there is really nothing like the Microsoft porducts. I am not familiar with Apple but I guess you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>I am including my previous question here for I don't know if you saw it and I am interested in your opinion if I should re-do the installation as custom or leave it alone as all seems to be working fine. Is there any advantage to re-install it.Thanks Andre&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb
 Andre, thanks again for your advise and for responding. I will do as you suggested. My last question though and I am not trying to beat the dead horse is that I&nbsp;DID NOT&nbsp;do a custom windows 7 install but only the regular upgrade after I reinstalled vista clean.

            There is no point in doing the reinstall. If you feel it will give you some peace of mind. Backup and do it. As for OpenOffice.org, go with 3.2.1, I just realized 3.3 is actually pre-release (thanks JW). If you want support for these products, its best
 look to the official support documentation or forums setup for those applications.

<p>Thank you Andre and JW I will have peace of mind by you saying that there is no point in doing the re-install. I will leave it as done, get it out of my head, and move on and put back my files and download the programs I need and hopefully enjoy the upgrade
 to windows 7. I am going to try the Open Office 3.2.1 till the 3.3 becomes available, and I think I may revert back to Windows live mail if I can't get thunderbird to do what I would like. I will save my $$$ and hopefully I will be able to afford Microsoft
 Office with Outlook some day. If anyone knows a cheaper way to get it please let me know. Thanks again for all your help on this forum and the advise given to me. I appreciate it a lot and wish&nbsp;you&nbsp;a very Merry Christmas and Happy and healthy New Year.</p>

            You could purchase the Office 2010 Professional Academic edition for US $99 which includes Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, OneNote and Publisher. This depends on eligibility though, but if you have a nephew or niece in college you could ask them
 to help you out. ;)

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            New Xbox One S &#40;1TB&#41; says not enough space</h2>
                    We purchased the Minecraft bundle Xbox One S for Christmas. Everything was going well at first. After the initial setup, we downloaded the Minecraft game. All good. However, when trying to download the add-ons included in the bundle, I am told there is
 not enough space. It won't even down load the one that says it is 26MB! Obviously, this is not a storage issue. Any idea what the fix is? Thanks!

<h2>            Unidentified Network - Using a wired&#47;wireless Router </h2>
                    Since upgrading from Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Ultimate- I constantly have problems with the system not recognising that a belkin router is connected hard wired.<br />
I keep getting the message unidentified network, I have to go into adapter settings, disable the network then enable it for the system to recognise it.<br />
This works until I have to restart the system. I've updated the Intel network card firmware, disabeled the Mcafee firewalletc and still have the problem.<br />
<br />
I have a notebook running on XP and an I phone and they connect wireless no problems.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<p>Hello <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers</p>
<p>Use the below mentioned methods and check if the issue gets resolved -<br />
Method 1:</p>
<p>1. Click Start. Type cmd in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
ipconfig /all (there is a space between ipconfig and / )<br />
The ipconfig /all command displays Windows TCP/IP settings for all your network adapters.</p>
<p>3. If your IP address for your Local Area Connection is either 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.x.x (where x is any number), then your computer is not getting an IP address from the router.&nbsp;
<br />
If that is the case, try this: <br />
· Ipconfig /release in the command prompt and press ENTER<br />
· Ipconfig /renew in the command prompt and press ENTER</p>
<p>Test it again by typing ipconfig /all&nbsp; to see what the address is?&nbsp; If the address is still not correct (if you are on a home router, it should start with either 192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x or 10.x.x.x)</p>
<p>Method 2:<br />
Try to reset TCP/IP stack: To reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and either click on "Fix it for me" or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</a></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to change your firewall security settings to different level and then check. Also do refer to the below mentioned links for additional guidance -<br />

<h2>            Why can I not get McAfee internet security to work on windows 7 - seems to be a problem with both Java and internet access</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband went to update McAfee Internet security on family laptops today, all went fine on his, all went pearshaped on wife's. I Have an Acer aspire running Windows 7 home premium.&nbsp; Basically the current McAfee will not open whatsoever, you just
 get a nice blank white screen.&nbsp; It cannot be unistalled as again you just get a blank white window.&nbsp; When trying to install McAfee 2011 I get an error message saying</p>
<p><span>"Installation Cannot Continue</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We're having trouble installing your McAfee sofware because JavaScript is not working correctly on this PC."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So, we did the sensible thing and googled the problem, found responses in the discussions on here telling people to</span></p>
<p><span>click on the start button(windows logo on Vista)</span></p>
<p><span>on the field "start search" type "cmd" without the qoutes, an icon will apear on the top part.</span></p>
<p><span>right click on that icon then select "Run as Administrator"</span></p>
<p><span>type "regsvr32 jscript.dll" without the quotes on the black window that will apear then press Enter(A message will appear confirming that the process was succesful) Restart your PC then try to download McAfee again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, she just gets the error message</span></p>
<p><span>"The module jscript.dll was loaded but the call to DllRegisterserver failed with error code 0x80004005.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apparently that error code relates to access being denied, so I was advised to try turning off user access control. &nbsp;This has not changed a thing, (as well as having been already able to access command function as administrator). &nbsp;Followed advice
 within another thread &nbsp;(<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_7/the-module-jscriptdll-was-loaded-but-the-call-to/2ab21afe-5ea6-4fd3-affb-2b2d200e21ea">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_7/the-module-jscriptdll-was-loaded-but-the-call-to/2ab21afe-5ea6-4fd3-affb-2b2d200e21ea</a>)&nbsp;that
 suggested I needed to carry out a system scan from the cmd function using sfc/ scannow to check and resolve problems, with the result of no integrity violations being found. &nbsp;It was suggested on this thread that this should solve my problem running the command,
 but I am still unable to run the jscript prompt successfully.</p>
</span><span>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have no internet access whatsoever on my laptop now, cannot access emails (presumably due to McAfee having kittens and stopping me from doing anything) since this problem occurred, which is hampering any attempts to do anything, and I have no
 clue as to how to proceed. Please help me, it's not like I do anything world changing on my computer, but this is really doing my head in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help</p>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have been having a problem installing the Cumulative&nbsp;updates on Windows 10 ever since I have received my new Lenovo laptop in mid-February. The Windows Update Troubleshooter often tells me that Windows update components must be repaired but doesn't
 fix them or tell me how to manually.&nbsp; I have no idea how to fix this so if anyone could give any suggestions/feedback I would very much appreciate it.

            Hey Cooper.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I would try installing cumulative update KB4093112 manually from the Microsoft Update Catalog. You can download it at the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4093112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search...</a>
<br />
<br />Download the following: choose the right architecture for your system
<br />
<br />32 bit
<br />2018-04 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x86-based Systems (KB4093112)
<br />
<br />64 bit
<br />2018-04 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4093112)
<br />
<br />Follow instructions to install manually:
<br />Learn how to manually install it:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manually-install-standalone-cumulative-updates-virus-definitions-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manually-insta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi C00per, the following method should get Windows Update running
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button type services and hit Enter

<br />Background Intelligent Transfer Service 
<br />Cryptographic Service 
<br />
<br />Close the Services App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Copy all the following commands and paste them into the command window in one go: 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old

<br />
<br />Wait for the all commands to complete. 
<br />
<br />Close the Command Prompt

    <title>Display&#47;multiple display settings keep changing on their own. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Display&#47;multiple display settings keep changing on their own.</h2>
                    <p>For years I have had my mom set up with a multiple display PC where she has her TV cloned to her PC display in another room so she can watch netflix and hulu and stuff in the living room.<br />
<br />
After upgrading to windows 10, the settings that allow both these displays to run keep changing themselves. Usually after an update. My mom does not understand some computer basics and can not fix these by herself, so EVERY TIME this happens I have to drive
 over there and reset her computer to display on both monitors.<br />
<br />
The specific setting that gets reset upon an update can be different. <br />
<br />
Sometimes the resolution resets to 1080p(she only has a 720p TV)<br />
<br />
Sometimes the refresh rate gets set to 85HZ(her tv supports only 60hz)<br />
<br />
Sometimes the system decides to disable display cloning without touching any other setting, and simply sets it back to single display.<br />
<br />
It might be worth pointing out that when a setting is changed, what they go back to seems to be the defaults to the computer monitor, not her TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm there, I often reboot to make sure the settings are preserved and they are. So these issues only seemed to happen during updates, or some other event I am not aware of. I am sick of going over to my mom's every other day to address this!</p>

            <p>Hello Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue with the display. The issue could be if the drivers are either get corrupted or need to be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could also be related to the
<strong><span>Display drivers and other updates</span></strong>. I want to inform you that&nbsp;updates will be released by Microsoft. So, I would suggest you to keep checking your Windows updates not only important one
 but optional too. If any available try to install them and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the Display drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How
 to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></strong><br />

<p>This is such a lame excuse. Always blame it on the user. The solution you gave us is total nonsense. Windows should not change the settings after it's been shut down. It never used to do it until the recent update. Also Bing just attaches itself to google
 so anything you search on Google Bing totally takes over. Microsoft cannot do just what it wants. We pay for the operating system and expect it to work the way we want to personalize our computers not the way Microsoft want to personalize it for us.</p>
<p>So please fix your mess and stop blaming the user as a way to cover your own faults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>The problem seems to be that, in the effort to make display settings "User Friendly" for the masses, they forgot the need to be able to SAVE different configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 1:&nbsp; A laptop.&nbsp; If I use the same two configurations, once I set things up it should just hotplug and NEVER change without user intervention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the case.&nbsp; A factory configured laptop from a well known vendor:&nbsp; I have seen this with Dell, HP, and Lenovo, when configured to use a second display will sometimes change for no apparent reason -- especially when the second display is a TV or
 projector.&nbsp; We never had this problem in XP or Windows 7 because we had the ability to save hardware profiles.&nbsp; Linux does not have this problem at all because they continue to support manual control of multiple screen configurations.&nbsp; Microsoft should do
 the same as automatic detection does not work for everybody in every situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 2:&nbsp; A dedicated projection computer.&nbsp; This is used in a presentation environment, specifically a church.&nbsp; We have five physical displays linked to three logical displays using a multiplexer.&nbsp; Display 1 is the fold back display for vocalists and is
 run over multiplexer channel 2.&nbsp; This display is always on even when projectors are blanked and shows at least the clock and is located to the left of display 2.&nbsp; Display 2 is the primary monitor.&nbsp; The desktop.&nbsp; This is direct connected to the graphics card.&nbsp;
 Display 3 is located to the right of display 2.&nbsp; This is the front of house projection and is mirrored on three displays, two projectors and one LED monitor on multiplexer channel 1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On several occasions Windows will arbitrarily reassign the numbers so that display 1 becomes display 2, while 2 may become either 3 or 1.&nbsp; It is unpredictable and a major pain and has happened on several occasions during the middle of the service.&nbsp; This
 is another case where a permanent MANUAL configuration would SIMPLIFY the whole procedure.&nbsp; Set it up once and it stays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue, the one of the OS re identifying displays on boot was solved by always booting to a single screen, then powering up the secondary displays in the same order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For each of the improvements I find in Windows 10, I find at least one thing I wish they hadn't abandoned, hadn't changed, or hadn't broken to fix something else.&nbsp; Dynamic display settings can be a good thing in many situations, but static display settings
 are still required for single task applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is this:&nbsp; did they eliminate static display settings?&nbsp; (save settings) or did they hide it and forget to document it?</p>

</p><p>Windows Update says <em>“Your device is up to date...Available updates will be downloaded and installed automatically.”</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So maybe I need to learn how to uninstall and then reinstall the Windows 10 Mail and Calendar app?</p>

<p>I was told that Windows 10 Mail app is incompatible with&nbsp;emails from&nbsp;some senders (e.g., eBay, others), and that explains why&nbsp;many emails still will not print from my Mail inbox.&nbsp;

    <title>NET Framework Runtime error on Microsoft Windows Media Player12 and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            NET Framework Runtime error on Microsoft Windows Media Player12 and shutdown the Pc</h2>
                    <p>NET Framework Runtime error&nbsp;on Microsoft Windows Media Player12 and shutdown the Pc</p>
<p>Both software are native to Microsoft, but for some reason that is not within the reach of common user
</p>
<p>experience, are not in good relationship, and when the W Media Player plays a long video file .mp4 (+
</p>
<p>30 minutes ), after some time of perfect reading, comes an unexpected "Runtime error" and comes a
</p>
<p>warning mini-window briefly, of difficult perception for the average user, followed by an abrupt and
</p>
<p>strange "screen-black" and shutdown the Pc. What is serious, considering that are native Microsoft
</p>
<p>software to run on Windows.<br />
Already checked up some procedures indicated in the Microsoft-forum of possible disk errors detection,
</p>
<p>or W.Media Player, or the .NET Framework, and was inconclusive, and everything seems to be correct.<br />
It is not within reach of the average user to detect and resolve the cause of this phenomenon for
</p>
<p>several years never happened, because it only happens from there approx. a month ago.<br />
The PC is up to date, and this "failure" only occurs with W.Media Player running vídeo .mp4 file large
</p>
<p>duration.<br />
Please Microsoft check-up this serious mal-function and produce a correction in Update to remedy that serious problem.<br />
Thank you.</p>

To further assist you, can you tell us if you are experiencing this only on .mp4 files? Are you having the same issues when playing other media file?
<br />
<br />
Can you also provide us the exact Runtime error you are getting? A screenshot is very much appreciated.

            <p>Thank you for attention to the problem, which to me is very important, and their willingness to help.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The PC operates effectively in all aspects. I did not detect any problems, or software or hardware, except the occasional imponderables arising from web browsing, overloading memory, and smaller things like some prey key.<br />
</p>
<p>2. I am a convinced supporter of Windows ever since Windows95 systems.<br />
</p>
<p>3. Windows Media Player is one of my favorite software, always, I have already installed in several Pc, since version 9, 10, 11, 12.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. This problem - serious conflict between Microsoft software - is new and very strange and inconvenient, it seems the devil's work (pardon) because everything is running well, and the conflict comes out of nowhere and is relentless, appears on the screen
 at a glance a small warning window and in a short time, 10 seconds, is black screen and the PC turns off.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. scenario problem detail:<br />
a) The Pc working exclusively with only the W.Media Player with 50% free RAM (of total 5Gb available 4 + 1)<br />
b) Reading the file of 90 minutes .mp4 starts, runs perfect audio + hd video, and for 15, 20, 25&nbsp;minutes everything is perfect. Suddenly, out of nowhere, there is an exaggerated increase in CPU which amounts to 90% of processes wmplayer.exe + audiodg.exe simultaneously,
 and the short time period, there is the small warning&nbsp;"Runtime error" and comes a warning mini-window briefly, of difficult perception for the average user and elapsed approx. 10/15 seconds-screen black and the PC turns off.<br />
Note: When the conflict and when&nbsp;i can monitor the weather before climbing the excessive consumption of CPU comes,&nbsp;i put&nbsp;PAUSE or STOP the W.Media Player and the PC happens to be normal, no longer gives the notice or turns off.<br />
But this creates a terrible restlessness, because I'm always hoping that the error happens.<br />
c) video files .mp4 short 5/10 minutes, the conflict never manifested, everything perfect wheel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d) Reading music .mp3 files or other extension that WMPlayer support, reading is perfect, whatever the length of the file.<br />
e) This conflict is a "thing" new, about a month ago, and in 20 years never the various versions of Media Player accused this problem or conflict.<br />
f) The video files are complete and integrity, already checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp;I have performed some procedures and scan and check disc routines, uninstalled and reinstalled the W.MediaPlayer to the default settings, it's all right (I got the feeling that WMP improved), but the problem persisted, to my frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Do not detect or relate to any virus or malware problem, I've done a / v scan everything, and have a/v in real time from a known and prestigious Microsoft partner brand (who also already&nbsp;i reported the problem) .</p>
<p>8. I'm no expert, perhaps especially interested and attentive user, and some experience and interest in Windows, I have no perception of another problem that is in addition to recent conflict between Microsoft software, the NETRuntime + WMedia Player, which
 possibly only can be corrected by update by Microsoft. <br />
Windows has to run continuously dozens of services, processes and control applications that take up a lot of memory, and should be useful to resolve these situations, like:
</p>
<p>Generic Host Process for Win32 Services<br />
svchost.exe (vários)<br />
windows error reporting</p>
<p>windwos crash report<br />
wicainventory <br />
Windows\system32\WerConCpl.dll", LaunchErcApp -responsepester <br />
CompatTelRunner.exe<br />
DismHost&nbsp; (akamaytechnologie)<br />
</p>
<p>QueryAppBlok<br />
wermgr.exe<br />
diagtrackrunner.exe<br />
svchost - Reability Abalyses Custom Handler/MS/Windows/RAC/RacTask<br />
svchost - <span>Windows Errors Report Service</span></p>
<p>9. Updates available have all been successfully installed.</p>
<p>10. I have tested the video playback .mp4 in alternative Players, and run on perfection. But my preference is the software WMédia Player, and I'm not adept to have installed several software for the same function, it is a waste of space and concern.</p>
<p>11. The speed and the unexpected way in which the conflict arises, not allow the image capture, not even to correctly understand what is written. When the warning comes too late is - black screen -&nbsp; Thank you.

            <p>Attempts to get a picture of the "error message" were dashed, perhaps because at the time the system is already overloaded (excessive CPU) and does not allow access to other functions or applications. I'll try to get through an external procedure, because
 it might help diagnose the specific problem. I can not enter the link you suggested.</p>
<p>Thank you Jarius Tol. Greetings.</p>

    <title>MP3 players supporting Playlists - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> schwag65  say:</h3>
<h2>            MP3 players supporting Playlists</h2>
                    <p>I currently have a Sansa Fuze mp3 player, and I know it supports WMP custom Playlists. I am able to sync my custom created Playlists to the device and play them at will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I have not had much luck finding other mp3 players that support the Playlist feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a list of other mp3 players that would support my syncing of custom Playlists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance!</p>

            As I said in my original message, I haven't had much luck finding other mp3 players that are compatible with the WMP playlists. I have already done many searches and come up with no good results. I thought someone might be able to name another mp3 player
 that they use successfully with custom playlists.
