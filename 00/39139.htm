            The Mail app doesn't so much "store" info as "caches" it.&nbsp; The authoritative copy of the emails is the server (in this way, the Mail app functions more like mail apps on cell phones do).

<h2>            corrupt IDT audio drivers everytime restart windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell Studio XPS 1645 with Windows 7 ultimate.</p>
<p>I have recently installed Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi MB software. Then the problem starts.</p>
<p>Under the Device Manager (Sound, video and game controlles) section there are two devices:</p>
<p>High Definition Audio Device</p>
<p>IDT High Definition Audio CODEC</p>
<p>Everythings works until I reboot, then the Yellow Exclamation point is next to the IDT device and there is no sound.&nbsp; The error is "Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware.&nbsp; The driver may be corrupt or missing. (Code 39)".&nbsp; The drive installed
 for this device is IDT 6.10.0.6217(6/29/2009).&nbsp; I can re-install the drivers and everything works until I reboot again.</p>
<p>I have tried to uninstall the device along with the driver and just let windows do it job re-installing everything.&nbsp; No such luck.</p>
<p>Please help !!</p>

<p>Hi Reggie and Jerry,</p>
<p>Sorry for my late reply, I do have the problem solved, but not an easy way!! I believe something have been done in the registry and is not reversable ! What i have done, is to reinstall Windows all together!!</p>
<p>I do have reinstall the Creative Sound Blaster driver after i have reinstall Windows 7, but this time, rather than just install the software in Windows 7 "mode" there is something call "Troubleshoot Compatibility", to do this, you will need to right click
 the setup icon, and you should find that! Then go to check the version of the software compatible with which version of Windows, there should be a list... I choose Windows Vista SP2 and then start the setup process! Everything works fine there after !</p>
<p>Hope all these helps, I know it is a pain to reinstall windows ......</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>Tim</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the issue might be caused by network issue while installing the Windows updates. What we suggest is that you run the Network troubleshooter which will help us diagnose and resolve network issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Network</strong> icon in the notification area.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot problems</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen steps to start troubleshoot the issue.</li><li>Try to run the Windows Update again.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still persists, we suggest that you run the <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_wu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update troubleshooter</a></strong> to find and resolve Windows Updates concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will keep an eye out for your reply.</p>

            <p>Multiple checks for updates &amp; re-boots etc. does not help for me. After initial failure, KB4012215 is never listed as available again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very suspicious of the optional update KB4012218 (March, 2017 Preview....) that I installed
 can run Windows 7 updates (?), but the machine concerned is&nbsp;many years old, so should not be affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other updates are working fine on the machine, so for know I have manually downloaded from the Microsoft Update Catalogue&nbsp;the 2 security components (KB4012204&nbsp;and KB4012212) listed for KB4012215.</p>

            Count yourself as fortunate. Sounds amazing does it not.&nbsp; Microsoft updating is a quagmire.&nbsp; Best advice is do not use Windows update now.&nbsp; Watch for a MS-Defcon rating on
<a href="http://www.askwoody.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.askwoody.com</a> to find out when to use it.

            What KB4012215 did to me was uninstall all my tap drivers so none of my vpns would work. Some of the tap drivers I was able to download again, but TunnelBear simply would not be repaired. I was forced to restore my system. Now the update won't install,
 which I suppose I should be thankful of, but it's still sort of annoying.

            <p>I did some research on more computers and found out this:</p>
<p>1. <strong>I uninstalled KB4015552</strong> (April 18, 2017 (Preview of Monthly Rollup)) and restarted computer. KB4015549 is now installed automatically fine by WSUS.</p>
<p>2. Now I can install KB4015552 too, without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I cannot install these two updates together, but</p>
<p>First: April 11, 2017—KB4015549 (Monthly Rollup)</p>
<p>and Second:&nbsp;April 18, 2017—KB4015552 (Preview of Monthly Rollup)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you, support guys, confirm that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And my question is, why WSUS synchronizes these two (or other two similar mothly rollups) updates together?</p>

</p><p>First time posting here, hopefully someone can and will help me out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Laptop - Connected via WIFI (Qualcomm Atheros AR956x)</p>
<p>Router - TP-Link with DD-WRT</p>

</p>
<p>When I move Laptop to the kitchen, for example, the connection speed drops drastically and randomly, causing package losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other devices work at even greater distances (2 Android devices, 1 iPhone, 1 Laptop running Ubuntu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before this setup, I had another router with stock firmware that Windows somehow didn't even manage to get an IP from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first setup this router I had it on 20MHz (Full) channel width, and Windows would not connect on that distance (connected to the router, but no internet access).</p>
<p>I changed that to 20/40MHz (Dynamic), and the issue above (slow speed/package loss) started.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have tried:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Reinstalling network drivers via Windows Update --- Current setup</p>
<p>- Installing the drivers from the hardware manufacturer (Acer) --- Wouldn't even connect to the network</p>
<p>- Resetting network (from Windows Network &amp; Internet Settings)</p>
<p>- Changing routers (obviously)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has any idea on what could be going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Some additional info that might help narrows things down. I have another laptop on a wired connection that can't be seen on the network from the laptop with the issue. The wired one can see/access itself and the laptop with the issue.</p>

<p>Hey Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help, but I think I might have found the problem. Will list everything I did here in case someone stumble upon the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did everything in the correct order from your link, didn't work.</p>
<p>Booted an Ubuntu live media and the issue was also there, so it wasn't Windows.</p>
<p>Changed the WIFI card (it's a laptop, but still) for another one, same model, but different vendor (Lenovo), worked on Ubuntu, but Windows disabled the card (said it had known issues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, today I rubber ducked and it came to me, I still don't know how.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I unplugged the wireless mouse USB receiver (also operates on 2.4GHz).</p>
<p>Problem solved. Hopefully for good.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello 4Print Solutions, <br />
<br />
You can try to install the Javelin J310C Card printer in compatiblity mode for Windows XP.<br />
This is an older printer and may not be compatible with Windows 8. <br />
<br />
All of the information I have found indicates it was designed for: <br />
Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See the driver and software information at the link below:<br />
<a href="http://www.nbstech.co.uk/card_printer_drivers_and_manuals.asp#J310C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nbstech.co.uk/card_printer_drivers_and_manuals.asp#J310C</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't help, you would need to contact the manufacturer to see if they have updated drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
<br />
<br />
Marilyn </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with your settings... The feature has been removed...</p>
<p>This occurred at the same time "Display" was removed from the Control Panel...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are registry edits for most of the settings, but are something most people don't want to mess with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I first encountered this I was fortunate to stumble across a free utility called WinAeroTweaker... It has the missing settings plus more...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a "portable" program that does not install...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The method I use now is to save registry settings from a older build and then merge them with the newer one when an update\upgrade messes them up again...</p>

Let's not get carried away. While logged on under an admin account, you <span style="font-weight: bold">
can</span> delete any registry key. However, you must first seize ownership of such keys, starting from the innermost level. Right-click the key, then follow the menu items.<br />

                    <p>Hello, I really need help. I've been experiencing this BSOD for a few hours now and I can't access my Windows. I tried Safe Mode but it just restarts. I've tried Startup Repair but it's still not working. I tried System Restore. At the first restore point,
 it says 'An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x8000ffff)' and at another point it says 'System Restore failed to extract the file (C:\Windows\System32\aeinv.dll) from the restore point. The restore point was damaged or deleted during the
 restore.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember installing a program and when. I shut it down last night, I accidentally pulled off the plug while Windows is installing updates.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span><span>You can restore to Factory Settings, which is a destructive process that erases all data files and installed programmes. There are other options but from what you say these may not work.
 Read more from Page 60 in your manual.<br />
<span><a href="http://support.toshiba.com/support/staticContentDetail?contentId=2728348&amp;isFromTOCLink=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.toshiba.com/support/staticContentDetail?contentId=2728348&amp;isFromTOCLink=false</span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Press and hold the 0(zero) key on your keyboard while powering on the computer to access the options. (Page 64 of your Manual)
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you need to recover your data files before restoring to factory settings you can do by removing the drive and placing
<span>&nbsp;</span>the drive in a USB external drive enclosure and connecting to a working computer. You can then read, write and copy from the drive as it becomes in effect an external drive. More information at paragraph 7.4 in the next link:<br />
</span><a href="http://www.gerryscomputertips.co.uk/win7tips1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.gerryscomputertips.co.uk/win7tips1.htm</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you have restored to factory settings you should set up an internet connection, install anti-virus software, update all drivers from the Toshiba web site and install all Windows
 Updates. Run Disk CleanUp and defragment at intervals. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should then be in a position to reinstall programmes. With that in mind make a list of programmes to be installed and check that you have the means to do it. Check that you have the
 necessary information to recreate your internet connection on the new system. Make a list of what you need to do and the order in which you intend to do each task. This will help you considerably when you carry out the operation. If you have a second computer
 available when you rebuild your computer system, this can help if you hit a problem and need to check online.</span></span></p>

            <p>&nbsp;According to MSI's specifications, this $200 notebook can have DDR3 800/1066MHZ, Max: 4GB memory.&nbsp; See this link</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;What I would recommend is that you go to <a href="http://www.crucial.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com</a> and let it download their tool for assessing your memory.&nbsp; It will analyze your computer, give you the specifications, and offer to sell you some RAM.&nbsp;
 You don't have to buy from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You have to recreate the playlist from the scratch as there is no other way other than recreating playlists. Also, you may have to update libraries since the location has been moved.</p>

            Playlists are actually in a plain text format, and can be opened in a text editor like Notepad or Wordpad. There, you could perform a search/replace to replace all occurrences of the old location with the new one.

<h2>            Windows suddenly failed to boot</h2>
                    As the title says, my laptop suddenly failed to boot. I was just using it this morning and I shut it down normally and now I can open it. I can load the bios. I tried to repair it using windows installation disk but it failed. It gets stuck on "starting
 windows" on 2 different installation disks. Sometimes it will load until the repair screen but still fails to do the job. I also tried to reformat my drive but it says it cannot install windows on the drive. I also tried repairing it using several rescue disks
 I have but still no luck. My laptop is an Acer 4820tg running on windows 7 home premium. I would greatly appreciate it if I can at least recover files in drive c.

<p>

<p>I was finally able to do some backup and reformatted my drive c but the installation of windows cannot proceed. I am having this error:

<p>Are there any workarounds for this? </p>

            Its a hardware problem. I think my hard drive is really failing like what the windows installation said. My laptop was able to boot up after replacing the hard drive with a new one and doing a clean install of windows.

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recent changes in the network settings of a HomeGroup may affect the incoming connection of all new devices. Examples are: If you are not aware of the recent changes in passwords, changes in the limitation in the total number of computers in a group, or
 if there is new restriction made on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to setup your computer to an existing or new HomeGroup, you will need to add or create it first on a network. For more information, you can visit this link:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>HomeGroup from start to finish</span></a></strong> to know how you can setup this network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get your network credentials, visit this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023501/surface-how-to-find-your-wireless-network-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Tool tip Pop ups - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamallmand  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tool tip Pop ups</h2>
                    <p>While hovering over objects with the mouse pointer, tool tips are displayed to give a little bit of information about a button or file. I do not want to see these pop ups ever. It would be nice if I were able to disable it. Apparently it is impossible to
 disable them for everything all at once. I would like the programming community at large to realize that these pop ups cause me extreme grief and I have had enough. Please add options to UI's that allow dummies to disable these "tool tip" pop ups at will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reasons:</p>
<p>I am trying to focus on something else and it steals my attention. very distracting.</p>
<p>The pop ups cover up various things I would like to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eye strain.</p>
<p>I already know how to use most of the things I use all the time, therefore I do not need them.</p>
<p>They generally don't provide information that I cannot see in properties on a file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only time They are convenient is tutorial time when I first start using a program like Microsoft Excel, or CAD, or whatever. Nobody is going to want tool tips forever and ever while using any program.</p>
<p>They are driving me insane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I found on Microsoft website about tool tips is how to put more tool tips in other programs. (frustration)</p>

<p>Thanks to all who responded to this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ray</p>
<p>I found an answer which seems to work for me and this computer. After posting this question, I went on a search and trial effort while searching the forumfor "Windows 7 not reading external hard drives", The response from 'panav' which suggested changing
 the drive letter.</p>
<p>Go&nbsp; -&nbsp; control panel - systems &amp; security -admin tools - create &amp; format disk drive - disk management.&nbsp; select Action - all tasks - change drive letter and path.</p>
<p>I&nbsp; changed the drive letter to "R" and am now getting a action panel which list "show the drive contents" and it works, I have also removed and reinstalled the drive with out a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please mark this question as closed, thanks&nbsp; rays_usb_bug</p>

<h2>            Dashboard will load up very slow</h2>
                    
<p>Since a few weeks I have experienced a problem where after booting up my Xbox it stays stuck on a grey screen with a white circle spinning for at least half a minute before it loads the profile selection screen.</p>
<p>The time it takes to load seems to become increasingly longer as I even had it stay stuck on this screen for as long as 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Does anybody know a solution to resolve this issue?</p>

<p>Hello, I would suggest to clear the system cache. It is a simple little trick and it does help out the xbox. To do so go to your system-storage. Then highlight your hard drive. Hit "Y" and then hit Clear System Cache. That should help your system to speed
 up some! Hope that helps! </p>

<p>Clearing the cache has not helped and neither has removing the HDD from the 360 and booting it improved this issue.</p>

<p>Hey Cyandil,<br />
<br />
<span>Sorry to hear you're having issues with your dashboard load times. Just to make sure that I'm understanding correctly:<br />
<br />
When you say "neither has removing the HDD from the 360 and booting it improved this issue" are you meaning that did not clear up the issue or that it did clear up the issue.</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Also, are you able to try your console on a different network or try a different console on your network?</span>
</li><li><span>Can you try turning on your console while not connected to Xbox Live?</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><br />

<p>Hey Cyandil,<br />
<br />
<span>Sorry to hear you're having issues with your dashboard load times. Just to make sure that I'm understanding correctly:<br />
<br />
When you say "neither has removing the HDD from the 360 and booting it improved this issue" are you meaning that did not clear up the issue or that it did clear up the issue.</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Also, are you able to try your console on a different network or try a different console on your network?</span>
</li><li><span>Can you try turning on your console while not connected to Xbox Live?</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Please let us know and we'll go from there.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Fizzle,</p>
<p>What I meant was that I tried booting up the 360 without any devices (HDD) attached and that it did not improve the issue.</p>
<p>However I detached the ethernet cable and turned of my modem so the 360 could not connect through WiFi and it immediately loaded up the profile selection screen!</p>
<p>Apparently this did the trick because after attaching the ethernet cable again it booted up flawlesly *knocks on wood*.</p>
<p>Thanks allot!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;CYANiDAL,<br />
<br />
Man, this is a stubborn one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At this point, if the console is still running this slow with the HDD removed, your console may be in need of some love. Here is how to setup your&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 for Repair</a>.<br />

<p>I have tried booting up with a brand new 360 on the same network and it is giving me the same delays.</p>
<p>So now I am certain it has something to do with how the Xbox relates to the network and that it is not a hardware malfunction.</p>
<p>My PS3 and PC have no such network problems and my 360 didnt have this issue untill a month ago eventhough my network setting have not changed.</p>
<p>So if anybody could provide information which resolves this issue with my 360 than I would be much obliged.</p>

<p>Well that changes things..<strong><br />
<br />
When you connected that other console to your network, did you recover the same profile onto it?</strong> If so, this may be profile specific.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>As for the connection, are you connected wired or wireless? Also, what is the make/model of your router?<br />

<p>Hello Mister Ohnaka,</p>
<p>I have the same 3 XBL profiles on both consoles and the delay occurs before I sign in with any of them.</p>
<p>My main console with which I first experienced this issue is connected through wired, while the other is connected through WiFi.</p>
<p>My modem is a Ubee - EVW3200.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen&#58; win32k.sys - SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello guys.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm having a problem with my Windows 7 x64 Pro. I have it installed since late december 2009 and I was really happy of it. All software works smooth and everything's going fine. But, since a few days, I get a BSOD for apparently no reason, at random,
 not repeatable precisely. I get the following error message: &nbsp;SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION and then it mentions wink32k.sys, if I recall correctly. In the events manager I found this: "La vérification d’erreur était : 0x0000003b (0x00000000c0000005, 0xfffff96000124283,
 0xfffff880078c1070, 0x0000000000000000).".</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the past few days I haven't installed any special software or for that matter, a new driver.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My configuration is:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intel Core 2 duo, E6700, 8Gb RAM, Geforce 9600GS and a Bamboo Pen 'n Touch tablet if that has any relevancy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you all. Looking forward to some answers.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Thank you very much for your reply. However, this is a rather standardized reply :).</p>
<p>I already mentioned that I didn't change my hardware and all of its components are fully Windows &nbsp;7 x64 compliant. I already stated that it worked for two months without any issues. Something *else* has changed. I can only blame the Microsoft Windows Updates
 or a failling hardware component. I also did not install any new software at all. I don't know how to check if it's hardware failure or not. Any ideas?</p>
<p>The two BSODs I got were while I was watching videos. Once it was when I was watching a movie in VLC Player and the other BSOD occured while I was watching a Youbute HD video in Opera 10.51 with Flash Player 10. For me, watching videos with VLC or using
 Opera to watch videos on Youtube is not uncommon. Since day one, that is, from december 2009, I watch videos almost daily using any of the two methods I mentioned, thus it is not something out of the ordinary in the way I use the PC. I should also mention
 that these two BSODs occured on two separate days, after 10 hours of PC up time and they did not occur after boot.</p>
<p>I've used a BSOD MiniDump viewer and it has come to my understanding that the nVidia driver has caused the BSOD. I updated my video drivers now, and I am still waiting to see if I get any more BSODs. Until now, everything seems fine. I'll get back to you
 here, if I get another BSOD.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Marius</p>

<p>It is really unfortunate that after two-three hours of my reply, I got another BSOD. Exactly the same error as before.</p>
<p>I'd need some suggestions on how to figure out what is happening. Can you help me? What should I test?</p>

<p>Hello, again!</p>
<p>Because solving this issue for me is of utmost importance, I began investigating the issue. I installed the windows debugger for x64 and I came up this these details:</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (3b)<br />
An exception happened while executing a system service routine.<br />

<br />
One may notice that DWM somehow has caused the BSOD in win32k.sys. As far as I can tell, by not being a coder myself, it is related to drawing on screen elements or related to the display. Since this BSOD dump, I had upgraded my nVidia driver, but still, I
 received again BSODs.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and best regards,</p>

<p>Hello, again!<br />
I've been meaning to post an update to my situation here. Thanks a lot for your reply, it's greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
I think I have to explain the situation's background, the context of this BSOD.<br />
<br />
Since late December 2009, I installed Windows 7 x64 Pro. Back then, I installed all the latest drivers I've found for my hardware and all the software I require. I do not use any specific firewall software, just the included one from Windows. As an antivirus
 I installed Avira Antivir Personal.<br />
<br />
In the first weeks, I also tested a few games to see how the system fares. So, until April no problems occur, of any kind, no BSODs, no freezes/locks. Of course, poorly coded applications crash at times, in certain conditions, but that is unrelated to the OS.
 I should also note that I did not install any additional drivers since January or any new devices. I also did not upgrade/change any drivers.<br />
<br />
Since I installed Windows, I've enabled Windows Automatic Updates. Given the media coverage of latest Windows Updates which caused numerous BSODs for systems which were running fine, I started to suspect myself as well the updates which were installed by Windows.
 Before jumping to any conclusions, I ran multiple PC burn-in tests for CPU, GPU and other devices to find any possible problems related to hardware failure. All the tests were succesful, no BSODs occured.<br />
<br />
Having no other choice, I uninstalled all the Windows Updates of April 2010 and the last two from March 2010. Since then, that's one week already, no more BSODs occured :). This is troubling, because I would really like to use Windows Updates and it seems Microsoft
 pushes unreliable updates. Here's the list of the updates I uninstalled: KB980302, KB980182, KB981433, KB979683, KB980232, KB890830, KB979309, KB978601. I have no idea which one causes the BSOD in my case. I've read their descriptions to try to figure out
 which one would be the cause, but no luck.<br />
<br />
If you know which update causes the BSOD, please let me know.<br />
<br />
So, to conclude, the solution to stop having BSODs was to uninstall all the Windows Updates of april 2010 and to deactivate Windows Automatic Updates. For now, I do not intend to use it anymore. It seems that one never has to fix a system which runs fine :).<br />
<br />

<p>Please upload your all minidump files on Windows Live SkyDrive.</p>
<div>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</div>
<div><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Then me as well as other also can check those minidumps for actual file or processes behind the BSOD.</div>
<div>I would appeciate if you in advance tell me the result of memory diagnostic test from Win 7 booting menu screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try to provide other details as I asked on that thread also.<br />

<p>I've scanned your minidump files. There is two minidump files; so I hope you get the BSOD only for two times.</p>
<p>Once you get error from nvlddmkm.sys. Which is a nVidia driver related file.</p>
<p>You may worked well with present driver since December but once it get a BSOD then you should update it.</p>
<p>Try to update the driver from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/win7_winvista_64bit_197.45_whql.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/win7_winvista_64bit_197.45_whql.html</a></p>
<p>It would be better if you could manually uninstall the previous driver first then install the new driver. But if you can't then it would be done automatically by the nVidia driver during update.</p>
<p>Then reply me if the problem frequency is reduced or totally vanished?</p>

<p>Please read my previous posts for details. You may see that I updated my video card driver and nothing got fixed. I still got BSODs. &nbsp;I got 4 BSODs in total, but I have only two minidumps. For now, I found &nbsp;<em>my own solution: i uninstalled all the windows
 updates prior the first BSODs. Microsoft produces totally unreliable updates</em>. I will only install Service Packs from now. :)</p>

    <title>You can rename enchanted items - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cammofthrones  say:</h3>
<h2>            You can rename enchanted items</h2>
                    
<p>I spent a couple hours disenchanting and enchanting items to upgrade my character again.&nbsp; At one point I looked down in the lower left and for the first time "Rename" popped up. But this option does not pop up until you have all 3 times selected. So right
 before you "enchant" the item, you can rename it.&nbsp; I named my ring "BOW RING" because I disenchanted some Bow (archery) improving gloves. I also created some "Fire Boots" using a Fire resistance enchantment. I am still trying to find magica boots I can disenchant
 so I can have Magica boots on my character.</p>

<p>I have a necklace I need to re-enchant sometime. &nbsp; It gives me a 15% discount at merchants. &nbsp;The current name always confuses me with a different neclace that is for 28% more magica. &nbsp;So re-naming those will help a lot. &nbsp; The only bad part is that you only
 get 1 chance to re-name the items. Once they are enchanted, that name is there forever. &nbsp;</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes that is correct.&nbsp;You can also&nbsp;add perks to your "enchanting" tree&nbsp;after you level up.&nbsp; I leveled mine up I think twice and each item I enchant is around 60% of its value.&nbsp;If&nbsp;the item I disenchanted was 25% I get around 21%.&nbsp; &nbsp; Also remember to only use
 GRAND soul gems.&nbsp; Anything lower is not even worth using unless you just want to level up.&nbsp; If you look at my "BOW RING" above, the gloves I disenchanted to make that ring were 25%, now I placed them onto the ring and they are 21% .&nbsp; Yes it gets higher and
 higher as you level up.&nbsp; The shield I&nbsp;disenchanted for my fire boots was 30% but once I applied it to my boots it is around 24%.</p>

    <title>HP Printer Doesn&#39;t Print MS Office Documents Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpsz  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Printer Doesn&#39;t Print MS Office Documents Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Three weeks ago, I did a clean install (deleted all C: partitions) of windows 10.&nbsp; I let it go through it's updates and eventually got to Windows version 1709.&nbsp; I purchased MS Office 2016 and installed it.&nbsp; I reinstalled my HP Officejet Pro 8720 all-in-one
 printer.&nbsp; The printer will print from my browser (Chrome) and will print PDF files.&nbsp; It also scans just fine and will save those to my PC.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot print MS Office documents.&nbsp; I tried Word and Excel.&nbsp; I see the document in the print queue with a status of
 "spooling".&nbsp; In a second it disappears.&nbsp; I never see a status of "sent to printer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the device manager, I see my HP printer listed but also see a new entry I hadn't noticed before.&nbsp; This entry is "WSD Print Provider" and under it is the HP Officejet Pro 8720 printer.&nbsp; I suspect this is the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted HP support and they said it was a Windows issue.&nbsp; I contacted Windows support and they said it was a printer issue.&nbsp; According to HP, the Officejet Pro 8720 printer is compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; I believe this because it was working fine before.&nbsp;
 I neither added or removed any hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told by Windows that my motherboard (ASUS P9X79 Deluxe) isn't compatible with the latest version of Windows.&nbsp; In reviewing the ASUS website, it appears that this motherboard is compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; I was running Windows 10 without issues for
 at least a year prior to this.&nbsp; Windows support provided me the .iso files for Windows 10 64-bit versions 1607 and 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed version 1607.&nbsp; I installed only MS Office 2016 and the printer and had the same issue.&nbsp; I installed version 1703 and have the same issue.&nbsp; I'm currently running version 1703 build 15063.850.&nbsp; I have delayed the install of later versions as I
 had the same issue with version 1709 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In looking around the internet, it seems that this WSD is potentially causing the issue.&nbsp; I don't see any concrete solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply seahawks65.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did those steps and it still doesn't print.&nbsp; When I tried to print the .XPS document to the XPS document writer, it opened a 'save as' window and wanted to save it as a .oxps file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can print PDF documents but those are printed from Chrome as Chrome is my default PDF application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2016 installed on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has something to do with some update that was applied when I formatted my C: drive and reinstalled windows.&nbsp; I have never had this issue before with this PC or printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done all the steps you suggested numerous times.&nbsp; I have run the Microsoft fix-print issues tool and it reports everything is fine.&nbsp; I have also run the HP scan and print tool and it also reports all is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really believe this issue is directly related to that new entry "WSD Print Provider".&nbsp; I have never seen that before.</p>

<p>Ya it must be because I can do it with an old Lexmark X2480 printer that is 8 years old and on every other printer I have wired or wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would go to devices and printer, uninstall printer</p>
<p>unplug printer or disconnect if wireless</p>
<p>go to programs and features in control panel and uninstall the printer software</p>
<p>restart pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>install printer software, if the printer on the OEM site shows only drivers and software for windows 7 or 8 and not 10, then you have to right click on the installer file and select compatibility mode and select the OS version the drivers and software is
 for.</p>

<p>In the device manager, I see my HP printer listed but also see a new entry I hadn't noticed before.&nbsp; This entry is "WSD Print Provider"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How to shut this driver down. I didn't read it all, but my thought is to uninstall the driver, but it will probably reinstall every time you restart or log on. So follow this guide on first link.</p>

<p>I did a clean install (deleted all C: partitions) of windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would you delete the partitions, that&nbsp;has nothing to do with anything for a printer. I am shocked you got a clean install if you deleted the EFI partition, unless you did an install that was BIOS.</p>

<p>I was told by Windows that my motherboard (ASUS P9X79 Deluxe) isn't compatible with the latest version of Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>False, All Pc's pretty much are because Microsoft creates all the Motherboard, sound, video drivers for PC's that the manufacturers to not want to develop for new operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This one definitely is and runs EFI. And like you stated, it was (Win 10) installed already, and yes because of all Microsoft drivers for internal hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I suggest going back to v1709, build 16299.248, as you already stated you had it installed already and you are losing out on features in 1709 and more in the future.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone, I am trying to install new windows 8.1. And blue screen is appearing saying system32/drivers/ndis.sys is creating problems.</p>

<p>Hi M OR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better assistance, we'd like to ask if are you using full installation disc or media creation tool when installing your Windows 8.1?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will encounter the error "System32/drivers/ndis.sys" if your computer has a faulty hardware or corrupted driver files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest scanning and repairing your hard drive because hard drive corruption is of the one reason why we're getting BSOD. To do so, please follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open an elevated <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Copy and paste<strong> chkdsk /f</strong> and then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.
</li><li>Wait for the scan and repair to finish. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done with the hard drive repair, you may try to install again your Windows 8.1. You may check this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to download and install Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply. </p>

<h2>            Realtek - Update with old release date and no info</h2>
                    <p>Thx for reading this. Hope you can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An update for Realtek appeared on 12-31-15.</p>
<p>The release date was from Nov 2014.</p>
<p>There is no other information available regarding it in Win update links.</p>
<p>I tried to update Realtek device through Device manager but it says&nbsp;driver is current and best available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I find more info on what&nbsp;the update is for?</p>
<p>Why is this update being suggested now when released earlier?</p>
<p>Why is it being suggested only&nbsp;in windows update when device manager shows 'all is well'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here&nbsp;is a&nbsp;copy of the&nbsp;update details:</p>
<p>Realtek - LAN, Other hardware - Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller</p>
<p>Download size: 1.0 MB</p>
<p>You may need to restart your computer for this update to take effect.</p>
<p>Update type: Optional</p>
<p>Realtek LAN, Other hardware software update released in November, 2014</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you have a query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that it is released earlier but it depends on computer hardware requirements and the time taken in deployment process. Also it is a third party optional update you may install
 or don’t it’s up to you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

</p><p>I still would like to know more about the&nbsp;specific update.</p>
<p>1) Why is a there a&nbsp;lack of details?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;Can&nbsp;Win Up suggest&nbsp;an update, optional or not,&nbsp;and not be able to show any detail as to what the update&nbsp;is?</p>

            <p>VooDuu, </p>
<p>You are quite the character. I'm a bit amused and confused as to how/why you seem to think that I have anything to do with your GWX problem. I am between jobs right now but I am a truck driver and I really doubt any boss I have would give a damn if I found
 an answer to your question or not.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I too used to be plagued by the same GWX reminder and I actually found a way to get rid of it. Check out this:
<a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/214070-how-to-delete-microsofts-unwanted-windows-10-download-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.extremetech.com/computing/214070-how-to-delete-microsofts-unwanted-windows-10-download-files</a></p>
<p>I remember following their advice and after removing <span>KB3035583, restarting then going back to WU and clicking on the update again, cause they will still offer it again, and then hiding the update. I then went to the
</span><span>$WINDOWS.~BT folder and deleted as much of it as I was allowed. It was not easy but I was able to reduce it from almost 5GB to 1.66GB. Since then the notification and update are nowhere to be found. For some reason when I check my
<em>update history</em> it shows successfully installing KB3035583 twice. Once on October 10 and again on December 29. However when I look at my
<em>installed updates</em>, it is nowhere to be found and nothing on my system has changed.</span></p>
<p><span>This worked for me. Hopefully you can find some relief from what angers you. As for me, I won't be looking over my shoulder anytime soon cause I have never infected anyone's computer with anything but possibly a sticky keyboard.</span></p>

<p>2)&nbsp;Can&nbsp;Win Up suggest&nbsp;an update, optional or not,&nbsp;and not be able to show any detail as to what the update&nbsp;is?</p>
<p>3) Since&nbsp;the update&nbsp;is suggested in Windows Update is it a trusted update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Realtek RTL8168 device.</p>
<p>Driver ver: 7.46.610.2011</p>
<p>Windows Update&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;version: 106.12.1119.2014. (I had to install the suggested&nbsp;update to get this information.&nbsp;I&nbsp;rolled it back.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, I could not find a driver ver matching the WinUpdate at Realtek.</p>
<p>Instead, Realtek's site suggested 7.97.1001.2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps, someone more knowledgeable than I can use this additional information to find an answer. Thank you,</p>

            Not you, the person, Im talking about you, as in Microsoft you...I thought you were a Microsoft employee...and the GWX thing wasnt the original question, it was about the RealTek update that Crabby_patty asked, what, 10 days ago? Thats why the sarcastic
 venom...if I knew you were a fellow truck driver, (I carried the nations **** for 22 yrs), I wouldnt have been so aggro...but I still would have wanted an answer to the question.

            Sorry patty, didnt mean to draw attention to another issue, wasnt my intent. I was in the middle of trying to extricate that GWX from my PC and I must have popped all over Mark. My apologies. &nbsp; Voo

            <p>VooDuu,</p>
<p>I later realized that after my response to you. It caught me off guard when I received the email notification and I saw "Ummmm, HEY MARK...YEAH, YOU...Still waiting on your reply, bro..." Since my name is Mark I immediately thought it was directed at me
 personally. It wasn't until later that I was thinking, wait a minute, how does he know my name? All that he knows is killrkadoogan. It was too late by then. I want to apologize to Crabby Patty for getting off topic. I to have the same questions unanswered.
 Curse you Microsoft! See what your lack of useful information has led to? That info I gave about GWX was legit though. Good luck.</p>

    <title>Skype Mic Volume is Low - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Mic Volume is Low</h2>
                    <p>I use Skype daily to teach English online. I've recently had some problems with the students not being able to hear my microphone when it is plugged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the app version (windows 10) and I tend to use the classic version. Both are experiencing the same problem. I made sure that only one program was open at a time while running this test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time it occurred, restarting my computer worked, however, this time it didn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the audio settings. They are at the maximum with the computer settings. I've tried disabling the 'automatic adjust' settings in Skype and setting to the max.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the microphone is working perfectly in other programs like Audacity, my screencasting software and the other video calling program I use called Zoom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I am using the latest version of the Skype App.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. The first option was a bit overwhelming for me to try to figure out but I uninstalled and reinstalled Skype and it resolved the problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy to hear the transition is underway. Yes, there have been a lot of problems in the past few months.&nbsp;</p>
