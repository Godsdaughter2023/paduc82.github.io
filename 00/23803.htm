    <title>Bug found in WiFi-N network drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug found in WiFi-N network drivers</h2>
                    <p>I think I found a bug in Windows 10, this happends in combination with a RTL8723BE Wireless-N card.</p>
<p>Just got a brand new laptop, when I install Windows 10 from scratch (built 10074) internet is fast and no problems whatsoever, then I start the update process (slow or fast ring does not matter) and internet is becoming unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter if I take the Windows 10 network drivers or the Lenovo network drivers, in both cases internet is to slow for normal webbrowsing, reinstall fixes this issue but after the first update the problem is again there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I updated to the latest fast built hoping it was gone, but it wasn't.</p>
<p>So I checked device manager, and selected "IEEE 802.11b" instead of "auto" and for some reason internet works again.</p>
<p>When I open task manager it indeed says 802.11b instead of 802.11n and internet is normal again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other thing I noticed it that the WiFi signal is higher (5 including the dot) instead of 1 max 2.</p>
<p>This problem does not exist on my other laptop, which has a Broadcom 802.11g network card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the network card in device manager to IEEE 802.11 b/g also seems to work, the problem is related to the 'auto' selection where the network card switches to WiFi-n.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are pertaining to delete the&nbsp;<strong>entire conversation </strong>with the new Skype, please be advised that it is not yet available. However, you can
<strong>delete a chat</strong> for a specific contact. See the steps below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Right click on the chat you would like to delete.</li><li>Click <strong>Delete chat </strong>from the menu.</li></ul>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft does not provide a smooth and trouble-free upgrade path - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suat.cini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft does not provide a smooth and trouble-free upgrade path &#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clean-installed Windows 10 Build 17134.1 at the beginning of May 2018. After that I installed several insider builds ( Redstone 5 iterations ) over one another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one of the builds, I noticed that my Start Menu and Settings/Personalization/Colors went haywire when I turned on Transparency Effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Transparency Effects on ( Dark Mode ) with Start Menu and Colors setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc251562-7be0-490c-af69-a58481979492?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc251562-7be0-490c-af69-a58481979492?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Transparency Effects on ( Light Mode ) with Start Menu and Colors setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40ac0e90-da42-4c15-95bc-830333e7dd01?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40ac0e90-da42-4c15-95bc-830333e7dd01?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I clean-installed Build 17686 today and everything is all right now. No empty tiles in Start Menu or in Colors setting with Transparency Effects turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2f2428f-590b-4d06-8290-ecd614e2b750?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2f2428f-590b-4d06-8290-ecd614e2b750?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent Feedback several times about this anomaly but nothing changed until I clean-installed the recent insider build 17686.1003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I complain about this anomaly when clean-installation has gotten everything under control ? I said everything but actually not everything: When I try to associate .pdf files with Adobe Reader, Settings menu crashes. Till now I could only find this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is, when I visit Windows 10 Microsoft Community forums, I see that there are a good number of complaints from people all over the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The complaints are, I upgraded to …... and my computer went crazy. My computer upgraded automatically to …... and none of my programs are working. I upgraded to …. and my battery isn't charging. I upgraded to ….. and my wi-fi is gone. These complaints can
 reach hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why ? Because Microsoft has lost the ability to provide the customers with a smooth path to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I am able to re-install the OS with ease. But many people can't do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So guys, what do you think about this ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft releases a new version of Windows 10 every 6 months. Is this a short period of time for development of an OS as big as Windows 10 ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to hear your opinions.</p>

<p>I always try to keep in mind that those complaints from all over the world as you put it are a very small percentage of the millions of Windows 10 users. A help forum is by definition biased to those who are experiencing difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>then when piled on top of looking at the insiders, a group that is both more computer literate but also more likely to tinker, the stage is set for issues to arise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just keep on testing the beta versions, with the known and unknown problems, because I like to tinker and be ahead of the curve on what is coming down the pike.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without seeing the actual numbers of update issues, in the "release to public" versions or the insiders versions, there is not enough issue to be concerned about.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also get those weird screen issues on occasion, I believe it is a driver issue. I have reported in feedback and hope the telemetry tells MS there is an issue with the screen refresh.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Terry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your contribution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a good number of Microsoft Forums all over the world. I don't know how many people visit them with complaints.</p>

<p>In the past I would say things like " If it is Broken for One it should be Considered Broken for All"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply because if the one that is Broken is someone you need to work with the work is not going to get done. Except for the work time on the computer OS trying to get it to do what it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OS should be what is in total control and nothing Apps can ask for should break the OS because that is what the OS is for controlling things that are asked of the device that the OS is managing. If something is out of range for that device the OS needs
 to stop that request and document what was causing the request to be Out of range and be able to report that to the App and the company that Created the App causing the Out of Range Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I do not know what Microsoft does to Make this happen but I'm sure they are doing the best they can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making an OS that can Manage any App or any Device seems to be the Goal so I hope that Microsoft can reach that Goal some day what an Amazing Quest.</p>

            The description of the highlighting as yellow indicates that the template doesn't use any fields or content controls. Instead, it uses the "No changes (Read only)" editing restriction with "exceptions" for the editable areas.<br />
<br />
Using this type of "form", it is NOT possible to turn off the yellow highlighting as long as the protection is in force. You can click the Stop Protection button in the Restrict Editing pane, but that's all.<br />

 PowerPivot. &nbsp;If I double-click a total "Show Details cannot be completed on a calculated cell" dialog-box appears. &nbsp;With a standard Pivot Table, I can. &nbsp;According to some of my research, I seems to be able to use "drill through" feature if I download PowerPivot
 V2. &nbsp;However, I can never find a Webpage I can download PowerPivot V2. &nbsp;Where can I down load it? &nbsp;The reason I download PowerPivot is because the Standard Pivot Table has an issue with drill-through when I use a slicer. &nbsp;So "drill-through" is a number one
 feature I was looking for in PowerPivot. &nbsp;I was astonished that PowerPivot does not drill-trough. &nbsp;I truly appreciate your comment... &nbsp;Thank you very much.</span>

<div>Thank you very much. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What IT department installed to my PC is Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2-PowerPivot for Microsoft Excel 2010. Version ：10.50.4000.0 released on 7/12/2012. &nbsp;If I had known that V1 and V2 have such a huge difference, I would stop IT rep. installing 10.50.4000.0.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Today, I had another shocking discovery. &nbsp;PowerPivot V1 does not offer Advanced Mode. &nbsp;It is said Advanced Mode is only available in PowerPivot V2.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With mysterious reasons, I can never find a webpage which offers "PowerPivot V2". I've been opening over 100 links from yesterday and concluded that PowerPivot 11.0.31290 released on 1/9/2013 seems to be the latest version. &nbsp;The software name is Microsoft
 SQL Server 2012 SP1 PowerPivot for Microsoft Excel 2010. &nbsp;Is this same with the "Denali"?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyone who is using PowerPivot V2.....Will you please help me? &nbsp;Will you check your PowerPivot V2 version number by clicking PowerPivot tub? &nbsp;Does it state "Version 11.0.31290"? &nbsp;I'd really like to double-check if version 11.0.31290 IS REALLY POWERPIVOT
 V2.<span> </span>I can not afford asking IT department to keep installing different versions until we come up to V2 by accident. &nbsp;I'd like to be sure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you very much for PowerPivot V2 users...</div>

            After downloading and installing Version 11.0.3000.0 I could access Advanced Mode selection and could use Drill-Through. &nbsp;So even though it states V2 no where, Version 11.0.3000.0 seems to be the equivalent of PowerPivot V2. &nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Need to use existing OST with new Outlook 16 Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike 123abc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to use existing OST with new Outlook 16 Profile</h2>
                    <p>Today I had to create&nbsp;a new profile in Outlook 16 in order to access my existing Exchange server account. Why? Long story short: my access to another business Exchange account I had as default on my local client was removed/deleted at the server due to a
 job change and Outlook would no longer launch and recognize my personal Exchange account since it wasn't default. The workaround was to create a new profile&nbsp;for my existing outlook account and then set it as default.&nbsp;The problem is, when I did that, it created
 a new default OST which did not completely sync. I simply &nbsp;want this new profile to use my existing OST which was working fine up to this point. The Data Files browse button is disabled when I try and point to the old OST. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<h2>            Nokia 215</h2>
                    Being a bit of a cheapskate (and having a general aversion to smartphones) I recently bought a Noka 215 handset. Now, firstly it's rubbish and hugely inferior to the C1 handset I used to have. But specifically: I've been sent a message from Nokia asking
 for my feedback (which is ironic, since my feedback will be mostly negative) but I can't open it. And it being there stops me from using the right hand 'go to' button. Any idea how I can get rid of this message or open it?

</p><p>I have never heard of estimating finish time based on a target amount of earnings.&nbsp; I dare say that would be unethical.&nbsp; A job takes a certain amount of time. independent of what you might want to earn.&nbsp; The amount for labor is the hourly rate times the
 estimated time.</p>

<p>Estimated finish time is Target £240 divide by £24 = 10 hours from start time</p>

<p>
</p><p>The critical factor that you had omitted previously is what "current time" is or what the hourly rate is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your cell assignments are as follows (some of which you provided previously):</p>
<p>
</p><p>A1, start time: 13:00 or 1:00 PM</p>
<p>A3, current time:&nbsp; 14:30 or 2:30 PM</p>
<p>A5, hours worked:&nbsp; <strong>=(A3-A1)*24</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; (formatted as Number)</p>
<p>A7, current earnings:&nbsp; 36.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (formatted as Currency)</p>
<p>A9, hourly rate:&nbsp; <strong>=A7/A5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (formatted as Currency)</p>
<p>A11, target earnings:&nbsp; 240.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (formatted as Currency)</p>
<p>A13, target hours:&nbsp; <strong>=A11/A9</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (formatted as Number)</p>
<p>A15, target finish time:&nbsp; <strong>=A1 + A13/24</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (formatted as Time or Custom [h]:mm)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caveat:&nbsp; This mostly assumes that the target finish time is on the same day.&nbsp; I do not see any guarantee of that, since you determine the finish time based on target earnings(!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would behoove you to enter date as well as time into A1 and A3, and to format A15 to display date and time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[EDIT]</em> You can still format them to show only time of day, although A15 might be difficult to understand that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if A1 and A3 contain only time of day, the format [h] will display more than 23 if the finish time is another day.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[EDIT]</em> Aha!&nbsp; In fact, A3 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>does</em></span> include the date, if A3 has the formula =NOW(), as you indicated originally.&nbsp; In that case, A1,
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">must</span></em> also include the date.&nbsp; But if A1 contains only time of day, the formula in A3 should probably be
<strong>=MOD(NOW(),1)</strong>, or more reliably <strong>=--TEXT(NOW(),"h:m")</strong>, so that A3 also contains only time of day (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>not recommended</em></span>).</p>

 (400+ pages).&nbsp; The editor has win 10.&nbsp; We have had to put everything in pdf for her to mark, then I have to change it within Pub. on my Win 7 machine.&nbsp; I can't work on my new SurfaceBook at all.&nbsp; So frustrating.&nbsp; Are there some settings I'm missing?&nbsp; Any way
 around this?

            I just don't understand why a fix for a problem this big has not been found.&nbsp; It totally spoils all collaboration on projects between different machines.&nbsp; I am totally disappointed in&nbsp; MicroSoft.&nbsp; I installed fonts that came up missing when loading Pub.
 but I did not substitute Win7 fonts for Win10.&nbsp; This seems like a backward step.&nbsp; What will this do to other Win10 documents?&nbsp; I checked the undo graphic acceleration thing in pub.&nbsp; Did not help.&nbsp; Graphics drawn on my Win7 machine come up on a different place
 on my SurfaceBook.&nbsp; I guess this could be the spacing etc. with the fonts.&nbsp; This makes me very sad.<br />
I guess to finish this project I have to go back to my old laptop.&nbsp; Glad I didn't sell it.&nbsp; Will they take my ridiculously expensive SurfaceBook back?

The root cause of the problem is that you have circular references.&nbsp; I presume the circular references are intentional since you have the Iterative Calculation option set.<br />
<br />
I have not yet figured out exactly how that causes the problem whereby, for example, =IF($B$2=$A$21,AM3,AM4) in 'Coal price'!AM2 differs from AM3 (and AM4).<br />
<br />
(Since the conditional expression is TRUE, AM3 is the expected value.)<br />
<br />
Doing a full recalculation does not remedy the problem.<br />
<br />
We might expect that despite the circular references and iterative calculation, AM2 and AM3 should agree due to the obvious dependency order.<br />
<br />
My theory is:&nbsp; the iterative calculation proceeds one more time, effectively changing the value of AM3, then aborting the recalculation cycle when the iteration conditions are met, leaving the previous value in AM2.<br />
<br />
That is only an educated guess at this point.&nbsp; I will need to construct a much simpler example to test the theory.<br />
<br />
I am not familiar with the eccentricities of the iterative calculation.&nbsp; I have always found ways to avoid it.&nbsp; And I think you should as well.&nbsp; That might be "simplest" way to remedy your problem.<br />

<br />
Circular Reference Cell Calculation Sequence<br />
<br />
When your workbook contains circular references and Iteration is switched on (Application.Iteration is True) Excel has to use a slightly different calculation algorithm:
<br />
<br />
The first step is the same as a recalculation (or full calculation, depending how the calculation was invoked) that does not involve circular references. This enables all the cells that come before the circular reference to be properly calculated and the list
 of cells in the circular reference to be identified together with their dependents. During this first step Application.Iteration is False.
<br />
<br />
The second step occurs once on each iteration: The list of cells in the circular reference is calculated sheet by sheet, in alphabetic sheet name sequence (even in Excel 2002 &amp; 2003). Within each sheet the list of cells and array formulae in the circular reference,
 and all cells that are dependent on them, is calculated from left to right and top to bottom. (all the columns in the first row from left to right, then the next row ...). Each array formula in the list is calculated as a single block of cells from left to
 right and top to bottom, so if you want to use calculation by columns rather than by rows you have to use a multi-cell column array formula. This calculation ignores the dependency tree and relies on the iterative calculation process to resolve dependencies.
 Volatile cells that are not dependent on the cells in the circular list are NOT recalculated on each iteration.
<br />
<br />
This step is repeated until the iteration limits (maximum number of iterations and maximum cell change per iteration) are reached. During this second step Application.Iteration is True.<br />

<h2>            Sharing Folders with External Users &#40;w&#47;o sign-in&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
I am wondering why I am unable to accomplish such a simple task. Maybe someone can help me out here.<br />
<br />
What I want to do is to create a folder with bunch -of PDF's in it and also create a link for sharing these docs (folder) with whomever I chose. I don't want to force people to sign up for a FREE Microsoft account because most people just won't do that just
 to check out our brochures.</p>
<p>I also don't want to invite them one by one since it is so time cınsuming. Instead, I want to have a one link that would allow anyone who has that link to access my files.
<br />
<br />
Is this possible with One Drive? It is so simple with Google Drive but we are using Office 365 for our business and we want to keep everything at one place.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks...&nbsp; </p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you checked if there are any firmware updates available via checking in the [phone update section? if there is, please update to the latest version offered. failing that, you can try Restoring your phone to factory settings.<br />
<br />
Failing the above, you will need to take your phone to Nokia Care for inspection:

<p>Hello, Sarkodie. What feature or function of the phone is not working? Or are you referring to a specific app as you've posted your concern in this thread? If this is an app specific issue, what is the name of the app? Is this a built-in app or is it downloaded
 from the Store?<br />
<br />
What exactly happen when you tried to access the app, the feature or use the function on your device? Does it close right away once you tried opening it? Does it open but just continue to load?<br />
<br />
Is the internet connection of the phone up and running? Are you able to browse any websites via phone browser just fine?</p>

            Try following one by one and see after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.

<h2>            Administrator account won&#39;t sync to office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guy's,</p>
<p>I have a Exchange 2010 - Office 365 Hybrid setup, all of the user accounts have successfully synced to office 365. &nbsp;However I have the domain administrator mailbox still on-prem, I attempted to move the administrator mailbox to office 365, however I found
 that the Administrator account hasn't synced to office 365. &nbsp;I then moved the administrator account to the same OU as the other synced users in AD, completed a full sync and the account is still not appearing in office 365. &nbsp;Is there some sort of restriction
 with syncing the administrator account into office 365?</p>

            <p>Hi Basia62,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me assist you in finding your lost emails or getting them back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to verify if you had set up Email forwarding to receive emails from another account or if you had added a send and receive email account in your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Meanwhile, here are the possible reasons why you are unable to find your emails:</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. Emails got deleted due to Inactivity.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>When users don't sign in for more than 365 days or within the first 10 days after signing up for an account, the system will flag it as Inactive. After an account becomes inactive,
 all messages, folders, and contacts are deleted. Incoming messages will be sent back to the sender as undeliverable.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Also, if you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn’t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose
 emails due to inactivity in web account.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>2. Account has been hacked or compromised.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>You may lose emails if your account was hacked and the hacker had already deleted emails in your account.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. Conversation threading is enabled.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If the feature Conversation threading is turned on wherein all emails with the same subject line are grouped together. You can click

<p><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This feature

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>5. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Messages can be deleted if you are using a mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account and the option
<font><b>Always leave a copy of the message on the server</b> is not selected. This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail.</font></span></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can use the recover deleted or lost emails feature in Outlook.com to bring back your lost emails. However, when Outlook.com recovers missing or deleted emails, our system restores
 as many emails as it could regardless of its dates.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Please be reminded that there is no guarantee that the messages that you are looking for will all be recovered. You can refer to this
</font></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff">Solution Article</font></span></a><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
 for the steps to retrieve your lost or deleted emails.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: The system can recover messages but not the folder itself. Recovered messages will be presented in your Deleted folder. Also, emails will not be recovered via recovery link if they
 were deleted from email clients like Windows Live Mail, Microsoft Office Outlook, etc.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have other questions or clarifications, please let us know.</span></font></p>
