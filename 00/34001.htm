<h2>            Easy SDuite doesn&#39;t work after April 2018 update</h2>
                    Does any one know how to make the Easy Suite file transfer software work after the April 2018 update is installed?&nbsp; It worked before hand;&nbsp; now it appears to start launching, but then just disappears and doesn't complete the launch.&nbsp; Thanks again, Microsoft!!

            Hi Alfred,
<br />
<br />Try Uninstalling and then reinstalling that application to see if that resolves the issue, Windows Update may have pulled one of its compononents
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the Issue, go to the Software Manufacturers website and look for a patch or update, you can be sure you are not the only person experiencing this with their software . .

<p>The software is not installed on the computer (I looked for it in the installed programs list - it isn't there).&nbsp; Instead, it launches when the USB cable is plugged in - 'Run Easy Suite' is one of the options that comes up when the 'choose action to take'
 box is clicked.&nbsp; So, the 1st suggestion is a dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before posting here I did a Google search for the software;&nbsp; didn't find any helpful links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's another freeware option for transferring files using a USB cable, I'll probably go that route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>

            <p>I finally managed the 1511 (10586) upgrade from the 1240 version</p>
<p>
</p><p>My secret ...?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Stage 1 - download the upgrade to USB - it's a pain waiting again and again when it fails</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stage 2 - Having read about peoples' graphic cards issues (I'm running an AMD HD6670) I went to AMD direct and manually downloaded and installed Win10 64bit drivers.&nbsp; These were more up to date than my current AMD drivers which were being reported as latest!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stage 3 - I updated my Netgear WiFi drivers, just in case, but actually disconnected WiFi and went back to ethernet for the upgrade installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stage 4 - Disconnected all USB ports except Mouse/Keyboard transmitter (I couln't be **** to dig out my wired peripherals)</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it.&nbsp; To recap, all that was connected was Mouse/Keyboard + Ethernet + Windows 10 on USB.&nbsp; I didn't disable Kaspersky Internet Security, on the basis that Windows had to go onto the internet as part&nbsp; of the upgrade.&nbsp; I didn't disable any graphic drivers.&nbsp;
 All other programmes were safely closed.&nbsp; Oh, and I had a very recent image on an external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took for ever, but went through sweet as; which is a good thing as I didn't really fancy messing around with mobo firmware....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reconnected peripherals on at a time and they all seem to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Days!</p>

    <title>Controller&#47;Headset&#47;Play-Charge Kit Broken&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> igreentreefrogg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller&#47;Headset&#47;Play-Charge Kit Broken&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63; Mine too&#33;  PLEASE READ&#58; XBOX&#47;Microsoft Design All Accessories to Break</h2>
                    
<p>I am writing this post in hopes to spread awareness of how Xbox is designing their equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My experience with Microsoft, and their Xbox one accessories is as follows:</p>

<p>Since the launch of Xbox One, I have owned a total of: &nbsp;5 wireless controllers, 2 play and charge kits, and 3 wired headsets.&nbsp; Now, let’s be clear, I don’t own all of these things just for fun…I’m not a collector of xbox accessories…I don’t plan to sell
 them on ebay at a later date for a profit..</p>

<p>&nbsp;I have had NO CHOICE but to purchase these things in order to USE MY XBOX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;That last part is key.&nbsp; Because really, what is an Xbox One without its accessories?&nbsp; It’s nothing but an oversized, bulky, and honestly fairly ugly paper weight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Suppose I could have used the clumsy voice commands to navigate through the menus, but only to watch Netflix…not play a game, or communicate with my friends (through xbox live which I am also paying a monthly subscription for).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to get 2 of my 5 controllers for free from Microsoft as replacements for the 2 “bad” controllers they sold me on day one.&nbsp; Both controllers had broken left analog sticks after just a couple of weeks of use.&nbsp; One of these new controllers is also
 beginning to fail, this time the A button is getting stuck and being “pressed” more times than I intend it to…so I reckon I will be onto my 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;controller soon…but that’s neither here nor there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I had to buy the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;controller was that it took Microsoft nearly HALF A YEAR (after countless hours of phone calls and email chains) to send me replacements for the 2 “bad” controllers I was sold at launch…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for about 2 Months (Feb-March), I had no controller…again, I had NO CHOICE but to pay for a 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;controller (while waiting for replacements) when I’m only ever using 1 at a time.&nbsp; My choices were A) Don’t use your xbox.&nbsp; Or B) Pay for another
 controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since launch I’ve seen tens if not hundreds of threads on the forums discussing the same issues I’ve seen with my controllers….these threads never see any attention from an Xbox admin, they never see any responses.&nbsp; Xbox/Microsoft denies that there is ANY
 problem with their controllers.&nbsp; At this point in time, most of the threads are now locked or deleted (by xbox/Microsoft) so we are no longer able to openly discuss these issues…like they don’t exist..</p>
<p>&nbsp;I thought the forums were an open place for discussion, and not Nazi Germany, but I guess I was wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The controllers are bad enough, but really that’s just the beginning.</p>
<p>As stated above, I am onto my 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;play and charge kit.&nbsp; Let me start this by saying: Xbox, do you really hate your customers so much as to not have the charge kit built into your already overpriced system? Even PS3 had it….like come on guys…get
 serious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anyway, the issue with the play and charge kit is simple…it doesn’t charge.&nbsp; The wires in the cord frayed almost IMMEDIATELY after I took the kit out of its box.&nbsp; At first the cord would still charge the controller, but I couldn’t be playing while it charged….so
 how can it be called a “PLAY and charge kit”?&nbsp; It would charge only if the cord was bent in a certain direction and the controller had to be perfectly still, any slight movement would disconnect the frayed wires and so, the controller would disconnect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got to a point where even if I left the controller on the ground, plugged in to the cord, propped up so the wires and everything was in the appropriate position, the vibration of footsteps in the room (i kid you not) would cause enough movement to disconnect
 the charging cord.&nbsp; So basically, I have to keep a constant eye on my controller while its charging or it will likely become disconnected very quickly and not charge at all.&nbsp; I do not think this was the intention of the play and charge kit….certainly not how
 it is marketed.&nbsp; 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;cord was tossed, now onto my second.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My second play and charge cord has already begun displaying the same issues as the first.&nbsp; It is clear that the wires are frayed and have a hard time staying connected unless carefully placed in the appropriate orientation.&nbsp; It is a chore EVERYTIME I want
 to charge my controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course, who could forget the wired headset!?!&nbsp; I am now onto my 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;wired headset in under a year.</p>
<p>These things are probably the worst of them all.&nbsp; Within the first month after launch, I began to notice that my microphone would cut in and out.&nbsp; I first thought it was a connection issue, but it turned out (similar to the charge kit) it was just another
 case of frayed wires.&nbsp; If I wiggled the cord around and held it in place, the fray wires would connect and I could be heard…but that was the only way…I had to hold the wire (where the cord meets the controller adaptor) in the proper orientation to get a connection.&nbsp;
 It got worse and worse over the next couple weeks until it was simply un-usable.</p>
<p>At that point in time, I was in the process of having my replacement controllers shipped, and was luckily able to piggyback a wired headset replacement with the controllers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, since then, my replacement headset has failed in the exact same way as the first.&nbsp; The microphone began to cut in and out, I noticed if I moved my arms (while holding the controller) the mic would continuously connect and disconnect.&nbsp; Again,
 it became useless…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now, here I am again, forced to buy another accessory to simply USE MY XBOX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me make it clear again that I did not abuse these accessories…my controllers/headsets rest safely on top of my xbox when not in use, I do not pull or bend the cords (especially around the controller adaptor, as I know how HORRIBLE OF A DESIGN that is).&nbsp;
 Every time I plug the headset into my controller you’d think I was handling a butterfly.&nbsp; I am SO careful, yet they continue to break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind, these are my own experiences…many of my personal friends with the Xbox One have had identical issues (especially with regards to the controllers and headsets).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now, as I have gone through 5 controllers, 2 play and charge kits, and 3 wired headsets in less than a year… I ask xbox this.&nbsp; Do you expect your customers to keep spending 300$ a year to maintain their accessories?&nbsp; Simply to use their console?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is it going to take for Xbox/Microsoft to sell me a functioning piece of equipment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I click “Get a Replacement” on your website, thinking “Oh, that’s nice, they know there is an issue and are sending replacements!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this link only leads customers to a checkout page where they can BUY ANOTHER…which is NOT the same as getting a “replacement”.&nbsp; Very tricky wording there Xbox…very coy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So…what is it going to take?</p>
<p><br />
Do I need to go through the escalation process every time an accessory breaks? I don’t have enough time in the day to spend 2 hours on the phone with your terrible call centers.&nbsp; What would you have me do Xbox? Please advise, I would love some advice here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any lawyers out there? I've seen a few posts about a lawsuit but it seems they are yet to *** off the wrong person.</p>

<p>Xbox...i want to contiune to support you as i have for the past 10+ years...but you are making it extremely difficult to do so. &nbsp;Why are you selling your customers junk? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Had mine since launch, dogs have pushed my Day One controller off the couch dozens of times and I haven't had an issue with controller, charge and play, or headset adapter, no electronic device is going to last forever, but sounds like you need to treat
 your stuff a little better.</p>

<p>Dont own the X1, but am knowledgable about these sorts of problems.</p>
<p>1, Theyll never admit it, but the X1 thumbsticks are weak where they connect to the mod, and will break/wallow out during normal use. Solution take it back to the place of purchase for a replacement, or if thats not an option and MS want replace it.</p>
<p>Buy replacement thumbsticks, which can be had cheap online and simply replace them. Youtube has videos on how to do it. Whats causing them to break is clicking on the thumbstick for sprinting in games like CoD etc, and while clicked moving in one direction
 or the other, the plastic shank of the thumbstick shell will often split, allowing the stem to wallow around inside.</p>
<p>The original, and xbox 360 thumbsticks could take the abuse, but the redesigned x1 controler with its brittle thumbsticks simply cannot. I forget how much MS said it spent redesigning the controller, but whatever&nbsp;the cost was, it was completely offset by
 using&nbsp;shabby matterial/workmenship in its construction.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2, Dont use play and charge kits. Purchase rechargable batteries, and charger. Often less than 20 bucks for 4 batteries plus charger at wally world etc..and use them instead. Play and charge kits. In my personal&nbsp;view.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are simply&nbsp;a 'dead' expense.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>3, it sounds as if the wires/connections for the headsets are less than ad to do the intended job. Thus you may want to try using better quality headsets. Or you can try slidding the connector outwards a touch when connected. What I mean by that is.. Connect
 the headset to the controller and then ever so slightly begin slidding the connector probe outwards until you can hear others through the headset clearly. If it still dont work... Well, ive no other ideals at this time.</p>

<p>While it's unfortunate that you are having so many issues, ant, I have personally had virtually no issues with my controller and I've had it, along with my console, for nearly an entire year. IMO, you are actually in the minority - most people don't have
 any issues with any of these (or at least don't take the time to complain about it online if they do). For example, my play and charge kit fits nice and snug within my controller - in fact, it's so tight, I have to tug really very hard in order to get it out
 (basically the opposite of your issue).</p>
<p>It seems to me you already know of not one, but several solutions to this issue - you've already contacted support and had replacements sent to you as well as bought new replacements yourself; both are valid solutions (that most people would likely do WITHOUT
 complaining about it here). If you know the solution and have followed through, why the need to complain or inform others? Since &nbsp;you're posting to this forum to educate others, allow me to educate you: I'm afraid it will largely fall on deaf ears either because
 as I already said, theirs probably works, or they simply don't want to read about other people's issues. I'd also like to inform you that although these are the official Xbox forums, they are not run or read by Microsoft in any official capacity - again, your
 complaints/info will likely fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Finally, you shouldn't presume to tell us how they are manufactured - we know exactly how they are manufactured. In fact, it was featured in a video during Xbox One's release, which can be seen

<p>Geek, my play and charge is also snug in the controller...its the frayed wires within the cord that casue the connection to fail....this is EXTREMELY detailed in my original post...did you even read it?</p>
<p>Your response really couldnt have been any less helpfull, or any more condescending...thanks for nothing. &nbsp;If you had ANY IDEA (which you dont) whiat i had to go through to get those replacement controllres, you wouldnt bring your ignornace in here.</p>
<p>I could show you in a video i suppose...ANY movement of the controller or cord while the cord is plugged in will cause it to disconnect.</p>
<p>And to ANYONE (Zero Divided) who thinks someone who had done the damge to their stuff themselves would be ignorant enough, mentally challenged enough, to come online and write a god damned essay describing the experiences that he has had, you sir, are a
 fool, and you are not helping anyone.</p>
<p>Like you really think im damaging my stuff? &nbsp;my post clearly states that i am no abusing the accessories, many of them have problems after a few week of use. &nbsp;I am a grown a$$ man and I treat the things that I BUY very carefully...if you are going to wrongfully
 assume i am the one causing the damage, please take your comments elsewhere. &nbsp;you are wasting my time.</p>

<p>Sorry but I was only speaking of my own experiences and those of the people I game with almost daily, no one I associate with seem to have any of these problems, several with Day One consoles, and several purchased over the past few months, I use the charging
 cable daily to charge my controller, phone and tablet and it still works as perfectly as the day I took it out of the box.</p>
<p>All I can do is go off of what you written in your posts, and from it I gather that either you, and your friends, are the most unlucky people... Like ever, or there is something more to the story.</p>
<p>And just because someone says something you didn't like doesn't mean you should start with the personal attacks, that is not how grown men handle a disagreement, and that is how threads get deleted and locked.</p>

<h2>            Text deletes when typing &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    When typing, I end a sentence with punctuation, hit space bar, and half or all of the previous text disappears.&nbsp; What is this functionality called?&nbsp; Is it a sticky key, quick key?&nbsp; I think I am somehow hitting a sequence of keys at the same time causing
 immediate actions, which prompts a delete.

            Yes, you will have to do a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium (regular version). The 'N' version is a separate product specifically for European market the keys are hard coded for that particular version.

Stop proposing your answer as the solution. The OP wants Windows 7 Home Premium not Home Premium N, there was mention of need for Media Components, although that could be reason.<br />

<p>this is the answer, accept it or not. You can't install the normal Edition with a N Key. We had this discussion already in a former topic.</p>
<p>When he wants all features back, he had to install the Feature Pack, with the update, there no difference to the normal Edition.</p>

<p>Where in my post did I say that? I said the OP will need to obtain and reinstall the regular Home Premium. They got it through BizSpark, so I assumed they can get the regular Home Premium through there too. The issue is, you are proposing an answer that
 has not been verified by OP whether it is correct or not.</p>
<p>Basically, you are putting answers in their mouth.</p>

    <title>PlasmaCAM Program Won&#39;t Open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cainvu  say:</h3>
<h2>            PlasmaCAM Program Won&#39;t Open</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm running Windows XP on a desktop in my shop for a program called PlasmaCAM. In all my past years of using this program, nothing has ever gone wrong. A couple days ago I went to use it again and when I clicked to open the program it told me "PlasmaCAM
 is already running" so I went into task manager, stopped the PlasmaCAM process and tried again. This time, the program opened for a split second then disappeared, almost like its opening off screen. I searched for answers and found that I could try to move
 it back onto the original screen, but the program is not appearing in the task bar.</p>
<p>After toying around with it a little bit, when I try to open it, it gives me the error "Could not open PlasmaCAM because get_io.dll could not be found". I'm guessing "get_io.dll" is some file that runs the program. After some searching, I found the file
 but it would not let me open it.</p>
<p>I'm stumped on what to do, I've tried logging on in safe mode and all. Any input as to what's happening/how to fix it would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You need to run the format from the installation or recovery disk.&nbsp; Boot to the disk and click on repair or otherwise get to the screen of recovery options and select Command Prompt.&nbsp; Type Format C:\ and enter and it should format the disk.&nbsp; If that doesn't

To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and
 exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />

                    <p>How do I report a gamertag that has hacked into my daughters BO2 account but left no trace behind him. Nothing on her Microsoft or console history. He just went in, changed her stats, her prestiges, gun loadouts and created a couple offensive emblems. then was cocky enough to send her a message just a lil bit ago bragging about it. i called Xbox live but they said i had to go to enforcement support but when i go there i could find where to report this person. please let me know where to go or who to contact. Thanks</p>

<h2>            Yahoo Homepage Displays in Foreign Language &#40;Windows 7&#41; after latest Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I open the Yahoo homepage, in any browser (IE9, Firefox, Chrome), it appears in Swedish, with a tab to enable me to display it in English (but, even after I click the tab to display in English, the Swedish tab still appears). I have checked my Yahoo
 preferences and&nbsp;they correctly show the language set as English (United States).&nbsp;It seems to have been happening just the past week, quite possibly as a result of the latest W7 update. I hesitate to roll back the update, because I know they are necessary.
 Has anyone else had this problem?</p>
<p>I realize this issue may be a Yahoo issue, but Yahoo help pages are worth than useless. Trying them only got me dizzy from going in circles. And, I don't know if this should be submitted under "Windows Update" or "Programs" forum; this is best guess.</p>

<h2>            Looking for girl gamer friends &#58;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I am basically looking for more girl gamer friends to play with, I don't have a lot of games but I do like to play Call of Duty Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3... I know those aren't very female friendly games but hey it's all I have really. I also
 have all the Halo games for the xbox360, I'm not very good at them, in fact, frankly I suck horribly lol but I would play them if someone asked me to. I am not a competitive player, I play mostly for fun, curse words do slip from my mouth once in a while but
 I am not a compulsive curser like a lot of gamers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways I am looking for girls of any age, it doesn't really matter as long as you are mature, although I would prefer girls who are over age 15/16 so that we can play like mature adults. I am 24, very laid back and do love to socialize so if anyone (girls)
 would like to be my friend and play together sometimes plz send me a friend request and a message saying who you are :)</p>
<p>Sorry but this post is not meant for guys, sorry guys, I just have way too many guys on my friends list and would like to meet more girls. Also I HATE getting spammed with friend requests from guys simply because I am a girl!</p>
<p>Anyways thanks for reading and I hope I can make some girl friends ^_^</p>

    <title>Possible spyware on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> x gasmask x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible spyware on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Earlier today my girlfriend called me and told me that while she was playing overwatch a strange video started playing, and she had to hard restart the console.&nbsp; I didn't know what she meant but about 15 minutes ago it happened to me.&nbsp; I was playing Mortal
 Kombat X when the screen went black and then a strange video started to play.&nbsp; It showed a kid, a bicycle, a guy in a hazmat suit, and some other weird [mod removed] This video played three times in a row all the while I'm trying to exit the [mod removed]
 thing.&nbsp; Then the screen went black and I had to restart the console again to get back to normal conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm afraid there is somehow spyware on my console or someone has figured out how to hack into our xboxs.&nbsp; No one seems to know what is going on so this must be a new thing, but I need help fast because this is a little worrying.</p>
<p>Also I called the toll free help line and even though my console has been registered since day one you guys can't seem to find a record of it.&nbsp; So you guys really need to get that straightened out too.&nbsp; This is very frustrating.&nbsp; You refuse to speak to us
 unless our consoles are registered and when they are you say they aren't and hang up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p><br />

<p>I'm sorry to say this but i can't buy this I'm not trying to be rude but only Microsoft can release updates for the console and since the only way is a virus via USB / External HDD etc Microsoft would never intentionally put this into the consoles OS software.</p>
<p>Short story if you put a USB / External HDD etc with a virus attached to it then it the console are going to act like this until you factory reset both of them. If it still persists get your local Microsoft retailer involved to see what they can do.</p>

<p>So I had the same thing. More then likely it's your routers defense to someone trying to ride your ip. I have been getting pings from random ips as well as at.awola attacks. It freezes my xbox first then shuts it down to neutralize the attack. Then I get
 an alert from from my xfi about a threat. @Microsoft if you can help?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Have tried connecting the devices via Itunes?<br />
<br />
Follow these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span>Boot into <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Advanced Boot Options</span></a></strong> and disable driver signing checking.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disabling driver signature enforcement has helped a lot of users in fixing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You may also delete the USB "Upper Filter" &amp; "Lower Filter" Entry and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Before we go any further, please first backup the Registry. </span></p>
<p><span><br />

 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge

</p><p><strong>What is the Reserve Upgrade app?</strong></p>
<p>The Windows 10 upgrade is designed to be compatible with your current Windows device and applications*. We are hard at work to make this upgrade process a great experience.
<strong>You can reserve your free Windows 10 upgrade now through a simple reservation process.</strong> Look for this icon in your system tray at the bottom of your screen, simply click on the icon, and then complete the reservation process.

<p><strong>The reservation app is not working, it displays a blank screen:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If the Reservation application (Windows 10 app) has a blank screen or does not work or is not available:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Check Windows Update for an updated version of KB2952664 (Windows 7 SP1) or KB2976978 (Windows 8.x)</strong></li><li>After installing the Windows Update, re-run the&nbsp;Compatibility Appraiser. This will happen automatically within a day or it can be run manually from an&nbsp;admin command prompt:
<ul>
<li>schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser"</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once started, it may take&nbsp;10 minutes or so&nbsp;for the appraiser to complete. Once&nbsp;complete, re-open the Get Windows 10 app and it will have the updated compatibility information.</p>

</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn’t get a notification? </strong></p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
•Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
•Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
•Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
•Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
•Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
•Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each update and click Uninstall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Other reasons why you might not be seeing it:</em></strong></p>
<p>Why don’t I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don’t see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.
</strong></li></ol>
<p>Running Windows Update and installing any available updates will fix the first three issues. Need more help? Go to our

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we’ll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC’s compatibility if you
 choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device is managed as part of a school or business network, please check with your IT administrator about upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Task menu background transparency - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ybreton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Task menu background transparency</h2>
                    <p>About the Windows 10 Task menu background, how can we achieve complete transparency, not just translucidity?</p>
<p>I upgraded to W10 from W7 and I can't achieve more than translucidity. A friend upgraded to W10 from W8.1 and he has it without knowing how. Does the previous Windows version still affect Windows 10 menus?
</p>
<p>I'd really like to know how to achieve it. It looks very nice to have the Task menu appear without background; tiles only, over the screen image.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

 and drag to the required size for the start menu. </p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. Resizing the task menu is interesting. But what I would&nbsp; like to know is how to render the background of this menu completely transparent, not translucide (only option yet offered). It looks very nice when task menu tiles are floating
 over the screen background image seen directly and not through a blurred menu background. Formulated differently, the question would be how to increase task menu background transparency to make it completely transparent?</p>

            <p>I discovered how!&nbsp; The task menu option for Full screen has to be "on" then the background becomes the desktop background instead of the blurred colored background through which the desktop background Is barely visible.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Windows 10 team, Great work.</p>

<p>This is not isolated to one website, indeed, Adobe's own test page doesn't recognise it. This must be an inherent problem with the implementation of Flash Player in Edge.

            Thank you for this, I had already looked at this link in a vain attempt to get some useful help and hence the reason for my post. Clearly all this link does is tell you how to turn Flash on and off - the title and question specifically refers to Flash
 player not working/not recognised as toggling it on (which was the default) seems to have absolutely no effect.

            <p>your original post does not refer to anything related to that setting - which could have been switched off. I have no issues with flash on my Edge browser so there is no "inherent problem with the implementation of Flash Player in Edge" - otherwise it wouldn't
 work for anyone.</p>

<p>thanks again.</p>
<p>apologies I realise I was not clear in the last sentence of my reply; I meant that the reason I originally posted was because I'd tried the toggle switch but you are of course correct that I didn't mention that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the second link you have posted also doesn't aid me - because my Flash is not working, the page only informs me what the latest version is.</p>

            I too am having the same problem. Flash under Edge does not work. It is not recognized as being installed by using pages. Perhaps the issue is the upgrade path. I went from Windows 7 Home Premium to 10 HP. One thing to note is that flash works fine if
 I select the menu option "Open With Internet Explorer". That is, in the IE window, Flash works. My understanding is that the application is still Edge, just using the old IE rendering engine. So if the application is using the same Flash player, then the issue
 is in the rendering engine. Specifically the Edge rendering engine.

            <p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Background Scenario Summary</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I had upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10</li><li>I had tried the obvious solutions
<ul>
<li>checking that flash was toggled on in Edge</li><li>checking the quite frankly useless Adobe website</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Solution</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Well, in the absence of any kind of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">technical</span> support from Microsoft, I did what many have done and did a clean install - this has solved the Flash Player issue</li><li>I only managed to get this to work in the end by using a WINDOWS 10 BOOTBALE DISC</li></ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I first did this&nbsp;through 'reset' within 'settings/update and security/recovery</li><li>As with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">many</span> who have tried this, when Windows rebooted, it got stuck in an infinite restart loop showing the error INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE - (no idea what caused this or how to fix it)</li><li>I had selected the option to remove old data from the hard drive and my Win 7 recovery disc 1 was somehow corrupted and therefore couldn't reboot from it</li></ul>
<p>You <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">must</span> therefore do the following things before a clean install:</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup everything you want to keep</li><li>If you want to retain Windows 7, at least make/check your recovery discs (be aware that&nbsp;I don't know if this would have solved my problem)</li><li>Create a Windows 10 boot disc - either on DVD or USB (check your BIOS supports the latter)</li><li>Check that Windows 10 is activated before you do any reset</li></ol>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I eventually (more by luck than judgement) got windows 10 installed through using a bootable USB</p>

            <p>Really?&nbsp; so to get Flash to work on my browser I need to re-install Windows?&nbsp; Six hours of backing up, installing, re-installing all my software, messing around with Live mail to recover thousands of emails, etc.....&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
or&nbsp; I could just use another browser like Chrome or Firefox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is in no hurry to acknowledge there is a problem. They aren't posting any info about it or any fixes anytime in the near future. A big mistake on their part as hundreds of thousands are just going to get frustrated (as we were with IE 11), dump
 Edge and most likely never go&nbsp;back. </p>

            Its funny isn't it? There are several threads about this, and on most a representative of Microsoft has popped up and told us to switch it on in the settings. When we all say that doesn't work we never hear from them again. There's nothing like a poor
 product and a lack of customer service to drive us to the competitors is there?
