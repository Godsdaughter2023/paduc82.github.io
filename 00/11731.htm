<h2>            Cannot edit on office for mac with my student account</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i am a student and have the license to office 365 student edition. I am currently using a macbook air and it does not seem to allow me to edit documents as it use to before. Rather, it keeps showing this. (Refer to attached screenshot 1)</p>
<p>Additionally, every time i try to sign in with a different account, this will come up. (Refer to attached screenshot 2)</p>

<h2>            What&#39;s the significance of 93&#37;</h2>
                    My upgrade to 10547 has failed twice at 93%. Looking back over previous builds, I notice that failure at 93% is fairly common. Anyone any idea why this should be?

<p>It's been at 93% for just over a day now. As for power, I've got an AMD FX8350 8 Core Processor running at 4.00 GHz.<br />

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried that a couple of hours ago. It's now started configuring again. What's the betting on it stopping at 93%?</p>
<p>The only thing I've installed is Office.</p>

            Most of the posts that had this sort of stall at a certain %&nbsp;(and fixed it) seem to indicate that they had to disable or unplug some device to get it to install.&nbsp; The clean boot approach, disabling all unnecessary hardware and startup software and non-Microsoft
 Services might work.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't associate url:ms-excel and url:MS-word with Word and Excel. I have a Windows account that I use to logon to my computer and an Office 365 account for my business. When I try to associate these apps with their respective protocols, I get a message
 stating there is no app installed to open this file type. I am then directed to the app store to purchase Word and Excel. I have already paid for an Office 365 for Business subscription and I have installed Office Pro Plus. At present I cannot open Word or
 Excel from Teams or Sharepoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    I understand no longer "supporting" legacy products like Office XP &amp; 2003, but I do not understand why Microsoft will no longer activate either of these! I have roughly $2500.00 worth of software that is now useless! I had to do a re-install after a hard
 drive crash &amp; now my software is useless???? I work in a field that commonly uses Windows XP &amp; Office 2003 because it is what is compatible with most all of the CNC machines in our shop! We have tried to upgrade some of the pc's but it ended up crashing one
 of the machines &amp; it was down for several week! After that we were told by the owner to "stick with what has worked for us &amp; stop costing me money." I attended the launch event for Windows &amp; Office XP, &amp; this was the subject of a huge debate when Microsoft

            Actually in the machining industry I have recently seen &nbsp;OS2, Windows NT 4, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, &amp; 98, so it is not all that uncommon to run across these legacy systems, &nbsp;in fact some of the machines will not run on anything else!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem with the updater is that it says current version 3.83 new version 6.01(so there is comms to my phone) it then downloads the 76 Mb file and then says updating software, Estimated time 15 minutes and then nothing happens thereafter. It is as if
 it has lost comms with the phone. Does anybody know what the problem may be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            remove all software components and reinstall new, make sure you remove all the drivers and reinstall both nokia pc suite and nokia software updater, reboot your system and try again and see if it makes any difference.&nbsp;

<h2>            Vertical scrollbar not painting new records on form</h2>
                    I have a small business with several PCs running a collection of Access database forms, reports, etc. &nbsp;Recently, the behavior of the data display has changed when scrolling on forms. The vertical scrollbar slider moves up and down and indicates that record
 numbers are changing but the data on the form does not change. &nbsp;The scrolling behavior works fine on datasheets but not on forms. &nbsp;It works fine in all other applications (e.g. Excel, Word, Edge) &nbsp;The data used to scroll and repaint the same on forms and datasheets.
 &nbsp;It still works fine on some of my PCs. &nbsp;I have limited the test to a simple sample database with one table so the database and forms are identical across PCs. &nbsp;All PCs are current with Windows 10 updates. &nbsp;I have tried swapping mice, keyboards and screens
 but the problem seems to be PC related. &nbsp;

            One thing I have noticed with my E7 and connecting it with the computer is that I have my computer and the nokia suite connected to the internet. I had noika suite blocked from accessing the internet, because I just wanted to add some music, and I would
 get errors everytime I tried. Then I turned off my firewall, and since Nokia suite could now access the internet, it finally worked. Eventhough I wasnt doing anything over the internet.<br />
You might want to check this. Also you might want to see what the Default Programs setting is for the phone. You can check/change this via the control panel.

<p>In addition to any possible software issues it is not unknown for microUSB socket upon E7 to become detached from motherboard, which can lead to intermittent connectivity issues in it's early stages as solder joints break down.</p>

<p>i have tried more than 50 times today, sometimes it gets connected and then within&nbsp; afew seconds it gets disconnected, but most of the time its not connected at all, but charging is ongoing.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem with my E7 in that Nokia suite could not see the phone when I connected it, removed all the suite incl cable drivers etc &amp; reinstalled several times but with the same result: it would see the phone upon first using NS but next time
 I had the same problem. Using the cable from my old N97 solved the problem for me &amp; I had no further connectivity problems. It's only since upgrading to Belle that I can now return to using the cable which came with the E7.</p>

<p>It is based on your phone capabilities, not your phone model. When a developer is submitting an application he or she must specify all of the required hardware for the application and the resolutions is supports.</p>

<p>When you first go to the Marketplace website you'll see applications that have no hardware requirements selected. W?hen you sign in the view is filtered based on your device properties and your operating system version.&nbsp; Occasionally developers will make
 mistakes in specifying requirements such as accidentally clicking on an item of hardware that isn't actually required or forgetting to check a supported resoluion. When this happens you'll find that the application may be available from the vendor's website
 and is listed as compatible for your device but the application is evaluated as incompatible on the marketplace.</p>

<p><span>I finally got fed up looking for Microsoft to fix this issue and decided to try the regedit solution and went online to find this again but could not locate this thread until after I had already found another solution that removed
 the /dde from the default string and replaced it with “%1” and changed the name of the ddeexe folder where yours replaces the command string with “%D”</span></p>
<p><span>I tried both and when I use the “%D” I was still receiving the warning but the file did open so I went with the other option</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the other link in case others need this fix as well</span></p>

<p><span>I did this for both entries</span></p>
<p><span>Excel.Sheet.12</span></p>
<p><span>Excel.Sheet.8</span></p>
<p><span>Again this is Windows 7 64-bit with Excel 2013 in case others have an older version of Excel I believe there will only be Excel.Sheet.8</span></p>

<p><span>The compatibility mode was set to XP SP 2, so I changed it on both excel and word to Win7 and they are both now working thanks so much this isuse has been killing me.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;Snip&gt;The problem was not related to the file or its content.&nbsp; I could stop the message by changing the name of the file to end .doc without changing the format of the file content.</span></p>
<p><span>I searched for and found many suggested fixes for the problem ... and none of the fixes worked for me.&nbsp; I eventually fixed the message “There was a problem sending the command to the program” with a change in the registry.&nbsp; I
 edited “HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Word.Document.12\shell\Open “ and deleted the “ddeexec” key.&nbsp; The “ddeexec” key can also be deleted from “HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Word.DocumentMacroEnabled.12\shell\Open”.&nbsp; A similar change may work for earlier versions of Word.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>For Word 2013, you can change the registry by right-clicking and saving&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.dilloway.co.uk/del-ddeexec.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="REG file for There was a problem sending the command to the program">
this file ...</a> </span></p>
<p><span>Double-click the file after downloading to update the registry.&nbsp; WARNING ... It is you that knows the situation of your own computer.&nbsp; I cannot know about your computer and cannot be responsible for any unintended consequnces.&nbsp;
 I have tested this process and I am confident that it is safe.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>****************** </span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Basically I needed to be able to run all my macro enabled workbooks as administrator (because for some reason using adobe functionality in macros requires this), so I was not willing too succumb to having to run excel manually
 in Administrator mode every time I wanted to open a file.</span></p>
<p><span>when I changed the default for Excel.exe to always run as administrator, I would be unable to open an Excel file directly. I would either receive the “There was a problem sending the command to the program.” Error or Excel would
 just open with no workbook. Then I would have to select the office button and open the file from within Excel.</span></p>
<p><span>I had a play with a shortcut to my excel file that used the Excel.exe application with the Filename as a parameter...Strangely this actually worked. So I next went into Windows Registry and amended all of my parameters for excel
 files to do this. </span></p>
<p><span>Here is how you can do it in Windows 7/8:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>1. Allow the excel application to default to Run As Administrator.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>2. Press the Windows Key and R to open the run cmd line ... Type in regedit</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>***Warning</strong> editing Registry Values can cause serious harm to your computer***</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>3. Navigate to the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT directory and locate your excel file extensions</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>NB</strong>: Depending on your version of excel, these might be listed under the extension (.xlsm etc) or at the bottom by file type name (Excel.Macro.Worksheet.12 etc)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>4. Navigate to the Shell&gt;Open&gt;Command property and right click on the command value (right hand section) and click modify.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>5. At the end of the line of jibberish you will find a parameter (usually /e). Replace this value with “%D” including quotation marks.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<strong><span>&nbsp; NB</span></strong><span>: What this does is runs the Excel application with the full Filename and path of the file that you have tried to open as the parameter.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>6. Repeat this for all excel extensions that have a Shell&gt;Open&gt;Command property.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>7. Close Regedit, and test out your work by double-clicking on any excel file.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Sercho.</span></p>

<h3> wingmr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 620 QHUSB_DLOAD</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 620 that I installed the Windows 10 Mobile Technical Preview on. &nbsp;It became very slow and the Settings option would not work, so I downloaded the Windows Phone Recovery Tool ver 1.2.4 and ran a recovery. &nbsp;This then reported that the recovery
 had failed and the phone showed a red screen saying Nokia. &nbsp;I tried the process again and it failed again, but this time the phone is showing nothing on the screen and is totally unresponsive. &nbsp;In Device Manager it shows as QHUSB_DLOAD. &nbsp;Now the Windows Phone
 Recovery Tool cannot detect the phone at all. &nbsp;Holding down Power and Volume Down buttons does cause the USB connection to end and reconnect, but otherwise, there is nothing on the phone screen.</p>
<p>Please help. &nbsp;Is there anything I can do to recover my phone back to Windows 8.1?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, but the phone is completely dead. &nbsp;There is nothing on the screen, and pressing the buttons does nothing. &nbsp;I have tried leaving it on charge overnight, but there is no sign that it is even charging as there is nothing on the
 screen and it does not vibrate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I then plug the phone into my PC via the USB cable, I can hear the PC make the sound for when a USB device is plugged in, and the tray message says "Nokia Emergency Connectivity successfully connected" and it shows up in device manager as&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">QHUSB_DLOAD
 but the phone remains dead. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If I go into&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Phone Recovery Tool on the PC, and attempt to recover the phone, it does not detect the phone is plugged in. &nbsp;I click
 on the button "My phone was not detected", then it says "Waiting for a connection" and eventually suggests rebooting the phone by pressing Power and "Volume down" at the same time. &nbsp;I have tried holding these 2 buttons down, and eventually, I hear the USB
 disconnection sound on the PC, but there is still nothing on the phone and it does not vibrate. &nbsp;If I release the buttons, the phone reconnects to the USB , but still shows nothing on its screen, and Windows Phone Recovery Tool still does not detect it.</span></p>
<p>I also tried using the Lumia Software Recovery Tool (ver 5.0.7) and that also does not detect the phone automatically. &nbsp;However, when I press the button "My phone does not start up or respond", and follow the instructions to disconnect and reconnect the
 phone, it then says "The selected phone is not supported by Lumia Software Recovery Tool".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the Windows Phone Recovery Tool has completely erased everything from the phone, including the Windows &nbsp;and boot loader. &nbsp;What can I do to get the phone to work again?</p>

            <p>I have updated he Windows Phone Recovery Tool to version 2.1.0, and then attempted to recover my Lumia 620. &nbsp;It does not automatically detect the phone, so I clicked on "My phone was not detected", then I select "LUMIA" as the phone's manufacturer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It then comes back with "The Connected device cannot be recovered".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that the Windows Recovery Tool has written off my phone when I first attempted to use it, and that I will never get it back as a functioning phone?</p>

<p>Hook up a second monitor which does have the required resolution.&nbsp; Another scenario that I imagine could be relevant is using Remote Desktop.&nbsp; E.g. would a Remote Desktop user's monitor's resolution be enough to satisfy the requirement that the actual host
 could not provide physically?</p>

<h2>            WP7 Mozart Mail Sync works only once then I get error 85010001</h2>
                    
<p>I have a strange mail sync issue against a W2K8 E2K7 SP3 machine. WP7 and server is set to US english locale. I have a german keyboard layout as well on my phone but also without it the problem is also there. There is another entry pointing to a language
 issue so I verified that everything is set to US english. All involved machines have us english OS and products installed. There is no MUI on any of these boxes.</p>
<p>I can sync once then it does not work. I get error 85010001. When I change the machine name to an alias I can sync again but only once. I'm not using SSL to avoid issues on that side.</p>
<p>I tried this with several accounts against that machine but the problem happens there as well. On the same machine against hotmail IMAP4 oder POP3 all works fine.</p>
<p>The problem happens via local W-Lan as well as via 3G connection.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Patrizia!</p>
<p>The proposed solutions in the referred thread are not relevant. Especially as all my systems run in US english versions. I do this to avoid troubles like this.</p>
<p>There was one thing that cached our attention: it works <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>once</strong></span> but never again. So there is something different the first connection an the later ones.</p>
<p>My E2K7 server has an internal domainname xzy.local and a official one for accessing the box via 3G network. The&nbsp;server is behind a fire wall in a 172.16.x.x network.&nbsp;A friend from MS was finally helping me and found the solution.</p>
<p>The solution was primnarily to define the outside domain name on my internal DNS as well. Up to that point I lived on failovers and forwarders. So all machines outside of my local LAN need to be defined on my internal DNS as well. This is some nasty work
 as I have many WEBs outside my LAN.&nbsp;Now my internal DNS responds to xyz.local as well as my own official domain if there is a request comming from my local LAN. Certificate name resolutions now point to the correct machine (my E2K3 box) and things work fine.</p>
<p>Additionally I installed a certificate from startssl to secure the mail traffic&nbsp;when I sync via 3G network. Actually the troubles there made us looking at the DNS issue which finally solved the overall problem. It works fine without the SSL connection as
 well. I expect it works with the previous self signed certificate as well but I haven't tried it as I have a "official" certificate now working.</p>
<p>Hope this helps others which might step into that situation. Eventually MS might want to publish a white paper how to set up a active sync configuration in a non official DNS domain in a firewalled network.</p>

<h2>            Thumbnail view in office 365 for business</h2>
                    
<p>My company is rather new to Office 365 for business (signed up a few months ago), and we are starting to add quite a few files and photos. &nbsp;Right now we can only see the list of files and really need to see thumbnails - especially with our photos. &nbsp;How do
 we do this? &nbsp;We are all used to the old "offline" way of accessing and seeing our files stored on our hard drives and just would like to know if one drive 365 for business can show us these files in the same manner.</p>

<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions.&nbsp;<span>:smileyhappy:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To verify, is this the first time you experience this issue? Note that, if you still haven't read the message, you will only see the first two lines, but once you tap it, that's the time you will view the whole message.</p>

<p>Hi, Heid1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We haven't heard anything like this before. Let's try to further isolate the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to do a hardware reset on the phone. To do that, p<span>ress and hold the power and volume down keys simultaneously for 10-15 seconds, release the keys if the phone vibrates, and then the phone will restart. It is best to monitor
 your phone's behavior after doing this.&nbsp;</span><span>No worries, this will not delete any of your personal data and&nbsp;<span>you just need to set the date and time on your phone after this operation.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>By the way, make sure that your phone has the latest software update available for it to get better functionalities and performance. To check, go to Settings&gt; Phone update&gt; Check for updates.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>We'd appreciate if you will also coordinate this with your service provider for us to know if there's any problem on their end. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Zek,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are facing issue while pasting pictures from Google Chrome to Word 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may face an issue while using Office 2003 on Windows 10 as it is not compatible with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I suggest you to check if you face similar issue while using Internet Explorer, instead of Google Chrome and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As support for Office 2003 is no longer available, I suggest you to upgrade to Office 2013 or Office 365 to get a better Office experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps, do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>So if it continues to ask for your password after you enter it then it is not seeing what you are entering as the correct password. Make sure you are NOT in caps lock and look carefully at each entry to make sure that if it is supposed to upper case (or
 lower case) that it is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, from a PC, see if you can login using that password just to make sure you are using the correct password.</p>

<h2>            How to KEEP Msft Word within the RAM.  I know it sounds crazy but I&#39;m of sound mind.</h2>
                    <p>Most of you guys are going to think I'm crazy for posting such a question. &nbsp;Who would want to keep the Microsoft Word program within the RAM after you save and close a document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I use Word documents extensively. &nbsp;I like Word better than OneNote and other programs. &nbsp;It's very resource heavy and ask so many useless features but I've formatted Word so that it opens really quickly. &nbsp;Basically, I don't alter the original template
 that much so new Word documents are created in a split second....</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, new Word docs are created only if the Word program is already open. &nbsp;For example, another Word document is already open. &nbsp;Or all Word document are saved and closed but I haven't exited the Word program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I can just keep a empty blue Word program open until the time comes when I have to open a new Word document or I can minimize the empty blue Word program and have it just sit there on the task bar....</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, is there a way to have the Word program at least minimized to the task tray or just started up during start up and the main program will always be open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way, I press Control + N and a new Word document pops up, I write up the note or whatever I have to do and then save it and then do something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
When using your computer and working on something like editing a Word file, you are using the RAM at the same time. RAM is a temporary storage used by your computer processing, managing and using apps. Regarding your concern, we cannot keep a Word file within
 the RAM because once you click on Save in a Word document, for example, the operating system takes the information that is in RAM and writes it to a file on the hard drive by default. If you're still working on the document file, it also means that you're
 working with RAM. If you didn't save changes made in the file, RAM will only read the file and show the last saved changes made on it. I hope this information gives you an idea about how RAM works on your computer and why it can't save Word files in RAM.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.
        </p>

<p>Once you have Word open, you can close the current document without exiting Word. (The default, using the close X, is to close
<em>and </em>exit if only one document is open.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Ctrl+W</strong> closes the current document without exiting Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Alt+F</strong>, followed by <strong>B</strong> closes the current document without exiting Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Close</strong> closes the current document without exiting Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a complete answer, but does keep Word loaded as a program for when you next open a document. You need the Word Window to have the
<em>focus </em>for <strong>Ctrl+N</strong> to create a new blank Word document.</p>

<p>Office preloads parts by default. I turn this off because I don't need it. If you check your task manager, you will likely find it running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep Word on my taskbar whether open or not, I've pinned it there. I keep my taskbar on the right side of my screen because there is more room there. You may want to try that.</p>

<p>Ariel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you understood my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you start Microsoft Word for the first time, it takes my computer about 10 seconds to open a new document as it loads my templates and styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario #1: Let's suppose I open a new document and it takes it's usual 10 seconds. &nbsp;Then I only
<em>close </em>the new document. &nbsp; The Microsoft Word program is still open unless you exit. &nbsp;If I open a new document when the Microsoft Word program is still open, a new document is opened almost immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario #2: Let's supppose I open a new document and it takes it's usual 10 seconds. &nbsp;Then I close the new document
<em>and</em> I exist out of the Microsoft Word Program. &nbsp;If I open a new document this time, it's going to take another 10 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is this. &nbsp;Is there a way to execute Scenario #1 but have the Microsoft Word program minimized to the task tray so I can't see it until I'm ready to open a new Word document. &nbsp;In one day alone, I'm writing 20 Word documents and exiting out
 of the Microsoft Word program like 20 times. &nbsp;Waiting those 10 seconds, 20 times a day is reallly annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could save and and just <em>close </em>documents without <em>exiting </em>the Word Program but I hate that the Word Program take a spot on my Task Bar when there is no Word document actually opened yet. &nbsp;Is there a way to have the Microsoft Word Program
 saved to the RAM even though a word document is not yet opened. &nbsp;So, when I do eventually open a Word Program, it will just open a new document instantaneously?</p>
<p>

<p>I certainly get what you are asking. On my computer, with Word 2010, starting Word requires about 7 seconds. Opening another document is virtually instant, once Word is open. Word 2013 takes a bit longer with the initial opening. If you try to open another
 document during that initial time, you get two instances of Word, each with the incumbent delays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way, from within in Word, to do what you want. It involves the functioning of Windows. Windows opens a taskbar icon for each program that is running and, frequently, for each document open. As I mentioned earlier, Office did have a preload function.
 I can't find it right now. I know that I have disabled it in every version I've had. I keep Word, Outlook, Chrome and Firefox all loaded 85% of the time or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone may be able to make a custom program, to run in Windows, to do what you want. You could ask for it in
<a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304924-word-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uservoice</a> as a future "feature" but if it is offered I sure hope it is optional, I have enough background processes running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, keeping Word running is not that big an imposition if that 7-20 seconds is crucial to you.</p>
<p>Also, for me, the opening time more than a split second is due entirely to the Add-Ins I have chosen to load when I start Word. If I did not have those Add-Ins loading automatically, Word would start in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. You answering is reassuring in a sense because I know there is at least one person who understands my situation 100%. &nbsp;I also agree with you that I thought earlier versions had something that would preload an Office startup program
 that would speed up the startup of Office programs. &nbsp;But I too would too try to get rid of it, instead of keep it because I didn't want it to take up valuable RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, I use this program Dexpot which gives me multiple virtual desktops and I use tons of Excel and Word files that I open and close constantly. &nbsp;I hate the fact that the Word program tab is on every single taskbar on every virtual desktop. &nbsp;I even upgraded
 to 32 gigs of RAM so that I could open and close tons of Word/Excel files very fast with Dexpot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Normal Template</strong></p>
<p>Btw, helpful information for you. &nbsp;If you want to open your Word programs instantaneously, I don't think it's the Add Ins. &nbsp;I think it's the Normal Template that slows the Word startup. &nbsp;If you just cut and copy the Normal Template to a save place, Word
 will create a clean Normal Template. &nbsp;And Word opens in a sec. &nbsp;Unfortunately, for me, I've amended my Normal Template with personal styles which slows startup considerably. &nbsp;I hate the templates provided by Microsoft. &nbsp;(Btw, if you have a site that sells
 or gives away good Word templates, please let me know. &nbsp;I'd love to get some beautiful headers, titles, subtitles, etc.) &nbsp;But if you don't need the customized templates and just use the Normal Template, startup opens instant for me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Nope. I have a large normal template (926K). Nevertheless, if I open without Add-Ins but with my normal template ( \a switch) Word loads very quickly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked and I currently load 21 Add-Ins (.dotm and .dotx) files automatically. I also load Adobe's COM Add-In). I would guess few people have that many. Generally when I want to add or change a feature, I create a new Add-In rather than adding it
 to another one.</p>

</p><p>Your response is really helpful but I want to rip out my hairs now. &nbsp;=)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I get rid of my old Normal template, Word opens instantaneously (under 1 sec). &nbsp;But once I start modifying the Normal template a lot, Word will take those 10 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, totally random question but it seems like you know your stuff. &nbsp;Which pdf program do you like best? &nbsp;Do you like Adobe Acrobat DC better than Nuanced PowerPDF? &nbsp;Just curious about your opinion. &nbsp;Was going to buy one of them.</p>

<p>I'm guessing this was probably a direct purchase so you have no store to take it to... I still think the drive may be defective and the one successful burn was a case of getting lucky. My 2015 Dell will burn first time every time with either P2G or iTunes
 so I'm not sure of what else to suggest except trying yet another brand of discs - it may be that the internal OD is particularly sensitive and just doesn't like the ones you have tried. The reliability of the usb drive suggests there's no software or systemic
 issue. Have you tried CD-RW? They can behave differently - and are useful for test burns so it's worth having a few... also when you insert a blank CD-R what is showing in
<strong>'This PC'</strong> in the DVD/CD drive? Is the usable (free) space showing?</p>
<p>At least with the plug and play drive you can prepare a batch of burns and just connect it when needed but it's a pain with an otherwise good quality new machine, I agree... Regards, R.
