<h2>            Be Sure to Keep the Current &#34;Control Panel&#34; and &#34;Devices and Printers&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Today at work, I needed to connect to a new printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began with the Metro "PC Settings".</p>
<p>From there, I chose "PC and devices".</p>
<p>I was given no specific option for printers, so I then selected "Devices".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there I was confronted with a list of 6 internal identical printers used at my workplace.&nbsp; On their in-house&nbsp;MAC network, they were identified by IP address, but I was a guest and only had the option of selecting a printer by its "external" identity
 -- that is, Printer and Model.&nbsp; Which is absolutely no use at all.&nbsp; Oh, that's right, there were additional labels such as "copy 1", "copy 2", "copy 3" and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried right-clicking.&nbsp; Nothing at all.&nbsp; Not surprising for a system that is supposed to integrate with a telephone, but come on now ....</p>
<p>I tried left-clicking.&nbsp; Then I got an option.&nbsp; "Remove device."&nbsp; Oh, of course, another phone-based choice, but on a computer!!&nbsp; Really, those are my options?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not one of those little info circles, which when I click on it tells me things like IP address and -- of much greater importance ! j-- allows me a labelling option.&nbsp; In this case, I would have been able to identify "Hall printer", Main Building Printer,
 "Library Printer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I still had access to the "Control Panel" and through that to "Printers and Devices" (although no direct access until I pinned it to the Start Menu).&nbsp; Once there, I printed a blank page on each printer until I identified the responding one and
 then used "properties" to label the ones I needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then it occurred to me:&nbsp; What if MS pulled another bonehead like they did with Windows 8?&nbsp; What if this round they toss out Control Panel?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think I'm kidding, then you've missed those surveys asking you what you think of the new metro "PC Settings" compared to the "Control Panel".&nbsp; This is a serious question they are asking us and it shows someone somewhat is saying "hey, team, let's
 slim things down and toss the code for Control Panel, you know, just like we did with the original Start Menu -- that was a real winner."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And all those Windows Phone Users who don't own a PC or else don't work on them will all say "great idea" and there it will go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love Control Panel.&nbsp; It is flexible, well-designed, almost fun to work with, and the new (now old) Printers and Devices an excellent desk toolkit for anyone even halfway knowledgeable about the devices we work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Metro Devices screen looks slick and is about a 0 on a 10-point usefulness scale.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had issues linking up to a network wirelessly because of the lack of info.&nbsp; Collecting my own device data is almost hopeless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea might have been to design software even an idiot can use.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if&nbsp;the metro links are all we end up with, it will turn out to be software only an idiot would want to.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they remove Control Panel I and many many others who actually use the PC for more than a glorified phone will stay with previous versions until we find an alternative among the competition. I hate Macs and their way of doing things, and always have, but
 I hate Win8 BlockWorld-aka-Metro style more.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, in my case it wasn't a matter of recognizing a printer -- it was a matter of knowing which of the 6 It identified on another network was the one I needed access to.&nbsp; And then having a way to rename the printers so that I would know them in
 the future.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 calendar overlay view not sticking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 calendar overlay view not sticking</h2>
                    <p><span>I support individuals who views multiple calendars in Outlook 2016. &nbsp;Their primary calendar is Exchange and is configured not to be overlaid with the rest of the calendars mostly
 "Other Calendars" using an web based ICS location. &nbsp;These other calendars are setup as overlaid. &nbsp;For the most part this view sticks and when closing Outlook or going to Mail and then back to the Calendar view the view is correct. &nbsp;The issue is that sometimes
 the view doesn't stick and when viewing the calendar ALL calendars end up being overlaid. &nbsp;I know it's simple to move that one calendar back out of the overlay, but it should work this way. &nbsp;We have been dealing with this issue since 2016. &nbsp;Has anyone else
 experienced this? &nbsp;Is there a workaround? &nbsp;Can a bug be entered if it's not a known problem?</span><br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This problem is apparent on all computers. &nbsp;New profile and installations of Office 2016 do not fix the issue. Additionally, Office 2016 is up-to-date with updates.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your earnest effort to reach out with Microsoft Community. We understand that you are experiencing issues with Outlook 2016 Calendar overlay discrepancies. For case isolation, since the view settings
<span>set up</span> for the Exchange for the primary calendar were mixed up with the overlaid Calendars, we recommend that you change the overlay settings for the Calendars set up as
<span>overlaid</span>. You may follow the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1</p>
<p>In the <strong>Name and Type</strong> section, type the <strong>Calendar Name</strong> and select
<strong>SharePoint. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63e9180c-796f-4598-bd28-3e88651fbab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63e9180c-796f-4598-bd28-3e88651fbab4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2</p>
<p>Uncheck the<strong> Always Show </strong>option. When <strong>Always Show</strong> is not checked, you will be able to turn overlays on and off from the page. If it is checked, the overlay calendar will always appear on the page's calendar.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you run the Online Repair to correct a misbehavior in the Outlook 2016. You may check the instructions on the article below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your response to the solution will be highly appreciated. </p>

<p>I'm confused by your reply as I'm having issues in Outlook 2016, not the OWA interface. &nbsp;I can't find how to start with your Step 1 within Outlook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Name and Type</strong>&nbsp;section, type the&nbsp;<strong>Calendar Name</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>SharePoint.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me identify what area within the local Outlook application you are referring too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Adobe Flash is not available in Manage Add-Ons</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 2012 server with IE 10.&nbsp; Flash is supposed to be bundled with IE 10.&nbsp; All sites that try to use Flash indicate it is not installed.&nbsp; I frequently get the message "An Add-On for this website failed to run."&nbsp; Flash is not listed in the "Manage
 Add-Ons" section of Tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using IE in desktop mode, not the Modern desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have disabled\re-enabled IE, looked for options to uninstall\re-install IE with no luck, verified no group policy is disabling it, tried downloading\install Flash from the Adobe site (of course it says it does not apply to this OS), etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I find\enable Flash if it is already there, or re-install IE without rebuilding the server?</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010, File Attachments, not being received by recipients, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ns_bob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010, File Attachments, not being received by recipients, replaced with &#34;winmail.dat&#34; attachment.</h2>
                    
<p>I have read all about this in other threads and I have everything set to HTML, not RTF. I cannot understand why Outlook 2010 cannot handle attachments properly.</p>
<p>To prove this point, I sent myself a message with an image attachment using Eudora in HTML format (yes, old but reliable and robust email client), and I received it in Outlook 2010&nbsp;with attachment, fine.</p>
<p>I then forward this same message back to myself (attachment included) and picked it up in Eudora again, but the attachment is missing replaced with this annoying winmail.dat file attachment.</p>
<p>After purchacing Office 2010 Home &amp; Business, I was going to give Outlook a really good try as my only email client but becuase of this apparent&nbsp;"flaw" in Outlook, I am going to stick with my tried and true Eudora Pro 7 unless someone can tell me how this
 annoying attachment problem in Outlook 2010 can be remedied.</p>
<p>This all came to light when I was forwarding a message I received in Outlook 2010 with a Word document attached and forwarded it&nbsp;onto 4 other friends and all they received was the winmail.dat file. Very annoying.</p>
<p>Thanks, Bob</p>

<p>SharePoint, Perhaps I misunderstood the references to TNEF coding re: www.slipstick.com/problems/alwaysrtf.asp</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought it referred to SharePoint.&nbsp; None the less I now know more about this than I ever wanted to know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is fixed and hopefully NS_BOB will be able to resolve his problem as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can now go back to being happily oblivious to what goes on in the registry.</p>

    <title>Upgrading Car Kit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrading Car Kit</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
just a quick question for those who have played around with this before or know an answer.<br />
<br />
I currently have in my car an original Nokia car kit with the pop-port all set up for a nokia 7250i (my old phone) I have finally upgraded to the N95 and I also wanted to upgrade my car kit.<br />
<br />
From what research I have done I can see that I may not need to purchase a new car kit. I believe that all I need to do is purchase the remote control from the ck-7w car kit package and plug that into the port where the pop-port cable is pluged into.<br />
<br />
Am I on the right track? I just wanted to find out if this could be done. I'm guessing that the bluetooth receiver is in the remote control.<br />
<br />
Can someone provide some input or perhaps direct me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
thanks

Do you currently have a ck-7w? if so you should already have bluetooth and the control button - it is a standard feature.

            It sound like you currently have a car-k126, you will need to buy a full new ck-7w car kit in order for this to work although the mic, speaker &amp; power will be the same but i would replace everything just to be on the safe side.<br />

            Sorry if my post was a little unclear let me start again.<br />
<br />
I bought my car second hand and it came with the standard carkit that the 7250i used. It came complete with the cradle for the 7250 (and similar phones).<br />
<br />
When I looked at the layout of the CK-W7, it seemed to be the same unit except that there was a bluetooth remote control plugged into the main box as opposed to the Data cable that currently plugs into the 7250 cradle.<br />
<br />
As I have a bluetooth phone, I was wondering if it was just a matter of unplugging the data cable and plugging in the remote control. I believe that if the bluetooth receiver for the carkit is in the remote control, then I see no problems?<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone has played around with this and know if it works. I rang Nokia care and a few big car kit shops in Melbourne and as all technology salesmen they are useless!!! They told me to 'have a go'!!!<br />
<br />
Anyway, as I know that the user ends up being the expert as opposed to the salesman I'm looking for input!<br />
<br />
Thanks for any comments!<br />
<br />
Lorenzo

            The button is not a bluetooth antenna, its just a control, the bluetooth is in the main brain box which you will have to change to CK-7W or similar bluetooth car kit to work.<br />

            Option-V will give you √, but not the line above the ensuing text. To obtain a proper representation, you'll need to use equations.

<p>Hi Tpeters8377,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>May I ask if you have created the shared mailbox in Exchange online? If so, please directly connect to Exchange online PowerShell to retrieve this mailbox rather than connect to
 Exchange on-prem PowerShell remotely. How to connect to Exchange online PowerShell:
</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Besides, usually we don't recommend customers to directly create shared mailbox in Exchange online in hybrid mode, please check this following KB for the detailed description:

Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur when you play any particular game or all the games?<br />
2. Did you upgrade the graphics card drivers after upgrading to Windows 10 Technical Preview?<br />
3. Did you check if the game is compatible with Windows 10 Technical Preview?<br />
<br />
This issue might occur if the game or the drivers for the graphics card is not compatible with Windows 10 Technical Preview. I would suggest you to try installing the game and the drivers for the graphics card in compatibility mode and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows<br />

            <p>I was playing a game on Pogo. &nbsp;A message was repeatedly displayed that if you were having difficulty playing, revert to Java 7.71 &nbsp;So what the heck, I would try that. &nbsp;Then I discovered that Java was not installed at all in Windows Technical Preview, Build
 9879. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded Java 8 thinking that would solve the problem. &nbsp;I didn't.</p>
<p>I uninstalled Java 8.25 and installed Java 7.71. &nbsp;Hey, now my cursor in any environment is running smoothly and fast. &nbsp;The game issue was really a cursor issue.</p>

<p>1) You may wish to consider using the form's timer functions. That way, if it fails once, it'll try again later. The TimerInterval form property uses milliseconds, so you could either set it manually to 1800000 (1000 * 60 * 30) or use your hidden form's
 on_load event to set it:<br />
<br />
Sub Form_Load()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.TimerInterval = 1000 * 60 * 30 ' 30 minutes<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Sub Form_Timer()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While Time() &gt; #2:30:00 AM# And Time() &lt; #5:00:00 AM#<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Application.Quit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wend<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
2) I have to ask. Why don't you want to use Windows Task Scheduler? There are so many things that can go wrong if you do it by code (as mentioned by Daniel and Tom).<br />
<br />
It's the one thing you can do to make sure to terminate MSACCESS.EXE totally and easily. Just have Windows take up the task:<br />
<br />
1) open up Notepad and put in the following code-<br />
taskkill /im MSACCESS.EXE /t /f<br />
(The /t /f will close any open processes that occur if a critical message box was being displayed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) save it as something like "CloseMSACCESS.bat"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) have your Windows Task Scheduler call up the CloseMSACCESS.bat daily, say at 2:30am and you can repeat this every half hour in case somebody decides to open up your program again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can opt for both routes too...</p>

<p>Don't know about Windows server, especially when you have to deal with administrative rights of the individual computers. The Windows Task Scheduler provides APIs for C++ (not VBA) development, so according the this
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/TaskSchd/using-the-task-scheduler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
URL</a> you can modify Task Scheduler activities on the local machine your C++ program is located on, but I wasn't able to find any particular method to do that with Access vba.<br />
<br />
If you try of close all open processes in a particular Windows folder using vba, s.a. with:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Kill "C:\MyFolder\*.mdb"</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get an error "Permission Denied." But that doesn't directly terminate MSACCESS.EXE either, which is what you need to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many computers are you have to reset the Task Scheduler?</p>

<h2>            Runner - Heart rate, GPS and Bluetooth wireless music</h2>
                    <p>I hope the future version of the Microsoft Band would allow me to run free of my phone, track my run with a GPS and play music stored on the band to a wireless Bluetooth headphones. It is 2016 and I have not been able to find a good device that can do this.
 I just purchased and returned a Moto 360 and Samsung G2. The G2 got close to what I need but lacks a GPS which forces me to carry my phone. With phones getting larger and larger by the minute, carrying them on the pocket makes it very difficult. The Moto 360
 was a complete fail as I was not able to sync music to it, but on paper it is supposed to do what I need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem that the requirements are not that complicated. </p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to music: mainly listen to music that I own which I burned from my CD's, so don't force my to use Google play or Groove or any service.
</li><li>Listen to podcasts: I have a podcasts when I run. Podcasts like Ted talks. Ideally I can sync the podcasts to the device and play them while running.</li><li>Play the above sources of music to a Bluetooth wireless headset. It is not&nbsp; convenient to run with cables that usually get on the way</li><li>Track my pulse while I run</li><li>Track my run via GPS</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope Microsoft in the next version of the Band can include the above features. The watches I purchased both were 250 and 299 each. I'll be willing to pay a similar amount for a good band.</p>

    <title>Word for Mac garbles my document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wendyjmmj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for Mac garbles my document</h2>
                    <p>I have Word for Mac--the kind that you pay by the month. Just switched from PC to Mac about 6 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last month or so I've noticed that my Word documents randomly get corrupted. All of a sudden something I've typed in one place randomly shows up inserted in the middle of sentences elsewhere resulting in nonsense. Sometimes I will have just
 edited and reviewed a document so I know it is fine; however, when I save it and open it later, it contains these weird errors. Yesterday I emailed myself a document I'd written at work (on a PC) and then downloaded it to my home computer where I have Word
 for Mac. When I opened the downloaded document, it had a few places where the random changes had occurred. However when I went back and opened the emailed attachment using an online version of Word, the document was fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: this is not the same as other postings where the text turns into symbols -- in my case Word is taking small chunks of text from one place and inserting it several other places in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather not have to replace my Mac but my main use for my computer is word processing and this has resulted in some significant errors and need to go back and redo work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain what is happening or how to fix it?</p>

            <p>Hi Wendy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description of the problem I think you have two separate things going on and they are not related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first is the random insertion of text in a different location then where you started typing. I am going to speculate and please tell me if this is correct... when this happens, the first few words or part of the sentence you were typing is in the correct
 location but somewhere in the middle of the text, the system decided to finish it someplace else. Usually this new location is earlier in the document but not too far from where it should be, Both locations, wrong and right, are visible on the screen, in other
 words, the screen didn't scroll. You are a quick typer and your keystrokes are forceful. This happens on your MacBook or MacBook Pro... you've never seen it happen on a desktop Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If most of the above is correct, the issue is the sensitivity of your MacBook's touchpad and either one of your thumbs has gotten a little too close to it while typing and when coupled with a forceful quick typist, it causes the cursor to move and register
 a new insertion point. The remedy is to turn down the sensitivity on your touchpad, slow your typing speed down a bit when using the MacBook, and/or don't "bang" those keys quite so hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue of typed text displaying on some systems but not others can sometimes be font related, particularly if non standard fonts are being used. All you said though was "random changes" and that is not clear enough in order to give a good recommendation,
 in other words, font weeding won't hurt but it might also not be the answer. What are the changes? Did valid text disappear or did invalid text mysteriously appear?</p>

</p><blockquote>with UUP now being used , is their any way to create an esd file ? </blockquote>
<p><strong>Steps to Disable UUP and create one large ESD to be made into an ISO</strong><br />
<br />
1. Enable Fast on Windows 10 (tested with 14971, might work for other windows builds)<br />
<br />
2. Press Windows + R (run)<br />
<br />
3. Type regedit and press enter or click [ok]<br />
<br />
4. Navigate to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate</strong><br />
change "<strong>SupportsUUP</strong>"= 1 to 0&nbsp; (zero)<br />
<br />
5. Navigate to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\Orchestrator</strong><br />
change "<strong>EnableUUPScan</strong>"= 1 to 0 (zero)<br />
<br />
6. Reboot for registry changes to take affect.<br />
<br />
7. Login and Click start, Settings, Update &amp; security, Windows Update, click [Check for updates]<br />
until you see Downloading Windows 10 Insider Preview 14986.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>8. Navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download\ <br />
&amp; search for *.ESD &amp; it should find a 3gb ESD file in the top yellow folder (edited to make it clearer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>14986.1000.161202-1928.rs_prerelease_CLIENTPRO_RET_x86fre_en-us.esd<br />
or<br />
14986.1000.161202-1928.rs_prerelease_CLIENTPRO_RET_x64fre_en-us.esd </p>
<p><br />
<br />
9. When the download is 100% complete (it will then start the process of installing then at 23%)</p>
<p>copy C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\install.esd <strong>before</strong> it asks to reboot. (edited to make it clearer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Follow the usual procedure to create the ISO from the ESD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(the servers are being changed to fix errors with UUP so this may not work soon)</p>

<em>**NOTE**&nbsp; In this thread and on a few websites, there have been recommendations
</em><br />

<em>While this may have helped for this particular build, it is important that you
</em><br />
<em>restore these regkeys back to their original value if you changed them. &nbsp;</em><br />
<em>This will impact your ability to receive future updates. &nbsp;</em><br />

<p>If you haven't restarted your PC lately, definitely do that. You probably should also check your disk for errors, since a disk error can sometimes result in corrupt .pst file symptoms. After checking the disk, run scanpst again, alternating until there are
 no errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new profile won't fix a problem with the existing .pst file, but you could move items from the old file to the new one that Outlook automatically creates when you build a new profile. You would lose custom views and rules (but rules can be exported first
 to a .rwz file), but could recover the address nickname cache by renaming the .nk2 file to match the name of the new profile. That's a lot of work, though, to solve an annoyance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't use Exchange, you have no .ost file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't think that there is anything off the shelf at the moment but for consideration:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;First method - you must have a working internet connection through your phone, a Gmail account &amp; web browsing application (opera mini or bolt browser)&nbsp;email your (<em>named</em>).pdf file to your email address (as a attachment). Then sign in to your gmail
 account through a web browser. Then read your new email. At the end of the page there is View : basic HTML &gt; Select it. &gt; Open attached pdf file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Secondly there was an application Zesium Mobile .pdf suitable for S40, but think developer has moved on and no longer sells activation licenses.</p>

<p>What has changed on your computer since the last time you were able to click the link without the warning?</p>
<p>Has the <span>

<p>It could be your Internet Explorer security settings as well.&nbsp; Please see below:</p>

<p>Hi TLS81,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Outlook for Mac (Here yours are Outlook 2016 for Mac) runs slowly, there are some general factors causing this.&nbsp;<br />
1. Many emails/messages in the Inbox can slow the the sycnchronization with the mail server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The solution can be moving the messages to your Mac machine.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>2. Outlook for Mac logging is turned on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution can be turning off the log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Outlook for Mac can take longer to sort items in less-common fields.</p>
<p>The solution can be sorting contacts and messages by a different fields.</p>
<p>For more information, you can refer to&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outlook-is-running-slowly-115e5ce0-5823-4df8-b129-33513963e611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outlook-is-running-slowly-115e5ce0-5823-4df8-b129-33513963e611</a></p>
<p><br />
If there is no method (above mentioned) works for you, I suggest you contact the "In-App support" for further help. The engineers there are dedicated in handling the Outlook 2016 for Mac related issues. To contact the support: You can click "Help" mennue of

    <title>Disable Scoop &#40;Skype&#41; messages in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable Scoop &#40;Skype&#41; messages in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So, now Skype wants to be my news source?<br />
<br />
Why am I suddenly getting "Scoop" (the Skype mascot, apparently) appearing in bottom, right to tell me about Donald Trump? I don't trust him. Why should I trust another dog?<br />
<br />
I tried going into Skype Settings to turn this off, but there are WAY too many settings in there that could relate to this, as well as other mysterious settings (e.g., "Show out of app ongoing call indicator," which could be Show Out-of-App Ongoing-Call indicator
 -- and I still don't know what that means -- or "Show-out of App-Ongoing Call-Indicator" or you name it).<br />
<br />
Some other possibilities:<br />
* Instant messages<br />
* Automatically preview incoming videos</p>
<p>* Play streamed media from 3rd party providers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or whichever one it is. Or maybe you don't allow us to turn off Scoop?</p>

<h2>            Copied Hyperlink won&#39;t paste correctly - the worksheet reference changes</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with an excel file that contains internal hyperlinks between worksheets, but I am having a problem copying an internal hyperlink from one page to another.
</p>
<p>FYI, an internal hyperlinks are created when you "Insert Hyprelink -&gt; Place in Document".</p>
<p>In my file, the internal hyperlinks are listed on one sheet (the contents page), which copy and paste into other worksheets to create cross references between worksheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A segment of my contents page is shown below with an internal hyperlink:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca010eaa-8e3c-4e41-8004-9e87b78e886a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I copy a hyperlink from the contents worksheet to another worksheet, the hyperlink reference changes to a different worksheet from the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see how the worksheet reference changes when I have copied cell C16 in the contents worksheet to cell B19 in the destination worksheet:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58c41ecc-0d3e-4ebc-8deb-7ac2baf6d05d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is causing the worksheet reference to change when I copy a hyperlink from one page to another?</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Excel for Mac - PIVOT Tables</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Microsoft Office for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to ask question regarding the pivot function for Microsoft Excel for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an option dialogue box missing from the existing interface he missing option is 'Add this data to the Data Model'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to add my existing worksheet with another worksheet under the same exel document. I read manuals and check the web and this suggest that I need to select/click on the option 'Add this data to the Data Model' in order to add multiple tables
 to create a pivot table report. I checked Mac version online manual for excel and it stated that the tab should exist in the Mac interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something on the Mac version of Excel? My existing Mac excel is currently updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My excel is running at Version 16.6.6 - 190114</p>
<p>My notebook is running MacOS Mojave (10.14.2)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advice. Thank you.</p>

<p>I agree that they could have done better. However, I want to give credit where I think credit is due.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Office 2016 first came out the code base was the same as Office 2011 for Mac. It was a distinctly different code set from Office for Windows. I hated it. I think the first general release build was simply the worst commercial software I had ever used.
 It crashed. It had bugs. It barely worked at all. I was telling users here in the forum to complain directly to Microsoft's Satya Nadella about how neglected the product was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, all our complaints resulted in sweeping changes. During the 2016 product cycle Office, and Excel in particular, underwent a complete remake. They went from 32-bit to 64-bit. The entire code base was abandoned and replaced with the same code base
 as Office for Windows Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The Visual Basic Editor was rebuilt from scratch (and is still not quite done in 2019). On the Mac side, support for automation via JavaScript and Objective-C was added to AppleScript support. Crashes are practically
 non-existent. I have used Microsoft Office since 1985 and it has never been as stable as it is today,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find the number of previously unsupported features that are now supported astonishing considering the short time span since the code base was switched over. The very latest formulas are now supported in Excel - the latest ones being the stock formulas.
 In Excel 2019 for Mac we now have flash fill, pivotcharts, slicers for tables &amp; PivotTables and PivotCharts, built-in SQL Server ODBC driver, and many many more features.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Excel for Mac has undergone the most dramatic positive change of any software I have ever used, and it is evident that Microsoft is continuing to bring it up to par with Excel for Windows. The last remaining frontier is the power tools and accompanying
<p>
</p><p>While I lament that Office for Mac got way behind development of Office for Windows, I am delighted to see the amount of progress that has been made in a very short period of time. Hence, my advice to nudge the developers to keep at it by giving the feature
 a vote of support in the UserVoice forum.</p>

    <title>Multiple If and Vlookup statements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terriat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple If and Vlookup statements</h2>
                    I need to combine the following three criteria for the [value_if_true] <br />
<br />
If I25 equals NONLABOR, return&nbsp; 0<br />
<br />
If I25 equals LABOR then, if VLOOKUP(K25,'OH_GA'!PG:AS32,7,FALSE) equals 0 or #N/A, return the value in cell R24
<br />
<br />
Else return value of&nbsp; VLOOKUP(K25,'OH_GA'!PG:AS32,7,FALSE)+Q25<br />
<br />
This is what I tried =IF(AND(I25="NONLABOR",IF(VLOOKUP(K25,'OH_GA SOURCE DATA'!$P$6:$AK$32,7,FALSE))=0,IF(ISNA(VLOOKUP(K25,'OH_GA SOURCE DATA'!$P$6:$AK$32,7,FALSE))),R24,VLOOKUP(K25,'OH_GA SOURCE DATA'!$P$6:$AK$32,7,FALSE)))+Q25<br />
<br />
I have tried IF(AND, IF(OR but can't get it to work<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Dear Kazi,
<br />
<br />I am glad to hear that you were able to retrieve your inbox emails.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately if you were unable to retrieve sent items, it is high possibility that they are no longer on the server. The situation with files and data on servers changes frequently and when new data is saved it takes the free space in priority, so the deleted data still stays. However, when this free space is taken, new data is being saved and overwrites the ghost data.
<br />
<br />On my memory only once I was able to retrieve emails from Microsoft Account using Email Recovery app twice on different devices, but there are low chances for that. You can try to run it again on another device in Microsoft browser.
<br />
<br />I wish I could advise more, but this is the only working way that I am aware of.
<br />
<br />Additionally I would advise requesting Export of inbox. At least you will have a backup copy of your emails <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/export" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/e...</a> .
<br />
<br />Good luck.

            Hello KaziMofiz, 
<br />
<br />I understand that your emails have been magically disappeared from your mailbox. This is very frustrating and it can be a big impact to your personal or work life if emails are important to you. 
<br />
<br />Fred not, we will try to troubleshoot this together. It would be great if you can provide additional information about the issue. 
<br />
<br />1. Can I confirm, do you use Outlook.com or Microsoft Outlook email software? 
<br />2. Are only emails in inbox&amp;sent disappeared or in all other mailboxes affected too? 
<br />3. Can they be located in the trash bin ("Deleted Items"), Junk Email and Archive? 
<br />4. Have you ever setup POP3 for that email account?
<br />
<br />Like @LordAlukard suggested above, it is possible to recover deleted items within 30 days. If it is older than 30 days, it is permanently gone.
<br />
<br />Hope to hear from you soon! 
<br />
<br />Regards, 
<br />Sutharsan
