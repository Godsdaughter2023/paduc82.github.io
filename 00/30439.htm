<h2>            BSOD on Surface Book 2 when using the Surface Arc Mouse</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Hi everyone,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I recently picked up the Surface Arc mouse to use with my Surface Book 2 (13.5", i7), and it connects/works as expected. However, since beginning to use the mouse in my day to day work, I've noticed a significant increase in the number of BSODs I experience
 (I actually cannot recall the last time I didn't get at least one during a work session). I am on the active development track of the Insiders program but on the slow stream (so version 1709, build 17074.1002).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I was quick today and took a screenshot of the BSOD stop code: <strong>KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE
</strong>via <strong>bthport.sys</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Looking through the Bluetooth services in the Device Manager has led me to find that it is the "Marvell
 AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter" that uses the bthport.sys driver</span>&nbsp;but my Googling hasn't led me to anywhere productive.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Anyone experienced this issue before? Any ideas on how to fix it (without throwing the mouse in the trash)? I've searched for updated drivers for the mouse and for the radio adapter but device manager just reports that I already have the latest version installed.
 Any help would be extremely appreciated!</p>

            You also need to set the screensaver up - yes, I know this seems illogical.
<p>1 Set the screensaver - Control panel, Personalise, Screensaver [in the bottom right-hand corner of the window]. You can alter the timing and also whether or not you need to sign on again after it activates -
<em>this is the screen you keep seeing</em>.</p>
<p>You should then check the logon part of this setting in both</p>
<p>2 Power options, [on the left-hand side of the window] Require a password on wakeup</p>
<p>3 Power options, {active power plan} Change plan settings, Change advanced plan settings, [you might need to click on "Show settings currently hidden] {active power plan}, Require a password on wakeup</p>
<p><em>Steps 2 &amp; 3 are just checking that the alteration has been set &amp; saved - there should be no problem under normal circumstances.</em></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Lock Screen Bug with Video</h2>
                    
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp; This issue is very important because not even Microsoft Technical Support could do anything about it, after speaking to two different Technical support agents and them running an entire&nbsp;diagnostic and error repair (which my computer was 100% fine)
 ok so here we go..&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that when I lock my computer screen and I don't touch it it will go to the sign in screen and back to the lock screen. When I first contacted Microsoft's Technical Support he ran every test and ran a scanner that would fix any potential issues
 if there was any. So he told me to lock my screen and I did so, .......... waited and nothing happened. He had no idea what I was talking about let me not forget to add that he had remote access of my computer so he can see everything that I can see. So it's
 not doing nothing. So THANK GOD I MADE A YOUTUBE VIDEO NOTE: (<strong>IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY WINDOWS 10 ISSUES OF ANY KIND DOCUMENT IT AND UPLOAD IT TO YOUTUBE THAT WILL SAVE YOU.</strong>) He seen the video and showed his co-workers they have never seen this
 issue before no one has called in about it. I noticed that 1 person left a comment saying they are having the same issue so I mentioned that to him and he seen the comment. For some reason it was not doing it (And I believe it was cause he had remote control
 of my computer and that somehow interfered with the Lock Screen Bug.) So he was saying "Well I see here the issue isn't happening so the scan must of resolved it." I was so thrilled and surprised because the Lock screen was not going to the sign in screen
 so although I was thinking about him having remote access I dismissed it as maybe the scan fixed it. So he says looks like the problem is fixed Im happy and thank him for his great work he gave me a case number and I ended the call. So I call my friend who
 knew about my issue he had recently upgraded himself and had no issues and I call him so happy and I lock my computer and I set a timer on my phone for 5 minutes and I tell my friend, if these 5 minutes pass that means the issue is resolved. So I am looking
 at the timer go down and it's down to 2:24 I am about to jump up in the air excited and I tell my friend I think this is it! BAM!! There is goes! It shows the password screen and the lock screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I literally felt as if my computer was laughing at me like hahaha! I told my friend listen I will call you back I am going to call them back and give them my case number and tell them the issue had not been resolved. Mind you I just wrote a long paragraph
 to the person who commented on my YouTube page how the issue was fixed and left him the Microsoft Support number and gave him instructions on what to do. I changed the Title of the YouTube Video and put (Resolved) at the end so I had to delete the YouTube
 comment and I had to change the title screen again. ugh I know guys this is long. I decided to call the next day give my case number this Technical Support guy had no idea what I was talking about and thought I wanted to get rid of the password prompt and
 he says I kid you not "The reason why it ask you for the password is because it's a feature of windows 10" I grabbed my hair and pulled it out (not really) but I wanted to and I tell him no and explain the situation above so guess what? I had to show him the&nbsp;<strong><em>YouTube
 Video!</em></strong> Had it not been for that he would of been so lost. He says I see your problem and he ask me to lock my computer screen, I do so and set my timer and I am hoping it doesn't do the same thing that it did before like with the other representative!
 That would suck! So he puts me on hold to wait for it.. I am telling my computer do it... waiting.. and IT DOES!!! He says I see what you are talking about.. The lock Screen went to the password screen and back to the lock screen. Who wants to see that every
 2 minutes? Not me.. I know it's a minor issue but it "bugs" me (no pun intended)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>He goes over a few things.. and says he can't do anything about it and has to send it off to "Software Developers" because they haven't &nbsp;had a large volume of calls and I am like the only one. I had to point out the YouTube comment to him. I am not the
<strong>ONLY ONE&nbsp;</strong>I tell him. If you are having these issues please comment on my video and let me know so I can show that I am not the only one who is going through this. So right now I still have the issue any feedback is greatly appreciated either
 through here or the YouTube page. I know guys I wrote a long story book I am sorry I type fast so this was really nothing but I wanted to get this out in as much detail as I can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update September 15, 2015:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still experiencing the issue with the lock screen, and the friend I mentioned above who wasn't having the issue is now having the issue too. On the video I pasted below it has about 68 views and a few people commented on how they're having this issue
 with their lock screen. So it seems like this windows lock screen bug is more wide spread then I thought and perhaps many people have the issue and choose to ignore it or don't notice it since it's such a inconsequent issue. Windows has not got back to me
 on it even with me tweeting them for the second time about it so it seems unimportant to them as well. Some people don't care but with me I do. My lock screen didn't do that with Windows 8.1 and yes, while it's true nothing is perfect something as petty as
 a lock screen shouldn't be hard to fix for developers. I know they can fix this easily and that's why Im on them about it. Just send out a patch... they do have very very very nice lock screen photos that I enjoy looking at but when my sign in screen comes
 up and the little dots show up as if it's trying to sign me in and then goes back to the lock screen every 2 minutes can get annoying but without&nbsp;<strong>YOU</strong> the reader, contacting windows about this they are going to push it under the rug. I guess
 we will have to wait. If this issue gets resolved I will post an update on here and on YouTube you can check out the video above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update October 16, 2015:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So after tweeting Windows Technical Support on Twitter and them telling me to Reboot my computer (which I refused to do) contact the tech support people was what they told me two days ago from this review. Given the previous experience with WTS I was reluctant
 to do so. So I said ok, I'll follow the instructions from the Windows people on Twitter and I got in touch with a representative and I give him a old case number I had from August and he read over it. So I share the screen with him and show him a video I actually
 made this morning<strong> (I'll link it below)</strong> showing that I'm still having the problem and I figured it would be wise to make another video to show that as of this date 10/16/15 it's still doing the lock screen issue. So I show him and he says let's
 make an entirely new account and see if it happens on the new account and if it does then it's the system. So we do that, he makes a new user account and transfers my files onto it. So I told him I'm going to discontinue the remote access because the last
 guy who tried it had remote access and it wasn't doing it and it wasn't until he exited (after we both thought it was resolved that it started doing it again. So he exited it. And I set the timer 2 minutes went by and it was successful! I told him I wanted
 to set another 5 minutes just to be sure and if 5 minutes went by then it was resolved. So I lock the screen again and set the timer for 5 minutes.... I crossed my fingers and.... Beeeeeep the timer finished and the lock screen stayed and didn't try to sign
 in showing the dots going in a circle and back to the lock screen! I was like YESSSSSS! I thanked him and this was the problem....<br />
<br />
<strong>&lt;&lt;It's a corrupted system file&gt;&gt;</strong><br />
<br />
*This is not something that's going to be fixed in an upcoming update so don't do what I did and keep waiting and looking for updates.<br />
<br />
I'm going to tell you what to do but before you do I (highly recommend) you have a Windows Technical Support Representative walk you through this to ensure you don't make any mistakes.<br />
<br />
When they pick up explain the situation to them you may use either one of my videos although I recommend you use the one from August because it's about a minute vs like 4 minutes. Or you can fast forward it and get to the part where it starts acting up. Tell
 them when they take remote access that you wanna show them the video so they can better understand what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
Tell them that you found out what it is because someone had the same issue and did this with an agent and it worked.<br />
<br />
Tell them you want to create a new user account and transfer your files to it. You have the option to delete your old account and keep the files or delete the files and the account all together. I deleted everything all together because it was pointless to
 keep the files. But MAKE SURE when all the files transfer to the new user account that you have everything on there so check your music and picture folders and important stuff to make sure.<br />
<br />
Once that's done and you choose which option (Keep old files delete account) or (Delete everything) sign into the new account with your Microsoft account. And you should be all set.<br />
<br />
But before you delete your old account I recommend<strong> you do the test I did with the lock screen to make sure it's not looping.</strong> So set a timer on your phone or in your head for 5 minutes with the new user account.<br />
<br />
The Windows Rep will guide you but<strong> don't do it by yourself unless you know what you're doing</strong>. I'm glad it's finally fixed. Thank you everyone for your support and feedback and let me know if that works for you. I will keep both YouTube videos
 up for future reference and for you guys to use when you speak to the rep.<br />
<br />
<strong>Don't just sit there waiting for a update to come because it's not gonna happen</strong>. This is something that won't fix itself or in an future update it's a corrupted file not a bug. Good luck! Post in here if this ended up fixing your issue like
 it did mine.</p>

            <p>I am having that issue too. It happens about one minute after having locked the screen.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that the "bug" behaves differently depending on your power plan settings.</p>
<p>If you set the screen to power off after #minutes you experience a loop between lock screen and login screen.</p>
<p>If you set the screen to "Never" power off your screen dims about ten seconds before going to black. Then, if you move the cursor it goes back to the lock screen but after another minute dim/black again.</p>
<p>I'd call it "The Dim Black bug". Nice title for a song.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Miguel</p>

            i am having a similar problem. My lock screen will not unlock until after several tries. If there is a fix suggested here, I do not see it.

    <title>Admin override - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robbed_muffin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Admin override</h2>
                    <p>I bought a second hand <span>
laptop from a small business, they said they were upgrading their system.&nbsp;I went in and used it and it was working fine with seemingly a clean install of windows 10 the guy packed it up then when&nbsp;I got it home and tried to switch it on it’s asked for a username
 and password which obviously&nbsp;I didn’t have so I went back in and saw the same guy who said they had set it up with ‘username’ and ‘password’ so&nbsp;I went back home and logged in and only used it for browsing the internet&nbsp;but then the next day I tried to install
 a couple of things and was told to log in as an admin user and have had the same problem with everything I&nbsp;try to install so&nbsp;I went back to see the guy and the business is all closed up with bankruptcy notices on it so obviously they were just trying to make
 some quick cash before they shut. Is there a way to get past this, I tried to download windows to wipe everything and even that said I needed an admin username and password.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I don't mind going out and buying a new physical&nbsp;copy of windows but only if this will actually work. I don't want to spend another £120 just to be in the same situation with a computer that does
 less than my phone! </span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change security settings, install software and hardware, access all files on the computer and make changes to other user accounts, you'll need to have administrator rights on your account. You can check on the accounts listed on your laptop and see which
 one has the administrator rights. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <em>Control Panel</em> in the Search bar at the taskbar. Click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the list.</li><li>Select <strong>User Accounts&nbsp;</strong>then click on <strong>User Accounts</strong> again.
</li><li>Check which account is listed as Administrator and how many accounts are there.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we would like to ask if you have tried using the username and password provided to you initially? If so, is there any error messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there are any updates. We'll be glad to help further.</p>

<p>There is only one account and it doesn't have admin rights, it's&nbsp;seems like it's&nbsp;still networked to their business server and they presumably still have the admin account details but I now can't get hold of them.</p>

<p>The very first thing to do when you buy a pre-owned computer is a clean install of the operating system and all application software. That's the only way to be sure that your computer is setup correctly and is free from malware, misconfiguration and configuration

<h2>            How to check Auto renewal&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How exactly does one check if their Xbox Live GOLD Auto-Renewal is off or on?</p>

<p>I can't for the life of me find it now.</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/12/t/130588.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
other thread</a> about turning off renewal, and that seems to work, but I can't find any page that can simply tell me (verify) if it is actually set to on or off. Any help?</p>

<p>Also on a side note, is it possible to remove the only credit card I have listed from my payment options?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If you followed the steps to turn off auto renewal then you should be good. &nbsp;However, if you want to be sure the best bet is to call phone support. &nbsp;That way you'll be given a reference number in case there is an issue in the future.</p>
<p>As for the credit card, it cannot be removed until you revert back to Silver.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Okay (about renewal). I'm assuming I should be fine then.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>(About the credit card)</p>
<p>If I let it revert back to Silver, and remove my credit card, I should still be able to become Gold again (via redeem code) no problem?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And the credit card should still be gone?</p>
<p>And my Gold Tenure should also be unaffected one back to Gold, yes?</p>

<p>To check your renewal status from the console, go to Settings --&gt; Account --&gt; Xbox LIVE Gold</p>
<p>To check your renewal status from the website, go to www.xbox.com/account, and look under Subscriptions. &nbsp;If your renewal is off, it will say "Expires on DD/MM/YYYY", otherwise it will display the date it "Renews" on instead.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you let the account revert to Free (Silver), you should still be able to go back to Gold any time you choose to, via redeem code or credit card, no problem.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You'll need to wait for your Gold to expire before you can remove the credit card, but once it's removed, it will stay off the account until you add it back in all over again. &nbsp;There is no way to simply restore the credit card from the previous records once
 you opt to remove it, so it will be like you're adding a new credit card to the account for the first time again.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Your Gold tenure is based on how much time your account has ever been on Gold, so you can take breaks in between without resetting your Gold tenure. &nbsp;The number it shows for tenure is based on how many complete years you've been on Gold.</p>

<h2>            USB hard drive is write-protected</h2>
                    I am an amateur photographer and have been using an external USB drive to store numerous images as well as back up other documents.&nbsp; I was doing this with Windows XP Pro, but I recently upgraded to Windows 7, Home Premium.&nbsp; I can view the documents and
 images I have stored on the USB drive, but whenever I try to save anything to the external drive I get the error message:<br />
<br />
"The disk is write-protected.&nbsp; Remove the write-protection or use another disk"<br />
<br />
I queried the user manuel and various help sites but cannot find out how to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are welcome.

<p>Hi Wjay,</p>
<p>Step1:-:-<br />
You can remove write protection from your usb flash drive using the below method:<br />
1. Open start menu, in the search bar type regedit and press enter. This will open the registry editor.<br />
2. Navigate to the following path:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies<br />
Note: <br />
If the registry key StorageDevicePolicies does not exist, you will need to create it manually.<br />
3. Highlight StorageDevicePolicies, and then create a New DWORD (32-bit) Value named as WriteProtect.<br />
4. Double click the key WriteProtect in the right window and set the value to 0 in the Value<br />
Data Box and press OK button<br />
5. Restart your computer and try copying files into your USB drives.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Registry Disclaimer:-</span><br />
Sometimes this problem is caused by two Windows registry entries that have become corrupted. To fix the problem, you have to use Registry Editor to delete the corrupted registry entries.
<br />
However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.<br />
For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, follow the steps as in the KB Article:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</a><br />
<br />
Step2:-<br />
If the issue persists, check what happens in safe mode.<br />
Here are the steps to boot the computer into safe mode:-<br />
1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
<br />
Click the Start button; click the arrow next to the Shut Down button, and then click Restart.<br />
2. Do one of the following: <br />
•If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you'll need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt
 appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
•If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press Enter. For more information about options, see advanced startup options (including safe mode).<br />
4. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of your monitor.<br />
Refer this link for more information.<br />
“Start your computer in safe mode”<br />

            <p>Not sure which folder you mean, but you can shrink the component store size with a dism command:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">/Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup [/ResetBase]<br />
&nbsp; Use /StartComponentCleanup to clean up the superseded components and reduce<br />
&nbsp; the size of the component store. Use /ResetBase to reset the base of<br />
&nbsp; superseded components, which can further reduce the component store size.</p>
&nbsp; /StartComponentCleanup with /ResetBase operation is completed.</p>
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<p>Another way is with disk cleanup:</p>
<p>Running cleanmgr /sageset lets you choose what you want to remove when you run cleanmgr /sagerun.</p>

<h2>            Problem with custom domain and account that no longer exists</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a big problem with a domain I have added to be a custom domain using domains.live.com. The domain is over fine, email working etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But one account (my Mums) - when I add it it says do I wish to import it. But, this account has never signed up for a Microsoft account before. If I don't import it and try to sign in to hotmail or something, it says that the account doesn't exist. So why
 does the domains.live.com say that it does? If I do import it, I can't set the password and it isn't anything me or my Mum ever users, and there are no reset options at all. The email address in question is
<i>(removed email address for security reasons)</i><br />
However, my Mum did have a Live ID of </p>
<p>(removed email address for security reasons)</p>, which has&nbsp;
<p>(removed email address for security reasons)</p>added as an external account to pick up email from. So I thought I would just login to that (I have the password recorded) but now it says: The Microsoft account doesn't exist! So that account seems to have
 been removed 
<p>(removed email address for security reasons)</p>Can someone please help me sort this mess out? Otherwise I will have to back it out and route the email somewhere else.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<b>Reset your Password </b>option.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>- For questions with multiple answers, such as email subjects and contacts, provide as many answers as you can.</span></p>
<p><span>- If you have difficulty remembering email subjects or contacts, try reaching out to family, friends, or business contacts to verify.</span></p>

    <title>Bonus Points for Tom Clancys Wildlands not deposited. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vertigo860  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bonus Points for Tom Clancys Wildlands not deposited.</h2>
                    <p>I wrote to you a few days with this problem:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I purchased Wildlands through the Microsoft store to earn the bonus credits, but never received them.&nbsp; It was one of the My missions to get bonus points for the month of March. Can you help out with this?

  </p>

<p>Your Response was this:

  </p>

<p>Hello vertigo860,

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>The Ghost Recon offer was only for physical purchases from MicrosoftStore.com, as stated in&nbsp;the FAQ&nbsp;for that offer:

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>Which items are eligible for this offer?

  </p>

<p>To qualify for this offer, you must order a hard-copy disc of&nbsp;<i>Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands</i>&nbsp;for Xbox One from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Tom-Clancy39s-Ghost-Recon-Wildlands-for-Xbox-One/productID.5060903800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MicrosoftStore.com</a>&nbsp;during the offer period. This offer is good for one purchase only. You can earn up to 15,000 Rewards Credits, depending on which version of the game you purchase: &nbsp;&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands Standard Edition</i>: 10,000 Rewards Credits &nbsp;&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands Deluxe Edition</i>: 12,000 Rewards Credits &nbsp;&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands Gold Edition</i>: 15,000 Rewards Credits

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>Since your purchase was made digitally, it was not eligible for that offer.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>So my response to this message since I can not reply is that I purchased it through the microsoft.com store to ensure I received these points, since I did read the FAQ before purchasing, as well as writing a post to you.&nbsp; This is the email I received from the store, without my personal information and product key as well as order number.&nbsp; I think it is disheartening to have to jump through hoops to be able to receive the points I have earned.&nbsp; I write to support and the only response is that I didn't purchase it properly, when I clearly did.</p><p><br /></p><table>  <tbody><tr>   <td>   <table>    <tbody><tr>     <td>     <p>Thanks     for shopping with us!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Deleting only personal files is not the way to do this</p>
<p>Anybody can retrieve them with Data Recovery&nbsp;software and your&nbsp;User Account name, settings&nbsp;etc remains..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if anyone recommends "Dban"; that will even delete any Recovery partition (which you may need for reinstallation purposes), as it deletes (as its default action)&nbsp;information on any Hard Drive it finds in your Computer and you still have to reinstall
 the Operating System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way to do what you want to do&nbsp;is to reinstall the Operating System as your Header originally&nbsp;asks&nbsp;(but remember the only way to know your Data is never recoverable is to physically destroy the Hard Drive!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>These are the different ways to reinstall the Operating System:</strong></p>
<p>Contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks to reinstall from.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How to replace Microsoft software or hardware, order service packs, and replace product manuals"</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall Vista back to how you bought your Computer (that is why I did not recommend using Dban).</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot.</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cheers.</span></p>

            <p>I had to change my server&nbsp;FROM col126.mail.live.com&nbsp;TO blu404-m.hotmail.com. Then it synced immediately, no more 0x8501001d error.&nbsp;I just happened to see a screen shot of someone using the "blu" setting. I don't see this properly documented anywhere. Very
 disappointed that the sync didn't work correctly when I upgraded from Windows 7 (Hotmail, now Outlook) to Windows 10. You still need to do all the maintenance like Contacts from Outlook on-line as Windows 10 Mail looks like just a link and not a full mail
 program like Windows Live Mail 2012. With all the hype about Windows 10, I have been disappointed with it out of the box since some software and hardware needs to be replaced and not sure what I really&nbsp;gained in the process except longer life of the OS.</p>
<p>Update: I see that the settings automatically changed the server&nbsp;TO col401-m.hotmail.com now, so guess a number of them work, just not the original setting when I did the Win 10 upgrade. FYI: I am going back to Windows Live Mail 2012. I don't like limited
 functionality and fixed screen layout of Windows 10 Mail.</p>

            By some miracle I fixed my sync problem by following the steps below in the next post ( Sept 12 ) - but be aware of the following : it's very important to choose and save the settings on EVERY FOLDER - not only the INBOX. Also go to the MAIN SETTINGS PAGE
 on Windows 10 where you find the PRIVACY SETTINGS - and ensure you have agreed to let APPS ACCESS YOUR CALENDAR AND MAIL. Yes dear friends, if you have been freaking out at Microsoft snooping on your life you'll have to get over it if you want to read your
 email !&nbsp; Hopefully, this last comment will not get me admitted to Alcatraz - but it seems like if these apps are not linking and working together, nothing will happen. Alternatively, you can sign into your Outlook account to see your emails in your browser
 ( assuming you have an Microsoft Outlook email account. ) It's obviously more convenient to get the emails on the computer itself. Hope this helps !<br />

<p>Sorry for the confusion. The replies were juggled around - I was referring to the First reply from Microsoft Support Engineer, Akheel Ahmed in his message to Andrew on 12th September. Those are the instructions I followed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I realize the mail is on the server - not on the computer - but what I meant is - if you sync the email you can just click on the Mail App on the computer and see everything - rather than have the hassle of opening the browser and actually going online
 and signing in to whatever account to get your mail - a lot of extra steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I discovered : there seem to be TWO SERVERS involved.&nbsp; One got my mail into Outlook dot com website in the browser - (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> a bay number and&nbsp; - mail dot live dot com</span> ) BUT it then used a different one&nbsp;
 - a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">different bay number and - m dot hotmail dot com</span> - to get the same mail into the Mail app on the computer, windows 10. When I typed in
</p>
<p>( Remember I am using Outlook com on a Microsoft account. )</p>

            <p>I too have noticed that for the same mail account Microsoft is using different servers depending on what email client you are using. I take it that they just use one dedicated&nbsp;server per Mail protocol, so if you use a particular protocol you need to set
 the correct server for it that speaks that particular protocol and if you change the protocol you also need to change the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you have a problem with one mail client you can't just go to&nbsp;the online variant&nbsp;and copy the Server name to your non working mail client. It just won't work. What you can do (apparently) is generalize the server name and let the Mail client pick a
 new server from the available servers pool (or something to the same effect).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 App Store &#34;Updates to Download&#34; Count Shows More Updates than are Listed</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>... as the subject states, in the App Store in Win10, the&nbsp;"updates to download" counter shows more updates than are listed on screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b90b57-d4f2-4f61-87a7-bc5b10c65052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b90b57-d4f2-4f61-87a7-bc5b10c65052" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the (obvious) following to resolve:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>1) Ran the Windows Store Trouble-shooter</p>
<p>2) WSRESET - In an elevated Command Prompt<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then, more technical:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1) Rename and re-create the App Store Cache in:</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;to "Cache.old"</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then re-create "Cache"</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>&nbsp;2) Reset App Packages:</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;3) Removal of the Registry Key for User Cache</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/339e6031-93fb-4782-9048-85c39f6bea78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/339e6031-93fb-4782-9048-85c39f6bea78" /></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>&nbsp;4) Remove the App Package:</div>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;Get-AppxPackage *windowsstore* | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>&nbsp;5) Re-add the App Package</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">
<p>&nbsp;Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsStore_11706.1001.26.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Finally... recreated a new user - this causes all sorts of setup issues, so was a last resort!</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above has changed the counter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this leads me to believe that the database on the MS end, <strong><em>may</em></strong> be wrong???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p></div>

            You have been scammed if someone contacted you and sold you software. &nbsp;If you got a call that said Microsoft, you definitely were scammed. MS doesn't call users. And there is no need to clean the registry--EVER. Remove the 'software' if it even exists
 and do a Malwarebytes scan. Get help from a techie friend. You might be able to get a refund or stop payment by contacting your bank or credit card company.

                    <p>I mostly experienced this on links from MSN home page. The links always have a story with pictures. I see the picture then a big white X pops up. It is brief but I managed to catch it with print screen. This is on windows 10 and I have malware bytes c cleaner

            Hi Rodinaz,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. I noticed you are running Firefox. Does this also happen in Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge too? 
<br />
<br />Also, do you have third party password manager or security software installed in Firefox?

<p>Hi Andre,&nbsp; </p>
<p>It rarely happens on IE and I have yet to see it on Edge. My PW manager is Roboform but no security</p>
<p>software on Firefox. Keep in mind I do not use IE or Edge very often. It happened on IE earlier today but</p>
<p>the X was larger and it had 3 kind of half circles below the X as I recall. Similar to a sound icon.</p>
<p>That's about all I know, it happens so quickly I rarely catch it.&nbsp; Thanks Rod</p>

<p>It appears I have plenty to do. I have never reset a browser. How do I go about saving my settings bookmarks etc? I can do all you mentioned but don't want to end up with a big mess or difficult recovery.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            If you look at the X in your screen, it looks like the X in the following screenshot. This could likely suggest its an issue with your Adobe Flash Player needing to be updated.
<br />
<br />In Firefox, first, check if Flash is enabled. Click the Open menu , then Add-ons, Plugins then click on Preferences for Shockwave Flash. Click on the Choose Change when this add-on runs list box then choose Always Activate.
<br />
<br />Updating Flash on Firefox requires users to visit Adobe's download page where they can download and install the latest versions for their respective web browser.

            I updated Adobe Flash and chose always activate. It seemed ok for a while then another one popped up. It actually happened more than once a few times so I went back &amp; forward until I caught this example.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17340d7d-c7eb-47b6-89dd-da0db2146774?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17340d7d-c7eb-47b6-89dd-da0db2146774?upload=true" /></a><br />
&nbsp;Notice there is a solid triangle to the left and below what might be another X with something to the left. If I could catch it on a large color photo it would show the detail. It happens so fast but it appears its like the one above only smaller. Its a mystery

<p>I still get the white X on occasion as usual. I have reset Firefox, Chrome &amp; Edge. I have a copy of Malware Bytes Pro installed. It found nothing in several tries. Same with Windows Defender. I downloaded and run Eset Sysrescue and it found
<span><strong>PatronymicFusesetup.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>From my research I think by description it is a false positive. It was quarantined and so far it has had no ill effects or stop the pop up.</span></p>
<p><span>In every case the X appears on graphics with the LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Skype &amp; Mail Icons to the left. It does not seem to effect anything, although I have experienced some internet lag on games. I am at a loss. Might their
 be another or better forum for answers? </span></p>
<p><span>It seems so far no one has experienced this problem? Thanks</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;I still have the big white X and big backward triangle pop up on occasion. I guess I am the only person that's</p>
<p>had this problem. Or maybe its just another annoyance built into Windows 10? Well should anyone have this problem and cure it I sure would like to know, Thanks</p>

<h2>            remote procedure call fail error fo vista SP2 installing printer</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to reinstall my printer drivers and HP software. I am getting the Windows Installer is not available. I have looked up much info on that and have tried many things but still seem to have problem. This last time I got the following error message
 "The remote procedure call failed".&nbsp; In services, the RPC status is started with automatic start up, the RPC locator is manual start up. This is very annoying, as I cannot use the HP printer. I have disabled the AV and anti spyware when installing. Nothing
 seems to help</p>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This sounds more like a problem with the installer for Windows rather than anything with the printer itself.&nbsp;</div>
