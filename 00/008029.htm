<h2>            Multiple Charts from Single Excel sheet in Powerpoint Slides</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a single excel File and multiple sheets in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will generate 5-6 Charts from that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have those charts in PPT.&nbsp; Is there anyway to use only 1 Excel sheet to get chart in multiple slides?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a recent update is causing issues to your system, you can opt to perform the recovery options built-in to the system to perform a rollback.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You’ll be able to go back to your previous version of Windows by selecting the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp; button &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong>&nbsp; &gt;
<strong>Recovery</strong> and selecting <strong>Get started</strong> under <strong>
Go back to the previous version of Windows 10</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This will keep your personal files, but it'll remove apps and drivers installed after the upgrade, as well as any changes you made to settings. In most cases, you'll have 10 days to go back.
</p>

            No. The power button is the only way to turn the phone on and off.<br />
<br />
You'll have to pay a visit to a Nokia Care Point in order to get this fixed.<br />
<br />
And before you ask how much it will cost, only the Care Point can answer that question. Ask them.

</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Machine is working fine &gt;&gt; then I reload the customers data.

<div><span><span>I then try to go out to the internet with IE8 and get a blank white screen.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I checked my internet settings and then loaded another browser to see if the net connection was the issue.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>The other browser works great, so I try to install a downloaded copy of IE8 and got an error that the version on the machine was newer than the</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>version that was on Microsoft's web site.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>So, I searched Microsoft's site to find out how to remove the corrupt IE8 and followed their instructions.

<div><span><span>This did not work either. IE8 is still there and still corrupt. Now that I have spent hours on this thing, I am ready to reinstall the OS,

            "Blank white screen" often is a symptom of redirect not working.&nbsp; Use View Source to check for that possibility.&nbsp; Then you could inspect the script which would do the redirect, build the URL it would have redirected to and continue that way.&nbsp; So that wouldn't
 necessarily be an indication that IE was "corrupt", more likely burdened by unnecessarily strong security settings to use the problem site.<br />
<br />
Not being able to uninstall IE8 would be a much more significant sign of corruption IMO.

<h2>            HTPC Support, Charms and App Switching not working. These features are needed</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HTPC meaning the old school metro works significantly better for me, and this includes the left side Metro app switching as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running tech preview in remote desktop and I'm unable to switch metro apps anymore at all via mouse without my keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTPCs should not be overlooked, especially with the development of NUCs, there needs to be a way to enable full metro mode with a keyboard attached but not easily accessible which is the case of an htpc. I am either using a remote or a mouse only.

    <title>Interpol Virus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> montanabighorn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Interpol Virus</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.&nbsp; Somewhere along the way I've picked up the Interpol virus.&nbsp; When it happens the screen is overtaken by the scam telling me to send $300 to get it removed.&nbsp; I cannot minimize the screen or do much of anything.&nbsp; I hit cntl+alt+delete
 and select Task Manager but the Task Manager opens behind the Interpol virus screen so that does me no good at all.&nbsp; I can go a few days without seeing the Interpol scam but then it comes back.&nbsp; I run Microsoft Security Essentials full scan and it tells me
 that nothing is wrong with my computer (huh?).&nbsp; I attempt to run Windows Defender:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33f282f6-43ac-4657-8f58-3c210a2dea54" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It tells me that Windows Defender is turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click to turn it on and it runs for a few minutes and then:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07ba5807-a1bc-4fed-92ea-154ad35c5621" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It times out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempt to boot into Safe Mode, it fails and reboots into normal.&nbsp; I restore system to an earlier point and it does no good.&nbsp; The virus still returns in a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- When the virus comes on and takes over my screen, is there ANY keystroke combination I can do to restore my desktop and normal function?&nbsp; Win+M will not remove it from the screen.</p>
<p>2- What vulnerability is being attacked?&nbsp; I heard it was a Flash exploit but I uninstalled Flash and it still happens.</p>
<p>3- Why isn't MSE detecting this?</p>
<p>4- How do I remove this from my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>3) For your explanation, I believe you don't have Microsoft Security Essentials installed but rather you only have Windows Defender. In Windows 7, Windows Defender is Anti-Spyware only and it won't protect you against all malwares.</p>

<p>&lt; SNIP &gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how you arrive at that conclusion; I can assure you that I am indeed running Microsoft Security Essentials, as shown from this screen capture.&nbsp; I cannot start Windows Defender as shown in previous posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do appreciate your effort and will try Defender Offline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Don't waste your time with Defender Offline, it won't typically find these kind of Ransomware browser hijacks any better than MSE or Defender, since it's not really a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try Bruce's recommendation, since that Malware Tips removal blog is written specifically for this type of ransomware software.&nbsp; The person's English isn't the best and they also tend to title everything a "virus", but this is simply because that's how most
 people think everything&nbsp;is named.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Malware Tips website is recommended by many here who really know malware removal, which though I do little of this myself is clear from all those who reply with success after using their processes.</p>

            <p>Hi lyndamollins,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I understand, you want to know if you can still use the same email address and password that you are using on your old computer to the new one. Allow me to provide you an explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If what you are referring here is that accessing your email account, please know that you can sign in using different computers may it be a new or old one as long as you are providing the correct password for the email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, just like what ZigZag3143 has posted, please provide us more information and details about your issue so that we can give you an accurate answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions and clarifications, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Company&#39;s font damage in Office 2016 update.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have been using the font "Commercial Script BT" for my comany's name since I started it years ago.</p>
<p>Sadly, since the office 2016 update the font has been damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example if I put 'c' after 'n' there is a massive gap inbetween making it look as if my company name is two weird words which doesn't mean anything.</p>
<p>Even between 'i' and 'e' there is a small gap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix this from my end?</p>
<p>Or is there any way to contact the Microsoft Office development team so that they can fix it?</p>
                </div>

            <p>It could be an issue with the driver for your printer that may need to be updated to work correctly with Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try downloading the free PrimoPDF converter that will install itself as a printer and set that as the active printer in Word and see if the issue then occurs with the font and\or when you&nbsp;print a document to a pdf file using that "printer".</p>

            <p>Talk to your IT department.&nbsp; If your company has a large enough contract with MS, it will come with a dedicated MS Support option.&nbsp; In that case your IT will have a direct contact with MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, your next best option is to post the same question to the UserVoice forum.&nbsp; It appears that MS really is actively monitoring postings there.&nbsp; That site is dedicated accepting user trouble reports and change requests.

<strong><span>"UserVoice.com" - MS Suggestion box sites </span></strong>
<p><span>If you have an (other) feature suggestions to make for various MS products, here is a longer collection of MS UserVoice.com sites:</span></p>

</span></span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go to UserVoice, either through specific links I’ve provided or create your own suggestions there. That is where MS is looking specifically for this type of user feedback to bring them back to reality from what-ever lala-land they are working in when
 they make these "<em>improvements</em>".&nbsp; Comments (and votes) like these in UserVoice helped to convince MS to roll back the "phat QAT" buttons in 2016
</span><span>and to at least partially undo the 2016 changes to the way the Pen input works</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please do copy the comments you've made here and paste them into comments in UserVoice. If you make a new suggestion, copy the link to your suggestion and post
 it back on this question so other people with the same problem can vote for it and comment on it. (You’ll get faster action that way.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            In that case, it may be a problem with the font file itself. Do note that Office 2016 only supports TrueType and OpenType fonts; the older Adobe Type 1 fonts are no longer supported.

<h2>            Aconia 6120 &#40;dual touch screen&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried to install W10 several times over the last 6 mnths, but without success.</p>
<p>The first publicly released version was installed after many tries was unstable showing the "Memory error fault" and finally</p>
<p>locking up in a endless restart loop. Rolled back to windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second attempt with the recent &nbsp;revised public release, install went smoothly with no "Memory error fault" and run smoothly</p>
<p>using a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>However the touch screen (the bottom screen usually reserved for touch keyboard) was completely unusable.</p>
<p>The onscreen keyboard could not be activated and showed a mirror image of the main desktop background (normal)</p>
<p>the keyboard is normally activated with a 10 point touch on the lower keyboard screen, however any touch on the lower screen</p>
<p>resulted in a touch input on the upper main screen, but in an inverse mirror fashion.....</p>
<p>ie a touch on the lower screens lower left hand corner resulted in a touch input on the upper screen upper right hand corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im keen to get windows 10 working correctly on this model both for myself and other acer iconia 6120 (pau30) owners</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to a driver related issue. As Windows 10 is a new operating system, some of the drivers may be out of date. Therefore, I would suggest you to try updating the drivers by following the steps given by Andre Da Costa on
<strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows

</p><p>Let us know the result. We will be glad to help if you need further assistance.

            <p>Tried to follow advice given but driver download stalled on awaiting on driver msg. The internet was working just nothing happening.</p>
<p>so back to 7 again I do no for a fact that w10 can be got working on this laptop as I've seen it on YouTube along with Windows 8 and 8.1 but details of exactly what to do are hard to come by.</p>

<p>Hi Sangeetha<br />
</p>
<p><span>This is a very common question, and the answer is usually one of these two scenarios:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Did you just install Office from a retail box you just purchased?&nbsp; If so, go to Control Panel, Programs, Programs and Features and see if there is another copy of Office installed
 besides the suite you just installed.&nbsp; Some pre-installed Trial Office 2007 suites can conflict with the product key validation process.&nbsp; If you see a duplicate copy of Office installed, then uninstall it and try to run your new Office program again.&nbsp; Chances
 are your product key will work now.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you are using the 25-digit product key that you found on a sticker on the bottom of your laptop or on the back of your desktop case, then you are using the wrong key.&nbsp; This
 key is the product key for the <strong><em>Windows</em></strong> operating system, and NOT for the Office Suite.&nbsp; The correct product key for the Office suite will be in one of these places:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Inside the retail Office 2007 box (if you bought Office from a retail store)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Inside an e-mail from the online website where you purchased Office</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the outside of the CD case, on a sticker</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft has a knowledge base article that goes into more detail around the invalid product key scenario.&nbsp; It is located at
<span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836178</span></a>&nbsp;
</span>, and would be a good place to go if these instructions above do</span><span> not resolve your issue.</span></p>

            Is this a business account or consumer?  If business, the workaround in the office article might fix it. But it won't work for consumer accounts.

            Open Microsoft Word in a new document. On the View menu choose Web Layout. <br />
<br />
Make your new email message in Word's Web Layout view. You can add hyperlinks by selecting text or objects and then pressing Command-K on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
When you're ready to send your email, on Word's file menu choose Send To &gt; Email recipient as HTML.<br />
<br />
Don't bother requesting that the hyperlink feature be added to a future version of Office for the Mac, because it already has been done in Outlook 2011.<br />

This script makes proper hyperlinks (live underlined words in ordinary text that open linked web pages) in Entourage messages. It guarantees clickable hyperlinks in HTML messages even when received in Outlook Windows.<br />

It's in the Entourage X-2004 Scripts folder.<br />

<p>The default windows 10 driver works for left and right click however there is no scrolling functionality. Installing the dell cypress software 2.5.1.65 reduces the functionality of the trackpad's left and right clicks to just the corner square centimeter
 and still none of the gestures such as two finger scrolling work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how I can get trackpad scrolling to work and improve performance?</p>

            <p>Hi Euler,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to remove the Dell Cypress software 2.5.1.65, as it is reducing the functionality of your touchpad and update it later when the newer version of driver is released.</p>

    <title>Word Documents always opening as &#34;Read Only&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> golfdesigner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Documents always opening as &#34;Read Only&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>There may be a simple answer to this but can't seem to find it. A vast majority of the time when opening a document from an Exchange Server, the Word Document opens as "read only". That gives the impression that someone else may be in the document, but i
 know for sure that is not the case. To get the document to open so it can be edited, sometimes have to try to open it 3 or 4 times.</p>
<p>When reviewing the folder with the file, there doesn't appear to be any "lock" files (the grayed out files with the ~character). &nbsp;In some cases I edit the document, edit it, close it, then an hour later try to open the document and it says "read only". Pretty
 frustrating, and end up with having multiple file names for the same document because need to give it a new name to save it.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Expired&#47;untrusted certificate error freezes Skype application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark-w-farrell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Expired&#47;untrusted certificate error freezes Skype application &#40;still happening&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Regarding the issue that was previously closed... [Expired/untrusted certificate error freezes Skype application]<br />
<br />
It is still happening on a current and up to date system.&nbsp;<br />
This is truly most annoying and infuriating at times.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The notice pops up to install a certificate (I'm guessing from an advertiser?) with some very poorly worded certificate name like, "ultra super trustable" or some such nonsense and Skype freezes until you respond to the certificate request. The exact thing
 you tell people NEVER to click on [Yes] or [Install]. Once in a while, Skype has been freezing without warning and it just "dings" every time you click on it.<br />
==========</p>
<p>I believe the revision is the same (identical) as mine, but I have no such issues.<br />
I do have a paid Skype account for calling with a fixed number.<br />
The computer with the issue is using it free for Skype communication only.<br />
===<br />
We both have the most current, activated, update and version of<br />
* Win 10 Pro<br />
1709<br />
16299.192<br />
<br />
* Skype Classic<br />
7.40.0.151<br />
==========<br />
This happened on her previous machine (AMD Phenom II X4 955) and is now happening spontaneously on her new system (AMD Ryzen 1600+).<br />
New motherboard, new memory, new processor, new SSD and a fresh clean Windows 10 install to the SSD with all fresh downloads of system utilities and apps.<br />
Old drive is now a bulk storage drive and the video card is the same EVGA GTX 650 Ti 2Gb<br />
===<br />
My system was an AMD Phenom II X4 970 upgraded to an FX-8370 - rest of the components are unchanged.<br />
Neither one of us are interested in using the integrated Windows 10 version.<br />
<br />
What gives, any suggestions?<br />
<br />

            Hello,
<br />
<br />The Insert Icons feature is only available to uses of the subscription version of PowerPoint (Office 365).
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/insert-icons-in-office-2016-e2459f17-3996-4795-996e-b9a13486fa79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/insert...</a>
<br />
<br />It is a feature that was introduced after the release of Office 2016 and likely will be in Office 2019.
<br />
<br />If you do have the subscription version, I would recommend trying a repair.
<br />
<br />First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

<p>Thank you, Chris.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it possible that I had it for over a year in Office Home &amp; Student 2016, then?&nbsp; It seems strange to have had it, and then have it disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            That is very strange. I cannot explain it unless you had access to a 365 version for some reason.
<br />
<br />I have Office 2016 professional plus which is also a single purchase version and it does not have the feature even though it has many items not in the Home &amp; Student. I never tried using it so do not know if it was there at some time in the past.
<br />
<br />The help page I linked clearly says that it is not available in the single-purchase versions.
<br />
<br />I suppose it is possible that someone at Microsoft goofed and it slipped into an update to the Home &amp; Student version and then they "updated" it out again. If so, you might be able to back out of the update. I do not expect that this is what happened but can imagine it.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2770432/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2013-or-office-2016-clic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/277043...</a>
<br />
<br />If you try backing up to an earlier release and it works, please let us know here. This is not the type of information that Microsoft shares with us.

<p>Just to let you know that I restored a previous version of Office 2016, and the icons function did not return.&nbsp; So, it remains a mystery - and SOOOOO frustrating to have had it, and now to have it disappear.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>

    <title>Repeating tasks&#39; reminders change on their own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susan zee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeating tasks&#39; reminders change on their own</h2>
                    <p>I created a list of tasks that repeat weekly, semi-monthly, quarterly, and annually, and I have set up reminders for these repeating tasks to alert me one day or week
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">before</span> the task is due.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check the box to indicate that the task is completed, it does create a new task at the appropriate interval, however, the reminder for the new task is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always</span> created to occur <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
after</span> the new task's due date. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, a weekly recurring task is due on Friday, with a reminder on Thursday. On Thursday, reminder pops up; on Friday, task is completed and box is checked to indicate that. A new weekly recurring task is automatically created (correctly) for the
 following Friday, but the new <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">reminder</span> is automatically created for the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Friday after that</span>, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>not</strong></span> the Thursday before (one week after the original reminder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I manually change the reminder to the Thursday before, as it should have been from the start, the next time I look at the tasks and reminders, the reminder has reverted to the Friday after the new task is due.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on and how do I fix it?</p>

<p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the situation, could you provide some screenshots about the whole process and how you set the weekly recurring task? We will then check on our side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, I’d like to confirm the detailed version of Outlook for Mac you are using. (Open Outlook&gt;click Outlook in the taskbar&gt;About Outlook).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Monique</p>

<p>I am using Microsoft® Outlook for Mac Version 15.31 (170216) as part of an Office 365 Subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a new task, I click on the Tasks icon in the bottom left corner of the Outlook window, then click on New Task. I name the task:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f806e751-0cbe-4ac2-b689-53684e5216a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f806e751-0cbe-4ac2-b689-53684e5216a2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I set the due date:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bac39fe8-9bea-4e4f-9a0e-b4ea2af4484f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bac39fe8-9bea-4e4f-9a0e-b4ea2af4484f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I set the reminder date and time:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73b882f6-a854-4b4f-ad14-9025f4793aa5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73b882f6-a854-4b4f-ad14-9025f4793aa5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on Recurrence and set the schedule:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f3a2d68-08d1-403c-b8b9-be553eeb98f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f3a2d68-08d1-403c-b8b9-be553eeb98f2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I click OK and everything looks good:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b806a065-1b86-4873-8438-a5e024e331af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b806a065-1b86-4873-8438-a5e024e331af" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I click Save &amp; Close and it appears in my list of Tasks, as it should. When the Task is completed, I double-click on the task in the list and check the box next to the name to mark it complete:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28add8bc-4227-40f4-9a58-68a053ca508c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28add8bc-4227-40f4-9a58-68a053ca508c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A new Task is then created, with the proper Due date and Reminder, as it should:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa52f519-d0b6-4943-a301-ba0d6d690346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa52f519-d0b6-4943-a301-ba0d6d690346" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Time passes. I complete the new Task, check the box, click Save &amp; Close; a new Task is created properly with the proper reminder:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7878ec1f-4377-4568-8fa9-090a116c3ba0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7878ec1f-4377-4568-8fa9-090a116c3ba0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, before I even close this new Task, this happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d01c947-7e36-42b4-8442-b7f17cd61dae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d01c947-7e36-42b4-8442-b7f17cd61dae" /></a></p>

    <title>32 bit OS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            32 bit OS</h2>
                    <div>Hi all,</div>
<div>
<p>I'm thinking that 32 bit OS is now dead, along with Windows phone! Anyone think 32 bit is worth bothering with?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I've been an Insider for a couple of years or so and use an old Dell D620 32 bit on slow ring and a Dell Optiplex 755 32 bit 4GB RAM on the fast ring and a Lumia 735 but we won't mention that ! :-)</div>
<div>The 755 is currently on 17083.1000 and seems to be working quite well but think the Intel Q35 Express graphics are letting it down as it's using the MS basic driver. I'm thinking of going over to 64 bit and sticking a new PCI graphics card in and maybe
 going to 8GB RAM (max for the 755). </div>
<div>It is literally a spare machine and will only be used for testing / playing with Insider builds so I don't want to make a meal of it but I think it's time to put 32 bit OS to bed! I only connect to it using RDP from my main desktop as the 755 is in the
 (cold) garage at the bottom of the garden; keeping the CentOS server company :-)</div>
<div>
<p>Any recommends for a low cost PCI graphics card, suitable for Win 10? (I'm a bit out of touch with hardware specs)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>The D620 is currently on build 17074.1002 and has a problem with the (Intel) graphics driver so again it's using the MS basic driver! Think it is probably time to send it to silicon heaven :-)</div>
<div>
<p>Thoughts anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeff</p>
</div>

<p>I have a D600.&nbsp; I revived mine with an IDE SSD.&nbsp; Marvelous upgrade.&nbsp; Look around for one.&nbsp; They are hard to find sometimes.&nbsp; You can also buy a SATA second drive caddy for the CD bay and boot from it with a normal laptop drive.&nbsp;
 I have that also (dual boot) and the lappy runs quite nimbly from the SATA drive in the bay.</p>

    <title>Major, MAJOR problems with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garytayman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Major, MAJOR problems with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am having serious issues with Windows 10.&nbsp; Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I installed Windows 10 on two laptops back in March.&nbsp; One had sound issues, later fixed, and aside from that I've been really impressed, as both of these laptops have been superb.&nbsp; For this reason I was really shocked when the final rollout came
 around, and I installed it on my Lenovo Desktop, used for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once installed, I began getting multiple screen refreshes, along with errors saying my photo stream doesn't work because my iCloud isn't set up properly.&nbsp; Well, I've tried and tried and tried and tried, but I can't get rid of the errors -- and it seems there
 is no way to turn the dadblame thing off!&nbsp; I couldn't care less about iCloud; this is business.&nbsp; But the screen keeps flipping and flipping again, giving me the error over and over.&nbsp; Eventually it'll stop, but then the Start button refuses to work.&nbsp; Three-finger
 salute, sign out, sign in, and it starts over.&nbsp; After several attempts it finally starts to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next problem:&nbsp; Money Plus.&nbsp; I went in to look at my business account, it refuses to come on saying I need Internet Explorer 6.&nbsp; Can't get around it -- oh well, who needs money?&nbsp; I'll just write the checks and hope they don't bounce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went to make a quick update to my website.&nbsp; Using SharePoint Designer, I made the change and went to save it.&nbsp; Can't save it!&nbsp; It says I need Administrator permission to save this file!&nbsp; Never an issue until win10.&nbsp; So I saved it to my E drive (I
 have a second hard drive on this machine).&nbsp; After exiting SharePoint, I tried copying the file back to the original location.&nbsp; It resisted, still insisting on an administrator, but finally took it.&nbsp; I uploaded and it stripped me of all the pictures and graphics!&nbsp;
 Goodbye money, goodbye website, what next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to log onto the Microsoft forum, to ask about these things.&nbsp; It would not let me on the internet!&nbsp; As I tried, again the screen kept flipping over and over, with errors about my photo stream and iCloud.&nbsp; Several logins and logouts later I finally
 managed to go back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But -- now with Windows 7, I STILL cannot get my money files, although Money Plus DOES come up.&nbsp; I STILL continued to get funny windows saying my iCloud doesn't work and I can't get my photo stream.&nbsp; Through much fuss I think I've finally put iCloud photo
 stream out of its misery.&nbsp; Website, restored, but man what a time!&nbsp; My website in its original location still refuses to save without an administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point -- Money Plus:&nbsp; I try to restore a backup, from several sources.&nbsp; It refuses.&nbsp; If I restore from a flash drive I get an error saying the file cannot accept a name with all manner of symbols (which it does not have).&nbsp; ANY IDEAS ON HOW TO GET
 BACK INTO MY BANK ACCOUNT FILES?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Website.&nbsp; This is a folder in my Documents folder.&nbsp; How in blazes do I turn off this "Administrator only" business?&nbsp; I want to edit my files!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ICloud:&nbsp; if it don't work, can I keep It turned off?&nbsp; If I were to reinstall Windows 10, I don't want to deal with it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me when you get rid of all these bugs, then maybe I'll give Windows 10 another try.&nbsp; It's a shame because I like it, but if this computer sits here with the screen having epileptic fits, and destroying my business records in the process, you
 can keep it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it ridiculous that, among all the hardware and software out there that Windows must be compatible with, the biggest problems I've encountered are with Microsoft products.</p>
<p>

            I too am having major problems as W10 will now no longer accept my 'sticks' via USB port although, be damned, they work on my laptop which too has had W10 installed. I had to ferret around like a DH to find how to pin IE11 to taskbar which eventually I
 did but holy guacamole shouldn't these issues have been resolved before the damnable update was installed???? Frustration plus - does anybody know how to fix the USB port issue?

            <p>Sorry to hear your problems.&nbsp; I have been running a pair of HP notebooks since last fall and just no issues.&nbsp; I have installed a bunch more HP laptops and they just sing.&nbsp; Just took a W8.1 to W10 and I was using the USB sticks on them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I install W10 on some one elses PC, they get Firefox to go with it.&nbsp; They also get Start8(10) to void that hassle.&nbsp; My customers just lap it up.&nbsp; I feel the love.&nbsp; Some of these HP's have AMD and an update from AMD comes right in immediately after the
 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can say is that it should be better for you guys.&nbsp; Is it driver issues?</p>

            I downloaded to my laptop without any problems at all but on my PC nightmares. It will not recognise my USB port nor will it recognise some of my programs stating they are incompatible and when I try to update drivers or programs it won't let me with Windows
 Support telling me that "there are issues which should eventually get updated". Not the best of answers. On my laptop I have no such issues with all sticks being recognised.

            <p>I have not had problems with flash drives, but the problems I DID have were/are bad enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Microsoft Money Plus.&nbsp; It's a "sunset version."&nbsp; In other words, Microsoft made up a new version of Money Plus, offered it for free, and said it's the last one they're going to make.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I've been using money for many years, and all my business banking
 has been done with this program.&nbsp; I actually have two files -- My Money, which goes back to the beginning, and a newer file, Money 2015, which starts at the beginning of this year.&nbsp; (I started the second file for an entirely different reason).&nbsp; When windows
 10 was installed, Money locks up with an error that says it requires Internet Explorer 6.&nbsp; It refuses to run.&nbsp; THIS is a documented error; Microsoft's take on it appears to be "that's a sunset version and it's no longer supported."&nbsp; Oh, so that means it's
 perfectly okay to screw up my business records for the past 20 years?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; I'm sure that their "Agreement" that you sign states they're not liable for loss, but imagine if they release new software and power plants shut down, and planes fall out of the
 sky, and traffic lights screw up causing car accidents, I can betcha they're liable.&nbsp; I need a better answer.&nbsp; I've gone back to Windows 7, Money Plus runs again, but I STILL can't access these backup files!&nbsp; Microsoft -- any answers here?&nbsp; I'll keep trying,
 don't have much choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; iCloud.&nbsp; Maybe some of you think it's fantastic, I don't know.&nbsp; But I can't get it to work.&nbsp; Not only that, I couldn't care less about it anyway, and if it doesn't work I'd like to simply turn it off.&nbsp; I CAN'T!!!&nbsp; No, when I boot up the computer I get
 continual screen refreshes, over and over, spotted with messages saying my iCloud isn't set up, my Photo Stream won't work because of iCloud, my OneDrive won't work, over and over again.&nbsp; I click on one of these errors and it takes me to an iCloud setup screen.&nbsp;
 I go through the motions, and maybe -- sometimes I can get it to stop flipping, flipping, and refreshing over and over again.&nbsp; When the screen finally comes to rest, I click on the Start button and nothing happens.&nbsp; I sign out and sign back on, and it's back
 to the error messages and refreshes.&nbsp; After 5 or 6 tries with this, I can finally get back to using the Start, and actually doing things.&nbsp; What's frustrating here is that reverting back to Windows 7 didn't fix it -- I was still getting errors with the screen
 going crazy.&nbsp; However I finally got to one of those screens and turned it off, and so far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Why is it that I suddenly need Administrator permission to save any file in my Documents folder?&nbsp; Again, drop back to Windows 7 and the problem is still here,.&nbsp; The only way I've been able to save files is to place them in a second hard drive (like everyone
 has one of THOSE!).&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; How do I fix this Administrator issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got this sinking feeling that Windows 10 is going to take a year or more to fix, and then it'll no longer be free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands now, I was going to sign up for the Office 365, as my trial on the laptop is about to expire.&nbsp; Why bother?&nbsp; Is this only going to cause more trouble?&nbsp; I've been getting messages that if I sign up now, it's half price, but it won't tell me the
 price until I check out!&nbsp; GOOD GRIEF!&nbsp; I can see why Apple is doing so well; if this **** doesn't get any better I'll be joining their ranks.</p>

            And I thought I had problems. I have been onto their support site who tell me that it is a motherboard problem despite the fact that there was nothing wrong with same i.e. until I did the upgrade!!! So yes I too rolled back into W7 to still&nbsp;have the same
 damnable problem no access to USB ports!!! Expletive, expletive!! My dialogue with them has at least prompted them to do a remote access to check it, I think they were peeved when I suggested that the motherboard was fine before the upgrade. Do I care? No.

<p>
</p><p>Some GOOD news, sorta, albeit not GREAT news.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my banking records back!&nbsp; I can access Money, and it all works, but to make it work I have to right-click on Money and "run as Administrator."&nbsp; So the money problem is not the software itself (in Windows 7, it's still incompatible with Windows 10!)
 but this danged security thing that requires an Administrator to run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm back in Windows 7.&nbsp; HOW DO I UNLOCK THESE FILES/FOLDERS TO REMOVE THE ADMIN REQUIREMENT?&nbsp; I've fixed it with the website by placing this in another folder; I'm not sure I can do this with Money Plus.&nbsp; I've gone into security settings of the various folders
 and made changes, it won't let me make the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I please make a comment?&nbsp; Years ago you bought a radio.&nbsp; it had two knobs.&nbsp; One turned it on and changed the volume, the other tuned in stations.&nbsp; It came with a book that told you how to do it.&nbsp; TODAY you buy a computer and get a sheet that says, "Good
 luck with it!"</p>

            For the Administrator issue, it looks like the Trusted Installer from Windows 10 is up to it's tricks on your system by taking ownership of various files when it shouldn't be doing that. It's legacy has followed you back when you rolled back to Windows
 7.&nbsp;I've experienced something similar for the same reason on one of the preview builds where doing a "clean" install eventually solved that problem after fighting&nbsp;with the system to regain ownership&nbsp;of the affected files. It's an extreme measure, but it might
 be the easiest solution. Be advised that you will need your original install media and more importantly, back-up all your data before doing this.

            <p>Are these the files themselves or the folders they're in?&nbsp; Is there a way of finding out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking the solution here is to move the affected files/folders elsewhere, then delete the originals in whatever way I can, then replace them with the "clean" files or folders without the admin ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comments?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be more than happy to reinstall windows 10, but AFTER these bugs have been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Money Plus:&nbsp; Sunset program, it appears Microsoft is simply washing their hands with this.&nbsp; Yet, on some other threads there apparently is a "fix" which involves screwing around with the registry.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Maybe someone can spend a few minutes making a
 patch?&nbsp; In the next month or so, I've got a CPA coming over to move this stuff into QuickBooks.&nbsp; Then maybe I can say goodbye to Money Plus anyway -- but locking up the program, and my files, two weeks beforehand was just plain cruel.&nbsp; Yes, I had three backups,
 but the only way, besides what I did, to access them would be to find an old computer and install money Plus, then restore the backups.&nbsp; Bad news.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the admin-locked files/folders, the iCloud mess (messages that it doesn't work are one thing, but the constant screen-refreshing is horrible!), and other bugs I've heard of including flash drives that don't work, NVidia incompatibility and numerous
 problems with sound cards, it would be nice to get a message someday that these have been fixed -- and then we can try again.&nbsp; If they have NOT been fixed by July of next year, will the free upgrade offer be extended?</p>

</p><p>It is due to the programs and drivers / hardware on your previous system.</p>
<p>MS has absolutely no control over icloud or other programs of the same type.</p>
<p>You ideally should do a complete clean install of your base OS, WITHOUT any of the problem / incompatible programs and the apple stuff. THEN update to win 10 if you really must, THEN 1 by 1, install the programs and check compatibility.</p>
<p>Most driver issues can be fixed quite easily by installing the correct drivers and turning of auto driver update.</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable with this, then I suggest you do not update the OS &nbsp;to win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't see that MS has anything to 'fix' in your case, so a wait would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>A clean install and careful setup should and probably will sort all the issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are posting on the insider forum here, As an insider, you are presumed and expected to possess a reasonable level - well above average ! - of technical ability and skills, if you do not, as it appears, you are posting in the wrong forum. &nbsp;Simple registry
 modifications (to get the MS Money working) etc are day to day stuff for the tech level expected of MS insiders.</p>
<p>MS can not be expected to ensure all you old programs work - they can only offer a guide - the rest is up to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS compatibility checker is pretty dumb really. Win 10 is not in a truly finished state, and never will be with constant 'feature' updates. &nbsp;- Is MS misleading users about the 'supposed simplistic' update-ability of existing systems to win 10 ? - imo
 absolutely ! but hey.... NO MS release has EVER been a straight forward update - ALWAYS a clean install is better and usually NEEDED - but, the new management at MS knows better..... tum te tum...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And - re extending free update offer (note UPDATE not UPGRADE!) I think you have a better chance of winning the lottery lol ;-) ... win 10 may not even EXIST by July next year - it may well go the same way as MS Nokia.</p>

    <title>Lockup Issues with 10163 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredinit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lockup Issues with 10163</h2>
                    <p>I received the latest build - 10163 late last week. &nbsp;As far as I can tell the installation seemed to go OK. &nbsp;I did have to perform a final reboot manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since the build, though, the OS appears to lock up - horribly. &nbsp;The lockup requires holding the power button down until the system powers off. &nbsp;Three-finger salute, or other 'soft' methods do not appear to unstick system control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to occur whenever Administrative privileges are being requested. &nbsp;Such as installing new software, browser plug-ins, etc. &nbsp;I've tried lowering the security request threshold to minimum, the but system still locks up. Unfortunately the lock-up
 is so 'hard' that don't know if I can grab any logs or other materials to send to engineering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had several Win-10 updates and all have been flawless. &nbsp;Time to wipe the machine and build anew with the current ISO and see if that resolves it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meh - 'tis the nature of beta ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just asking/posting in case anyone else has noticed the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            It must be malware because the rest of us got 10162.
