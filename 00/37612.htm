                    <div><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">Hello everyone, Since 21/01/2019, I am waiting for a refund from microsoft. He noted that it would be issued within 4 to 7 business
 days. However, today at 01/02/2019, I still have not been refunded. Is it normal or should I start to worry? Thank you in advance for your answers.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing that you would want to do is go into your Microsoft Account https://account.microsoft.com/billing to see if the refund request was actually process.
<span>Refunds should take between three to five business days to reach your financial institution.&nbsp;
</span>Also, when you say "He" did you talk to somebody from support? Support no longer handles refund requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if this helps.</p>
<p>

                    <b>The whole error text is:<br />

</b><font><b><b>restrui.exe bad image - <br />
The app or DLL C:\windows\system32\wbem\framedyn.dll is not a valid Windows<br />
image. Please check against your installation diskette<br />
<br />
<font>I have a hewlett packard compaq desktop with windows xp home sp3.<br />
The pc came with a biohd-8 error (they say it is a hard disk problem and I must give it to them to fix it,<br />
the thing is the warranty will be over in a couple of months and I do not want to stuck with it if it breaks again then). Until to decide what to do I performed 2-3 times destructive recovery through dvd, the pc surfs alright, defragments alright, updates alright
 windows and av.&nbsp; Everything OK except for the biohd-8 error that persists in diagnostics (f9).<br />
Today though, the other error as in subject line appeared when trying to log in my limited account, I insisted and logged in alright, then it stopped me from opening any notepad or wordpad file, it leads to dos saying "one or more con codepages are not valid
 for the selected..." or sort of, I translate from local language.<br />
Then it stopped me from performing system restore.<br />
It remains in admin account and in safe mode.<br />
I applied manual instructions of microsoft paper "application has failed to start because framedyn.dll was not found" and was able to perform system restore once or twice, but error persists.<br />
Then I cannot update windows through windows update, when I try I had this error:<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Windows Update.Ink <br />
NVTDM CPU faced a not valid instruction.&nbsp; <br />
CS:0000 IP:0077 OP:f0 37 05 0e <br />
Click shut down to terminate&nbsp; Shut down/Ignore (I translate again).<br />
Should I try again recovery or this would stop me for good?<br />

            Did not see an answer in this forum for quite a while so I installed malwarebyte's antimalware, updated its definitions and scanned, it found trojan hiloti.gen in cyberlink&gt;mediashow which comes pre-installed in my Hewlett Packard CQ2300 pc with windows
 xp home sp3.<br />
My NIS did not find it.<br />
I performed destructive recovery through dvd (this pc does not come with os dvd, but with a recovery software that helps you preparing a recovery dvd as soon as you open it for the first time).<br />
But the trojan was still there, since it is into a pre-installed program as I said and each time I return to factory settings it returns too.&nbsp; Don't know how this happens.&nbsp; This was a last item on a shelf, opened I mean, in the store, perhaps somebody put the
 trojan into it.<br />
I erased the trojan, with above software, checked again and it found it again in system volume information folder, erased again and checked again, it found nothing.<br />
With the destructive recovery all other problems (restrui.exe, notapad and wordpad problems, windows update everything) were solved.<br />
I use this pc to surf and keep my data elsewhere, so have no problem to format each month and more often.<br />
I updated windows, NIS, antimalware, checked with both found nothing, yet when I restarted I found the net connections folder in my control panel empty!<br />
Somebody erased all my internet connections and could not connect to the net!<br />
I performed system restore to yesterday, the connections appeared miraculously and I update everything again.The situation is I have trojans that would not leave with formating the hard drive.<br />

            <b>2 days later.<br />
In the past I peformed 2-3 times destructive recovery for another reason.&nbsp; I mean before restrui.exe.<br />
Then I updated windows comparatively quickly, initially windows update asked for genuine advantage and another xp update, and after that something like 226 updates arrived all together and were installed one after the other, same thing all the three times.<br />
Now, after having erased this hiloti.trojan.gen, windows updates are VERY DIFFICULT to obtain.<br />
Up to now I managed only 160 and windows updates do not find any other critical available.<br />
After genuine advantage and the other standalone, arrived first and alone too net framework 3.5 sp1.&nbsp; This could not install in no way whatsoever and without it the 226 arrived but did not install.<br />
There was a loop, windows update was finding this net framework 3.5 sp1, it did not install, then when closing the system it was appearing installing yet it did not, it was required again and again by windows updates and so on.<br />
I was obliged to perform another destructive recovery.&nbsp; This time, after the genuine advantage and the first xp critical update (which is something like windows installer) I tried to install manually net framework 3.5 sp1.&nbsp; It took hours and finally it said
 "an error occurred, report to microsoft" and then it was alright in add/remove programs.&nbsp; After that I managed to install the remaining 155 updates by lots of 50 or 40 at a time, that is windows update did not find them all together but 40 or 50 at a time.<br />
And after that I don't know what to do.&nbsp; Windows update do not find any other critical updates available but I'm not comfortable with the net framework 3.5 sp1 having installed that way and the remaining something like 70 critical updates disappeared.</b><br />

I try to get my money back from them not only due to this but also because of a biohd-8 hard disk error and it's in warranty.<br />

<br />
rstrui.exe - Bad Image<br />
The application or DLL C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\framedyn.dll is not a valid Windows image.&nbsp; Please check this against your installation diskette.<br />
<br />
Those ideas are just more of their <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">wild goose chases</a></i> and not even good ones at that.<br />
<br />
Why did they just leave you out here hanging - what kind of "expertise" is that?<br />

            The framedyn.dll file is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after so if it ever comes up missing on your system and your WFP is not afflicted, WFP will try to replace the file so it is easy to "trick" Windows File Protection so it
 will just replace the suspicious file for you.<br />
<br />
Using Windows Explorer browse or navigate to this folder (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32\wbem</b><br />
<br />
Locate the suspicious framedyn.dll file and <b>rename </b>it to something you can remember like:<br />
<br />
<b>framedyn.xxx</b><br />
<br />
When WFP sees that the file is missing, it will want to replace it with a fresh copy from the backup copy of the file located here:<br />
<b><br />
c:\window\system32\dllcache </b><br />
<br />
Wait a few seconds, then press F5 a few times to refresh your display and a new framedyn.dll should appear in the folder and you will see an event like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file c:\windows\system32\wbem\framedyn.dll. This file was restored to the original version to maintain system stability. The file version of the system file is 5.1.2600.5512.<br />
<br />
Then see how your System Restore works.<br />
<br />
It could be that the backup copy of the file is also afflicted and if that is the case, you can download one from my SkyDrive and replace it that way.<br />

<div><b>Trojan.Heur.FU.0x1@ais2!JzT in my admin temp and erased it, then trojan.Heur.FU.pu1@aaPibJBT in system volume information folder and erased it.</b></div>
<div><b>The third scan found me clean.</b></div>
<div><b>The thing is I found so far those 3 trojans (hiloti which is a downloader and the other 2 now) with different methods than my av and my av (NIS I mean) often reports trojans deleted.</b></div>
<div><b>What is happening is that I have strong intrusion problems all the time I'm surfing (several years) and I lost more than a couple of systems due to it.</b></div>
<div><b>I always had trojans, that provoke problems, control the system yet do not infect it, like viruses do, rather threatening they would in order to make one obey and let them use his system as they like than destroy it once and for all.</b></div>
<div><b>The "microsoft experts" as you say diagnosed ongoing and longstanding hijacking to my two previous systems a while before they passed away (the systems, I mean, a laptop did not open at all any more and the manufacturer said it's not supported any more,
 local services said it's cheaper to buy a new one, and a desktop same thing).</b></div>
<div><b>Their solution (microsoft experts, I mean) did always be to format, I was answering to them what will happen if I format and trojans persist, they said no way.</b></div>
<div><b>I bought this new system cheap as I cannot afford to buy constantly new computers and it's my bad fortune this one was a last item in the store and had already problems the hard disk and this trojan dowloader which returns after each recovery through
 disk or through dvd.</b></div>
<div><b>Yet I'm happier than in previous years for some reasons.</b></div>
<div><b>1) I discovered vpn. &nbsp;It's unbelievable how happy that makes me feel when surfing and I do not mean only subjectively.</b></div>
<div><b>2) I can format now, as it is simple, I boot from recovery cd and that's all, while previously it was more complicated.</b></div>
<div><b>3) I can restore system although I have NIS (tampering protection on and off) while in previous systems did not now how and had abandonned system restoring or else had to switch to other av while having Norton pre-installed (usually it is) is always
 a problem to fully erase and other av maybe have problems due to that.</b></div>
<div><b>Plse do not bother to instruct about restrui.exe etc.</b></div>
<div><b>All that was due to trojans, I corrected them with system restore which I corrected and with recovery through dvd.</b></div>
<div><b>Cannot be sure though I am clean of trojans now.</b></div>
<div><b>After I bought this cheap system with windows xp last summer and although I knew xp would be discontinued in 2014, I read in the net that xp are a guaranteed zombie unless hardened.</b></div>
<div><b>The only thing I'm interested now is how to harden windows 7 or 8, in a way to be able to say I'll avoid all intrusions in the future.</b></div>
<div><b>In the past I asked this question lots of times and local services had answered to me "it's impossible, the only way is to keep your valuable data to a pc offline and to have an other one to surf and format each month".</b></div>
<div><b>So that's what I'm doing so far.</b></div>
<div><b>But I believe that if I could surf anonymously (that is nobody could attach to my IP my real name and surname while now it is obligatory to buy any internet connection showing ID) I'd be more free of instrusions. &nbsp;That's how vpn makes me happier than
 ever.</b></div>

As long as your System Restore is not complaining (that was your original issue) that is good for me.<br />

    <title>Recycle bin icon disappears after emptying trash. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a1a2z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recycle bin icon disappears after emptying trash.</h2>
                    When I empty the trash, the recycle bin disappears from my desktop. The words "Recycle Bin" are still shown on the desktop, and when I put the curser over the spot where the icon is supposed to be, the area still "hilights" as if the bin were still there.<br />
<br />
I am not using a custom icon. I am using the default recycle bin icon.<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7 Professional.<br />
<br />
When I reboot the computer the recycle bin comes back. I may be able to empty the trash several times before it disappears again, but eventually (usually within the first 5 times emptying the trash) it disappears again.<br />
<br />
I realize that this isn't a huge issue, but it is more than a little bothersome. Any help that anybody can offer would be greatly appreciated.

<p>I believe I have finally figured out the problem (in my case anyway).</p>
<p>I deleted my TrendMicro anti-virus software just after Christmas and replaced it with Norton Internet Security. Since I removed TrendMicro from my system I haven't had any issues at all with&nbsp;this problem.</p>
<p>Another apparently related problem was with Microsoft Office. It would sometimes take a long time to open Word and Excel documents. Then when I would "save" an Excel document the computer would create a "temp" file and save it to the folder that the original
 document was located in. It wouldn't delete the original document. It would just create a temp file that couldn't be opened. After I removed TrendMicro from the computer, those problems went away too.</p>
<p>I'm curious.......how many of you are using TrendMicro and having these issues?&nbsp;</p>

            Hello A1A2Z,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, lets try changing from 32 bit True Color to 16 bit High Color.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;- Right-click the desktop &gt; select Screen Resolution</div>
<div>&nbsp;- On the right select Advanced settings</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Select the Monitor tab &gt; under Colors select 16 bit and click OK</div>
<div><br />
<div>Test to determine if the issue is still present on your system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second, Have you tried to refresh your desktop when this happens to determine if it brings your icon back without the restart?&nbsp;</div>

            Hi, JayWin10
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network function and then repair.
<br />
<br />To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off

<h2>            Microphone Detected But Not Responding&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently I tried using Xbox&nbsp;party chat using the Xbox&nbsp;app on windows to 10 to get an error of 'The sample rate of your microphone isn't supported' so I went onto sounds to find my microphone was detected&nbsp;but no matter what I did no sound was coming out
 of the microphone and no one could hear me so I unplugged my mic and plugged a different one in which I know works because I have used it in the past which also didn't work either I have also tried the built-in troubleshooter but no luck there either any assistance
 in fixing this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am running windows 10 version: 1809, os build: 17751.1. With an MSI&nbsp;Z270 pro carbon motherboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hey JP183,</p>
<p>The only thing to worry about would be the PAL or NTSC setting of your Xbox. Since you bought your Xbox in the UK it has the PAL setting. The PAL setting is used everywhere in Europe.</p>
<p>In short lines, you're safe to buy games from anywhere you like in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The games you buy in Greece might be in Greek. I'm not too sure about this.</p>

    <title>Getting Blue Screen Of Death While Java Is Installed On The Computer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting Blue Screen Of Death While Java Is Installed On The Computer.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed something interesting recently that seems to point to an issue with Windows 10 and Java working well together. I'll spare you all of the gory details but I had bought a Microsoft-certified-refurbished PC with the intent to use it for Java development
 via Eclipse and Android development via Android Studio. For many months, everything worked fine but starting in roughly late-January, my laptop began to run into a blue screen of death issue, citing memory management as the root cause. I wasn't sure what was
 causing the issue, so I backed up all of my vital stuff and planned on having to do a full system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with removing all of my dev software, so away went Eclipse and Android Studio. I also decided that Java itself could go, at least temporarily, so I deleted the environment variables dealing with Java. Well wouldn't you know it but as soon as I
 had purged all-things-Java from my system, but 1) my system ran noticeably faster and 2) the continuous shut-down of my PC was no longer an issue. I would still occasionally run into a blue screen of death when I went to shut down the computer (which seems
 quite odd to me, but whatever! At least I was done!) but no longer was my work being interrupted. Of course, it meant I couldn't do the thing(s) I bought the computer for, so I decided to try and re-install my Java-related stuff again. For the most part, it
 worked over the next week or two but it didn't take long until the shutdowns commenced again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have the Java environment variables deleted from my computer but Eclipse and Android Studio are still installed. Of course, they are useless without Java but at least my PC actually WORKS!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone familiar with some sort of compatibility issue as it pertains to Java and/or the JDK and Windows 10? I'd hate to think that I'll have to disable the environment variables for Java any time I'm not planning to use it but if that's the solution,
 then so be it but with Java becoming more and more prevalent, it seems that if there IS an issue with Java and Windows 10 working together that Microsoft would be in a uniquely bad spot if they chose not to address whatever is causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-BG</p>

<p><span>Hi Bruce Gates,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to get clarity on this issue and assist you with appropriate troubleshooting steps, please reply with the answers to the questions below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model number of your computer and the version of your Windows 10 computer? (To check the version of your Windows 10, you can refer
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027391/windows-10-see-which-version-you-have" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">See which version of Windows 10 you have</span></a></em>).</li><li>Are you aware of any changes made to this computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the version of Java you have installed on your computer?</li><li>What is the complete error code/message that you get when you see the Blue Screen Of Death?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>It might that Java is not causing the Blue Screen Of Death because BSOD is generally caused due to the hardware or the drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, I suggest you to follow the below methods to narrow down the problem and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before trying the below methods, disconnect all external devices from the computer expect the keyboard and the mouse.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Updating Graphics Drivers</span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Follow the steps mentioned in <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Update drivers in Windows 10</span></a></em>
 and update the Video Card Drivers of your computer and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Running Check Disk</span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Please follow the steps mentioned in <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2641432/check-your-hard-disk-for-errors-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Check your hard disk
 for errors</span></a></em> (this article applies for Windows 10 as well) and check your hard disk for any errors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: While performing Check Disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive then Check Disk tries to repair that sector, if any data available on that might be lost. You may take
 a backup of the data before performing the steps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Running Windows Memory Diagnostic</span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>R</strong> keys &gt; Type <strong>
mdsched.exe</strong> &gt; Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose to either <strong>Restart now and check for problems (recommended)</strong> to check your memory straight away or
<strong>Check for problems the next time I start my computer</strong> if you want to keep working and do the memory check later.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: While performing these steps, there might be a risk of data loss. You may take a backup of the data before performing the steps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After performing the above methods, if BSOD is not occurring, then <strong>
please install Java</strong> and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>If you are still facing the same issue, then I suggest you to upload the mini dump files to know the root cause of the issue and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><span>Copy the Mini Dump files from <strong>C:\Windows\Mini Dump</strong> to your Desktop, zip up the files, and upload to the Cloud. Post the link for the same, so that we can examine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Give it a shot and let us know of any changes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Is Search History&#47;Browsing History Shared on Different User Profiles in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize if this is a very simple question, but I am not good at all with computers. Please bear with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Windows 7 Enterprise, 2009. This is a shared computer that I can log on and off of my profile. Other users are able to do the same. I am wondering if my search history (in Google), browsing history, and cookies are also shared between profiles?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I searched up "Anniversary Gifts" on Google, and then logged out, could somebody else--on their own profile--go to Google, type out an "A" and have "Anniversary Gifts" pop out in purple font, denoting that it was searched?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading this!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s. contrary to what most of you are assuming, this has nothing to do with the Googling of inappropriate material. Without going into detail, it's actually a legal matter I am caught up in, so I would really appreciate your responses!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aliyah</p>

                    I'm having a problem when I try to play Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection on my hp laptop.&nbsp; When I click play it says to insert disc one and then restart the application, but I've already inserted disc one, and it is clearly what I've been using to load
 up the menu.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling it, and reinstalling it and it is still giving me the same thing.&nbsp; Is this a problem with the software, hardware, or user error?&nbsp;

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>It's possible that Zoo Tycoon 2 may not be compatible with Windows 7, since the website only lists it as compatible with Windows XP and Windows Vista.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Frequent Wacom Drivers crash after  2017 Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Occasionally (usually when I turn my Cintiq 22HD off and back on), my wacom drivers will crash and I will lose pen pressure in programs like Photoshop. If I try to open "Wacom Tablet Properties" it will give me a message saying the driver is not found. Restarting
 "Wacom Professional Service" and Photoshop will sometimes fix the issue. It should be noted that I turn off "Use Windows Ink" and use
<a href="https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1501276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this fix</a> to force Photoshop to use Wintab instead of Windows Ink because Windows Ink introduces latency into the tablet input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was never an issue before the Fall Creators Update, the drivers rarely crashed. I am on the latest wacom drivers. Did the fall creators update change some timeout values for tablet drivers or something?</p>

<p>Hi Saimon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recently updated from one version of Windows to another, it's possible that the current driver is for the previous version of Windows. It's one of the possible reasons why you're getting the error. Meanwhile, we suggest uninstalling and reinstalling
 the tablet drivers to troubleshoot the issue. Kindly refer to these steps: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Find the tablet drivers under <strong>Human Interface Devices</strong>, right-click on it and click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Unplug the tablet from your computer.</li><li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Programs </strong>&gt; <strong>Uninstall a program</strong>. Look for the program that's related to the tablet, then uninstall it.
</li><li>Reinstall the latest tablet drivers from the device manufacturer's website.</li><li>Replug the tablet.</li><li>In <strong>Windows Services</strong>, restart<strong> "Wacom Professional Service"</strong> again.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the result. </p>

<h2>            win 10 people app email address error</h2>
                    <p>When I enter email addresses in the WIN 10 People app, the address appears to be correct. When I use the address to send a message with the Mail app, the first name of the person is appended to the email address, resulting in a mail fail. Any others? Any
 ideas?</p>
<p>example using person named Blue Socks who's address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Sending a message using the address in the People app, which shows as the correct address</p>
<p>Gmail sends a fail message:</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** account doesn't exist.</p>

<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is in the sent address</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There was a major change, and I should have noted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started&nbsp;using the Win 10 Mail app for my Hotmail, Gmail and webmail accounts about January of this year. The application was losing emails (or deleting emails I don't know which. I asked for help on this forum and was never able to get resolution).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting about July,&nbsp;I use the Win 10 mail app for my Webmail only. This has resolved the issue of missing mail messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Edge for Hotmail access (Outlook.com) as well as Gmail access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had any issues with the People app until last week. I believe I have previously &nbsp;added addresses&nbsp;using&nbsp;the People app, but cannot be certain. i.e. I cannot confirm that the app has ever worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Brian</p>

    <title>Error Code After Recent Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error Code After Recent Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi, after finally downloading the recent Windows 10 update I noticed I got this error code below whenever I unlocked my laptop. It would appear multiple times and I would get another error code when I opened up Origin, the only app that now has an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>\/ ERROR \/</p>
<p>
</p><p>cnext.exe - Bad Image</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\MSVCP120.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status
 0xc000012f.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled then reinstalled Origin and tried opening the Sims 4. It gave me the same error notice but instead of cnext.exe it said TS4_x64.exe.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is a problem with the game or something else, any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Yes, make sure you have the latest VCC+, restart PC and then try installing the program again.  If it's installed presently, uninstall it in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features and restart the PC again before reinstalling the game from the latest download.

            How to Resolve Problems Installing the Visual C++ Redistributable
<br />
<br />The Visual C++ Redistributable is a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file required by programs or games built using Microsoft’s Visual Studio software development environment. When a program requires a DLL or some other supporting file to run, this is called a dependency. The MSVCR.DLL stands for:
<br />
<br />MS – Microsoft
<br />V – Visual
<br />C – C++
<br />R – Redistributable.
<br />
<br />Browsing your Apps and Features Setting or Programs and Features Control Panel, you might see multiple versions of the redistributable installed. A particular app installed might be utilizing one of them, so, removing any version can cause an application to malfunction. Some apps might even require updated versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable such as 2010 SP1 or 2012 Update 4.
<br />
<br />A DLL helps app creators efficiently reuse common components that make a program work. Instead of reinventing the wheel and bloating their code each time, developers can reuse the libraries in the MSVCR.dll. This in return can reduce the size of a program and provide better performance and memory utilization. Some applications are written using specific versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable. If your computer does not have the full Visual C++ development program installed (which you likely won’t unless you are a software developer), a program will come with what is called a Runtime Component to facilitate that particular program. The Runtime Components are just the essential pieces of code that make the software work.
<br />
<br />The error indicates that a particular version of the Visual C++ Redistributable required by the program you are attempting to install is either corrupt or missing. In this case, MSVCR110 represents the Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable. Other versions include:
<br />
<br />MSVCR71.dll, MSVCR08.dll, MSVCR09.dll (2008 – 2010)
<br />MSVCR120.dll (2012)
<br />MSVCR130.dll (2013)
<br />MSVCR140.dll (2015)
<br />
<br />you can download the version required by the application. The program will indicate the version of the file required if an error pops up during or when executing the app. Users should also be aware that some programs might require either the 32 or 64-bit architecture.
<br />
<br />Below are links to download the appropriate redistributable for the version you might be attempting to install:

            Lily, you said the problem began after a recent Windows Update.  These are causing a lot of problems which we can often fix by uninstalling the Update.  
<br />
<br />Can you find the Update that was installed just before the problem began at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and then uninstall any you find?  Then restart the PC to see if that fixed it. 
<br />
<br />You might also be able to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Once the Update(s) are rolled back, if they reinstall again and cause the same problem then uninstall or system restore again but this time block them using Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<h2>            Any way to put windows 10 Mobile on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2&#63;</h2>
                    I have an old Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, so I thought it would be a good idea to put Windows 10 Mobile on it, is there any way to obtain, and install it? Any advise would be good.

            Unfortunately, you cannot. You will have to purchase a device preinstalled with Windows 10 or Windows 10 Mobile.

<h2>            Slow Wifi Issue completely goes away once the Windows 10 Mobile Hotspot option has been enabled.</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been dealing with an issue on my new Dell laptop that I have not experienced previously. I have a lot of time invested in the setup of this laptop which is why my preference is not to send it back to Dell. I have a Dell Inspiron 7000. I have exhausted
 all of the typical resolution methods with drivers and upon almost giving up, I accidentally discovered that 100% my slow WI-fi issue on all wifi connections 100% goes away the moment I enable the Mobile Hotspot option in Windows 10. Just to be clear, this
 issue with the wifi is on all networks. I average about 1.5 mbs or less no matter what my proximity is to the wi-fi radio. The moment I enable the hotspot setting, i jump to 20 to 100mbs depending on how strong my signal is.
</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I recommend you check your download speeds</p>
<p>I recommend this troubleshooting guide: https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/slow-performance-solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if it's a disc it needs to install the software and many times you need an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps</p>
