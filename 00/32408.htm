<h2>            Does mail app actually download mail to your computer&#63;</h2>
                    Specifically, does the mail app download all the mail to my harddrive? I do not want the mail housed on my computer as I have a small solid state drive. I haven't used outlook in many years because of the way it downloaded the mail to the computer.

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Are you referring to the files in the Mail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, the attachments or files which comes in the mail are downloaded to the Hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mails are not downloaded to the hard drive, it stores in the email service providers server. There are three basic types of incoming mail account: POP, IMAP, and Exchange. With a POP account, mail is downloaded from the server to the mail reader (such as
 Mail) and then usually deleted from the server. With IMAP and Exchange, the mail stays on the server indefinitely and is synchronized with all mail clients that access the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks Anil,</p>
<p>I am confused by "If yes, the attachments or files which comes in the mail are downloaded to the Hard drive."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The paragraph below that seems to contradict the above sentence. I use yahoo and gmail. I guess I should restate it another way. Does the mail app work like gmail and yahoo in the sense that it does not download all the mail to your hard drive? I understand
 if a mail with an attachment is selected and opened the file attached would be downloaded or saved if desired. My main concern is I don't want all my mail downloaded to my hard drive as I have a small solid state drive. I hope this makes sense and thanks for
 your assistance.</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 &#40;Home Edition&#41; Boot up Yellow Screen</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 (Home). The screen intially booted up a Bright Yellow with graphic flowers on lower right side, it then appear to have the microsoft logo in the center, and eventually continued on to the regular desktop screen I have with blue. Today
 9/20 is the first time I have even seen this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas about what caused it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside: &nbsp;I am thinking it has to do with Window 10 trying to creep in but I do not know. I can not switch to Windows 10 because my other software will not run on Windows 10. It's too expensive to keep switching operating systems when using the computer
 with software that becomes obsolete with the new OS.</p>

            Bert Lightwing - You are so funny and I agree. Windows 7 does everything I want and it works fine with the software I use. Why would I change? So MicroSoft figures out ways to make one have to change. I bet a lot of people don't realize you have to pay
 after 3 months. I certainly did not know that. How did you find out?

            <p><strong>1. Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to your computer?</strong></p>
<p>None that I know of. I scanned for viruses and none were found. Also cleaned up with Spy Detective (free version)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Does the yellow screen show any text when you say, "Bright Yellow with graphic flowers"?</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;yellow&nbsp;screen did not happen with 2 boot ups after the time I saw it. The flowers were&nbsp;part of the Microsoft Boot up screen.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>3. What is the make and model of your computer?</strong></p>
<p>Systemax. Never had any issues with it. I think the problem, whatever it was has fixed it's self.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi<strong> Peachesandolivia,</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
As the error message clearly indicates, setting association for the file extension in control panel should fix this problem.<br />
If a program does not show up in the list, you can make the program a default by using Set Associations.<br />
1. Open Default Programs by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Default Programs.
<br />
2. Click Associate a file type or protocol with a program.<br />
3. Click the file type or protocol that you want the program to act as the default for.<br />
4. Click Change program.<br />
5. Click the program that you want to use as the default for the file type you selected, or click the arrow next to Other Programs to show additional programs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
If that does not fix the issue then I would suggset you to contact Windows Live mail community for more support.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>if you are using Windows live mail then the issue you posted is related to Windows Live and would be better suited in the Windows Live community. Please visit the link below to find a community that will offer the best support.<br />

<h2>            Suspend mode problems&#58; won&#39;t wake up from sleep</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!<br />
<br />
I just installed Windows 7 to my&nbsp;HTPC. Media Center is great!<br />
But I have a problem. When I put my computer to sleep it won't wake up anymore. Actually it doesn't even sleep properly. It seems like everything else is shut down but the graphics card. There's no picture but the fan is screaming.&nbsp;It doesn't respond to&nbsp;keyboard
 or mouse buttons. Even computer power button doesn't make it&nbsp;wake up or restart. All I can do is&nbsp;hold the power button down for a while so that the computer shuts down.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;a wireless Logitech set with PS/2 plugs. I have double checked all the power management
 settings already. In BIOS all ACPI supports and PS/2 wake up supports are enabled. I can't figure out how to repair it!<br />
<br />
For a while ago I tested Ubuntu 9.10 and had similar problems there. In Windows XP sleeping is working fine, though.<br />
<br />
My configureation includes:<br />
AMD Athlon 3200+<br />
Asus A8V-XE motherboard<br />
2GB Kingston DDR<br />
GF 8600 GT 256MB<br />
Seagate Barracuda 250GB SATA(for OS)<br />
WD Caviar 750GB SATA (for data)</p>

            Now I found that it's USB controller that refuses to go to sleep. There's a hidden feature in Windows 7 that you can use to find out problems in energy saving modes.
<div><br />
<div>In command prompt give a command:</div>
<div><br />
<div>powercfg -energy</div>
<div><br />
<div>and it will generate a report about problems in your system. The report can be found at /Windows/System32/energy-report.html</div>
<div><br />
<div>My report revealed that there's couple of USB hosts which cannot be suspended correctly. After disabling USB support in BIOS the system had no problems in sleeping. Of course I can't use USB devices anymore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there some kind of fix or tweak for Windows 7 USB drivers? Windows states that it has the latest drivers already if I try to update them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My motherboard is Asus A8V-XE and it has Via K8T890 chipset.</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT:</div>
<div><br />
<div>I found an answer on this thread:&nbsp;http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/8059106b-21e2-4d17-bf2f-513a5b5d1d0b/</div>
<div><br />
<div>Apparently it wasn't a USB host that wasn't able to sleep but a USB device. I had a USB memorystick and IR receiver plugged in and after removing them sleeping works fine.</div>

<h2>            Vista 32bit only using 1GB of RAM &#40;physical memory&#41; out of 4GB intalled</h2>
                    <p>Hello and thank you before hand for your valuable intel.</p>
<p>I recently upgrated my RAM from 1GB to 4GB. However, my PC is still "stuck" using no more than 1GB.</p>
<p>Im aware about Vista's 32bit's limitation on using no more than 3 or 3.5 of ram (without major alterations/modifications).</p>
<p>I have tryed many things such as intalling the most current updates and running system diagnost to be sure my PC isnt missing any valuable factor.</p>
<p>Moreover, I did double check before buying the ram that it was compatible with my PC and in fact it is, hence under Boot setup/content menue it shows</p>
<p>how much ram is installed and available to use (4BG).</p>
<p>Additionally, I did some research and found out about BCDedit. I ran, bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVa 3072, but it didnt worked.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all I want is to know how may i configure my vista to use more than 1GB of physical memory, ideally 3GB.</p>
<p>Here is my system's info:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Vista Home Premium</p>
<p>Service Pack 2</p>
<p>Dell, Inspiron 1525</p>
<p>Intel Pentium Dual CPU T2330 @1.60GHz 1.60GHz</p>
<p>Memory (RAM) 4.00GB</p>
<p>32-bit Op syst. </p>

<p>This is not a Vista limitation.&nbsp; It was just as true of Windows 2000 and XP.&nbsp; It is not a Windows issue, it is just the way your computer's BIOS&nbsp;works.&nbsp; Computers running 32bit Windows have reserved memory addresses for use by the computer's hardware, especially
 the video card.&nbsp; This means that your comptuter is using all 4GB of ram but the portion available to the user is 4GB minus the ram allocated by the BIOS for the computer's hardware.&nbsp; It is just as true whether you are running XP, Vista, or Windows 7.</p>
<p>You need to address this in the Vista Hardware and Drivers forum.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware?tab=all">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware?tab=all</a></p>
<p>It is not a software problem.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Connection limited Windows 8.1</h2>
                    When I try to connect to WiFi through my windows 8.1 laptop, the section displaying the available ones shows that my WiFi is limited. However, I have an iPod and a desktop and both can connect to this readily. This is the second time it has happened and
 I wondered if there were any permanent resolutions to the problem. The first time it just stopped but as it came back again, I require a more long term solution.
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>My solution did't solve the problem. <span><span>After I used the new profile for one day, the problem reappeared.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>I did not do anything unusual, just installed Messenger, Twitter and Telegram from Store.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>UPD: </span></span><span><span>I found the cause of this problem</span></span>.&nbsp;<span><span>Indexing stops working correctly when
</span></span>I change location of Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos folders to other folders in disk D. And after that I cannot repair index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPD2:&nbsp;<span><span>This was an incorrect assumption</span></span>.&nbsp;<span><span>I left the default folders.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>After creating a new profile, indexing worked and found new applications (Messenger, Twitter, Telegram (from Store) and WhatsApp
 (from official website)). </span></span><span><span>But after half an hour after installing new applications, indexing stopped working.</span>
<span>It stopped finding applications that I installed now.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>UPD3: I enabled "Let apps run in background" option and search started to work again. Hmm, dear Microsoft, is this bug or feature ?</span></span></p>

<p>Same problem here. Got this problem on my old windows system, too. After buying a new laptop with a clean windows install, search worked perfectly. After installing some application, search stop working at some point. I also get the "Incorrect permission"
 error.</p>
<p>Is it possible, that the Ubuntu subsystem for windows caused this problem? Perhaps it changes some file and folder permissions!?</p>

<p>My girlfriend has purchased a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 6000 v3.0 for her computer, running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. &nbsp;Her keyboard will occasionally stop working and no keys will work at all. &nbsp;Sometimes it will randomly start working again, other times
 she has to remove the USB transceiver.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what's happening, why its happening, and what the solution - if any exist - is?</p>

Sounds like there is a hardware issue :<br />
<br />
Be sure the batteries are fresh and the USB is connected properly, maybe try another USB port.<br />

<h2>            May Windows 10 Update - now Win won&#39;t load</h2>
                    <p>The wife's Dell Inspiron 660s PC, got offered a Win 10 update yesterday, which she scheduled to run after bedtime.&nbsp; This morning, it seems like it wants to complete the update after about two dozen reboots (most manual, trying to move it along), got the
 blue screens (This might take several minutes, These updates help protect you in an online world, Leave everything to us, Making sure your apps are good to go, Almost there).&nbsp; Then the following window, over a black screen (with what appears to be a Windows
 toolbar at the bottom, but nothing works):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de1e10aa-d766-4bda-939c-53516d33e187?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de1e10aa-d766-4bda-939c-53516d33e187?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The black screen has a Recycle Bin in the upper left (hover help but no response to click), and a toolbar at the bottom:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa46143e-29a0-4144-acb7-5ceebb8f6732?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa46143e-29a0-4144-acb7-5ceebb8f6732?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>I can get to the screen where I am offered an earlier version (which reboots to the same screen) or two previous versions of Windows 10 (one just reboots to the same screen, the other gets to the error desktop shown).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also get to the CMD prompt, which shows me I only have an X drive, and a barebones Windows installation (no user files, nothing from the previous installation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss.&nbsp; What other info is needed, or what is next?<br />

            Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account. 
<br />
<br />If this does not work, I recommend you rollback...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

                    What is the differnce between XP and Windows 7 that I cannot connect my Panasonic PV-GS83&nbsp; and yet MS is not supporting XP drivers for devices that exist and still are in use?&nbsp; I realize this is an excellant business model&nbsp; that MS uses but this is the
 first time I have been impacted by it.

            <p>I certainly do not know if your camera is compatible with <br />
Windows 7...actually the following site&nbsp;says it is not.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Panasonic+PV-GS83+32x+Camcorder&amp;v=Panasonic&amp;uid=PV-GS83&amp;pf=1&amp;pi=6&amp;c=Cameras+%26+Photo&amp;sc=Camcorders&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Panasonic PV-GS83 32x Camcorder</a><br />
<br />
However...I'm wondering why you cannot connect the <br />
camera to your PC...the specs of the camera state that <br />
it has a FireWire IEEE1394 interface...do you have that<br />
port on your PC?<br />

    <title>Access Denied openning Bluetooth Serial Port - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kor-astro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Denied openning Bluetooth Serial Port</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I am trying to connect to an Iogear GBS301 Bluetooth serial port from a built-in BT device in a Dell Inspiron 15R. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can pair the BT serial port successfully, but when I try to connect to the port, I get an error. &nbsp;In this test, I am using Parallax Serial Terminal v1.2.4 available from &lt;http://www.parallax.com/ProductInfo/Microcontrollers/PropellerGeneralInformation/PropellerMediaPage/tabid/832/Default.aspx&gt;
 and I get a pop-up containing:</p>
<p>"Could not open port COM4. &nbsp;Access Denied. &nbsp;This port may already be in use by another device."</p>
<p>when I connect to COM4, which is the BT SPP slave vitural port.</p>
<p>I don't know of any other process that may be using COM4. &nbsp;I have used SysInternals Process Explorer and handle.exe to search for "COM4", "device", and "serial"&nbsp; (as I think COM4 will be listed as "\device\serial04") and have found nothing. &nbsp;I don't know
 how else to find out what process may be using COM4.</p>
<p>I have also tried the suggestion from &lt;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/bluetooth-spp-com-port-access-is-denied-when-try/ebce8ad7-5a0f-4378-b576-dd75cbdb9f7b?tab=MoreHelp&amp;auth=1&gt; but I can only pair with the BT serial port
 is the service is started as "Local Service", so the solution suggested does not seem to be applicable to my problem.</p>
<p>I have reviewed &lt;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-networking/error-message-access-denied-in-dun-with-bluetooth/cc51a8f8-b69d-458e-8873-8d838ceb0b90?auth=1&gt;, but it seems to be for WinXP and I'm not sure how to try it on a Win7
 system.</p>
<p>I have tried moving the virtual com port to COM3 and get the same result.</p>
<p>I have tried running the serial terminal as Administrator and get the same result.</p>
<p>Under Device Manager -&gt; Port (COM &amp; LPT) -&gt; COM4 -&gt; Port Settings -&gt;Advanced -&gt;COM Port Number, the port _is_ listed as "in use".</p>
<p>So, has anyone ever got a Bluetooth serial port to work under Win7? &nbsp;Is so, how? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can try next?</p>
<p>Thanks - Shane</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;Results are as follows:</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Still get "Access Denied ... already in use" when trying to open COM4.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Handle.exe and Process Explorer still do not list COM4, or \device\serial04.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm not really sure what this was supposed to accomplish.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp; The com ports were not hidden to begin with. &nbsp;I don't want to delete COM4, I want to use it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am familiar with this link and the setup process for Bluetooth. &nbsp;I have already successfully paired the BT serial port--I just get the "Access Denied ... Already in Use" error, mentioned in my original post,&nbsp; when trying to open the associated virtual
 com port, COM4.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 4:</p>
<p>&nbsp; My virtual com port "COM4" is already listed correctly: "COM4 - Outgoing - KOR_2_SPP slave" &nbsp;(KOR_2 is the name of the Bluetooth serial port.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>What I am trying to do is to use a HyperTerminal type program (since HyperTerminal doesn't seem to be part of Win7) to open the Bluetooth serial port (COM4) and connect to a serial remote system. &nbsp;I have been using this setup under WinXP for about 3 years
 and am trying to get it to work with a new notebook computer running Win7.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help on identifying what process is already using COM4 (I certainly did not start one!) would be helpful. &nbsp;Any information on what someone else has done to make this work would also be helpful.</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Paid for 2 day &#38;quot&#59;expidited&#38;quot&#59; repair of my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paid for 2 day &#38;quot&#59;expidited&#38;quot&#59; repair of my console, got UPS ground, told it would take 18 DAYS to fix.</h2>
                    
<p>My XBOX died after less then 20 HOUR's of use, it would turn on but no audio or video and the remote would never sync.&nbsp; Unplugging it for extended times didn't do anything, same results.&nbsp; I contacted support and they said the console was dead and under warranty
 so sent it in.&nbsp; I also paid for the expedited service and shipping.</p>

<p>So I send the box in, they fix it and ship it back.&nbsp; I get the shipment notification but then 4 days later I still didn't have the xbox.&nbsp; So I checked the tracking number and it's still in transit with UPS Ground shipping.&nbsp; The whole reason I paid for the
 expedited service was so I would get it back...not wait a week while it's on a truck.</p>

<p>I called up the billing support people so I could get a credit on my account for the expedited service that I didn't get.&nbsp; The "level 1" billing person I got said he would have to forward me over to "level 2" hardware support.&nbsp; So after a few minutes on
 hold I got transferred.&nbsp; I explained my issue to the "Level 2" hardware support person and told him since the unit already shipped that I wanted to get credited for the fees I paid for expedited shipping.&nbsp; I was put back on hold and after 5 or 6 minutes he
 came back and said that the "Level 3" hardware tech support would be able to credit my account and that he couldn't.&nbsp; He then told me that the wait time for "Level 3" support is
<strong>EIGHTEEN DAYS!</strong>&nbsp; I asked him to repeat the time twice, both times he said 18 days.&nbsp; I told him thats ridiculous....why should I have to wait 18 days for someone to call me back and fix a problem that they caused.&nbsp; HE simply told me again there
 was nothing he could do and I had to wait 18 days to get a call back and have this issue resolved.</p>

<p>Is this normal?&nbsp; It's there mistake so I don't understand why they can't just click some buttons and issue my credit card a credit.&nbsp; How does anything get resolved when it takes almost three weeks to fix?&nbsp; Is there someone else I can contact or another phone
 number that has competent workers that can just fix my problem?</p>

<p>Spectacular. &nbsp;I'm going through the same thing. &nbsp;It clearly says that "expedited shipping" cost covers "to and from our service center". Mine is also coming back Ground. Keep in mind it's coming back from Mexico, but that is their decision not mine. I sent
 it to Texas (which if google it, is a UPS facility not Microsoft). Then they started saying that the fee is to expedite the whole repair. &nbsp;No, no, the repair website is very clear and a "reasonable persons" interpretation would be that I should receive something
 faster than UPSs slowest (ground) service. </p>
<p>There is deception all over the place here. &nbsp;It doesn't feel legal. </p>

<p>The system was very recently changed. That might be what part of the issue is being caused by.</p>
<p>Also, purchasing and billing support will be zero help because hardware is its own mini department. You have a separate hardware account from your Live account, even if they are linked.</p>
<p>It might be taking so long to get back to you because they may not have had enough people assigned to tier 3 support for hardware and more people are being effected...</p>

<p>I finally got a supervisor on the phone, and was transferred to the hardware department where I was told to "immediately ask for a supervisor". &nbsp;I did, and after being on the phone for just over an hour, I got my $10 expedited shipping refunded (though I'd
 rather have the console back sooner as promised). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn't take a genius to figure out it cost Microsoft way more than $10 in support costs than if they had just seen how ridiculous they were being days ago and refunded me immediately.</p>
<p>I'm planning a blog post about "Microsoft's dirty little secret" about their "repair center", and being in cahoots with UPS. whose tracking into is curiously sparse while it is out of the country. &nbsp;I'm guessing MS pays for this special "service" to hide
 the fact that they ship the gear to Mexico. &nbsp;Wouldn't be right for PR.</p>

<p>Hi Charleston Cav,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
•&nbsp;When did the issue start?</p>
<p>After you wake the computer from sleep, the DHCP Client service (Dhcpcsvc.dll) is responsible for informing the IP stack about the routing information. The routing information is stored in the network store interface. This problem occurs when the network
 store interface already has the routing information that the DHCP Client service wants to store. When the storage operation fails, all routing information in NSI is lost. Therefore, the computer loses all the routing information. This includes the default
 gateway.<br />
<br />
<strong>A)</strong> You may also try this:<br />
1. Click Start, right click Computer and choose Properties. <br />
2. Click Device Manager.<br />
3. Navigate to your network adapter, right click it and choose Properties. <br />
4. Choose Power Management tab. <br />
5. Uncheck “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.”<br />
6. Restart the computer and test this issue again. <br />
<br />
<strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;Use Device Manager to verify that your network adapter is working correctly and reinstall the drivers:<br />
You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. <br />
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand the Network Adapters section, right-click your adapter and then uninstall it<br />
iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer, let&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;detect the driver and install by itself.<br />
If that does not help, install the latest version of the driver from the manufacturer's website.<br />
<br />
Check the link <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/b3c6477e-1111-4b9f-a52a-fffdc51e9c901033.mspx#E6F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Just Downloaded Game. Does Not Show Up At ALL. What Is Going ON&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I bought Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition in the Spring Sale an hour ago. I got the last chapter of the Walking Dead as well and downloaded both. The Waling Dead works fine. SSFAE on the other hand will not work. It does not show up at all in My Games,
 or Recent. It only shows up under my Download History and on my storage device. If I try to go to the game on the marketplace, it tells me to buy it. It's like the xbox is refusing tobelieve that I paid for this game.</p>
<p>I have a 4gig slim, with a 16gb flash drive that the game was originally downloaded to. I've deleted and reinstalled 5 times. Nothing. I switched the drive it was on. Nothing. I have looked EVERYWHERE for a solution and can't find any other 360 player who
 has gone through this. This has never happened to me before and it's really upsetting. There is NOTHING to help figure this out at all.
</p>
<p>All I want to do is play a game I paid for. What is going on here? </p>

<p>SSFAE itself is not a part of the spring sale. There are add-ons for the game that are available in the sale. It sounds like you purchased one of the add-ons. Those do not show in My Games since they are not full games.</p>

<p>Your confusion likely stems from the fact that the Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition DLC that was advertised in the spring sale is just that, DLC. It is not the full game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SSF4AE was made available in two versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a full version of SSF4AE that is available on disc and on GoD. </li><li>There is a DLC version of SSF4AE that is an ADD-ON to Super Street Fighter 4.&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The add-on DLC was originally released so that players who owned SSF4 could just purchase the DLC to upgrade their copy of the game to SSF4AE instead of purchasing a whole new copy of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the holiday season, the full GoD version of SSF4AE was on sale. For the spring sale, just the upgrade DLC for SSF4 -&gt; AE is on sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like you purchased the DLC. As such, you will need to own a copy of Super Street Fighter 4 in order to use the DLC.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade stalled at 93&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickdare  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade stalled at 93&#37;</h2>
                    My wife finally was allowed to do the Windows 10 installation on her laptop yesterday. It has been stalled at 93% (updating drivers, 75% completed) for over nine hours now. There is no motion on the screen (the spinning circle has stopped), so I do not
 know if it is dead or what. Please advise as to what to do. Is this a regular occurrence? I didn't have any issues with my desktop or laptop upgrades. We didn't do anything out of the ordinary on this install. It was an automated direct download from Microsoft.
 She is quite panicky and will be very upset if she thinks that Microsoft has killed her laptop, as will I.

<p>I am sorry but this is completely useless. I turned off the laptop, let it be off for 30 minutes, and when I turned it back on it tried to resume the installation. Referring me to a solution for someone who did not have the same problem as me is not a solution
 to MY problem. At this point, I don't even know how to make the laptop stop trying. It's been stuck for TWO DAYS. The screen says "Updating Windows - 93%" and "Copying Files - Installing features and drivers - Configuring settings 75%". It is a Toshiba A665
 that was previously running Windows 7. If nothing else, I need to know how to stop the update so I can attempt one of these fixes. If Microsoft has turned this laptop into a useless paperweight I may never buy another Microsoft product ever again.</p>

            It has been three days since I posted my reply to the response I got from Microsoft. I have not heard from anyone. It has now been SIX days since the laptop (a Toshiba Satellite A665 running Windows 7) started the upgrade to Windows 10, and FIVE days that
 it has been frozen at 93% complete at the copying drivers stage. I have tried turning the computer off and waiting and then rebooting, but the computer returns to the upgrade at the frozen stage. I created a flash drive USB upgrade tool as several instructions
 have said to do, but the computer does not know it is there. At this point all I want to be able to do is get the computer to abandon the upgrade so I can return to Windows 7 (which worked). Can ANYONE tell me what to do? I cannot afford to buy a new laptop
 if this one is ruined because Microsoft couldn't be bothered to tell us about incompatible drivers potentially causing the upgrade to fail.

    <title>How to reset file explorer window size to default in windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to reset file explorer window size to default in windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
Yesterday I connected my laptop to my TV using HDMI cable. I changed the display option to "Second screen only". While doing this I had File Explorer window opened. The size of file explorer got automatically shrunk. Resolution of my laptop is 1366x768 and
 resolution of my TV is 1920x1080. When I changed display option to "PC screen only", window size remained shrunk. How can I restore file explorer size to default (whatever it was previously when windows was installed)? Do I have to change some key in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local
 Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags\AllFolders"?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jyotesh<br />

<p>If you set it as the default for a program it says its done it but the association never gets created. Should'nt it provide a warning saying 'A file cannot be associated with this program unless it has admin priveledges'</p>
<p>I tried a few times to get Foxit PDF reader to be default till I realised what was gong on and I was a bit annoyed by then!</p>
<p>Is there a way to have a program be the default without giving it admin&nbsp;priveledge?</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi FruitBatInShades,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If a program does not have any administer privileges set as default then user can access it without any administer
 privileges.</span></span></p>

<ol>
<li><span><span>Click Start. From settings open the Control Panel. Switch to classic view.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Click on the
<strong>Default Programs</strong> icon.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Click on the
<strong>Associate a file type or protocol with a program</strong> link.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Click on the file extension type you want to change the association for what .exe program opens it.<br />
</span><span>NOTE:</span><span>
<em>It may take a moment to load up.</em></span></span> </li><li><span><span>Click on the
<strong>Change Program</strong> button.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>If listed, select the program you want to be associated with (opens) the file extension.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>A.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Check the
<strong>Always use the selected program to open this kind of program</strong> box and click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>If the program is not listed, then click the
<strong>Browse</strong> button and navigate to the <strong>.exe</strong> of the program you want as the default to open the file extension.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>A.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select the program.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>B.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on the
<strong>Open</strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>C.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hey Marco</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to post this on the Xbox Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated in the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/windows-10-xbox-beta-app-faq/1efde579-21ff-4247-ba4c-07444a04b36b">
Windows 10 Xbox (Beta) App FAQ</a>, due to the state the app is currently in, certain features are not currently working as they should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you take a look at the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/troubleshoot-games-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
