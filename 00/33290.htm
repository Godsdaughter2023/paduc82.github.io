<h2>            Windows 7 Laserjet 4050 parallel to USB setup</h2>
                    <p><strong>All,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I have an old Laserjet 4050N I'm trying to get to work on a Dell without a parallel port. Original problem was it would print locally, but not during a remote desktop session as a redirected printer. I figured it was a driver mismatch issue between
 the desktop and remote server, so I removed the printer from the workstation, and reinstalled it, and installed the same driers on the server. Now it will not even print locally.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We don't have any other parallel-to-usb connected printers, so I haven't seen it a lot. While installed the printer I selected the virtual USB001 port. I've tried the specific 4050 driver and the Universal and had the same result - any print job
 just sits in the queue, and the printer object has an error icon on it.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can anyone provide some guidance here?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>

            It is more likely to be the USB to parallel adapter than anything, we never found them particularly reliable. If you can I would suggest that you replace that with a parallel print server and put the printer on the LAN. HPs of that era were absolutely
 rock solid (far better than now) so worth the effort.

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply. I actually got local printing going. I had tried to let Windows PNP find it, and I had turned the printer on and off, but that wasn't enough. With the printer powered on I unplugged/replugged the usb. Windows then found it and set
 it up correctly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now I'm back to the original problem that being, printing to the redirected printer during a remote desktop session doesn't work. I see the printer, and can send a print job to it, but the printer then sits in infinite "Processing Job" state. I found a
 64-bit driver for the 4050, which I tried adding in the server Print Management console, but it errors out every time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That's as far as I got. I know I'm on the right track (driver mismatch between server and WS). I just need to research the driver install eorror a bit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again.</div>
        </p>

    <title>Chicony Camera Assistant Software with Toshiba Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Chicony Camera Assistant Software with Toshiba Laptop</h2>
                    I'm having a problem with my built in webcam on Toshiba Satellite A300. I have Windows 7 and just downloaded latest Win 7 driver for Chicony Camera Assistant Software from toshiba.ca. Camera software will still not allow me to open camera - keeps saying
 "Webcam is either disabled or has failed. Please check your webcam settings" Camera is not listed in Device Manager.<br />
<br />
This software package contains the latest drivers built in for XP, Vista and now Windows 7, plus a file called traybar.exe which is supposed to run in the Taskbar to control various setting for the webcam.<br />
<br />
After downloading the software, installing and re-booting I just cannot get the Camera software to open.<br />
<br />
My webcam is not listed in Device Manager under Imaging - I know it's a Chicony camera built into my laptop.<br />
<br />
The message I keep getting "Webcam is either disabled or has failed. Please check your webcam settings" is as far as I can get.<br />
<br />
I've tried double clicking traybar.exe and get the same error message as above.<br />
<br />
Because the webcam is not showing up in Device Manager I can't update the drivers any other way nor have I been able to find any solutions from the Windows Troubleshooter.<br />
<br />

            In Control Panel, Programs &amp; Features, Uninstall Programs, look for the camera software and uninstall the software if it is listed.&nbsp; From Device Manager, it should be listed under Imaging Devices, if it is, uninstall it and&nbsp;reboot the notebook.&nbsp; After
 the Restart, if Windows re-finds the camera, do NOT let it install drivers. &nbsp;Go to the Toshiba website (csd.toshiba.com).&nbsp; Click on Download.&nbsp; Select your model as the P500-ST6822.&nbsp; Select Windows 7 (either 32 or 64 bit) as your operating system and then Camera
 as the device.&nbsp; Download and install the driver package.

            Hi Cari,<br />
<br />
My Toshiba laptop is a Satellite A300-06H (Model No. PSAGCC-06H019 - Canadian model) I have been to the toshiba.ca website and have downloaded the latest Win 7 Chicony drivers for my exact laptop model. I have tried un-installing/re-booting/re-installing these
 drivers several times with no success.<br />
<br />
My webcam is NOT listed at all in Device Manager so I'm not able to delete it.<br />
<br />
Anyway I tried your suggestion as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Un-installed camera software.<br />
<br />
2)Camera is NOT listed in Device Manager<br />
<br />
3) Rebooted laptop.<br />
<br />
4)Windows did not find the camera.<br />
<br />
5)Went to csd.toshiba.com and downloaded software for model P500-ST6822 (even though my model is A300 as above)<br />
<br />
6)Double clicked on downloaded .exe file which just refused to install anything.<br />
<br />
I'm quite sure I had the latest and correct Win 7 64 bit drivers from the toshiba.ca website but the camera just will not appear in Device Manager under Imaging Devices and I just can't get the camera to open.

<p>Stating the obvious which appears not to have been mentioned; have you checked that it is set to start when it firsts starts? Just check system configuration/Startup. If it is deselected there it will never start no matter what or how many times you re install.</p>

            Same problem with Toshiba Satellite A300, on win7 64.
<div>After nothing worked (reinstalling drivers, checking startup), I tried to open it and check if some cable got loose, as I was opening it several months ago to clean the fan. All cables are fine, so my last hope to find a solution alone vanished.</div>
<div>Also, I installed latest camera assistant software with drivers, but it seams as camera doesn't exist. I get note : Webcam is either disabled or has failed. Please check your webcam settings.</div>
<div>Camera doesn't appear on list of devices, and when I open Skype, it also shows as camera doesn't exist.</div>
<div>I used to use camera without problems for years (rarely, but without problems), and only now discovered it's not functioning anymore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any ideas, any&nbsp;tech&nbsp;guru to help?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, in startup it's checked that it runs, but there is no traybar cam software, that used to be there. Do you know how to enable this?</div>

<p>I was having the same problem after I upgraded to Windows 7 and this is what i did to solve my problem without downloading any new software. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you install the&nbsp;Chicony-Camera-Assistant-Software (the one that worked with the Vista OS). After installation if you try running it you will get an error message but don't worry
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftshb.i.lithium.com%2fi%2fsmilies%2f16x16_smiley-happy.gif" /></li><li>Launch <em>Device Manager</em>&nbsp;by right-clicking on the <em>Computer</em>&nbsp;icon on the desktop or the start menu and choose
<em>Manage</em>&nbsp;from the menu that pops up. This will launch the <em>Computer Management</em>&nbsp;application then choose
<em>Device Manager</em>&nbsp;from the left pane.</li><li>Click on the <em>Imaging Device</em>&nbsp;node from the middle pane to expand it and you will see
<em>USB Video Device</em>&nbsp;under it.</li><li>Right-click on <em>USB Video Device</em>&nbsp;and choose <em>&nbsp;Update Driver Software...</em>&nbsp;from the menu that pops up. This will start the driver update wizard.</li><li>Select the second option on the first page of this wizard: "<em>Browse my computer for driver software"</em>&nbsp;and this will lead you to the second page of the wizard.</li><li>This is where you point windows 7 to the driver that you will like to use for you camera. So you can now browse to where this driver is. The driver for the camera is in the installation folder of the&nbsp;Chicony-Camera-Assistant-Software:&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Camera
 Assistant Software for Toshiba\driver. In this driver folder you will find two sub-folders 32bit and 64 bit so choose the one that corresponds to the version of OS you are using. After selecting the appropriate folder your complete path to the driver may look
 like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Camera Assistant Software for Toshiba\driver\64bit</li><li>Simply click on the next button and window will install the right drivers for your camera.</li></ol>
<div>This worked for me and i hope it works for anybody with the same problem <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftshb.i.lithium.com%2fi%2fsmilies%2f16x16_smiley-happy.gif" /></div>

<p>I'll give you my standard process that I use on my clients' computers.&nbsp; It may be more than you asked for, however because it is a step by step complete procedure:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
The hard drive&nbsp;has failed.&nbsp; You will have to replace it.&nbsp; Replace with a 500 G or more rotating 7200rpm drive.&nbsp; 500G drives can be found for around $70.&nbsp; Typically quite easy to replace.&nbsp; Now you will need a complete Windows 7 install.</li><li>
I do this all the time.&nbsp; I have done hundreds.&nbsp; This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>
First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</li><li>
From this point onward, I am providing you with the process to install Windows 7.</li><li>
You&nbsp;<strong>may&nbsp;</strong>be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the failing&nbsp;hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC,
 copy the data off.&nbsp; You may need a friend to do this part for you, but the rest is not really very technical or difficult for most people.</li><li>
Install the new hard drive.</li><li>
Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>
If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>
Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>
If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>
Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>
Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers, unless you can not proceed further.</li><li>
When you get to the place where it asks you where to put the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions.</li><li>
When the installer asks about Windows update, choose Ask me later</li><li>
<strong>Do NOT install any program</strong></li><li>
Hopefully, you started with a Win7 install disk that was SP1 (Service Pack 1). If not, run Windows Update until you get to the point that SP1 has installed itself as part of this procedure.&nbsp; It entails multiple Windows Update passes and restarts&nbsp;which you keep
 updating until you get there.</li><li>
Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, install the following:</li><li>
<strong>KB3020369</strong>&nbsp;Win-7 32 &nbsp;<a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu</a></li><li>

Open Windows Update, change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>
<strong>Do not install anything else at this point – NOTHING.&nbsp; Not even an antivirus program</strong></li><li>
Start&nbsp;the update process.&nbsp; It is likely to include about 200. It will take some time.</li><li>
Install all offered security updates.&nbsp; Install .net, but do not install any updates that do not come pre-checked.&nbsp; Do not install any “Optional” updates.</li><li>
Once you have a list of updates, you need to prevent certain specific updates from being installed to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.</li><li>
Click once on each Windows Update that is NOT labeled SECURITY and check the date of issue on the right.&nbsp; If that date is after January 1, 2015, Right-click on it and hide.</li><li>
Click install updates and wait for it to finish.&nbsp; Restart when asked to do so.</li><li>
After re-start is complete and you see a desktop, start Task manager – Right-click on task bar. Look at the % at the bottom.&nbsp; Do NOT attempt to use the computer for any purpose until you see that % fall to and stay at 10% or less.&nbsp; Windows Update is still working
 and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>
Keep running Windows Update again and again till it offers no new ones.</li><li>
Start Internet Explorer, click the gear (upper right)&nbsp;in IE11 and select Compatibility settings and enter&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft.com</strong>&nbsp;in the list</li><li>
Start Windows Update and click the link to include updates for other Microsoft software.</li><li>
Run Windows Update again and again until you are satisfied you have all the updates you want.</li><li>
After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type&nbsp;<strong>device</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose Device manager
 from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; You should get drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have installed all of them or nearly. Do NOT
 use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install malware.</li><li>
Install your Microsoft Office software and then run Windows Update again and again till no more are proposed.</li><li>
Defragment your drive.&nbsp; Type&nbsp;<strong>defragment</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it once.&nbsp; Choose the Defragmentation link.&nbsp; Wait till
 it completes all passes..</li></ol>

    <title>Sending File History backups to the cloud for redundancy. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommyd17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending File History backups to the cloud for redundancy.</h2>
                    My plan is to use File History to back up files to an NAS on my network.&nbsp; In order to have some offsite redundancy, I was going to back up those files, on the NAS, to iDrive(cloud backup).<br />
<br />
I have a desktop hooked into that network and can let the iDrive app run on that computer, which I hardly ever use, and continue to use the laptop.<br />
<br />
My concern is trying to restore files from that cloud backup, if needed.&nbsp; As an example, say my house burns down and I lose the laptop and NAS.&nbsp; If I get a new laptop with Windows 10, am I going to be able to restore my files from that cloud backup?&nbsp; I'm sure
 I'd get a new NAS, so I could always restore the cloud backup to that NAS.&nbsp; But, I still wonder if I'm going to run into any problems with those backups.&nbsp; I've read a few problems people have had when trying to restore to a new computer.<br />
<br />
If this should be possible, can someone outline the correct procedure to do this?&nbsp; I've also read some things that make it sound like if you screw something up, when working with the backups, it's sort of easy to make them unusable.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<p>Hi Tommy,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Network-attached storage (NAS)</strong> is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer or network via
<strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong>. You could use a cloud storage to backup the files inside your NAS and you can restore your file from the cloud backup. To restore data using File history, kindly refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17128/windows-8-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>article</strong></a> under<strong> Restore files or folders using File History</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Steps for <strong>Windows 8.1 </strong>works on
<strong>Windows 10</strong>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just remember, you cannot directly restore your files from the data on the cloud. You will need to d<strong>ownload the files to your NAS</strong> first before you could restore your file. There is a minimal chance of encountering issues with this setup.
 Maybe if you incorrectly synced or uploaded your file to the cloud, you may encounter issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more concerns, feel free to post.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Unable to Boot, Stuck in an Error Code 0xc000000d Loop</h2>
                    Hi, my windows 8.1 laptop PC recently has run into a few problems that hopefully someone here will know more about than I do.<br />
<br />
The short description of my problem is that I got stuck in an automatic repair loop while booting up, then got stuck (and currently still) in an Error Code 0xc000000d loop. I'm looking for a solution that doesn't result in losing files/applications.
<br />
<br />
The long description is as follows:<br />
I started up my laptop this morning to find it stuck in an automatic repair loop where I would get the message under an Asus logo that its preparing the automatic repair, then diagnosing it, and finally telling me to restart. Of course restarting would just
 put it back into the loop, so I had to go to Advanced options. From here I tried:<br />
-Running DskChk in command prompt (found no errors).<br />
-Resetting to a previous restore point (got an error 0x80070005).<br />
-Using bcdedit to set recoveryenabled to no (automatic repair still started and bcdedit didn't show any change in recoverenabled)<br />
-Booting into safe mode using Startup Options (Couldn't get into safe mode, none of the options changed anything when it booted up)<br />
-Going into the bios to check the boot priority (The only option under this was windows boot manager. No HDD or anything)<br />
-Used Startup Repair (Ended in saying it could not fix the error)<br />
<br />
For a while I thought I might be able to fix this by changing the boot priority to the HDD, but like I said its not even listed there and I have no idea how to add it. Eventually I decided to try powering down while in command prompt instead of going back to
 previous menus after using bcdedit, and when I started up I was greeted with this instead of automatic repair:<br />
<br />
"Recovery<br />
<br />
Your PC needs to be repaired<br />
<br />
The operating system
 couldn't be loaded because a critical system driver is missing or contains errors.<br />
<br />
File: \WINDOWS\<br />
Error code: 0xc000000d<br />
<br />
Choose one of the options below to address this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Press Esc for recovery<br />
Press Enter to try again<br />
Press F8 for Startup Settings"<br />
<br />
And thus we are where I am at now. I've done everything I did before I started seeing this error only to meet the same results/errors. All of my searches on this error have only produced results for cases where the file is \BCD, which doesn't seem to be the
 same problem as mine. I was hoping to find some fix that would not end up wiping some applications/files (System Reset/System Refresh) but I cant seem to find any other way. The only solution I have yet to try is the boot priority in the bios, but I'm still
 not sure how to fix that and I'm not so sure if that is the problem anymore. I would try to reset to a previous system restore point in safe mode, but I cant seem to find a way to get into it. My laptop model/specs is:<br />
<br />
ASUS Laptop X550LB-NH52<br />
<br />
Intel Core i5 4200U (1.60GHz)<br />
8GB Memory 750GB HDD<br />
NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M<br />
Windows 8 64-bit (updated to 8.1)<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community and providing us with the detailed description about the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As per the description, I understand that you are experiencing issue with you are unable to boot the computer, got stuck in an error code: 0xc000000d loop.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>There is a possibility that this issue might have occurred either due to some
<strong>“hardware or software”</strong> that have gone bad in the system or “<strong>system files”</strong> might have gone corrupt.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate all your efforts in trying to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Since you have already tried so many troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Firstly, I would advise to remove all external devices except mouse and keyboard (if any) and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Normally, if you are unable to boot the Windows 8.1 to its Start Screen, the Automatic Repair will check for the errors which is preventing Windows from booting up and will
 fix it. If this does not happen, then when you may need to run the Automatic Repair by booting the computer to Windows 8.1 installation/recovery disc and then it will fix the issue if the issue with any startup files required for Windows 8.1 to boot up.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you do not have Windows 8.1 installation DVD, you may have to create one, boot the computer from it and then perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8.1. To create installation
 media, you may refer to the article given below:</span></span></p>

            Hi DJ-Thonydoutchbag, I'm Bill.
<br />
<br />The USB dongle that came with your keyboard is linked to only the keyboard it came with, so there's unfortunately no way to replace the dongle alone without purchasing a new keyboard.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend firstly plugging it into another PC to see if it works, which will tell us if it's a problem with the USB dongle/keyboard or a problem with the PC itself.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know how you go. Thanks!

            <p>Hey, LJH Unholy! The names for the DLC are a little different currently in the Manage Game section. What you will want to do is uninstall the game, and reinstall it again. After you do, go to Manage Game and install all of the content listed there. After that, you should have your content in-game, even if the name might not be the same.</p>
<p>Give that a shot and let us know how that works!</p>

<p>Thanks for the information. We've passed that on to the appropriate teams for further investigation. As of right now, it appears that you would have to purchase the&nbsp;<a href="https://store.xbox.com/Xbox-One/DLC/Fable-III-Dog-Breed-Set/4637e72f-e727-46b6-a0d3-f9601c44318f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fable III Dog Breed Set DLC</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://marketplace.xbox.com/Product/Fable-III-Traitors-Keep-Quest-Pack/9cd8f238-a93e-4ef1-bad2-758e66c328e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fable III Traitor's Keep Quest Pack DLC</a>&nbsp;in order to access the Yule Hat DLC. We aren't sure if this is by design or in need of correction so we have asked for further clarification and we'll update you when we have additional information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued patience. :)</p>

<p>I too am also having that problem. Miss Bijoux &nbsp;I have the same problem as stated above. I can not play Traitors keep quest or in game collector addition. Before the update everything was fine but after the update everything is ruined! Please fix this soon,
 i'm already upset that there won't be a fable 4, so I should be able to enjoy fable 2 and 3 the same as before.

<p>still got this problem..</p>
<p>But it's also with the Channeler Sword and the Shardborne sword....</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea whats up.. I have all dlc except the hair pack and tatoos and the 2 hammers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But they won't show up in game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the game seems to be bugging out a bit... actually I'm pretty sure it's the emulator... cause it used to not do this at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>dark red shapes turning Blue. tiles on the ground turning Green or Blue. (like a solid color.) shadows turning white.</p>
<p>my character's hair turning pure see through white. and large burst of static. especially in loading an area or anyplace with shadows... or a new line of conversation between characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed this in Fable II also in Fable III</p>
<p>And I also notice the static noise in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic... And I asked my friend to check his out. and he said it was the same...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm very certain it's a bug with the xbox 360 emulator on the xbox one... I played this game 2 years ago or so and I haven't had problems like this... even back in 2008 when I first got it.</p>

<p>Hi Michelle,&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There were no changes to the computer that I am aware. I was away from home for several days and forgot to turn the computer off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The password screen never came up with any attempts to turn on and off.&nbsp; The keyboard and mouse were not operating normally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I have a Dell Inspiron desktop Model 3847</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I was able to access the computer by creating a recovery thumb drive for windows 10&nbsp; on a laptop.&nbsp; Accessed Bios and changed&nbsp;startup to USB and gained access to advanced setting to a restore point.&nbsp; Not sure if all that was by the book but it worked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>When I purchase a game on the marketplace will it stay with my account? Or if I get a new Xbox do I have to buy it again? This is my first time buying from the marketplace. Thanks.</p>

<p>The license for the game is associated with your gamertag. You can even recover your gamertag on a friends console, download the game and play it. &nbsp;When your gamertag leaves that console, it will revert to a trial game. &nbsp;That being said, the actual license
 for the game stays on your console. Not your harddrive, so if you change consoles you must be online to play the game. &nbsp;You can redownload you licenses, but Microsoft limits the number of times you can do this to one time a year.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Local Disc E&#58;&#34; appearing after the latest windows update. How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I updated my windows 10 today (i dont know what the update was) and suddenly, there is a random local disc (E:) in my (place where the harddrives show up) It even says its full even tho it has nothing in it. I dont know what it
 is but i guess it might be a backup for the version of windows i updated from.<br />
It doesnt really matter but im really irritated by the fact that windows is now constantly sending me messages saying "Your drive is almost full! Click here to check if you can free any space!"&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

(also it does not show up in most disc cleaning stuff)</p>

            1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />2. Type Diskpart and click through the UAC prompt
<br />3. If you have more than one hard disk in your PC…
<br />
<br />a. Type List disk and note the number of the disk on which Windows 10 is installed
<br />b. Type Select Disk N where N is the number of the Windows installation disk
<br />
<br />4. Type List Volume to see which partition has the offending drive letter. It will be a drive with a size measured in MB (Megabytes)
<br />5. Type Select Volume N where N is the number of the UEFI partition that’s been given a drive letter, in my experience so far it’s the one called “Recovery”
<br />6. Type Remove Letter=N where N is the drive letter (maybe D or E) assigned to the UEFI partition
<br />7. Type Exit to close Diskpart
<br />8. Close the Command Prompt Window

            Hi Onyxam, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update, here is the fix:
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC

<h2>            &#34;Folder In Use&#58;The action can&#39;t be completed because the folder or a file in it is open in another program&#34; when renaming a folder with Thumbs.db in it</h2>
                    <p>I've looked at many similar answers but none really nail our problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a Windows 7 client trying to rename a folder&nbsp;that is on a file server running SBS 2003.&nbsp; When you try to rename a folder which has a "thumbs.db" file&nbsp;inside it it throws up the message "Folder In Use:The action can't be completed because the folder or
 a file in it is open in another program". and then it won't let you rename it.&nbsp; This is not a problem with other XP clients attached to the same server.&nbsp; We have narrowed it down to folders that have this thumbs.db file in it by trial and error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will work when you just show icons which is unacceptable.&nbsp; You can however rename a folder that is on the clients own local drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions - we can work round it but it is inturupting workflow and is just plain old fashioned annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy to supply any system info anyone needs</p>

            Hi THM9, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            I recommend that you do a manual update for this KB.
<br />
<br />1. Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update Sound Distortion Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blinkysky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Sound Distortion Problem</h2>
                    <p>I am having problems with sound distortion after the Anniversary update. I notice that sounds usually became distorted for low frequencies, bass sounds. Prior to the update I have absolutely no problem with such distortion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hours of searching online for solutions, uninstalling drivers, reinstalling new ones (the latest from Dell recommended drivers, and even the latest Realtek driver for audio on 6 Dec 2016), the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One crazy thing is, once the distortion came up, I went to playback device settings and change the Default Format to any random value, then switch it back to 24-bits 48kHz, the sounds went back to perfectly normal! Even the music parts where it was distorted
 before became normal and perfectly fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it only last for a couple of minutes before it became distorted again. Unfortunately, I have tried to find out what causes the problem to reproduce but fail. I only know that it last a couple of minutes before it became distorted again. Changing default
 format back and forth still fix it temporarily every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If further information needed, here are some:</p>
<p>- I am currently using Dell Latitude 3440, with the latest Realtek Audio Drivers version&nbsp;6.0.1.8010 installed. I have tried other versions such as 6.0.1.7564 (recommended by Dell), and even rolled back every drivers prior that, but none worked. Before Anniversary
 update I used version&nbsp;6.0.1.7564 and everything was perfectly fine.</p>
<p>- I don't have any audio enhancement turn on, not even loudness equalization.</p>
<p>- I have Equalizer APO plug-in installed, even though I turned it off, the problem still persist. But since changing the default format while APO is on temporarily fixes the problem, I do not think APO is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance and I hope that the problem will be fixed soon for everyone.</p>
<p />

            <p>There are quite a few sound issues being discussed on the Dell community site.&nbsp; I am checking on two but have not notice the low frequency distortion you mention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your system have the combined audio output?&nbsp; Does this happen with internal and external speakers, Bluetooth?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the processor speed when this is happening?&nbsp; Sometimes it may be running slow and be getting caught with some passages.</p>

<p>*How* are you installing Windows 7 onto your Macbook Air?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Boot camp?<br />
Parallels?<br />
VMware?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Other?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>How much space do you have/are you dedicating?</p>
<p>Are you asking just about the drivers themselves (the installable bits)?</p>
