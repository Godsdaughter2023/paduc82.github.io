    <title>I need the service pack 2 windows xp home edition download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dub1993  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need the service pack 2 windows xp home edition download</h2>
                    <p>My old computer is where all of my files are. I am trying to transfer them to the new computer. I downloaded the new version of some of the software so i could transfer it, put it on a portable harddrive, and plugged it into the old computer so i could back
 the files up. The computer preceeded to tell me i needed an updated installer then said I needed atleast service pack 2 download the new installer. I cannot use the windows update because I cant hook the computer to the internet because the disc drive doesnt
 work to install the internet setup. I cant use service pack 3 because it takes service pack to in order to download. I found service pack 2 for IT, but i need to know where to get it for just one computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>I have read with much trepidation about all the valuable functionality that Microsoft has stripped out of Skye 8. I can live without much of it as I am not in any way a Power User.

<p>Snapshots are now broken, cant open a snapshot window, and drag it almost of off the screen to allow me to take "silent" non disruptive snapshots of the grandkids. I can switch to another screen capture program for this.</p>
<p>However, an absolutely vital, deal breaking change seems to have happened.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Where do I find the "call technical details"????<br />
&nbsp;</strong></span>These were vital in troubleshooting call quality with my son who lives an ocean away..

<p>I am an electronics communications tech, he is PHD and software type. Without access to details like below, Microsoft will finally have forced me to end my years as a Skype user and find another product.

    <title>Surface Pro 4 is charging, but battery percentage does not update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> choicekarpz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 is charging, but battery percentage does not update properly&#63;</h2>
                    So my SP4 has been playing up a bit recently. The device charges just fine, but whenever I am using it whilst it is charging, the battery percentage (in the taskbar) and the time remaining do not update properly. For example, it'll say 31% and x minutes
 remaining for a while, until I pull out the charger and it'll jump to whatever it has actually charged to. Funnily enough though it doesn't do this when discharging (i.e. it will update frequently).<br />
<br />
I got in contact with microsoft live chat the other day, and whilst the dude was helpful, his suggestions of uninstalling battery drivers (and then restarting), along with updating SP4 driver packages, didn't do anything to fix it.<br />
<br />
It's far from a major issue but I thought I would see if anyone else has been experiencing this? (not just on the SP4 but any win 10 laptop, particularly those with anniversary).<br />
<br />
EDIT: So I've discovered that it does refresh, just very rarely; as an example, I was charging earlier and it was on 41% for ages, but it then refreshed when it got to around 90%

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you tried to do the two-button shutdown? If not, you can follow these steps:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 1:</strong></td>
<td>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 2:</strong></td>
<td>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.
<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 3:</strong></td>
<td>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 4:</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Erwin</p>

<p>I think you mean 80190864. That means you have some sort of billing violation on your account. Go to billing.microsoft.com and make sure your account information is correct and up to date and there are no balances owed or anything. If you can't fix it from
 there, you'll have to call support and have billing help you sort it out.</p>

<p>Hey, jeremiahgodinez!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend also trying the steps listed here on our support page titled
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/tv-or-monitor-screen-is-blank-while-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshooting a blank TV screen or monitor while your Xbox One is on</a></p>
<p>That should help with your issue concerning the console screen staying black. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the previous posts or my troubleshooting did not help though, it might be that you have to get your console serviced.</p>
<p>If you want to proceed with that you can totally do so at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/devices</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Give those things a try and let us know how that helped with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>peer to peer network &#38; ip addresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott15  say:</h3>
<h2>            peer to peer network &#38; ip addresses</h2>
                    I have a 1Pv4 peer-to-peer windowsxp network. Below is an example of each <br />
pc's ip address setup. The gateway is 192.168.1.254 for all 3 pcs.<br />
<br />
My problem is that the network printer has an ip address of 192.168.18.100. <br />
If I change each pc to an address of 192.168.18.xxx, they can get to<br />
printer, but the internet connectivity won't work.<br />
<br />
Does the printer have to changed to a 192.168.1.xxx address for the pcs to <br />
be able to reach the printer and receive internet connectivity?<br />
<br />
Basically, in such a setup, does the 3rd octet of each ip address have to be <br />
the same within a p-to-p network?<br />
<br />
PC1: 192.168.1.11<br />
PC2: 192.168.1.12<br />
PC3: 192.168.1.13<br />
<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Since the Network is around a Gateway that its IP is <strong>192.168.1.254</strong></p>
<p>The subnet of the Network is <strong>192.168.1.x</strong> &nbsp; any IP on this Network must start with this subnet.</p>
<p>Thus make the Printer<strong> 192.168.1.100</strong></p>

<p>Im def not sure of a fix but I had that problem with dark souls if the game was updated you could not play an older version of it, so maybe try to delete the update and see if that helps you, no promises tho and if it does work you prolly cant play it online
 without having to update.</p>

<p>What exactly are you trying to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did your son lose access to something through Roblox? and you are trying to get him access back to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your son is playing on the xbox one under his own profile then his account should have an email attached to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the games were purchased under your account even if they were free you can see if the roblox customer support will allow you to send them a screenshot of your order history.</p>

<p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue concerning the need for a purchase receipt being requested by Roblox on your Xbox One console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you clarify where this request stems from, as in, does the game require this information when trying to launch Roblox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering that Roblox is a free game, all that should be needed to access the game is to ensure that when in the Microsoft store, Roblox shows an install or get option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clarify the above, and or check the Microsoft store on the console and let us know how this goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the exact same question! &nbsp;My son had gotten Roblox a couple of years back and is always logged into the game via his Xbox console and Ipad so we have never had to enter his password again. &nbsp;This year for his birthday, he received a Roblox gift card
 so that he can purchase Robucks, however, per the back of the gift card, the gift card needs to be applied to his account ONLINE. &nbsp;When I went to add the gift card to his account, I needed to know his password- WHICH I DO NOT HAVE. &nbsp;I have reached out to Roblox
 customer service and they have explained that stated that in order to prove that we own the account, we need to provide a COPY OF HIS PURCHASE RECEIPT for his first purchase in June 2019. &nbsp;I have no idea where I would obtain a copy of his purchase receipt.
 &nbsp;When I look on his Xbox console under his purchase history, I can see exactly what he purchased in June 2019. &nbsp;However, when I log into his the microsoft account online, there is nothing there and it is the same exact username. &nbsp;It does not make sense. &nbsp;I
 then asked Roblox customer service if I can take a picture of his Xbox screen demonstrating the purchase history and they&nbsp;responded back in BOLD letters that I need a COPY OF HIS XBOX PURCHASE RECEIPT for his first purchase in June 2019. &nbsp;I am not sure what
 else I can do. &nbsp;They then tell me if I need help obtaining the receipt, that I should contact Microsoft. &nbsp;Please help me obtain the necessary receipt so I can get my son's Roblox password. &nbsp;I just want to apply the gift card that he had received for his birthday.
 &nbsp;This has already been a 15 email conversation between me and Roblox and it is very frustrating. &nbsp;I understand they have to keep his account secure but I am just trying to apply the gift card. &nbsp;Thank you so much. &nbsp;I look forward to hearing back from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son's Roblox username is&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed - Personal Information]</strong></p>

            If you are seeing that error it's very likely the disk is failing even though it appears to be working OK. The disk itself and Windows both try to detect and automatically repair errors. If Windows is seeing errors it means the disk can no longer repair
 them. There are other reasons why this error may show up but you should test the disk ASAP. You should also make sure that any important data on the disk is backed up.&nbsp; The laptop may have come with a program to test the hardware. If not try this program.<br />

<h2>            Can&#8217;t Install Windows 8 on a formatted hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I first tried to upgrade from Windows 7 and keep everything but that failed (automatically reverted back to Windows 7).</p>
<p>I tried to upgrade and keep personal files and that failed (automatically reverted back to Windows 7).</p>
<p>I tried to do a clean install while booting into Windows 7 and that failed (automatically reverted back to Windows 7).</p>
<p>I removed my video card and tried to install while booting into Windows 7 and that failed.</p>
<p>I gave up on the upgrade and reformatted my hard drive and left the video card out.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I even disabled the integrated sound card.<span>&nbsp; </span>Booted to the Windows 8 installation disk and tried to install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The installation goes 100% through the installation process, reboots a couple and couple of times.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then it gets stuck on the splash screen and forever.</p>
<p>I purchased the upgrade version of Window 8 Pro, but I never get a message indicating that I can’t install to a blank hard drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any ideas why this keeps failing?<span>&nbsp; </span>I ran the Windows 8 test to determine if my hardware was compatible and everything was fine.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can’t understand why it won’t complete the installation process to a blank hard drive.</p>

            Hi,
<div>First of all thanks for the comprehensive analysis you have done.</div>
<div>Windows should install on a barebones systems like the one you have now so I am thinking of a hardware issue that might have not shown up in Windows 7.</div>
<div>Some of the memory sticks might be defective.</div>
<div>If you have two, try installing Windows 8 with each of them and see what happens.</div>
<div>Best of luck.</div>

            I solved the issue by luck. &nbsp;I changed the SATA mode in the bios from AHCI to IDE and the program completed the installation process. &nbsp;After installing the windows updates, I switched the SATA mode back to AHCI and windows would not boot. &nbsp;Changed it back
 and it worked again. &nbsp;This was too painful. &nbsp;My computer was down for seven days.

            <blockquote>I solved the issue by luck. &nbsp;I changed the SATA mode in the bios from AHCI to IDE and the program completed the installation process. &nbsp;After installing the windows updates, I switched the SATA mode back to AHCI and windows would
 not boot. &nbsp;Changed it back and it worked again. &nbsp;This was too painful. &nbsp;My computer was down for seven days.

Hi rjohns75, I am having almost the same installation issue as you except I don't want to try installing windows 8 in ide mode initially because it won't install the proper ahci drivers initially, and as you seen will not run later when you switch back to ahci
 mode in your bios. And I want to be running in ahci mode so I can get the best performance out of my ssd drive and also be able to hot swap other drives without needing to reboot for windows to recognise them.</p>
<p>I am guessing the reason you were able to install sucessfully in ide mode and not in achi mode has to be an issue with win8 installation software not properly identifying your hardware and installing the proper drivers needed. Win8 installation should offer
 you a way to choose drivers to boot off of like win7 did, I didn't see that option so far on any startup screen.</p>
<p>I am glad you got windows loaded but I suspect you will need to find out why it couldn't load the proper achi drivers needed for your system to allow it to boot up in achi mode. You might need to do a complete fresh install with achi enabled in bios again
 once you find out the issue.</p>
<p>Can you check your motherboard manufacturers web site for any bios updates?</p>
<p>And also any hardware drivers needed for win8 for your motherboard, Good Luck!</p>
<p>I myself will keep trying, I gave up on the upgrading with installed software now and will concentrate on a full clean install. Maybe it won't install because of my SSD?</p>
<p>Someone else online had written they couldn't install on a 60gb SSD and sucessfully installed on a hard drive. I have a 240gb SSD so didn't think that was my issue, but now I am not so sure.</p>
<p>I never had such a hard time updating in the past with anypast windows version, this is my first time ever having any upgrade issue.</p>
<p>Wish me luck,</p>
<p>Andonios</p>

<p>I haven't tried it but I found this link that explains how to switch back to AHCI mode after installing in IDE mode.

<p>Also, once I got Windows 8 running Windows update listed an optional update named "NVIDIA Corporation - Storage - NVIDIA nForce Serial ATA Controller"</p>

<p>I don't know if it is related to AHCI but I tried to install it in IDI and AHCI mode and the system crashes and resets to a restore point every time.</p>

            <p>The anniversary update added <em>support</em> for extensions. Now developers can start writing them. If you want to know when Symantec will have an extension for Norton software, you'll have to ask them. Likewise you can ask Symantec and Google about their
 toolbars.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2, 2016 Printer Redirection and Server Manager issues</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi All</span></p>
<p><span>We are encountering a rather strange issue on a few of our VMs. We are running a Hyper-V environment on 30 physical hosts. The hosts are made up of 4 different models, from 2 different manufacturers (Dell and
 Cisco). All our VMs are Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2 or 2016. They are either Enterprise or Datacentre edition and full desktop installs, nothing running core edition. We run Symantec Endpoint Protection on all physical and virtual servers.</span></p>
<p><span>The issues we are having seem to manifest themselves in 2 main ways, although both seem to be connected. The first thing we notice is issues with resource redirection. We run an RDS environment for clients. With
 some of the VMs, the clients are unable to see their locally connected printers. On some of these machines, restarting the spooler seems to sort this. On the rest, a full server reboot is required. Following the reboot, it seems to work fine for that day,
 then it drops off again requiring another reboot. No errors or warnings in the event logs. It just doesn’t seem to work. We tested the drive redirection, and this also seems to drop off when the printers fail to connect. However, if the printers failing to
 work is fixed by the restarting of the spooler alone, the drive redirection is not affected and always stays working. This seems to happen on all 3 releases of Windows Server. It happens on different physical hosts from different manufacturers and ranging
 from 4-year-old hosts to 2-month-old hosts.</span></p>
<p><span>The other issues we have noticed is in the Server Manager. When you select the All Servers tab, you get a box in the middle showing the list of the servers that are online or offline, and deeper details if its
 online but cannot talk. Some servers seem to show up as “Online – Cannot get role and feature data”. These servers we cannot manage properly remotely or indeed locally for things such as RDS Broker that requires the Server Manager. We are unable to change
 any of the roles or features, to remove or add new ones. We are unable to install or uninstall any applications or Windows Updates. We are also unable to access Disk Management, the VDS being unavailable. We reboot the affected server and that will bring it
 back online, but the issue will come back, it may be an hour, or it may be a few days.</span></p>
<p><span>I have taken copies of VMs that are struggling and removed the AV, and removed all updates installed in the last month. The issue persisted. What is interesting, I took another copy of the same VM and popped
 it into an isolated network (Private Network) and it didn’t seem to be affected by the issue. I am running this test again and will update this with the results to confirm, but that does seem to be hugely out of the pattern, purely by isolating it. Now this
 may be due to another VM causing issues, or a lack of WAN access but I am pretty much out of ideas. I have tried as many iterations of this as I can think of, removed and tried various versions of it. I cannot see what is causing this. It seemed to start badly
 3-4 weeks ago. It is not affecting all servers, and it is affecting different clients with their environments ranging from Workgroups to Domains, each client having their own space on the hosts. However, the network is one large subnet, so it is possible that
 something is passing across the LAN. As I say, I have tried everything that I normally would and done lots of digging online and found nothing.</span></p>
<p><span>Many Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>James</span></p>

            Hi James
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This is consumer Windows forum. Windows server related question is best answered at Microsoft's Technet forum. I would suggest that you should post simultaneously (i.e. cross-post) to Technet forum also. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet.

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Explorer, Edge and App window size and location</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently upgrade from Windows 7 to a clean Windows 10 install. On my previous install when I set a window's size and location each successive time I opened that application it would open the application window at the same size and location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the case for me with Windows 10. Each time I open a Explorer, Edge or any of the Windows Apps (News, Weather, etc.) they open in a different location and a different window size. Makes it hard to keep my desktop organized. Maximizing the window
 works, as they will open maximized on successive launches, but I do not want these windows maximize and is thus not a valid solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this "CAN" work in Windows 10 as other application do work this way (as they should):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Chrome</p>
<p>- Steam</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other non-MS applications that don't work as well:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Origin</p>
<p>- Uplay</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Connie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting prompt of no recent upgrade to Photo Viewer while viewing pictures. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you can answer these questions for a better understanding.</p>
<p>1. May I know the format of the picture?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried using Photo app to view pictures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to update Photo Viewer and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Photo Viewer</strong> supports <strong>.jpg</strong>, <strong>
.jpeg</strong>, <strong>.tif</strong>, <strong>.tiff</strong>, <strong>.png</strong>,
<strong>.gif</strong>, <strong>.bmp</strong>, <strong>.dib</strong> and <strong>.wdp</strong>&nbsp;format of pictures.</p>
<p>For more information, refer below article on <strong>"Which types of picture files can I view in Windows Photo Viewer?"</strong></p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/understanding-picture-file-types" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/understanding-picture-file-types#1TC=windows-7</span></span></span></a></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Note: <strong>References to Windows 7 also apply to Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow below steps to update the Photo Viewer:<br />
1. Click on <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security
</strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>.<br />
2. Select the "<strong>Check for updates</strong>" option.<br />
3. Check the little box next to the "<strong>Photo Viewer</strong>" icon and then click the "<strong>Install&nbsp;Updates</strong>" icon at the&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom&nbsp;of the page.<br />
4. Wait for the updates to finish installing, Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not,&nbsp;<strong>restart</strong> the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Vinodh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for &nbsp;trying to help me with my problem getting the update to the "<strong>Photo</strong>"</p>
<p>application found in Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>To answer your questions... All of the pictures that I save into the "Photo" application, have the jpeg extension.</p>
<p>Then you ask me this, and I am a little confused by it....."&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>2. Have you tried using Photo app to view pictures?</strong>"</span></p>
<p>Confused because, &nbsp;In my initial post/question, I say this..."<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>When trying to view my pictures using
 Windows Photo Viewer</strong>". &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So Vinodh, if you read that statement &nbsp;(and I know you
<p>I'm sorry if I made one tiny mistake by calling it "Windows Photo Viewer". But I see your level of expertise there</p>
<p>at Microsoft (beside your name) so I'm thinking you knew what I was talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, now my point. Your "<strong>fix</strong>" did not work for me. I followed your directions to a T. But I am still getting</p>
<p>that same error message whenever I use my Photo application.</p>
<p>I just thought of something! Do you think uninstalling the Photo Application, then re installing it, would provide</p>
<p>me with the new updated version?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Connie :)</p>

<h2>            Problem w&#47; family game sharing</h2>
                    <p>I just recently got an Xbox One and I never had much games so my brother decided to do game sharing with me. We set it up and I started playing but whenever I was playing a game and he signed in, it would kick me out of the game I was playing and&nbsp;ask me if I own the game and I'd have to kick him off of his account to get back in. Does this happen to anyone else and is there a way to fix it ?</p>

Next, navigate to Sign-in &amp; Security &gt; Connected Apps &amp; Sites &gt; Allow less secure apps, then set that option to "ON."

            If this is with your Gmail account:
<br />This seems to be happening to several users, my solution is to manually set up the account rather than allowing the mail app to enter the server details under the mail app &amp; turning on the feature to use less secure apps within your Google account.
<br />Incoming Mail (IMAP) Server - Requires SSL
<br />imap.gmail.com
<br />Port: 993
<br />Requires SSL:Yes
<br />
<br />Incoming Mail (POP3) Server - requires SSL:
<br />pop.gmail.com
<br />Use SSL: Yes
<br />Port: 995
<br />
<br />Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - Requires TLS or SSL
<br />smtp.gmail.com
<br />Port: 465 or 587
<br />Requires SSL: Yes
<br />Requires authentication: Yes
<br />Use same settings as incoming mail server
<br />
<br />Full Name or Display Name: [your name]
<br />Account Name or User Name: your full Gmail address (user...@gmail.com). Google Apps users, please enter user...@your_domain.com
<br />Email address: your full Gmail address (user...@gmail.com) Google Apps users, please enter user...@your_domain.com
<br />Password: your Gmail password
<br />If you have two-factor authentication on your account then an app specific password will be required instead of the account password.
<br />
<br />Change account access for less secure apps
<br />Change your settings to allow less secure apps into your account.
<br />Go to the Less secure apps section of your Google Account.
<br />Turn on Allow less secure apps. If you don't see this setting, your administrator might have turned off less secure app account access.

<h2>            Xbox RROD after Power Outage</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. Last Night, My street experienced a power outage lasting about 2-4 hours due to a storm. I was not playing xbox at that time and the xbox is plugged into a surge protector. Well the next morning, i decided to play xbox and it would not turn on. Then
 I restarted the surge protector, and the tv and xbox turned on. However the xbox flashes the three red lights. I have tried everythng from: Unplugging and replugging all the power cables to unplugging and replugging the AV Cables and still no luck! Do i need
 to send it in to be fixed?</p>

    <title>Locked out of PC without password reset disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmorrison611  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of PC without password reset disk</h2>
                    <p>I bought a PC roughly 1 year ago and since it was set up so far from our router we had to use a USB style plugin to get internet to work on the PC. Later on, we self-wired an ethernet cable through the walls and had it plugged into the PC. Unfortunately,
 the wiring job was faulty and the PC was useless without internet access so it was left unused for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had changed the password soon before I stopped using the PC and hadn't written it down anywhere as I thought I would remember it at the time. And, well, I didn't. I didn't think as far as to use a password reset disk and my password hint is no help in
 the slightest (It just says "You'll Figure it out."). I'm at a loss of what to do and I don't want to use any third parties or reset the computer as I could get a virus or lose all the time and progress I've invested in it.</p>

            Hi JM. Do you know the login email you used? It is probably a microsoft account. If so,  reset the password here: <a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />Then log in to the PC. 
<br />
<br />If that isn't correct then try this: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028457/windows-10-reset-your-local-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402845...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

<p>The first link would've been helpful but I didn't link a Microsoft account (my own mistake).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the second link has me reset it entirely, it's better than just having a useless PC. Thank you very much!</p>
