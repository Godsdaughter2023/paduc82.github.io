<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD HDAudBus.sys on Toshiba L755</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I upgraded my laptop to <strong>Windows 10 Pro</strong>, and after that, I sometimes get a BSOD that refers to&nbsp;<strong>HDAudBus.sys</strong>.</p>
<p>I never had any issue with HDAudBus.sys before upgrading from windows 8.1 pro.</p>
<p>I checked the driver from "Device Manager", and the "High Definition Audio Device Properties" has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driver Provider: Microsoft</li><li>Driver Date: 09/07/2015</li><li>Driver Version: 10.0.10240.16384</li></ul>
<p>I checked for Update Driver from the internet, and I got the message that the latest version is already installed.</p>
<p>Device status is "This device is working properly".</p>
<p>In "device manager" --&gt; "Sound, Video and game controllers", I can see listed the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Definition Audio Device</li><li>Mpow Swift....(BT devices that wasn't connected when the laptop crashed )</li><li>Mpow swift.....</li><li>NVIDIA High Defintion Audio</li><li>NVIDIA High Defintion Audio</li><li>NVIDIA High Defintion Audio</li><li>NVIDIA High Defintion Audio</li></ul>
<p>All of them are working properly and they ar updated to July 2015.</p>
<p>Any idea about what I can do to solve this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Lords of the fallen update</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought Lords of the fallen and installed it onto my xbox one. However I am not able to update it, every time I click to launch the game, it requests to update, i click update, it qets stuck on updating or tells me I am not connected to the internet.
 My connection is ok as I can go play other games online.</p>
<p>No matter what I still cannot update and it is very frustrating that I cannot play the game that I bought because for some reason I cannot update the game.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

            <p>Hey there FanaticRoom280!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the update issue! For clarification, did you install the game directly onto your Xbox One console's hard drive, or did you install on an external hard drive? I would start by&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/downloadable-content/uninstall-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstalling and Reinstalling</a>&nbsp;the game. Before you reinstall the game, do a full power cycle on your Xbox One console to clear the system cache. Follow each of the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall Lords of the Fallen</li>
<li>Press and hold the power button on the Xbox One console for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Once the unit is powered off, unplug the power cable from the Xbox One and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Plug the power back into the unit and power the console on.</li>
<li>Reinstall the game. If it asks to update while you are installing the game, press 'Skip' to let the game fully install.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post back and let us know if that helps! :)</p>

<p>I am having the same problem where the game will not update. I have contacted Microsoft Support who told me to contact the game developer. I have done so but not yet received a response.</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm, if I uninstall and reinstall the game - will I lose my save game files or is that seperate?</p>
<p>Can anyone also confirm whether uninstalling/reinstalling the game fixes this issue?</p>

<p>I had the same problem, just follow Mister Beep advice &amp; you should be fine. If installation queued just go to my games &amp; resume installation, which happen to me a couple of times. You will not lose your SAVE files if you follow Mister Bleep steps. Hope
 this helps anyone who is having this problem.</p>

            I fixed my problem...<br />
<br />
To temporarily disable the shutdown kicking in , after the warning popup displays, I went to the command prompt and typed in "shutdown -a" so I could troubleshoot.<br />
<br />
Then I went into the Event&nbsp;Viewer under Application and saw that a couple weird services that I don't need anyway were failing to start because they had missing registry information/dll info.&nbsp; This was causing the svchost.exe service to fail (and the default
 recovery for that is to reboot)<br />
<br />
I stopped the weird service (in this case it was Bonjour) because I didn't need it anyway and went into Properties for that service and changed it to "Manual" start&nbsp;from "Automatic"<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

    <title>Other voices for Windows Narrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucb1e  say:</h3>
<h2>            Other voices for Windows Narrator</h2>
                    I am looking for a Dutch voice for the narrator. Thought the program itself would have some link to the downloadwebsite but it is nowhere to be found. Also bing can't find it (not that it ever found something before..) and google didn't come up with much
 usefullness either. Then the MS.com website, after clicking some links i found this forum where i just looked for 'narrator'. It only showed links like 'get this off my computer' and one or two howto get a voice. So I clicked the change voice topics (idk what
 they were exactly called) and it only gave howto get in the settings menu (like i would ever understand how to get here if i can't even press a huge button in the middle of the window, even the narrator itself would be unreachable) and another website with
 -it seemed- third party voices (free trial, after that 30€.. the suckers, windows is expensive enough). I downloaded and installed one of them but nothing changed, not trial version anywhere.<br />
<br />
So I'm wondering about two things actually:<br />
-where the ____ can i find voices?! (dutch pls, or change my windows to english without reinstalling&nbsp;is fine too)<br />
-how ____ hard can it be?! Sorry for the word but let's imagine my grandma is half-blind and has to use the narrator. But she never can because: Texts (mail; internet; etc) and windows are in dutch, and the english narrator does absolutely suck at dutch. She
 never will be able to find a dutch voice because there is nothing to tell her what she is looking at when she found a random icon at the desktop. If she would find the web she would never know where to look to search something. Uhm do I have to continue? I
 think you get the picture. No way. Even I, someone pretty experienced with windows and computers in general, have trouble with it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for clearing this up.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Luc.

    <title>Where are the Xbox gift cards in the redeem section in Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where are the Xbox gift cards in the redeem section in Microsoft rewards&#63;</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: justify">I recently had a goal of a 5$ gift card in my Microsoft rewards page and decided to open it up as usual to try and complete my daily challenges. After I completed my challenges, I scroll down to check my reward progress and came
 to&nbsp;a surprise when i found out that my goal was removed from my rewards dashboard. I went to the redeem section on the rewards page and found out that the Xbox gift cards (and Microsoft gift cards) weren't present in the store. I had a similar problem a while
 ago but found out by setting my goal as a "1 month Xbox game pass reward" one of my suggested rewards would be a Xbox gift card that I could of set as my goal. But in this new case i haven't seen my redeem page with a gift card reward and not even in my suggested
 rewards section and I was wondering if anybody knew if this usually happens or if there's another reason behind it. Thank You.</div>

            The cards can change every now and then so sometimes they won't show up. They were removed a few days ago and put back after about a day.

<h2>            cancelled folder delete, still can&#39;t find folders</h2>
                    I recently had work done on my laptop, Windows 7, and I was going through it putting folders back onto it from my external drive. I started deleting a set of folders and realized I was deleting the wrong ones. So I cancelled the delete. It had deleted
 up to the folders starting with the letter G. I thought when cancelling the delete, it would have reversed any actions it had already taken.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I looked in the recycle bin, and there are no previous versions available. I have searched and tried restoring. Can anyone tell me where the cancelled deleted folders went?</div>

<h2>            My contacts on Skype</h2>
                    <p>I updated Skype on my computer. Skype disappeared. I still had Skype on my cellphone though with all my contacts, so I didn't panic too much. I re-installed Skype om my computer, as a update killed my old Skype version and I've got a "Preview Skype" version,
 without my old contacts. But like I said my Skype with contacts still was available on my cell phone. Now my Skype on cell disappeared... I used my new password, got my "preview Skype" version without contacts on my cellphone and no my contacts anymore anywhere....
 Please help!!!!</p>

<h2>            Mouseover in Excel</h2>
                    Is there a way to incorporate a mouseover hyperlink in excel? Would like an image to preview a category of items to the side of order-form. This image should contain labeled pics included in a category. I understand hyperlinks, but would like the image
 to disappear once the customer has moved on to another category. Is this possible?

<p>Honestly any HDMI will work but there is a difference in quality depending on what you go with. You don't need gold plated HDMI or anything but gold is good for allowing electricity to transition between different metals. I use a standard one I bought at
 bi-mart because the one in the box just wasn't long enough. It's also quicker to get the cable at a store.</p>

            <p>Hello Edurado,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to change the keyboard layout from English to Portuguese.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can customize your keyboard for a specific language or format by changing the keyboard layout. The layout controls which characters appear on the screen when you press the keys on your keyboard. Some input languages have several keyboard layouts; others
 have only one. For example, you can change your keyboard layout from the English QWERTY format to the English Dvorak format. After you change the layout, the characters on your screen might not correspond to the characters on your keyboard keys.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=287044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided in the article mentioned below to change the keyboard layout and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 error code 0x80780048</h2>

            <p>The only way I resolved this issue is by hooking up to an external hard drive and changing the settings that the backup went to that drive and not drive (D:) which was already full with the factory restore backup of the complete computer system, which windows
 10 automatically chose this drive to do a maintenance backup which was the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hooked up my external drive then right clicked on the windows symbol on the bottom left then &nbsp;chose 'control panel, 'system and security' then 'Security and maintenance' then 'maintenance, and change the drive from backing up to drive (D:) to the drive
 my external hard drive was on by going to 'file history, under maintenance then'cahange settings' then on the left side of the pane 'select drives' and selected the external hard drive. &nbsp;I no longer get that message it worked for me.</p>
<p>It's just too bad a person has to go and buy something else to solve a problem that Windows &nbsp;10 can't have an easier method for backup as it seemed to automatically select drive (D:) to do a maintenance backup when it was already full from the factory with
 the computer operating system backup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply in trying to come up with a solution Eeshwar greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just had the same error code warning&nbsp;with my new 64-bit PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Got message from my external hard drive that there wasn't enough space for running File History and&nbsp;the first system image backup.&nbsp; (Didn't have this problem with my old 32-bit PC).&nbsp; My&nbsp;docs and folders&nbsp;haven't changed much, so I guess the program files
 must be bulkier.&nbsp; Had to decide whether to run the system image backup or the File History, so&nbsp;switched off File History and created&nbsp;the&nbsp;system image: on the basis that I copy my files to discs/USBs every week any way.&nbsp; The system image backup (and making
 a system repair disc) then went OK.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is my logic right here or am I missing something?</p>

                    <p><strong>Actual Title: Windows XP ugraded online to Windows Vista suddenly won't boot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a computer which was orginally windows xp upgraded it online to windows vista all of a sudden it won't boot up. It begins to boot up and makes it all the way to first screen which says HP invent then goes to NTDETECT Checking Hardware then it seems
 like it is going to boot up to starting windows recovery console and then it starts all over again.&nbsp; Not for sure where this should be posted so any guidance is highly appreciated!&nbsp; Eventually after several rounds of doing the above and I mean several it stops
 with this information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer.&nbsp; If this screen appears again, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BIOS in this system is not fully ACPI complaint.&nbsp; Please contact your system vendor or visit
<a href="http://www.hardware-update.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hardware-update.com</a> for an updated BIOS.&nbsp; If you are unable to obtain an updated BIOS or the latest BIOS supplied by your vendor is not ACPI complaint, you can turn off ACPI mode during
 text mode set-up.&nbsp; To do this, simply press F7 key when you are prompted to install storage drivers.&nbsp; The system will not notify you that the F7 key was pressed - it will silently disable ACPI and allow you to continue your installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Information:&nbsp; *** STOP:&nbsp; 0x000000A5 ( 0x00000011, 0x00000007, 0xF79F7180, 0x0100000E)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for me personally I am not that intelligent when it comes to computers, but I have always been able to follow leamen terminology instructions.&nbsp; I have tried hitting the F7 keys but it doesn't really specify when it prompts to install storage drivers
 with the way it is acting.&nbsp; So I tried it several times and still end with the same results.&nbsp; Also my CD-Rom seems like it is not working I had to use a paper clip to get the door to open to place a cd which I had downloaded driverdetect to so to check it
 that way but can't install it cause I can't get pc to boot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also tried to unplug the CD-Rom and the CD/DVD Writer because both say on one screen that they are not supported by smart support I think is what it said.&nbsp; unfortuanately I could not get
 either unplugged it says to not wiggle back and forth or up or down case a pin could be bent.&nbsp; Any suggestion on how to do this without busting my knuckles I will try again if you think it might at least get pc to boot.&nbsp;Anyway I hope this is enough pertinent
 information for some brillant brain to help me.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for sharing your knowledge.&nbsp; Have a blessed day and an wonderfully Happy New Year!</p>

The problem would be on the disk containing the index, so I wonder if we can configure Windows 10 to put it's indexes on a different drive.

I have Windows 10 on my new desktop computer and have a 1.9 GB MP4 file that I want to burn onto a DVD so that I can play it on my DVD player.&nbsp; Each time I try -- all I get is the same MP4 file burned to the DVD -- which doesn't play on my DVD player.&nbsp; Doesn't
 the system have to convert the MP4 file to something else to go onto a DVD so it can play in DVD players?&nbsp; What am I doing wrong here?&nbsp;

            Hi Jeff,
<br />
<br />It depends on your DVD player, some DVD players can play mp4 files, others cannot
<br />
<br />More than likely you need to convert the mp4 file to a DVD
<br />
<br />Freemake will do that for you and it is totally free:

<p>I can call any Skype user or they can call me anywhere in the world and I can make or receive the call through my Skype App. &nbsp;I can call anyone, landline or mobile, from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world by using the app and paying with credit
 or a plan. &nbsp;I get all this I think but NO ONE can call me who is not a Skype user unless I buy a Skype number. &nbsp;Is that a correct statement? So in Europe if the hotel wants to call me to confirm a reservation, they cannot do so unless I give them a Skype number
 I purchase. Thank you for your assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to produce a multi camera music video</h2>
                    I want to record a solo musical performance using multiple cameras and produce a video that shows the performance from the varying angels without gaps in the audio.<br />
<br />
I get how to bring clips from each of the three cameras into my "master" video. I also get how to "cut" from one angle shot to another. I don't get how to keep the music audio smooth during that process.<br />
<br />
What do you suggest?<br />

            <p>Hi TimothyCorcoran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. I understand that you want to create a video&nbsp;that shows your performance with&nbsp;multiple angles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I want to clarify if (1) you want to create a single movie with all the videos playing simultaneously, or do (2) you want to include the videos on the different parts of the movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for my first example, this feature is not available in Movie Maker. You can only play a single video at a time. If you think that this should be included in Movie Maker as a feature, you may post in our
<a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback </a>page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the second example, you can mute all the videos that you are using then use the music of one of the videos as the overall music for your project/movie. You can follow these steps as a reference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the videos to your project.</li><li>On the <strong>Edit</strong> tab, click on the <strong>Video volume</strong> then move the slider to the farthest left. Do the same to all videos to mute them.</li><li>On the <strong>Home</strong> tab, click the <strong>Add music</strong> icon.</li><li>On the lower right part where it shows <strong>Audio and Music</strong>, change it to
<strong>Videos</strong> then locate the video file which you will be using the audio as the music.</li></ol>
<p>You can now arrange the videos according to your preference. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need further assistance regarding the issue, please don't hesitate to post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Recently I sent my 360 slim to be repaired under service request 1156620222. The problem I was having is exactly the same as this youtube video:</p>
<p>[View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCR9MeIY6N4&amp;feature=related]</p>
<p>Since I could not tell if the problem was being caused by the console I sent in the console and the power supply and clearly documented the problem in the service request AND provided the same documentation inside the shipping container. Apparently neither
 of these were read by your repair staff since the original power supply was returned unrepaired. I called your support line and their solution was for me to return the power supply a second time to Texas but this time I have to pay the shipping. This is a
 ridiculous requirement. The UPS store quoted me $30 to package and ship this item. I can understand this policy with controllers and headsets but there is no market for used broken power supplies. I offered to let the person hear the noise over the phone but
 they refused. I have owned 5 consoles now, including the original, and if your support for brand loyalty is to treat me like I'm a thief you can consider this console to be my last.

    <title>Windows 10 Forced Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danmccabe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Forced Updates</h2>
                    Once again, I'm going to ask you to please stop crippling my computer with your unwanted "feature updates".<br />
But really, there is no way of getting through to you, is there? Over and over I've tried to explain that my laptop just doesn't have room for your updates. No, I can't "free up space"; my computer just doesn't have that space. Twice I've let your support technicians
 into it; the first time I was led to believe that the problem had been magically fixed, the second time I was just told in so many words to get another computer. Meanwhile I can stare for hours at "Getting Windows ready ... don't turn off your computer." And
 then finally be treated to the message: "Cannot install updates. Click here to fix." An invitation to continue the cycle of futility.

<p>It appears that there are three separate issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- You are using an operating system that consists of updates, but you don't want the updates. Like ordering a hamburger and saying "leave off the hamburger."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- You seem to have one of those tablets or laptops with a very small hard drive. There are probably millions of these devices with 32GB of storage, give or take, that are just too small for Windows 10 and never should have been sold with Windows 10 in the
 first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are steps that you can take to make space available on these devices, buy you're really just kicking the can down the road. Ultimately, the hard drive is just too small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- You sought help from the third-party contractors that Microsoft hires to provide technical support. Most are just reading from scripts and reference manuals. They certainly are polite, but they don't know how to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regular updates are here to stay - that's how software is built today. Google has this down pretty well. Apple and Microsoft are still struggling, with Microsoft clearly in third place. For now, all that you and I can do is develop coping skills, like delaying
 updates until they've had more exposure and making regular backups</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're looking for a <em>killer</em> computer at a very reasonable price, look no further than a Chromebook. This is what a Surface wants to be when it grows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if you want good technical support for no cost, look to the internet and learn from the experts - the&nbsp;<em>real</em> experts, the pros. It takes more time to search for good information and you may have to synthesize from different sources. But in
 the end you'll <em>own</em> it.</p>

            You seem to have grasped the situation.<br />
I have one of those putative millions of laptops/tablets that never should have been loaded with Windows 10. But the question remains: what should they have been loaded with? A previous version of Windows that would be rendered obsolete? I would have been delighted
 with Windows 7, or XP, for that matter, but when Microsoft tells you it's Windows 10 or nothing, what are you supposed to do?<br />
Like the Saskatchewan wheat farmer dealing with the CPR generations ago, you have a choice: their way or, well, build your own railroad.

<p>I am sitting here with 9 Lenovo laptops with some as much as 9+ years old that are running Windows 10 and not having any real problems.</p>
<p>I do not run any 3rd party anti virus, cleanup, security programs as Windows Defender and Malwarebytes do the job very well.</p>

<p>I'm originally from Montreal, but I understand nevertheless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My <em>opinion</em>&nbsp;- that's all, just an opinion: Those small devices should have been loaded/could have been loaded with Windows Mobile. But Microsoft failed miserably at Windows Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A major idea behind Windows 10 is that everyone should be using the most recent, up-to-date version of Windows. Thus, regular cumulative updates. There are lots of good reasons for this, that benefit users and developers and, of course, Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're someone (not <em>you</em> personally) who doesn't like change, or can't cope with change, or wants to stick with an older version of Windows, or wants to stick with older hardware or software, Microsoft has no time for you. You're just holding
 them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is rapidly becoming a service and moving to the cloud, because that's where the future is. That's where Microsoft's competitors are, like Google and Apple and Amazon and Facebook. The future for Microsoft is not Windows but Azure (their cloud platform)
 and AI (artificial intelligence.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you're someone who can't keep up (again, not&nbsp;<em>you</em> personally,) that's too bad but the customers Microsoft is chasing are the ones who want the next big thing
<em>now</em> and they'll go with whomever brings it to them first.</p>
