    <title>Sound too quiet, but volume turned up all the way. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound too quiet, but volume turned up all the way. </h2>
                    
<p>I just got a used computer from a friend of a friend. It's an older (but not too old) PC, and it uses windows Vista.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to be working fine, until I put a CD in and tried to listen to it. I found the external speakers, and they are pretty small.&nbsp; I turned the volume up all the way on iTunes, (I tried windows media player as well, with the same results) and
 went into the control panel and turned the master volume up all the way, but still heard no sound. I plugged in some brand new, working headphones, and can slightly hear extremely quiet music playing through them. I have tried looking at the different advanced
 settings, and I can't find anything helpful. everything is turned up all the way.</p>
<p>The previous owner said that he completely cleared the hard drive, and said nothing about any sound problems. I don't know if this is because of something that happened to it while the previous owner had it, because it is just old, or if it's something I
 can't see yet. I am hoping someone can help me with this, because I am still a student and I enjoy my music and videos very much. I would really appreciate any help or suggestions that anybody can give me!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Unable to maintain a stable version of Skype on my Win10 Station</h2>
                    <p>Hello, what is happening? I use Skype to stay in touch with family on the east coast and in Europe. Family members are having issues forcing me to log in remotely to their devices to remedy situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version of Skype has issues. I am Office 365 subscriber and I cannot help but think that Skype and Skype for Business is playing games on my station. My Skype Video connection stopped working after making a successful connection. This was after I verified
 in settings/audio &amp; Video that everything was in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to reinstall Skype on my Win10 station. In control panel, I uninstalled Skype but only to find that the software is still installed. This is a first!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into how to uninstall Skype For Business in the Control Panel only to find it is embedded within the suite of products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, my impression is that you keep on adding features and are destroying the product. Users less technology-savvy are confused by your ever changing design. The popularity of Skype before Microsoft purchased it, was that it works!! I have members
 in my family that have decided to purchase ipads for the senior members in the family and gravitate toward FaceTime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very big fan of Microsoft productivity tools, that is thoroughly confused in Seattle, WA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise!</p>

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t boot after installing updates.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:</p>
<p>Windows 7 wont boot up</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>my computer seems to have updated and restarted overnight. When I woke up it was starting itself up but seemed to be stuck. I waited five minutes and decided to try a reboot. After that I got instead of the normal start in safe mode options only two options:
 start normally or startup repair. I chose the repair and it loaded some files, got to the loading bar and after that a black screen. This lasted for like 20 minutes and I rebooted again. Then I chose the normal startup and it worked fine. I was able to open
 a web browser and use the computer. There was a small problem with caps lock working in reverse i.e. when it was off you typed in caps and the numpad didn't work. So I restarted and the startup got stuck again. So after that I tried a reboot again and got
 the same two options as before but now neither of them work. So after this I tried to boot my win7 installation disk and it boots nicely and loads but after that there's another loading bar and after that a black screen (the same situation as with startup
 repair). When I tried to boot the install disk in safe mode (advanced options F8) it got stuck on line Loaded (something) disk.sys.</p>
<p>Has anyone had similar experiencces and knows how to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you are able to get into Windows Recovery Environment perform the steps given in the following article:<br />
<strong>How to use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows Recovery Environment to troubleshoot and repair startup issues in Windows</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392</a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to Use the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) to run System Restore<br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows 7 installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer.
<br />
<br />
2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD ….” appears.<br />
<br />
3. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click ‘Next’.
<br />
<br />
4. Click Repair your computer. <br />
<br />
5. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, choose the drive of your Windows installation and click ‘Next’
<br />
<br />
6. At the System Recovery Options Dialog Box, click on’ System Restore’.<br />
<br />
7. Follow the System Restore Wizard instruction as usual and choose the appropriate restore point.<br />
<br />
8. Click ‘Finish’ to restore the system.<br />
</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iunify  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>I like to keep things looking very simple, otherwise there is too much clutter I never use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to place custom folders that I create into the start menu, this section as highlighted here:</p>
<p>(photo taken from the internet)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/324a8402-1490-4014-99e2-2955517cc20c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/324a8402-1490-4014-99e2-2955517cc20c" /></a></p>
<p>Take note of the top section.&nbsp; There is only one three lined button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see on the image of my personal desktop below, I have one option clicked in the whole of options for the start menu personalization, "show app list". I do NOT actually wish to see the app list whatsoever, but if it is NOT clicked...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c749867-b83f-4c58-8acf-babf50d78d19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c749867-b83f-4c58-8acf-babf50d78d19" /></a></p>
<p>Than I am left with a blank screen and two MORE extra buttons in the menu, as seen in the image below:</p>
<p>(It would also be great if there is a way to group the 'sign out' and 'lock' functions with the 'power' button and keep 'account settings' in the 'settings' category as these things fit together and creating the extra category, again, just muddies things
 up).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0cf1049-e068-4fbd-a108-ba382405f714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0cf1049-e068-4fbd-a108-ba382405f714" /></a></p>
<p>So, imagine the first image of my desktop (middle image), with one button at the top of the start menu (the 3 lines), on the second image of my desktop (above)- where there is no program list. In this empty space I would like to have the custom folders.&nbsp;
 This was easy on all pervious versions of windows but I can't figure it out here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>

<p>We tried to replicate your issue on our end and we found out that you were clicking two different parts of the taskbar. On your second photo, you clicked the Windows icon or the
<strong>Start </strong>button at the right-bottom corner of the desktop screen. While on the third photo, you clicked on the search bar or
<strong>Cortana </strong>located in the taskbar. Once you toggle off the <strong>
Show </strong><strong>app list in Start </strong><strong>menu,</strong> you will not see the highlighted part on your first photo.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are limited options to customized your Windows Start Menu as what we have provided on the link in the previous post. If it does not discuss what you were looking for specifically, then the limitations may have applied.</p>

<div>I know a month ago I did have viruses, but they have since been cleaned using Vipre Antivirus. &nbsp;I think when hey were removed, it deleted the file (afd driver in the Windows system folder) that was infected. &nbsp;I will still try to run that Windows scanner.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The afd driver no longer shows up in the windows\system32\drivers\ folder. &nbsp;If I have another similar Dell, is there a way I can transfer the afd driver over to my computer?</div>

            I completed the Microsoft scan and it showed there were infected files, and it said they were removed. My computer is still unable to establish an Internet connection.

<h2>            Calendar gadget has an all orange background and doesn&#39;t show date info</h2>
                    My calendar gadget has an all orange background and does not show the date information. I have tried the various helps and resets listed in Support site and also through a search engine search.&nbsp; No fix that was out there has worked yet. I have tried resetting
 the .dll, re-installed McAfee, closed the gadget, deleted it, and re-installed it.&nbsp; I am short of doing a total re-install of Vista (no money to upgrade to 7 just yet), but I don't really want to do that for a simple gadget; I'm sure there is a fix out there.
 I did install a registry cleaner and then uninstalled it, but I don't recall the name of the program. Thoughts?&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10, Various DirectX errors on Call of Duty, Please help.</h2>
                    <p>I have been running into a few dissatisfying issues after upgrading to windows 10, In this case involving both Call of Duty Advanced warfare, and the Black Ops 3 Beta. What happens is that when I play Cod:AW, if I set the texture setting to maximum, the
 game will crash shortly after loading a map, presenting me with the directX&nbsp;error
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Create2DTexture(*** varies ***) Failed: 887a0005 = The GPU device instance has been suspended. Use GetDeviceRemovedReason to determine the appropriate action"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also the error</p>
<p>
</p><p>IDXGISwapChain:Present Failed: The GPU device instance has been suspended</p>
<p>
</p><p>These errors only happen on COD:AW, The issues that is shares with BO3 is that my GPU monitoring gadgets read incorrect clocks, and the memory usage shows 200000% when I launch either of these games. BO3 will also crash on the highest texture settings, but
 it does not give me that error window. I also noticed that on COD:AW, where it displays the video ram spec in game, it displays 3911MB of ram, which is not true of my GTX 670's which have 2 GB of ram. This will change back to 1900MB if I shut SLI off, but
 that does not prevent the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System specs: 4770K, 16gb ram, 2x GTX 670.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These errors did not occur on windows 7, Nor have they occurred on any other games as far as I know. Ive tested Borderlands: Pre-sequel, and Witcher 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Ive tried so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried 2 different older video drivers (both with clean installs); verifying the system files using SCANNOW; Installing the directX files provided with COD:AW; modifying paging file size; ram cleaning utilities; and verifying both games install files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what else to do, this is crippling both games, and I am regretting upgrading to Windows 10. Please help<br />
</p>

            Hi Sagittarius,
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<br />
I appreciate your interest in windows 10 and also for trying troubleshooting steps to fix issue.&nbsp;I understand the inconvenience you faced.&nbsp;I will certainly help you to resolve issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could have occurred due to corrupt video card drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you&nbsp;to download&nbsp;latest graphics drivers from manufacturer website and install in
<br />
compatibility mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to&nbsp;install drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;Right click on setup file.<br />
b. Click on Properties.<br />
c. Click on Compatibility tab.<br />
d. Put a check mark on Run this program in compatibility mode for.<br />
e. Select the operating system to which the driver is available.<br />

            So do you mean for example, to download the windows 7 driver, then install it in compatibility mode for windows 7?

            <p>Regardless, it did not work, I cannot install Nvidia Drivers in compatibility mode for either win 7 or win 8, its simply fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Win 7/8 drivers in Compatibility mode for Win 7 and 8, and I tried Win 10 Drivers In compatibility mode for Windows 7 and 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All methods presented me with failed installs. I went back to the latest windows 10 drivers with the same issue as before. The earlier driver that windows installs automatically after I uninstall the driver and restart the computer also gives me these same
 crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, I find this issue seems to be video ram related, If I lower the memory using options in game, for example texture resolution, the game takes far longer to crash. But in the end, it still does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also seems that it does in fact effect other games. Far Cry 4 also crashes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;What else can I try?</p>

            OK I was getting directx errors pretty often and it was happening more and more. I finally found a solution posted by someone else that had to do with BF4 having the same issue. I tried it and it worked. Go to your steam folder and find the game folder
 for Advanced Warfare. Open the folder call _CommonRedist. Then open the folder for directx keep dsetup.dll, dsetup32.dll and dxsetup.exe. Delete everything else in that folder. Then double click on dxsetup.exe and it will install the latest version of directx
 for that game and will let you know when its completed. You should be good to go from that point forward. Hopes this helps. By the way just to make sure I cut and paste everything in the directx folder to a new folder on the desktop just in case something
 went wrong., which it did not.

            Hi  Subhadeep
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started.

            There’s currently a known bug with 1903 &amp; wifi not finding any wifi connections:
<br />Intermittent loss of Wi-Fi connectivity
<br />Some older computers may experience loss of Wi-Fi connectivity due to an outdated Qualcomm driver. An updated Wi-Fi driver should be available from your device manufacturer (OEM).
<br />
<br />To safeguard your upgrade experience, we have applied a hold on devices with this Qualcomm driver from being offered Windows 10, version 1903, until the updated driver is installed.
<br />
<br />Affected platforms:
<br />Client: Windows 10, version 1903
<br />Workaround: Download and install an updated Wi-Fi driver from your device manufacturer (OEM).
<br />
<br />If this isn’t the problem then try an in-place repair:
<br />I recommend an in-place upgrade repair.
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then follow the instruction here:

<br />This will also upgrade you to the latest version of Windows - currently 1903.
<br />In a nutshell you just download the media creation tool &amp; choose to upgrade now.

<p>Hello, I am moving to the Netherlands and have been putting off buying a new laptop with Windows 7. If I wait and buy one there, will it have the option of setting it up in ENGLISH? Or do I need to buy one while still in the UK for it to be in English? Thank
 you, Lindon</p>

            Here are a few points for you to consider:<br />
<ul>
<li>Aggressively priced laptops (those sold in discount stores) are unlikely to have Windows with an English UI when purchased in Holland.</li><li>Dutch shops specialising in PCs will probably load the language of your choice.</li><li>If you buy a less-known brand in the UK then you might have a problem getting it serviced in Holland unless that brand is also sold there.</li><li>Laptops bought in the UK will have a UK keyboard layout. This becomes a hassle when you are forced to switch between machines when living in Holland.</li><li>The higher flavours of Windows 7 let you switch between a large number of UI-languages.</li></ul>

<p>Good god why post suggestions if you dont know the correct answers.</p>
<p>When pre ordering from MS store you will get one of two promos right now depending if the game qualifies.</p>
<p>Some games will get you 15,000 microsoft credits towards your rewards account. And some ganes will get you a 10$ currency card.</p>
<p>Too redeem said currency card you will get a promo code sent to the email account associated with your gamertag. Once this promo code is recieved you will need to navigate back to the microsoft store online, add the 10$ currency card to your shopping cart
 then you will need to proceed to check out where there will be an option to redeem promo code once promo code is entered you will notice the bill is now 0.00$ click check out and it will show you your digital receipt including a digital code to use on your
 xboxs store. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You changing the email associated with your account recently is going to delay the process of recieving the promo code!</p>

<h2>            Task view desktops now at top of screen, move back to bottom&#63;</h2>
                    The May 2018 Windows 10 update moved the task view multi-desktop bar to the top of the screen. Having to go from the very bottom of the screen to the very top is really annoying, and it throws off my workflow especially since I'm so used to it being at
 the bottom of the screen. Is there any way to move the task view bar back to the bottom?

            No problem. You should be able to click and drag it back into place.
<br />
<br />If it wont' go, right click on the task bar and look at the bottom of the context menu. If there is a check beside "lock screen", click to turn it off.
<br />
<br />If there isn't a check on lock screen, select "Settings". There is another separate (?) "lock" option.
<br />
<br />
<br />I don't think that 1803 did that. I suspect you did it accidentally. No one else has mentioned that as a problem, yet.
<br />
<br />Actually, I've been working with my taskbar at the top for a decade or so.   With large dimension, and/or high resolution screens I find it easier to move from the taskbar on top of screen to the application ribbon / menus.

            Thanks for the response. I'm talking about the task view bar that has the multiple desktops on it, not the taskbar though. The icon for it is on the taskbar, the ladder looking thing to the right of cortana. In the old update, all the desktops were shown
 on the bottom, but with the new one its now on top.

            This might sound dumb, but if you don't want to move your mouse a lot, couldn't you just drag the taskbar to the top like Rohn007 said?

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue and it is a massive frustration for me as well. Right on the day I got the 1803 update installed, I immediately contacted Microsoft support. They confirmed to me that it is impossible to configure Timeline and that Task View is gone
 forever. Furthermore it is impossible to place the Virtual Desktop preview anywhere else and that animations can also not be turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I feel with you brother :( I posted the request to get Task View or configuration on Feedback-Hub, filed an official complaint with Microsoft Product Management and hope that we soon get either configuration for Timeline or that old Task View back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're not the only one with this issue and it's a big one. Could you also please go onto Feedback-Hub and file a request there or upvote those who request a change as well?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for doing this - although it is well documented that Microsoft ignores any and all user feedback, it's great to see people still trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every day I regret moving to Windows 10 - as a heavy computer user in finance, and with a long history in IT,&nbsp; M$'s "roll out" out of an OS is so incredibly wrong it's actually quite scary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, it's the constant and relentless "updates" (that really only install new ways for them to track and advertise to you as a user) that you cannot disable no matter how hard you try. And also the unwelcome modification (like the window menu moving
 from bottom to top) or little things like changing options such as your default browser back to M$ Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I have specific applications, I am forced to run native Windows - unfortunately I will have to be rolling back to the several years old Windows 7 to attempt to be able to do my daily work.</p>
<p>

            Same issue here.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A couple of months ago I -suffered- ( think is the proper term with this new style of forced update) the 1803v.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Immediately I went back and till today I was fine with my wonderful -bottom- virtual desktop-taskbar.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now again, and it is so frustrating. This is the first time I write here because for the first time I feel so uncomfortable with this decision taken by microsoft.&nbsp;<br />
They want to force us to update?! Ok, fine. But the graphic interface! Damn! Let me choose it! It is MY computer, I have to decide where I want the elements!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am so upset. For the first time I am thinking to move to another OS.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope they will unlock that bar.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm with you all guys.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: any idea if it could be possible to move it playing on the regedit ?&nbsp;<br />

 for two: <strong>Questa Bold and Rodscript?</strong> I want them. I need them. Where can I find them and how do I add them to my system where I can easily find them and get to them quickly?&nbsp;<br />

            Are you looking for an offline only site or online site? As far as I know, there is no third party app offered by the Microsoft store or most anywhere that you can download fonts from the desktop. 
<br />
<br />The best sites to use are fontspace, squirrelfont, and google fonts. These 3 will have most any font you want without malware/any issues. 
<br />
<br />You could also use a font manager like this: <a href="https://fontba.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://fontba.se/</a>

I hadn't considered offline only or online. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. The sites and the link you provided should help me quite a bit. Let me elaborate.&nbsp;<span>I'm not sure I'm asking the question the right way, but hopefully you will
 understand what I'm trying to do.</span> I find it very frustrating when I find a font in an application that I really like and want to use across all sorts of applications. Example: Let's say I find a font that I like when I use Avery for making and printing
 labels. Perhaps I decide that I want to use that same font elsewhere to maintain consistency and continuity in other document types. Maybe I want to use that same font in a word processor such as Open Office or Word but it's not available in their dropdown
 menu. Is there any way to do that? If there is, great! If not, I'll just accept that fact. You've been very helpful.

            Hmm, I do understand what you mean now but I have not ever heard of such a thing existing. You could try the link I sent as it may help the issue you are looking to fix.
<br />
<br />
Your best bet is just to download the font and add it to Windows 10. It should work across many platforms.

<p>No converter is needed. Try the Print command from within Word, and look for a "print to pdf" choice. Although it's called printing, it doesn't really print; it just creates a pdf file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your version of Word doesn't have that print to pdf choice, install almost any pdf reader program,and it will add one for you. A good choice is the free Foxit Reader at https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/</p>

<h2>            Problems with Win7 USB bootsect</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently got a free copy&nbsp;of windows 7 professional courtesy of my Univeristy (University of Bolton) because I want to upgrade from my Win7 32-bit system to my new 64 however after using the download tool it said that the files were copied however it read
 as follows: " Files copied successfully. However, we were unable to run bootsect to make the USB device bootable." What should i do?</p>

            You can download the ISO's from these links...and then burn them and do your install using your licenses.<br />

<p><br />
I got the same message when I created a usb thumb drive and it still worked just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look in the folders that were created on the usb thumb drive and see if "bootsect.exe" is in one of the folders. If it is, you're good to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't understand why the download tool gives that error other than supposedly it only happens because you downloaded a 64bit version of Windows with a 32bit machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My son works in the PC lab at his college and he used my usb thumb drive I created the same way you did and he's been able to use it for installs many times with no problem.</p>

            If ISO is 64 that you want to burn, make sure you run the USB tool on a 64bit machine.<br />
<br />
Son's been able to make installs - inadvertently used the right OS for USB tool.<br />
<br />
It isn't because you downloaded a 64bit on a 32bit - of no consequence whatsoever.&nbsp; The execution of the code is what counts.&nbsp; USB tool's parameters when run on a 32bit machine will operate in 32bit mode ergo any attempt to burn a 64 results in the error.

    <title>Moving Music back from Groove to I tunes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidwoolleyws  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Music back from Groove to I tunes.</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new Pc and wanted to transfer my music stored in I Tunes to it ( this amounted to over 300 CD albums, which I ended up giving away as I had all the music saved) . My son suggested moving my I Tunes file to One Drive , assuming I could
 then open one drive on the new pc and move the file into ITunes from there. Sadly that did not happen, all of my music moved in to Groove music (which sadly I hate)&nbsp;and I can not&nbsp; find a way to get it back, please can someone help . I am not a PC wizard so
 simple instructions would be helpful . </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you . </p>

            Right-click a song inside Groove, choose "Properties" and it will tell you where it's coming from. &nbsp;Then you can just open that folder and take your music files elsewhere.

            Hi MIa.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can make Signs in Microsoft word, of if you don't have Word use built-in WordPad this same way:  <a href="https://www.smallbusinesscomputing.com/buyersguide/article.php/3846891/Microsoft-Tips-How-to-Make-Signs-in-Word.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.smallbusinesscomputing.com/buyersgu...</a>
<br />
<br />When you go to print, you can blow up the signs to larger paper using the Print Setting under Page Setup to change it's percentage scale and then preview with Print Preview, change it to Landscape to make words fit bigger sideways.  It might take some experimenting so you can see it first in Print Preview and even print to PDF to test it before wasting paper.  
<br />
<br />For example, anything you compose as shown in tutorial above on 8 1/2 x 11 can be blow up to 11 X 17 and printed on that size paper at home or at a copy shop.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            ASUS Windows 8 Laptop not turning on</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; I really need help. My Asus Windows 8 laptop does not turn on. I have read previous discussions about something similar happening to other peoples' laptops. However, I have not upgraded my laptop to Windows 8.1. I have tried many possible solutions
 but they are not working for me: I have tried to recharge my laptop to full battery, push the power button for 5 seconds and search up&nbsp;how to fix this problem but, nothing seems to work. :'(
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom of the laptop where there are 3 lights beside 3 symbols; a lightbulb, a battery and a lock with the letter A in the center. The LIGHTBULB symbol has a green light. Why is this the only light that shows up?!??!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, </p>

            <p>Hello Jannon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the model number of your Asus laptop?<br />
2. What happens when you start your laptop? Does it show any error message on the screen?<br />
3. Did you make any hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either if Windows startup files are corrupt or there is a hardware issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we will try to fix the Windows operating system issue, at present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform automatic repair using the installation media
</strong>and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to contact the computer manufacturer to change the boot order of the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive in BIOS and then boot the computer using Windows 8 installation disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. After inserting Windows 8 disk in the CD/DVD drive, you will get a message "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the "<strong>Windows Setup</strong>" dialog, set the time and currency format, keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click "<strong>Next</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>". On "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Click "<strong>Advanced Options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Automatic Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Follow on-screen instructions to complete automatic repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may create a Windows installation media using suggestions provided in this article.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with required information and do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>

<h2>            charger turning on and off</h2>
                    When I attach the charger to the surface the charge indicator blinks on and off and the screen brightens and dims at the same time. There is no light on the end of the charger either. I have tried it with several power sources with the same results. Something
 is obviously wrong with either the charger or the battery.

            The answer is in the question :) You have tried it at multiple plug-points, try it for one last time and ensure that the magnetic charger has latched into your device. If the problem persists, get your charger/Surface exchanged.

<div>My surface charger was the issue, and hence replaced by surface support.</div>

    <title>Intel Graphics Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gootdude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Graphics Options</h2>
                    <p>After installing the latest 11/2 firmware, the Intel Graphics Options has disappeared. The software seems to be installed with the driver, but doesn't ever launch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone able to access Intel Graphics Options on their Surface Book?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need access to disable the Adaptive Contrast options, since this causes flicker on Slingbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The older drivers available on Intel site work fine, but then I lose whatever power optimizations Microsoft makes.</p>

            <p>No response Microsoft? C'mon, you're clearly messing up the intel drivers, since their released version of the 4300 driver version works perfectly fine for launching Intel Graphics Options, but the microsoft brandd 4308 completely fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to access intel options to disable their stupid adaptive contrast. Either enable the control panel or make sure these options are disabled!</p>

            Genius will have to supply the drivers, and if they don't or won't, buy a new webcam that is 64-bit compatible..
