<h2>            So much &#39;choice&#39; is available with the new OS&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After dealing with this board for the past few months, I see altogether too many posts from people (some purporting to be 'power' users) who feel some sort of 'choice' has been torn from their grasp by the introduction of what they feel are 'new' UI features
 with the last couple of versions of the Windows OS. Too many of these posts include silly threats about changing OSs if things are not returned to the old ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While there are many issues in the IT world, lack of 'choice' is not one of them. And, if you are doing anything real in IT, you are already changing OSs regularly - for some, this happens several times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many users here state that they like working in Windows 7, but, they also want the new features concerning speed, security, connectivity, flexibility, etc... that are only available in the later OS versions. This often results in short circuited conversations
 based on short sighted assessments that the 'new' UI should somehow be changed to accommodate them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For even low end 'power' users, or home/small business users that this makes any difference to... It is a trivial matter to fire up Hyper-V in a later OS version and install Windows 7 as a virtual machine. They can then work as they like while having the
 experience enhanced by the base OS. The choices are multiplied not reduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Hyper-V option does not satisfy your need for 'power' you can always use multiple PCs and multiple OSs. Modern keyboard/video/mouse (KVM) switching and network technology makes control a snap. Modern shared storage technology makes it a breeze to
 work with files across multiple platforms. Current display technology allows for ultimate flexibility in seeing what is going on. There are way too many 'choices' available to even keep track of. Today, even very powerful PCs can be tiny - it is much like
 the old adage 'they're small, take two'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have four PCs under my desk (I defy you to be able to find them by looking under the desk) running four different OSs. I often have to collaborate with the graphic design department that operates exclusively on MACs, or the accounting department
 that uses Windows 7 due to current software restrictions, or the engineering department that uses a mix of OS technologies and&nbsp;our main business is multi-tenant data centers so Linux is very important to us. I have displays that are on my desk, displays that
 are in my desk, displays that are on the wall and even a display in my office that 'is' one wall. The dizzying array of input devices, I am not even going to go into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to what is 'in' my office that I always have at least four development/testing 'machines' running on Azure and Amazon - I often wish there were fewer 'choices', but, that is not the case at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can anyone consider that choices are restricted today? How can anyone consider that they are not allowed to work in the way they consider best?</p>

            <p>&gt;&gt; This often results in short circuited conversations based on short sighted assessments that the 'new' UI should somehow be changed to accommodate them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why should it not be? The 'new UI' is far from perfect, and has received massive criticism from the world. So much so that even Microsoft has strayed from its initial course, and the head of Windows (Sinofski) was fired for doing such a poor job. Some
 of the new ides are great, but were very poorly executed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; For even low end 'power' users, or home/small business users that this makes any difference to... It is a trivial matter to fire up Hyper-V in a later OS version and install Windows 7 as a virtual machine. They can then work as they like while having
 the experience enhanced by the base OS. The choices are multiplied not reduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my prior post - Using a VM ignores a slew of issues such as performance (and battery life on mobile devices such as laptops/tablets), lack of VGA passthrough for hardware acceleration, compatibility issues, etc. Let's not ignore the cost
 of a second Windows license. People already resist paying more than a couple hundred dollars for their entire PC, and you want them to go pay another $100+ for a Windows 7 license to be run in a VM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; If the Hyper-V option does not satisfy your need for 'power' you can always use multiple PCs and multiple OSs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again as I mentioned in my other post - Let me just carry around two computers everywhere. Perfect solution! I'll have two laptops, two desktop computers, and I'll even ask my place of employment to give everyone two computers. Let's not even get into details
 of trying to share local data between these machines when you're on the move, unless of course you're solution is to share an external hard drive. KVMs have limited functionality, and such machine will not share the same hardware. Expensive workstations with
 thousands dollar GPUs or CPU clusters cannot be shared by simply attaching a KVM or using a network connection to move the mouse across screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; How can anyone consider that choices are restricted today? How can anyone consider that they are not allowed to work in the way they consider best?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you're getting confused as to what the lack of choice is. It's not about the choice of OSs, the choice of services, or even the available software or hardware out there (should a third party be able to do what you want) - it's about what gets shipped
 inbox with the OS. People invest money into a Windows license. They want it to come with all of the stuff they want. The stuff that makes them productive. They don't want to go pay $5 here or $10 there for licenses to software just to obtain the basic requirements
 needed to make things usable in their own personalized environment. Not everyone is a develop, has the required knowledge,&nbsp;or has the time to find a solution to their problems.&nbsp; For many people, Windows 7 had things people wanted, and Windows 8 does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take something as simple as the title bar for each Window. In Windows 7, you could customize the text color if the black/dark gray color they use by default was not good. In Windows 8, this is not longer possible. Without installing third party software
 to bypass the signature requirements on a trusted system component in order to install third party visual styles, you cannot change the color. That means by default, you can't even use black as a theme color in Windows 8 because you then cannot read any of
 the text! What a pity, since I love dark themes and use them all the time. I do a lot of late night work, so too much white sometimes hurts my eyes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also love to be able to use most of Microsoft's new technology without being forced into making a fullscreen modern application. Their layout and rendering engines are outstanding! why can I not use this in a Window? Well, apparently a lot of people
 feel the same way, because with Windows 10 that's exactly what they're doing. In my opinion that's a great step in the right direction.</p>

            <p>No UI is perfect. The only place I see complaints about the Modern UI are in the OS releases, it seems well received everywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly, heads may roll in any single team at Microsoft at any time. This means little in the major scheme of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am well aware of the limitations, rather what is needed to make a VM perform well. Anybody who chooses or needs to go this route can overcome these. No, It would not seem to be a good option for most mobile devices. Presumably, any one moving from Windows
 7 to a later OS already has a license for Windows 7. Everything here presupposes there is a need. If there is need that makes this worthwhile, the noted obstacles are easy to overcome. If there is not a worthwhile need, there is no point in any of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, carrying two or more mobile devices to fill this need is ridiculous. Remote VM and cloud storage (public or private) make short work of this though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KVM technology, both in hardware and the virtual world, along with proper networking and shared storage make the use of multiple machines rather comfortable in an office, stationary, setting. We also make great use of this in our network operation centers
 and have for quite some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use dedicated display controllers to handle the issues on that side of things. The digital signage industry is far ahead of the PC industry in that technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OS never has contained 'in box' everything required to use a PC effectively. It has always been just a platform to run 3rd party apps on. I do not agree that anyone should rely on the 5 or 10 dollar items for anything either. If the individuals in the
 IT industry had taken the responsibility for continuing education, these things would be trivial for more than just a few today. The Microsoft vision concerning this was stated many years ago. And restated again today. Yet, so few have even got a clue what
 to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choices are simple really, if you like Windows 7 use it, if you like Windows 8 use it, if you like parts of both of them, there are many options. There is only one team at Microsoft that really cares what operating system you use. Now there is a move,
 by Microsoft as a whole, to&nbsp;rid the world of any Windows device not running Windows 10, in the very near future. As stated today, there will soon be more 'devices' running Windows than there are 'people' on the planet, focus at Microsoft is shifting and has
 been for several years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trend toward running WinRT apps on the 'desktop' is a minor problem, but, it makes little difference concerning Windows 10 Embedded and the required UI for your toaster or your delivery truck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not all of these limitations can be overcome for the desired scenario. e.g. Hype-V does not support VGA passthrough for hardware acceleration - and even if it did, is not guaranteed to give the same performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; Presumably, any one moving from Windows 7 to a later OS already has a license for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fair enough :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; Everything here presupposes there is a need. If there is need that makes this worthwhile, the noted obstacles are easy to overcome. If there is not a worthwhile need, there is no point in any of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not everything is a need. Some things are wants, based on personal preference. The modern environment is capable of doing many of the things I do on a day to day basis, that doesn't mean I want it to. I don't want to overcome unnecessary obstacles, I just
 want to configure them to not be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Remote VM and cloud storage (public or private) make short work of this though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not if you are in an area with poor or no internet connection. Most of the United States still has very poor internet, especially if you live in rural areas. Some places still don't have access to broadband internet. For many people, this would make such
 a setup extremely unpleasant to work with. I have a 50/20Mb fiber optic connection at home and work fairly closeby, and yet I still find the latency and limitations of an internet based remote connection to my physical work machine to be quite painful to deal
 with. Couple that with the fact that proper (GPU) hardware acceleration is not available over a remote desktop connection and you have a pretty poor experience since the remote connection is thus rendered using WARP via the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; KVM technology, both in hardware and the virtual world, along with proper networking and shared storage make the use of multiple machines rather comfortable in an office, stationary, setting. We also make great use of this in our network operation centers
 and have for quite some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases this is indeed good enough. I use KVM switches myself at work, but they have limited functionality. I could never afford (in time/effort) to use KVM switches solely to switch between two UIs, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; The OS never has contained 'in box' everything required to use a PC effectively</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is a difference between the 'in box' user interface and the 'in box' apps. Of course the in-box apps are not going to be sufficient for many tasks, but the user interface is something seldomly changed, making its configurability pretty key to providing
 a pleasant experience for the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, Windows is a product like anything else sold by a business. The goal of any business, including Microsoft, is not to just do whatever they want, it's to create a product that their users want. If the users want a start menu to be included in the
 OS, then that's what Microsoft needs to cater towards. It doesn't matter if you or Microsoft believe it's backwards design - it's what their customers want, and it's what their customers say they'll pay for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; The choices are simple really, if you like Windows 7 use it, if you like Windows 8 use it, if you like parts of both of them, there are many options</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this is a reasonable solution. Each new version of Windows will have new features that no third party will produce. I, for example, will most likely upgrade to Windows 10 against any possible resistance in my mind, solely for DX12 support.
 Even if I feel the UI is a regression from previous versions, I may believe that I have a net gain. That doesn't, for a moment, imply that I'm OK with everything the OS ships with, and as a consumer I would be pretty unhappy if the requirement for getting
 DX12 was that I also had to pay $30+ on third party software to fix all the problems I had issue with out of the box.</p>

            <p>While I have some fairly particular engineering types working quite happily on VMs when they want to work remotely, I realize that it is not the answer for everything, it is just one of the many choices available. There are several virtualization technologies
 to choose from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wants get handled when you have the time, money and effort available. I am only saying that the choices and options are available, not making any judgment on the worth to any individual in any given situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, in the latest OS versions, the Modern UI is meant to be as close to invisible as possible. It is really tough to even classify it as a GUI any more. This being the main design factor means that very little if any 'interface' configuration is necessary
 or included 'in the box'. There need be only enough to facilitate bare bones or out of the box operation. By definition,&nbsp;any GUI work&nbsp;has shifted to the domain of app development. It is largely considered the user (the term 'user' here includes the enterprise
 IT department) themselves would be the ones to personalize their own systems through app creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If $30+ dollars is more than what you would benefit from fixing your perceived problems, you have wasted a lot of time typing for nothing.</p>

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I certainly do not mean to imply that many very smart people cannot make great use of virtualization technology, simply that it's not always a good solution.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It might sound silly to you, but as an avid PC gamer, I spend significant amounts of money on things like graphics cards to because I've become accustomed to a certain level of performance on my computer. Playing a game at anything under 60fps or with too
 high of a latency is immediately obvious to me, and bothers me quite a bit. I don't see this bother a lot of other people, but it does me. Things like virtualization and remote desktops introduce lots of latency and performance issues like even minor amounts
 of stalls or stuttering in processing or displaying things. It drives me up a wall, and I expect the experience to be extremely smooth at all times.</p>
<p>Coupled with the nature of my job, any kind of alternative (virtualization, KVMs, remote connections, etc) is fairly laughable at best.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;By definition,&nbsp;any GUI work&nbsp;has shifted to the domain of app development. It is largely considered the user (the term 'user' here includes the enterprise IT department) themselves would be the ones to personalize their own systems through app creation.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Interesting. I don't know of a single person who wants to develop their own GUI via app creation. Not a single one. Why would anyone want that? You get a bunch of people with
<em>far </em>less experience than the professionals in GUI development (with 15+ years of optimizing the experience) writing their own instead? All that produces are tons of suboptimal user interfaces riddled with bugs, usability issues, and perf problems that
 nobody has the time to investigate because they have a job and a family. You'll get a nice little collection of people trying to share what they've created with a bunch of people too nice to tell the person what they created was trash. Ever try to see the
 average person design something without experience? You should know this one, you were an architect after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; If $30+ dollars is more than what you would benefit from fixing your perceived problems, you have wasted a lot of time typing for nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you take the statement at face value that the goal is to save myself $30, then sure. we can argue all day about whether that's a waste of time. But I'm not typing these responses for myself. I'm typing them in support of all of the people who agree with
 me. $30 for myself isn't a lot, but $30 per device per user... now we're talking millions.</p>

            <p>While I am not into gaming (to each his own), spending significant amounts of money on graphics cards and all things display related is something I am involved with all the time. Our engineers are very particular about the contents of their individual workstations
 and the 3D renderings they produce are important to us all. When the discussion moves to the display embedded in the four by six foot surface of drafting table, subjects come up and money gets spent that are hard to imagine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While virtualization or remote operation is truly not useful for the engineers' main work, things like Hyper-V are still useful, on their workstations,&nbsp;concerning operation of unrelated applications that they still have to deal with. Remote operation is
 still important for static display or presentation of their work. Not for everything, but these things&nbsp;do present several options&nbsp;and choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, a short time ago you mentioned eye strain due to working in front of a monitor in low light conditions. I would highly recommend that you look into monitors with ambient light sensors and perhaps a visit to your favorite optometrist. The transient
 coatings now available on lenses they have designed specifically for use in the IT field are very effective in countering the occupational hazards of our industry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take the recommendations for what they are worth, they will protect your vision far better than just changing the on screen colors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure we travel in different circles of the IT world. Over the years I have seen a great many applications designed to aid the user in guided operation of the PC, designed by people for their own use or that of their employees. These things range from
 simple program launchers to very intricate systems concerning things like application and file categorization, work flow, file management, navigation of organizational resources, etc... containing large amounts of instructional data, imagery and documentation.
 I have seen these things 'written' in Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, several types of HTML notation, etc... as well as more 'standard' methods. The one thing they have in common&nbsp;is an attempt to 'use' or describe the 'use' of the PC in a way that
 is not provided in the standard UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We get requests for this type of thing quite often, WinRT app development tools and processes make it easy to provide this with excellent functionality built in. The invisible nature of the Modern UI means that the user of this type of app need never see
 much of the UI provided with the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation allows me to see only a few examples of others work in this area and generally they are the ones that did not work (after all, why else would I be there). The education system today is pumping large numbers of people into the IT field that consider
 the skills to do this trivial. If there are not a large number of others doing this, they should be. It is not complicated enough to even approach comparison with architecture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It amazes me when I see responses here by vendors or support personnel saying "My customers say it is ugly." without noting that they can simply respond with "That's fine, let's hide it. How do you want to use your PC?" If it was not for me knowing I am
 just cynical to the core, I would say that the Windows 8 UI was provided solely to make developers easy money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work we do in the development field is generally done based on the concept that it is better to spend a few thousand up front than spend tens of thousands in training, support and compliance issues&nbsp;later. It would be very hard to quantify the cost or
 savings on a per user basis.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the concern :). Although I may have been misleading earlier. Not sure about my exact wording, but to clarify more accurately: I do not really get any eye strain, I simply prefer things to be dimmer when in the dark. A dark visual style in Windows
 does that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That and I just happen o be a fan of dark colors :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; I am sure we travel in different circles of the IT world. ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was primarily referring to full GUI replacements (not supplements to the GUI built in). I made this assumption based on two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I am assuming we are using the modern environment, in which case you have no choice, since you must either write a fullscreen application or do nothing at all. After all, the suggestion was that such things be made in HTML+JS, no?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) It is the only way to accomplish what most people here actually want, which is not their own custom GUI or extensions, but the ability to customize the existing interface. Things like style preferences - colors, fonts, etc. You cannot trivially write
 an app to do such a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we are referring solely to supplemental tools to aid our daily activities, then yes, I would agree. Writing such applications would be beneficial, and I would put the user in charge of writing such applications. However, I do not see this as a possibility
 from within metro. If anything, the modern interface completely frowns upon such customization with the amount of sandboxing and restrictions it has, and I believe is actually an incredibly strong point against it. Assuming I am using a full GUI replacement
 written by some nice fellow from the internet, it would be impossible to customize his interface myself unless he explicitly added support for some kind of extensions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think one need not look much further than file system restriction in WinRT to realize the limitations of writing a GUI replacement/supplement from within metro. The follow is an excerpt from The MSDN documentation for CreateFile2:</p>

</p><p>How would one create a replacement for something as simple as file explorer without access to files or directories outside of the application's special directories? The only way to open a file handle outside of these is via the FilePicker, which is considered
 a trusted component that can open handles outside of those directories. I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but this itself is such a significant limitation that it would make the development of any such GUI extensions extremely difficult at best, and nearly
 impossible at worst.</p>

<p>It might sound silly to you, but as an avid PC gamer, I spend significant amounts of money on things like graphics cards to because I've become accustomed to a certain level of performance on my computer. Playing a game at anything under 60fps or with too
 high of a latency is immediately obvious to me, and bothers me quite a bit. I don't see this bother a lot of other people, but it does me. Things like virtualization and remote desktops introduce lots of latency and performance issues like even minor amounts
 of stalls or stuttering in processing or displaying things. It drives me up a wall, and I expect the experience to be extremely smooth at all times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is going to be an issue, specially when I listened to the web case about reduce power. You just reminded me to mention to Microsoft to include a power user mode for&nbsp;gamers. Overclocking is what I do to squeeze the best performance out of my machines.
 Overclocking in 8.1 is a failure for me. This is an concern for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>@srfeeman,, what do U consider poweruser? Some one that has 100 monitors hiding under its desk?, or someone that spends the day at programming and testing digital devices/software. Powerusers can be any kind of person.
</p>
<p>No offence but your post seem very selfish. Just because some says, "I'm changing", does not make them any less value. Seems to me your a power user of vocabulary, that does make you a power users of words and writing skills. Just because you have this skill
 does not&nbsp;give you the right to bully anyone with those words. &nbsp;I follow your post and plenty of times you&nbsp;ridicule others, which classifies you as bully. When speaking to others, &nbsp;try to use the words
<strong>We</strong> this subjects a less selfish way of expression. </p>

 and godmode 7,8,8.1 (have not tried it on 10 yet as i am trying to give the cleanest feedback i can) the options dwindle with every release. Really, where IS all this choice everybody says they have? the smaller i can make windows, the faster and more effecient
 it becomes. </p>

<h2>            PowerPoint Online replaces Label values with &#91;CELLRANGE&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have user who facing issue with his PowerPoint online (fyi, it's Office 365).
</p>
<p>When he copy the chart from Excel to PowerPoint online, it will replace the label with "[CELLRANGE]"
</p>
<p>If you select 'Edit in PowerPoint',&nbsp;it will showing correctly in Powerpoint.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acb5fbbd-6ccc-4eb7-9cf9-d5d429092069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acb5fbbd-6ccc-4eb7-9cf9-d5d429092069" height="326" width="637" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this? Pasting the chart as a picture/image is out of the question; user need to be able to make adjustments to the chart inside PowerPoint online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

    <title>How to recover unsaved word doc on iPad. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewgillies  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to recover unsaved word doc on iPad.</h2>
                    i have just lost a document on word that I desperately need to recover. I had attempted to save this document multiple times along the process of creating it, however each time I got a message telling me that I could not save my document, without explanation
 as to why. I finally finished my document after quite a few hours work, and went to attempt to save it again, but instead of the screen with the option to save coming up, it went straight to the new document screen. From there I could not go back to my document
 and as a result have lost it. i desperately need to recover this as it is a part of an assignment I have due today and I do not have the time to rewrite the whole thing. I had auto save turned on however I do not believe it has worked, because if I was unable
 to manually save, surely it wouldn't auto save. Is there any way at all to recover a lost unsaved document on word for iPad?

<h3> mike min  say:</h3>
<h2>            you can see that your PDA skip a PASSWORD window</h2>
                    
<p>Please let me know What it is clearly....<br />
<br />
=====================================================================================================================<br />
Question :</p>
<p>step 1. Click [Tap here to set owner information] on TodayScreen<br />
step2. Input Name : blabla~<br />
step3. Move to [Notes] tab<br />
step4. Input Notes : blabla~<br />
step5. Move to [Options] tab<br />
step6. Check [Identification information] and then OK<br />
step7. Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Lock<br />
step8. Check [Prompt if device unused for]<br />
step9. Input Password such as '1111'<br />
step10. Input [Confirm] then OK<br />
step11. Off and On (Sleep -&gt; Resume) * you can see the my info screen.<br />
step12. give a call from other phone or PDA.<br />
When you accept the call, you can see that your PDA skip a PASSWORD window!</p>
<p>Does anybody see that like me?<br />
Is it a bug of WM5?<br />
Please answer What it is!!!!</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Answer :</p>
<p>It’s not very clear from your description and it’s hard to find WM 5.0 device nowadays...
</p>
<p>But if you mean ability to accept the call without need to enter a pin then that is normal. Device should remain locked after that.</p>
<p>=====================================================================================================================<br />
Question :</p>
<p>Thanks for reply.</p>
<p>Sorry about not clear.</p>
<p>I mean that a device doesn't remain locked after that.</p>
<p>After that, I can do anything with a device like no lock.....</p>
<p>Yes, I know that hard to find WM5.0 device nowadays.</p>
<p>MS WM5 document refer that as you said, but I see device does not remain locked.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Answer :</p>
<p>If it’s not locked then it’s probably a bug. </p>
<p>Since this forum is development related only and your question is not, I would have redirect you to WM forum and close this one:

            That would help if you could post the model of your device.

<h2>            AHCI drivers for ASUS M5A97</h2>
                    <div>Pn-W10-002 AHCI&nbsp; <br />
System config below.</div>

<div>Can not switch to AHCI mode (No drivers).<br />
The plan was to Install Win 10 in ATA mode then<br />
*&nbsp; Install ASUS drivers<br />
*&nbsp; Use MSCONFIG to set next startup to safe mode<br />
*&nbsp; Switch BIOS to AHCI<br />
*&nbsp; Reboot</div>

<div>The problem.&nbsp; Drivers that came with the MB and the latest drivers<br />
install software from the ASUS web page interrogate the version of windows<br />
to select the appropriate driver. (win XP, Vista, Win 7, Win 8).<br />
Error, do not recognize this version of Windows.<br />
EOD!</div>

<div>If their were drivers this method and similar have worked on earlier versions.<br />

http://www.askvg.com/how-to-change-sata-hard-disk-mode-from-ide-to-ahci-raid-in-bios-after-installing-windows/</div>

<div>Considering the rather impressive job the Win 10 install did on detecting<br />
hardware and installing appropriate drivers, should I retry the install<br />
with BIOS set to AHCI?<br />
Any suggestions?</div>

<div>By the way the install was impressive.&nbsp; I powered up a network attached <br />
Brother DCP 7065.&nbsp; By the time I dug out the install disks the drivers were already installed.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are supposedly methods to switch to AHCI after the installation that have I seen mentioned before, but it might be best to just set the BIOS to AHCI first, then reinstall...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think the end results would be better...</p>

            <p>Considering how well Win 10 did with other devices I was wondering if it would not have picked up AHCI.&nbsp; Although this is my 'main' PC it is workbbenched for Hard drive upgrades.&nbsp; No data of any value and a WD 320 sata or two to play with.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I will give this a try and post the results.</p>

            <p><strong>Impressive.&nbsp;</strong> We are making progress.&nbsp; It's a long story.</p>
<p>I forgot to disconnect the drive having a Win 7 install.&nbsp; This was not where I wanted Win 10 so I pointed the install to the target drive.&nbsp; Not only did AHCI 'light up' on one of the reboots it appeared to give me a bootmanager like choice as to which system
 I wanted.&nbsp; I ignored that (one thing at a time) and let Win 10 continue installing drivers.&nbsp; All was going well until it attempted to install the MB Audio drivers.</p>
<p>Things went downhill rather quickly from there.</p>
<p>It had gotten the Realteck MB drivers working before so.............</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to wipe everything clean, get back to a known state and reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to confuse things but,,, Is win 10 Dual boot capable?&nbsp; For Audio / Video editing the ability to compare results on the same hardware would be a wonderfully thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've been seeing a lot of posts concerning the RealTek HD Audio... mine seems to be OK...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure Win 10 is capable of Dual Boot... But I wouldn't take that to the bank....</p>

            <p>We have made progress.<br />
Cleaned up all HD space.<br />
Restored Win 7 to one WD320 and verified operation.<br />
Formatted target drive for win 10, powered off and unplugged Win 7 drive.<br />
POR and reinstall Win 10 on target drive.<br />
All went well.&nbsp; AHCI was found on install. RealTek audio worked fine.</p>
<p>The confusion may have been caused by 'some' system repair installing bootmgr and related files<br />
on a WD Green 1T drive.&nbsp; This drive was only in the PC to hold driver packages (Ironic isn't it).</p>
<p>Out of courisoty I used ReDo backup to wipe the Win 10 drive, reconnected the Win 7 drive<br />
and attempted install with that drive powered.</p>
<p>The install went well.&nbsp; Win 10 was smart enough to change the Win 7's drives letter.<br />
<strong>No Dual Boot.</strong><br />
This is unimportant at the moment however if <strong>you</strong> wish to look into it further at this time<br />
we can do so.</p>
<p>For now I'll take Win 10 for a ride around the block and look at the only other 'nasty'<br />
problem I've found so far.&nbsp; There are a few BIOS settings I want to look at as this thing<br />
doesn't power off correctly. (possibly more on that in another problem)</p>
<p>Although heading in the wrong direction at the moment, the system was taken down for HDD
<br />
upgrades. I am in no great hurry to finish this up, for what it's worth this is rather fun at the moment,&nbsp;
<br />
so if there is anything you folk would like to try, let me know. </p>
<p>Thanks and I will close this out after I have gotten a few apps running.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say no Dual Boot... what happened to the Win 7 HDD ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 7 and probably newer put some kind of a boot file in any drive that is hooked up when it is installed.</p>
<p>This can become a problem if you decide you want to remove or reformat the drive.... You end up with boot errors that require a repair...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the shutdown problem goes... I have this problem after the driver for my AMD Radeon HD7700 series graphics card was updated by Windows Update to a WDDM ver.2 driver...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I allow the machine to set for 5-10 minutes it will eventually completely power off... The problem with that is that from that point on I get nothing but a black screen with a pointer... The pointer moves, but nothing else works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case what basically happens is that the display turns off, but the actual desktop is still power on. It even sometimes displays a good bit of HDD activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to avoid the shutdown problem by turning off Fast Startup... You could give that a try regardless of your shutdown reason...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>This feature only works when you do a SHUTDOWN and then Boot.</p>
<p>It doesn't effect a RESTART.</p>
<p>To turn it off or on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control panel...Power Options, and select Choose What the Power Buttons Do on the left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then select Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable near the top center of screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lower down on the window, uncheck Fast Startup.</p>
<p />

            <p>My my.&nbsp; I will take a closer look at the Win 7 drive this morning but.......<br />
<strong>Your power problem is almost a dead ringer for my power problem!</strong><br />
The M5A97 does not have onboard video.&nbsp; Video card is an ASUS silent with NVIDA G-Force 8400 chip set.<br />
I will get the 'black screen with pointer only' problem returning from sleep, sometimes.<br />
Restart is about the only thing that works as expected.<br />
It almost acts as if&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Power on by PS2 device: </strong>is enabled in BIOS.</p>
<p>It is not.</p>
<p>I am on a KVM switch so it powers up as soon as I attempt to switch to another system.</p>
<p>My workaround is to allow the attempted reboot and F8 during post to get to the MB Boot select and drop power at the surge protector.</p>
<p>Should we move this problem to another append so others may find it in a search?</p>

<strong>This is a very bad default.</strong><br />
Think about it.<br />
You have done something that has temporary corrupted the system.<br />
POR now saves everything including the corruption and attempts to restart from there.<br />
What would happen if you tried to shutdown if an application is caught in a loop or hung?<br />
Turning off fast startup appears to fix the power problem.</p>
<p>Win 10 note to self.<br />
Allays remember never forget.......</p>
<p><strong>Uncheck Fast Startup!</strong></p>

<h3> navyboi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unblock sender NOT found on &#34;Block Sender&#34; list</h2>
                    <p>For about a year I have not been able to receive emails from my property management company.&nbsp; They must email me from their private accounts in order for me to receive information regarding my property.&nbsp; This is a hassle for them and not strictly professional
 to send business email from personal accounts, but we are making due right now.&nbsp; Here is what I/they have done ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Their company/domain does not appear anywhere in my blocked senders list in Outlook.&nbsp; In fact, I reset my block sender list completely and added their domain as a "Never Block this Sender or Group".&nbsp; I still receive no emails from their business accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The company checked with their tech support to see if I was accidentally added to their own "Do not send list".&nbsp; My email does not appear to be blocked from their end either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- They double-checked.&nbsp; Out of the 100+ homes they manage, I am the only property owner who is unable to receive their emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, this is all really weird.&nbsp; Is there potentially an issue in the Microsoft servers that is blocking the email from coming to me?&nbsp; Anyone have another option that I can check on MY end to somehow unblock their emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

Given the fact that mail is not in your junk or spam filter and you have explicitly added the user *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to your safe sender list AND added @domain.com to your safe domain list it tells me the mail is not even getting to your mailfile and is being rejected by Microsoft servers. <br /><br />If that is the case you'll need the property management company to send in the information to Microsoft by using this link:<br /><br /><a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a><br /><br />If mail is indeed being blocked their mail server will receive a no. Deliverable message. <br /><br />I hope this helps. It's a tricky situation but one that can be resolved. <br /><br />Thanks, <br />-Jeff       
        </p>

    <title>Exporting Embedded Images from PowerPoint 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Exporting Embedded Images from PowerPoint 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I've been writing a PowerPoint Add-In which is basically going to parse a presentation based off of a special template I've made for PowerPoint.</p>
<p>I've reached a snag along the way, though. I want to be able to export an image off of a slide. To my delight there is a function in the Object Model called Export for shapes.</p>
<p>void Export(string PathName, Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint.PpShapeFormat Filter, int ScaleWidth, int ScaleHeight, Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint.PpExportMode ExportMode)</p>
<p>There seems to be little to no documentation. I cannot seem to find the differences between the PpExportMode, for instance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the function exports the images but they're tiny resampled versions of the correct images. They're garbled and unusable. Any ideas?</p>

                </div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The Export method for shapes you are referring to is a hidden method has never been officially supported. That is the reason you don't find any documentation pertaining to it and some it is broken anyways.</p>
<p>You can increase the size of the resample images be manipulating scaleheight and scalewidth arguments. This is the vba equivalent of increaing the export image size to twice it's size with respect to the slide size. Note that 720 and&nbsp; 540 are dimensions
 of the slide.</p>
<p>Call ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange(1).Export( "C:\Users\Shyam\Documents\Scratch\test.png",ppShapeFormatPNG, 2 * 720, 2 * 540)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Shyam Pillai</p>

<p>Office 2013 (mentioned in the Applies To line of your post) doesn't have a Document Map; the last Word version that did have it was in Office 2007. The current versions have a Navigation pane instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, there is no way to change the line spacing in the pane. Word 2007 and later have a built-in style named "Document Map", but changing the line spacing and/or the Space After settings in that style's definition doesn't change the appearance
 of the entries in the pane at all.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for this remarkably fast answer. Now I know I'm not hexed. But I did find a style called Document Map in my Word 2013, it is in the Home tab under Styles, and indeed editing it is as ineffective as the Word 2007 version.<br />

            Document Map is a built-in paragraph style in Word. In older versions of Word (up to and including Word 2003 if I remember correctly), you could use it to customize the text in the Document Map, but changing the style has no effect on the Navigation pane.

    <title>Excel 2016, Power Query Time.Minute command - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walterlp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016, Power Query Time.Minute command</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>I am looking for the right syntax for an OData query with Excel 2016 Power Query (Advanced Editor).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OData tables have a DateTime field called TimeStamp (e.g. "1/26/2018 12:00:00 AM") and every 10 minutes it has a new record.<br />
For that, I need to run every 10 minutes a query to get just the latest record(s). So my approach was to check the TimeStamp field against the current time and if it has a less difference then 11 minutes then I will pick this/those records.<br />
</p>
<p>I tried at the Time.Minute function but receive in all constellations&nbsp;a syntax error and I could not find any good example on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, if you could help me to get an example how this might work with a Power Query would be so much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>W.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />did you using time function as follows:
<br />=Time.Minute([LocalTime])
<br />
<br />Can you share the Query also. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.

Here is the query structure (of course I had to cut out the true OData link and access key).<br />
<br />
let<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Source = OData.Feed("https://www.myodatasource.com/ResourceData?$filter=<br />

<p>Thanks!&nbsp; Then, what's the problem....... it's an old notebook.&nbsp; Toshiba Satellite B550/B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some months ago, I had a trouble in VT-x (virtual availability bit set in BIOS) with BIOS settings.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I changed UEFI BIOS settings to UEFI boot first and changed Windows 10 to GPT (thanks to mbr2gpt.exe!), VT-x problem had gone.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I thought UEFI did
 it again.&nbsp; &nbsp;But what is the problem....</p>

<p>If you are trying to boot a Legacy BIOS device with media which has been setup for UEFI, it will not work.&nbsp; If you take that same ISO file, but use Rufus to create a bootable USB stick for Legacy/MBR then it should work fine.&nbsp; The resulting Windows partition
 is the same either way.&nbsp; Only the BCD and System files used are different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI on a GPT-initialized disk uses a FAT32 EFI partition for System files, while MBR uses an NTFS System partition.&nbsp; GPT requires specialized partitions that are not on an MBR disk, such as the MSR (Microsoft Reserved) partition.</p>

<p>Today I found the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not related to UEFI, but VT-x.&nbsp; &nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/01/11/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17074-pc/#gRFGRHfiiI2qBf7g.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Insider Preview's blog,</a>&nbsp;*some*
 machines with virtualization have boot problem.&nbsp; Today fixed version was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my machines are virtualization-enabled, so one machine failed to upgrade.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Follow the methods mentioned below and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<p><b>Method </b><b>1:</b> If you encounter a certificate error at a website you have visited before without errors, it's possible the website is not configured correctly. Try retyping the address you are using. For example, if you are typing the address as
<a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://example.com</a>, <span>&nbsp;</span>try changing it to
<a href="https://www.example.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.example.com</a>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is also possible that the website's certificate has expired and the owner or operator needs to contact the certification authority to renew the certificate in order to continue using it. This is a website-related problem, and cannot be corrected in Internet
 Explorer. If you are getting errors on a website you have previously visited successfully, contact the website or webmaster to report the problem
</p>
<p>Refer to the link below: </p>
<p><b>There is a problem with this website's security certificate</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931850</a></p>
<p>Refer to “<b>About certificate errors</b>” </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/About-certificate-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/About-certificate-errors</a><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/About-certificate-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b>Remove the certificate and check if that helps.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Do not forget to back up the certificate before you uninstall.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to remove the certificate:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on Tools and then click Internet options.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the content tab.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on certificates.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the Personal tab.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the certificate and click remove.</p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When prompted to confirm the deletion, click yes.</p>

            No. You could add the Cost field to the Values area twice, and set one to percentage and the other to sum.

<h2>            E1 and Office 2016 and Office 2013</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.&nbsp; I have just finished installing Office 365 for all staff with office 2013.&nbsp; The Executive Director is reluctant to have them jump to 2016.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, when this becomes available to E1 (and we have Pro Plus) in February, each user will receive a notification to upgrade?&nbsp; Can they ignore this notification?&nbsp; I installed individually with click to run (it's a small organization).<br />
<br />
We do want to upgrade but would like to wait as users get use to using everything with Office 365.&nbsp; We do not have a server.&nbsp; Everyone has Office 365 installed on their own laptops.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your insight.&nbsp; Please let me know the best way we can stay on Office 2013 until they are ready to upgrade.<br />
<br />
All my best,<br />
<br />
Katherine</p>

<h2>            Security Verification Code Query</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had many issues in the past when I am travelling and trying to log in to my Hotmail account when the security verification code never arrives at my alternative email address despite numerous attempts.&nbsp; In 2015 this function was working for me, however
 in August 2016 it was not, and I was without my Hotmail access for several weeks whilst overseas which was incredibly inconvenient.&nbsp; I am about to head off travelling for three months from mid-January 2017, and want to ensure my alternate email address is
 set up to receive the security verification code.&nbsp; Does anyone know how I am able to verify this and get comfort the function will work for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand I can also get the code sent to my mobile number, however I do not take my mobile phone when travelling therefore this is not an option for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

</p><p>Another thing, since you've mention your gmail back up email works to get a security code in the past but now its not, you've might have accidentally block the automated address of Microsoft that sends the code on your gmail. Check the spam filter or block
 option of your gmail to be sure.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to install IIS URL rewrite on your computer as it shows the version required should be greater than 7.0.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to remove IIS and add it again and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to remove and add IIS feature:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></span></li><li><span>Type <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong></span></li><li><span>Uncheck the box which has <strong>
Internet Information Services</strong></span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Ok</strong> and <strong>

    <title>Why is Data Execution Prevention &#40;DEP&#41; disabled for Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whyisitsocomplicatedjusttosetupanewcomputerin2013  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Data Execution Prevention &#40;DEP&#41; disabled for Excel &#40;excel.exe&#41; when I have it turned on &#34;for all programs and services&#34; with no exceptions listed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to tighten up the security/privacy of my computer.&nbsp; Yesterday I was learning about the extra columns one could add to Task Manager, and when I added the&nbsp;Data Execution Prevention column to my Task Manager, to my surprise I noticed that
 a number of programs including Word (word.exe) had it "disabled".&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then&nbsp;looked up how to request Data Execution Prevention for everything on the computer, and I selected all the right options in the System Properties box:&nbsp; System Properties - Advanced - Performance Settings - Data Execution Prevention - "Turn on DEP for
 all programs and services except for those I select" - and there is&nbsp;nothing placed in the exception window.&nbsp; When&nbsp;re-opened Task Manager, everything seemed to have DEP enabled, so I thought&nbsp;the whole computer&nbsp;was&nbsp;covered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, today&nbsp;when&nbsp;I looked at Task Manager,&nbsp;I noticed that Excel (excel.exe) said it had DEP "disabled" in Task Manager.&nbsp; (I didn't have an instance of Excel open last night when I double-checked Task Manager to see that everything had DEP enabled, and
 I expect if I had had Excel open then, I would have discovered this discrepancy then.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;opened up instances of my other Office programs to see if they had DEP enabled or disabled:&nbsp; Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook.&nbsp; Everything in the Task Manager window except Excel (excel.exe) and C:\\Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe had DEP enabled.&nbsp; Excel.exe
 has it "disabled", and ntoskrnl.exe does not have any entry in the DEP column (neither enabled nor disabled, just blank)
<em>(is that to be expected for ntoskrnl.exe?)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted several times,&nbsp;no change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my system -&nbsp;the laptop is about 8 months old,&nbsp;it's Windows 7, and&nbsp;I've got&nbsp;Office 2007 and Outlook 2007.&nbsp; Am very safe on the Internet, don't play games or download stuff, don't do social networking, don't open unusual emails.&nbsp; I have Norton Internet
 Security 2014, Malwarebytes passive, Ccleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last few days I have run all kinds of recommended malware and virus scans (about 8) - no issues have been flagged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched diligently in my Excel "options" (from within the program) to see if there is anything that might relate to DEP, but I didn't see anything specific.&nbsp; the few Excel add-ons I have are ones I've used for many years already, and seem legitimate
 and mainstream.&nbsp; (But if deleting the add-ons I have in Excel would allow me to enable DEP, of course I would delete them.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for a long time this afternoon online&nbsp;to see if I can find out why&nbsp;only&nbsp;my Excel&nbsp;has DEP disabled.&nbsp; There do not seem to be any similar queries out there on the internet or on the Microsoft site!&nbsp; I've gone through various solutions and investigations
 that have been proposed for DEP issues that were similar though not identical -- but I've found nothing, and the DEP is still disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I am now turning to this forum to see if anyone can help me!&nbsp; Does it sound like my Excel has been influenced by&nbsp;malware?&nbsp; What can I do to enable DEP for Excel?&nbsp; (Should Excel have DEP disabled for some odd reason?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>There was a Fix it for DEP on Office for earlier versions of Windows. I don't know if this works for Windows 7 or if using it would cause problems.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Thank you dax1792 for your reply and 2 suggestions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the first suggestion, I had already seen the Fixit for an earlier version of Windows, which involves changing the Registry and enabling all programs permanently to have DEP.&nbsp; Because I am not knowledgeable enough to&nbsp;fix a computer's&nbsp;Registry&nbsp;if something
 goes wrong, and because that Fixit was for an earlier version of Windows and when I look at that page a warning pops up&nbsp;that it's not applicable to my system, I don't think I will&nbsp;try that route, at least on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I also think the second suggestion probably won't work for me -- the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit appears to be&nbsp;for organizations who have IT people to install such things, and the directions are complicated, e.g.,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"How do I use EMET to protect my software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you install EMET, you must configure EMET to provide protection for a piece of software. This requires you to provide the name and location of the executable file that you want to protect. To do this, use one of the following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with the Application Configuration feature of the graphical application.</li><li>Use the command prompt utility.</li></ul>
<p>To use the Certificate Trust feature that is available in EMET 4.0 and newer versions, you have to provide the list of the websites that you want to protect and certificate pinning rules that apply to those websites. To do this, you have to work with the
 Certificate Trust Configuration feature of the graphical application."&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That is way more than I want to get into.&nbsp; If it comes down to taking drastic measures, and if having DEP on Excel is important, I&nbsp;probably could&nbsp;figure out how to take my computer back to a factory install, in case that would solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm wondering if there is something sinister (malware)&nbsp;in the fact that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
only</span> my&nbsp;Excel has DEP disabled, and in internet searches I can't find a report of anyone&nbsp;having had quite this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I had known about DEP when I first set up my new laptop, because then I would know if this quirk&nbsp;has always been an issue for my computer "out of the box", or if something has interfered with Excel's DEP recently.&nbsp; (Is there some sort of error log
 that I could find something like that on?&nbsp; I am somewhat&nbsp;familiar with the Event Viewer - I can find it, at least! - but I don't know my way around it all, and I know there must be various other logs and lists and histories that are stored somewhere.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this DEP-disabling of Excel&nbsp;is a minor thing that I can ignore, or if it's something I should definitely fix -- ?</p>

            <p>My guess is that Excel in Office 2007 is disabling DEP because of compatibility with popular add-ons.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx</a></p>
<p>I don't have a copy of Office 2007 to check this.</p>
<p>This could also be a quirk of the way Task Manager reports DEP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default install of EMET enforces DEP on Office without you having to set up anything yourself. However, it's true that if you happen to have an application that doesn't work well with it, it can be difficult to sort it out. Also uninstalling EMET does
 not necessarily undo the changes it has made.</p>
<p>There's a slightly more friendly guide here: <a href="http://rationallyparanoid.com/articles/microsoft-emet-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Yes, maybe that is it - an incompatibility with one of my Excel add-ons.&nbsp; Your first link in your second comment&nbsp;says, "Both IE 7&nbsp;and Office&nbsp;do not opt-in to DEP
<strong>for the sake of 3rd party extensions and plug-ins </strong>that need to run inside IE and Office applications. IE and the Office applications themselves work fine with DEP enabled
<strong>so if you don’t need to use older 3rd party extensions</strong>, you might be able to get away with opting these processes in to DEP."</p>
<p>
</p><p>All&nbsp;my other Office 2007 programs went from "disabled" to "enabled" when I used the System settings box to turn on DEP a couple of days ago, so maybe there is a specific Excel plug-in that has stopped it for Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reluctant to try to&nbsp;make a change&nbsp;in the Registry because that seems to turn&nbsp;DEP either off for everything or on for everything, and as your link&nbsp;says, "The system-wide 'AlwaysOn' setting and the ExecuteOptions registry setting do not allow DEP to be
 disabled for a process once it has been enabled which can lead to a DEP related crash in Office applications if those applications attempt to make use of VBA or macros...."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And installing EMET is a much more complex and risky&nbsp;step than I would want to take on, and perhaps&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;wouldn't even change&nbsp;Excel's DEP status, if a prior-installed add-on is preventing DEP from within the Excel program.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So maybe I could uninstall (or delete or whatever the term is) all the Excel add-ons I have, and then see if&nbsp;my Excel's DEP&nbsp;becomes enabled.&nbsp; If it does,&nbsp;I could try to add them back one at a time and see if any of them&nbsp;switch&nbsp;Excel's DEP&nbsp;back to&nbsp;disabled
 in Task Manager.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>(I am assuming that Add-ins are a type of "3rd party extensions and plug-ins" that&nbsp;were mentioned in your link that I quoted above...&nbsp; Yes, the following link discusses add-in incompatibility with DEP:&nbsp;

</p><p>It seems that they can either be inactivated or uninstalled - I'll try to inactivate them first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>result:&nbsp; SOLVED!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I inactivated all the add-ins in my Excel program --&nbsp;and the DEP status for Excel&nbsp;went from "disabled" to "enabled" in Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One at a time, I began to&nbsp;check if any of the add-ins were compatible with DEP, but after testing&nbsp;3 of them (2 were not compatible with DEP), I decided that it was&nbsp;probably a&nbsp;pointless exercise because&nbsp;I don't really use them anyway in Excel (as far as I
 know) and I can turn&nbsp;them&nbsp;on&nbsp;if I come to an Excel&nbsp;situation where I do need them.&nbsp; The one that was compatible with DEP was "Microsoft Office 2007 Help Tab".</p>
