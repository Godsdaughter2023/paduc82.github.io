<h2>            Xbox one preorder process&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am not sure where to put this in the questions page for the Xbox one, but my question is simple. How long does the payment process take when Preordering the console. I put the amount asked for before clicking the check out page, but when I went to check
 to see if the money went through I found out that the money I put in did not get processed yet. So how long does it take for the payment process to go through?</p>

    <title>The final solution to all bloatware, crapware, craplets. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> likeniniteonlybetter  say:</h3>
<h2>            The final solution to all bloatware, crapware, craplets.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>1- This solution is not aimed at outright malware, but at products whose only major problem is being installed without permission or being (sometimes only SOMEWHAT) annoying to deinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- It requires windows installers to be mandatory (windows 10 could do that), to state the company, and have a product ID (this is generally covered by the standard windows installers I think??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- When any installer runs, the following things happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-the user is made aware of every company that is installed stuff (or the installer is blacklisted permanently by windows 10). This lets people see the craplets coming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-it takes a snapshot of the system pre-install</p>
<p>
</p><p>-It allows reversing changes associated with one company either always in all future installs, always for this installer, or just this once. This is available blacklist style (I want Adobe Flash but I please always deinstall "True Key" after since all 3
 browsers install it after each Adobe update and I only want to say "no" once)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-it allows whitelisting companies either permanently, or for one installer, or for one PRODUCT, automatically blacklisting the rest ("install only products from Adobe when installing Adobe flash")</p>
<p>
</p><p>-users can share their settings as text files, so that choices made by an admin can be applied company-wide, or shared by forum users, even about future installs ("I never want Adobe Flash to install anything else")</p>
<p>
</p><p>-None of these steps ever prevent the craplet from INSTALLING, since technically a lot of those product come bundled with mandatory installers and won't let users share or publish craplet-free versions of the installers.<br />
<br />
-No craplet is ever deinstalled without some form of user decision, even if the user can choose to deinstall automatically anything installed by a certain installer that is not the main product without bothering to know what the other installs (that will be
 automatically deinstalled) will be, or use a pre-made decision list from some sort of anti-malware forums.<br />
<br />
-craplets who install recursively other craplets without going thru the same process (letting the user know what is being installed, and letting the user deinstall it) should be banned by windows 10. This includes the well known trick of installing another
 craplet when a craplet is deinstalled as part of the craplet deinstaller...<br />
</p>
<p>-something has to be done about "updaters" that "update" by installing craplets silently and re-installing them several times a day (Adobe Flash update on every browser comes to mind, as I personally deinstalled true key and macaffee something or other 3
 times today, none of which I expected). I don't quite know how to handle updaters, maybe windows 10 should have a SECURE UPDATER PROCESS that is mandatory?<br />
<br />
Please discuss!<br />

            <p>"well, don't install Adobe or Java and block ads, DUH!" isn't always a possible anwser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a game developper supporter (QA), as such Adobe Flash is mandatory to be installed, fresh, security updated weekly, and so is the unity player and a lot of other things (also ALL browsers, meaning each and every single one of them will try to install
 all plugins and all plugins that install craplets will run up to 22 times). A lot of craplets can't be refused automation or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The LEGIT installs we want take 5h 22 minutes by themselves (automated), and due to the constant changes in one or the other they ALWAYS manage to install never seen before craplets on all our test machines regardless of automation knowing about refusable
 craplets and checkboxing it off (besides QUARTER of the checkboxing off is ignored and they install anyhow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a sample craplet (just because this one is well known, it's NOT the worst one), when True Key messes with Cisco Anyconnect because of course something installed it, network immediately jams and so we can't login OR DO ANY CENTRALIZED AUTOMATION and have
 to uninstall True Key in safe mode manually, then flash the bios with a change which requires an USB stick boot (and that USB booting stick needs to be updated each time in a machine trio unique manner to avoid UNROLLING the installs we actually want because
 of this one little bit of windows OS fonts hitting a too many fonts causes the nonstandard-behavior fonts folder to cause hard to track random errors everywhere --- cost us 122h hours of 44 people to learn that folder is special the first time we wrote the
 automation it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we let the "automated" process continue, as each True Key install jams it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Complete with craplets installs/removals, depectiving around for brand new craplets or craplet changes, and the bios flash and safe mode boot for each and every "True Key" install takes 21h average. The lowest was 11h the longest was 174h.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that is done, one of our 44 QA machines is ready for the week. 88 more machines have to be bought so they can be rotated when some of them are full of craplets to the brim and our QA staff can't use them (you read that right --- craplets made us buy
 88 machines as a coping strategy)..</p>
<p>
</p><p>As each machine set is unique (44 sets of 3) we can't just make one and do drive-cloning. All steps the automation doesn't catch have to be done manually. We can't decide when the manual steps will be done due to the length of the automation and the randomness
 of the craplet behaviors on various machines, so an employee is in front of these machines at all times and they have to share notes on what they do EXACTLY because we couldn't get 44 employees to always do the same steps on each machine without it, and so
 many craplets have machine-specific removal steps or behaviors --- coordinating that takes 2 extra employees. Employees who do this have a VERY HIGH TURNOVER due to the frustration, to the point we have 5 extra employees on stand-by at all times --- which
 is not enough when new things like "true key" were first added to installers as we lost so many people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once THAT is done our actual money earning QA staff can work. If you think booting windows take a long time, try being told for 2 weeks in a row we couldn't remove all the craplets and craplet damage from either backup machine nor the production one and
 you have the day off to your employees .... IT SAPS MORALE. Currently machine set 4, 14, and 38 are like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is so DEPRESSING that I decided not to name the company here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ORIGINAL idea had to do with preventing the installing of software without permission (which would be nice but a lot of installers such as Adobe Flash force you to use their craplet loaded installer and have removed Adobe Flash clean installer from ninite
 or similar sites --- you can't install without craplets legally, or something to the same effect despite an apparent permission to do so internally which would be nice if it would actually be technically possible for all 44 machine sets, but only 5 of them
 can do that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why my NEW idea is making sure we can ALWAYS be notified of craplet installs, and ALWAYS be removed fully in one click in a STANDARDIZED WAY that automation can systematically catch up correctly (for us) and confusion on uninstalling can be avoided
 (end users we QA to make their lives easier).</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: the worldwide tech support of low skill users such as kids, grandmas, and other unkilled users dealing with craplets costs certainly so many millions of dollars which they'd rather spend on products they actually want (including legit microsoft/Xbox
 products!!!) --- not to mention the small percentage of them not going to work or not studying or getting depressed over it. The full implementation of my idea (pending some fix for the "auto updaters installs craplets" problem I have not fully figured out
 unless all updaters can be banned by microsoft if they install craplets silently) would do good on par with the discovery of a new antidepressant or the banning of some ADHD/depression causing food additive.<br />
<br />
And we'd all like to have less craplet additives in our digital diet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope microsoft starts taking this idea seriously. Even if I expect them to allow their OWN craplets in, there would be a large reduction in casino site related installers and "adult entertainment" dialers blatantly requesting your credit card number and
 also not having to deinstall a craplet twice would be golden (a windows 10 feature that should be extended to non-microsoft software if all else in my idea fails...)</p>

            <p>The reason Adobe Flash installs True Key without showing the much touted checkboxes to avoid it, is some sort of AdBlocker or having javascript off (Adobe will assume you want the offers you can't see, for which Adobe Flash has been declared evil since they
 start bundling stuff)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The website USED to work with the checkboxes, but the Adobe Website, NOT my ad blocker, has been changed to make sure I can't see the checkboxes to avoid the crapware install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>........this only covers half the browsers, the other half will auto-update without asking or offering anything and install True Key (and sometimes something else). They will not honor a registry key set to stop Adobe Flash from updating during the productive
 part of the day, which means for the most part it happens during work.<br />
<br />
I am only pointing out True Key as part of a larger problem...</p>

            Hi Heather, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />I suggest you try updating the Sticky Notes application or run the troubleshooter for Windows apps.
<br />Next option is to try fixing this issue by putting the computer in a clean boot
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />A “clean boot” starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program.
<br />Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, however that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.
<br />Next option is to try changing the Screen Resolution setting.
<br />- Press Windows + I, then choose System
<br />- Click on Display to open Display Settings
<br />- Under the Resolution section, choose a different smaller resolution
<br />- Then revert it back to normal resolution settings

<p>
</p><p>Original title: Window 10 and 100% Disk Usage on Task Manager</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have had this issue. Windows 10 freezes, even the cursor locks up sometimes. The disk is reported at 100% active although there is no traffic. The freeze disappears as mysteriously as it came about 20 minutes or so later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the fixes I could find online and nothing has worked. Today, quite by chance, I decided to move a folder of video files off drive C: onto a backup disk. This had problems in that it was getting caught up in system freezes. Eventually I was
 left with one file which every time I tried to move the system froze up completely. I guess it was corrupted in some way (?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided it was time to delete it but first checked File History to see if it had been backed up automatically. It was missing from the backup. And then it clicked that File History must be trying to back&nbsp; it up every hour or so and every time the PC was
 freezing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted the file and changed File History to back up less frequently. So far today the PC has behaved impeccably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be difficult to say the least to work out what file might be causing this under normal circumstances but I'm guessing turning off File History might lead you to finding out whether that is a cause.</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker 2012 start up error &#34;Movie Maker c945000e&#34;</h2>
                    I've updated my PC to the latest Movie Maker 2012 but it will not start. The Movie Maker window briefly loads then disappears leaving a little error box which say my PC may not meet the system requirements or that my video card drivers are out of date.
 As far as I can tell my PC meets the requirements and my drivers are up to date.<br />
<br />
OS: Windows 7 32bit<br />
Mainboard: Asus P5KPL-VM<br />
Video card: Intel G33/G31 <br />
Video driver: 8.15.10.1930<br />
CPU: Intel Celeron E3400<br />
RAM: 2048MB PC6400<br />
<br />
Is my PC good enough and up to date? If it is what can I do to get Movie Maker to work again please?<br />

<p>It seems that your system does not meet the requirements to run Windows Movie Maker 2012. Based on the log files that you provided, you're using Intel(R) G33/G31 Express Chipset Family which is listed in the common DirectX 9 video hardware that will not
 run Movie Maker 2012. </p>

<p><span>Hi yosser,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Are you using a wired or wireless connection to get online?
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Do you get any error message/code? If yes, what’s the exact error message?
</span></p>
<p><span>c. After installing Windows 7, did you install the latest network/wireless adapter drivers?
</span></p>
<p><span>d. What’s the model of your laptop?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your question does not contain all the required information needed for us to help you. Please provide us with more relevant information to continue
 with the troubleshooting accordingly. </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the mean time, the issue seems to be as a result of missing appropriate drivers installed on your computer. I’d suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s
 website and download and install the latest Windows 7 compatible drivers for your laptop model.

<h2>            Old HP Desktop Running Windows XP</h2>
                    Could someone please help me, if it is possible, to change my old HP Desktop into an extra hard drive for storage, and extra CD/DVD writer? Is this even possible to use it as extra backup Hard Drive and CD/DVD players? I hate to just trash it and thought
 I could use it as extra equipment. Do I need an Operating System on it? Do I just erase Hard Drive? If anybody has experience with doing this I would appreciate you letting me know. Otherwise, I may just give up on it and send it for recycle. If that is the
 case, how do I erase everything before I trash it? Thanks ahead of time for any and all answers.

            <p>I'm not sure I exactly understand what you want other than you have an old XP machine that you would like to put to good use rather than just discard it.&nbsp; I see two approaches that you might use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Assuming that your Windows 7/8 machine has the proper extra&nbsp;slots/connections, you may be able to take the hard drive and CD/DVD drive out of your old computer and mount them inside your newer computer as extra drives and then throw away the rest of your
 old computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) You can leave your XP machine as it is and connect it to your home network (it is assumed here that you have a internet modem and router or a modem/router combination that provides the networking to all your home&nbsp;computers.&nbsp; Doing this, you could configure
 it similar to a "Network Attached Storage" device (NAS).&nbsp; Using the DVD drive on the XP machine would require logging into that machine, though (either by being in front of it, or by Remote Access).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just because support is going away for XP will not make it any more vulnerable to threats than it is now.&nbsp; And updates to products like Microsoft Security Essentials will likely continue as they support several flavors of Windows.&nbsp; If you are worried, you
 can manually assign it an IP address on your network and omit the Default Gateway parameter.&nbsp; This will make it impossible to communicate through your router to the internet while leaving local communications intact. (Some routers have ways to block specific
 computers from the internet as well).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know where you heard that XP and Win7/8 are not compatible...&nbsp; I have been able to create a network&nbsp;share a folder on my XP machine and easily connect to it from my Win 7 machine and mount it as a drive and move files back and forth without problem.&nbsp;
 You did mention using the drive as a backup drive...&nbsp; With Windows 7, using the Windows backup tool to backup to a network-connected drive is only supported in the "Pro" versions of Windows 7. So whether you can do this depends on the version of your Windows
 7 machine...&nbsp; but moving individual files is not a problem with any version of Win7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to securely erase your hard drive before discarding your computer, you will need to boot your XP system from a CD so that files are not in use on your hard drive.&nbsp; I usually recommend the free
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hirens Boot CD</a>.&nbsp; Create the CD, boot your system from it, and after booting from the CD, you will have several "Nuke" options for securely wiping your hard drive.&nbsp; If you would like to leave your XP machine
 operational but securely remove all you personal files, then simply delete all of your files to the trash can and empty the trash can.&nbsp; Then download/run the program
<a href="http://eraser.heidi.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Eraser"</a> and tell it to erase all unused disk space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet another option is to install a free version of Linux on your old machine...&nbsp; but this takes a lot of patience and research to set it up the way you want and most likely will not work the way you might expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using a USB cable to connect two computers&nbsp;is problematic.&nbsp; USB likes to have one Master device and lots of slave devices.&nbsp; The computer is usually the master device.&nbsp; Connecting two "Masters" together requires more than just a cable with Type-A connectors
 at each end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp; JW</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for giving us an opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that after restarting the computer, the external 2TB Seagate hard drive isn’t detected.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Let us work together to resolve this issue.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, we need more information on this issue. Please answer the following questions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the model of the Seagate Hard Drive?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur in a different USB port?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what you can try:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue occurs in different USB port and on a different computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Try the Hardware Troubleshooter.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might be able to solve some problems by running a troubleshooter that will automatically fix some common issues
 with Hardware Devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the link below.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Boot the computer in Safe Mode and perform Clean Boot.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>: Check if the issue occurs in
<b>Safe Mode</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files
 and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Follow the link below to learn how to do so.</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>: If the issue doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, then proceed
 to <b>Clean Boot</b> steps given in the link below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<b>clean boot</b>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts<b>.&nbsp;
</b>Here is the link for your reference to perform clean boot.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Please go through step 3 of the Kb to keep the computer
 in normal startup after fixing the issue</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Update the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></b></p>

<p>Hello everyone! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I've only been on-line for about 1 year &amp; 3 months (yes, my Xbox 360 has been off-line for an eternity and more) but the one thing that I've noticed with EA servers is that if you're running your internet connection via Wi-Fi, you need
 at least 3 out of 4 Wi-Fi signal strenght bars to connect to their servers. &nbsp;I can attest to this because I used to have 2 out of 4 Wi-Fi signal strenght when I first went on-line and was unable to connect to EA servers with Need For Speed Carbon (regular
 edition) and Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer. &nbsp;Irritated by this, I bought the most powerful router that I could find and moved the modem / router also. &nbsp;Just to be sure, I then also purchased a "Wi-Fi Range Extender" device that takes the signal sent from the router
 and then amplifies it with maximum umph! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I now always get 4 out of 4 Wi-Fi signal Strenght bars and I only get kicked out of EA servers if they are running maintenace / whatever; not because of my connection issue. &nbsp;Please forgive me about not getting
 into the specifics because I am not really a "techy person" when it comes to setting up a Wi-Fi network and stuff. &nbsp;Long story short, with a lot of tech support and some hard earned cash, the results was totally worth it &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Again, I can't give any specific
 details about the new Wi-Fi set-up, but all that I could say is that I purchased the best router, moved the location of the modem / router, and then placed the Wi-Fi Range Extender thing less than six inches away from my Xbox 360. &nbsp;If you're using a cable
 connection and have this issue of being unable to connect to EA servers, then I am sorry, but there is nothing else that I can suggest to fix this problem. &nbsp;Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone! &nbsp;:)</p>

            Hi Amit,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please answer the following questions so that we can assist you <br />
better:</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</div>
<div>2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check the issue. Proceed to next method if only the issue persists after performing each.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong></div>
<div>Run the fixit from the link below and check the issue.</div>
<div><strong>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2</strong></div>
<div>Run Windows update and install if you can find any update for the Webcam. You may refer the link below to do that.</div>

<h3> kekoch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Windows 7 and USB ExpressCard Serial Port</h2>
                    <p>i have an expresscard serial port that says it is installed correctly and working properly using v 3.3.11.152 driver dated 3/12/10.&nbsp; But I am unable to communicate with my device using the serial port.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 Pro with SP1 and all the latest
 updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; It used to work on this laptop within the last 2 weeks and the only difference I can think of is SP1 and the lastest windows updates.&nbsp; Any thoughts or suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled, reinstalled, and updated drivers to see if I can get this to work. I have tried 2 different expresscards and cables.</p>

            Hi Nicolae727
<br />
<br />Before you start, backup your personal data (files) to your D drive
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Once the installation completes, you must then restore your personal data, install a set of device drivers, which you can obtain from the support page for your device on the manufacturers website and then finally re-install all your 3rd party applications . . .

            Hi Nicolae727, 
<br />
<br />You just need to backup your files somewhere, Installing Windows will wipe your hard drive and you will loose all your files otherwise
<br />
<br />So you need to copy all your files to a flash drive, an external drive, to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox.. .etc.), whichever suits you, as long as you have a copy of your files . . .

<h2>            My newly-bought Canon iP2770 won&#39;t let me print on my Windows 7 after installation</h2>
                    <p>I have been searching for answer regarding my problem, which is the title of this thread. I have applied almost all of the fixes, but it gave me no good.</p>
<p>I have bought this Canon iP2770 printer 2 days ago. When I had it tried on the store where I bought it, it actually worked. We even printed a single page. But when I brought it home and installed it on my Neo netbook with Windows 7 as its OS, it had never
 made me print a single page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw fixes like set your printer as default, some registry issues, and even reinstalling my printer driver, but still the problem persisted.</p>
<p>I tried to add a new printer in my devices, but when I choose Canon as the manufacturer, the model, which belongs to iP 2770 series, is not there. I tried to use Windows update to find latest printer models for my OS, but there was none.</p>
<p>When I attempt to print a document, it will only give me the error "Windows cannot print *whatevs* due to the current printer setup."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't brought my printer back to the store yet because I believe that it is not the printer that has a problem. It seems like it is just an installation issue that I believe can be fixed by the user (DIYs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me. I really need to make this work.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So did you install as per Canon instructions, which means using the Canon installation cd and only connecting the printer when instructed, or did you just plug it in and assume all would be OK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And any installation of the Canon software would also have included a Canon diagnostics option

            <p>Yes. I followed all the instructions from the cd installer. I also tried that canon diagnostics option, but it just gave me an answer which can be summed up as nothing is wrong with your printer, and it is connected properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I brought the printer and my netbook to the store and when they reinstalled it themselves, it still did not work. They told me to format my system because it is said to be corrupted, which I am now resorting to.</p>

    <title>Wordperfect X6 not working well in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wordperfect X6 not working well in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 as an upgrade from Windows 8.1 which was working just fine on my HP Pavilion laptop.&nbsp; However, I just discovered several problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Wordperfect X6, when I try to use CRTL-C and CRTL-V, it just does not work at all.&nbsp; Nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to print a graphic at a specific size, (this happens in Powerpoint, Word and Wordperfect, I set the graphic to the desired size and then when I print it, it is much smaller!&nbsp; This did not ever happen when using these programs in Windows 8.1 nor
 in Windows 7 before that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am totally perplexed and don't know where to turn.&nbsp; I've googled etc and cannot yet find anyone posting on this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot see where else to post this question on the Microsoft community site.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this issue specific to only WordPerfect X6? Do copy-paste shortcut keys work on other applications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to copy any content from WordPerfect X6 and paste the content on a WordPad and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Change the Settings of Print Preview:</strong> </p>
<p><span>Before printing the page, go to File menu, click Print preview and select a size setting other than "Shrink to fit." For most pages, 100% should work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<p>Whatever you deleted had nothing to do with the infection. To clean your computer (which probably is still infected), go through the thorough scanning steps at the links below. Don't skip the preparatory work. To fix what you inadvertently broke by removing
 the wrong files, reinstall the drivers for the network adapter and the sound card. See the end of this post for where to get drivers. Note that many variants of malware change the connections in Internet Options to a proxy server so you need to go to Control
 Panel&gt;Internet Options&gt;Connections tab&gt;LAN button and if the boxes in the Proxy Server section are checked, uncheck them.</p>

<p>Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />
