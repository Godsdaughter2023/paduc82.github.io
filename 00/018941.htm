    <title>Access Parameter Query Criteria Syntax - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dromeyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Parameter Query Criteria Syntax</h2>
                    <p>Should be simple, but I'm an Access/Query newbie and can't figure out syntax to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>PRICE SELL QTY&nbsp;&nbsp; (Parameter Query so it asks them a value or just click OK to return all)<br />
<strong>Criteria is:&nbsp; Like "*" &amp; [Enter QTY or Click OK to Display ALL ] &amp; "*"</strong><br />
<br />
This works correctly EXCEPT I need to add "something" to the criteria code that it returns ALL records &gt;0 as well as prompting for a value.<br />
<strong>How would I change the criteria syntax to make it return only records with value &gt;0?&nbsp; Thank you!</strong></p>
<p>(it doesn't work to just put &gt;0 unless I'm putting it in the wrong place)</p>

            Firstly, although you'll sometimes see it recommended as a solution, using the LIKE operator and wildcards is an inefficient, and often unreliable approach to making parameters optional.&nbsp; The inefficiency arises from its inability to make use of the indexes,
 the unreliability from its failure to allow for Nulls in the column in question.&nbsp; The way to do it is to test for a Null parameter in this way:<br />
<br />
WHERE (SomeColumn = [some parameter] <br />
&nbsp; OR [some parameter] IS NULL)<br />
AND (SomeOtherColumn = [some other parameter] <br />
&nbsp; OR [some other parameter] IS NULL)<br />
AND etc<br />
<br />
The logic behind this approach is extremely simple and consequently, given good indexing in the table, very efficient.&nbsp; It also has the advantage of not having to bother about the data type of the column in question, so unlike when building an SQL statement
 in code, consideration does not need to be given as to whether the values need delimiting or not. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Each OR operation is enclosed in parentheses to force it to evaluate independently.&nbsp; These parenthesized expressions are then tacked together with AND operations.&nbsp; The way it works is that each parenthesized OR expression will evaluate to TRUE for each row
 where the value in the column is that of the parameter, or if the parameter is left empty (NULL),&nbsp; for every row.&nbsp; By virtue of the AND operations&nbsp; the WHERE clause as a whole will evaluate to TRUE for those rows where all of the parenthesized expressions
 evaluate to TRUE, so those rows will be returned.<br />
<br />
To exclude rows with a value of zero at the column position you need to add another criterion, using a Boolean AND operation, e.g.<br />
<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM YourTable<br />
WHERE (YourColumn = [Enter QTY or Click OK to Display ALL ]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; OR [Enter QTY or Click OK to Display ALL ] IS NULL)<br />
AND YourColumn &gt; 0;<br />
<br />
Note that when you do this, parameters should only be declared if they are of DateTime data type.&nbsp; If other types were declared they could never be Null.&nbsp; DateTime parameters are unusual in this respect, and it's always advisable to declare them to avoid their
 being misinterpreted as arithmetical expressions rather than dates.<br />
<br />
When building a query like this, the basic unrestricted query can be built in query design view, but the WHERE clause should always be written and, most importantly, saved in SQL view.&nbsp; This applies to the initial saving of the query, and if any subsequent
 amendments are made.&nbsp; If it's saved in design view Access will move things around and at best the logic will be obscured, at worst it might become too complex to open.&nbsp; It's a good idea to save the SQL of such queries in a text file in Notepad or similar,
 as if anything does go wrong you then have something to copy and paste back into the query designer in SQL view.<br />

            Wow! Ken, thank you so much for providing such a complete reply!&nbsp; As a literal newbie, my brain is exploding trying to digest it all but I'll give it a go and try.&nbsp; FYI, the syntax I have above was literally copied and pasted from the Microsoft Access
 criteria examples page on how to do a "parameter query" so it's not just me being dumb :)<br />

            Your HTC Touch Diamond is a VGA device which has a resolution of 480x640 pixels. The programs you are using are probably only for QVGA which has a resolution of 240x320 pixels. This could cause that a program is only displayed in a quarter of the screen
 because VGA is basically 4 QVGA screens. <br />
You should look if the programs you are using are compatible with the VGA resolution.<br />
<br />
If you need any more assistance, Let me know.

            Instead of displaying the preview pane, try choosing the <strong>Large Icons
</strong>or <strong>Extra Large Icons </strong>display in the <strong>Insert Picture</strong> dialog. If nothing else, this will cause Windows to generate thumbnails, and then you may be able to see the preview in the preview pane.

            Hi Dave, &nbsp;I am having the exactly same problem. &nbsp;The preview pane will work sometimes when I first open Word but not for long. &nbsp;It worked fine in Windows 7. &nbsp;I have tried Repairing Microsoft Office but that did not work. &nbsp;I think the problem in with Windows
 10 not with Word. &nbsp;My work around is to preview the pictures in Windows Explorer (Windows Button + E) where the preview works fine, writing down the file name and then in Word inserting that picture into Word blind. &nbsp;Not very user friendly but it does work.
 &nbsp;What ever the problem is it is a bug Microsoft needs to fix!

                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>please I have a trouble with Sharepoint and linking to pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>I made 2 pages in Sharepoint Modern (page 1, page 2).</p>
<p>On PAGE 2 at the bottom I wanted to set something like anchor and link to this position from PAGE 1, but I found only one option and that I can insert a LINK ito the page 1, but only with SEARCH mode =&gt; which leads only to create link to the PAGE - but to
 page not to the position of searched text.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">Please how to make it in new SHARE POINT MODERN view... Standard OFFICE menu not available.

<p>Hi Vik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience, but this function is not available in SharePoint Modern Experience. We hope you could vote for the idea about adding this feature in SharePoint UserVoice:&nbsp;<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration/suggestions/33253909-anchor-links-or-collapsing-sections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Anchor

<p>A question about a feature that's been removed in the modern ui but is still available in classic IS an O365 product related question and should be addressed here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vik.Urbi - Msft is painfully moving away from a more fully featured, flexible and customizable platform to a stripped down "Sharepoint for dummies". Unfortunately we have to trust in their view of what's useful and needed and as you can tell from the modern
 ui, they really have no idea about that. That's why I suggest you stick with classic. You can quite easily style it to look like modern, if that's what you're after. Conversely, you can't restore the classic features to modern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a question, how to use and work with the old version, not moderin UI? I can not open the modern pages with OLD desktop software? Or open the pages with some OLD app web interface or something?</p>
<p>If I am right the set up of the pages in modern style and using modern UI is by corporate default.</p>

<p>Once again, that isn't accurate - it only applies to libraries and lists and you CANNOT switch a site between modern and classic. In a stunningly stupid move - amateurish even by Msft's low standards - the 2 flavors of ui are totally incompatible and there's
 no migration path between them. Rather than futz around with 2 incompatible ui's, you're better off starting again with a classic site and avoiding the modern ui entirely.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li>I think you may have a memory issue or something is just out of sorts with the one you have. Mine was buggy, up until today with V12 firmware update but, it never was that funky where it was that slow.</li><li><strong>BT</strong>: I had one issue with one BT headset made by Plantronics where, it would just stop working and disconnect. I used a Jawbone and it worked fine. So, sometimes it's the headsets that don't work with the devices properly. That same Plantronics
 headset didn't work with my E71 either but, it did work fine with other devices.</li><li><strong>The screen</strong>: It is not bad at all on mine. It's very responsive once you calibrate it to your touch. Have you calibrated it? If not, I would recommend doing it.</li><li><strong>PC detection:</strong> I don't have any issues connecting it with my Mac or PC. I know that I have had issues galore with other Nokias in that regard but, this one is really the only one that connects and stays connected 100% Did you go and setup
 the connectivity preference for how / what mode you want to connect it to by default such as mass storage, PC suite ect? &nbsp;That makes the difference. If your using as a modem or, BT in general, set it to PC suite by default and set it to not have to ask. Just
 allow it to connect automatically and you shouldn't have any issues unless your device is defective.</li><li><strong>Video Recording: </strong>I used mine for all videos on vacation and it was perfect even on the first Rev Firmware - V10.</li><li><strong>Locking function:</strong> It is a PITA yes and why that happens is due to a SW bug. In one error, it does not lock and, when you, the user attempts to unlock it, you actually lock it not knowing that it's already unlocked. Certain apps keep it
 in an unlocked state vs. default locking the touch screen. Now, on the other hand, when it does lock, what some report is that the slide lock doesn't function properly. So, what I found as a workaround was this:&nbsp;</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>when a call is received: use the side lock switch vs. the touch screen slide. It always works for me. One click down, select answer and the call is answered.
<strong>Note</strong>: you may also use the menu key to display whether it is locked or if it just comes on. If an app was left open, it may not even be locked and, by using the menu button, it will either display it's locked or not.</li><li>when the device is in standby mode / has not been in use- hit the menu key first. This will either display the note to unlock the device or, it will just come on due to it NOT being locked (depending on which app is in the current window) or, if you get
 the note, simply use the side key to unlock it by depressing down one time and releasing.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>When I perform the above, I never have any issue with unlocking the device. Part of the issue is not knowing what state the device is in. This happened to me before two or three times. Now, I don't have any issues with that function.</li><li><strong>Browser Crash:</strong> I have had the browser crashing issue but, as of this V12 update and the C memory patch, I have not had this happen since.</li><li><strong>USB charging:&nbsp;</strong>I don't have any issues with that either glad to report. But, there's issues or, was issues with the battery not showing up as full or, stalling out during the charge at two bars. The issue was a software issue with battery
 management. I have seen this same condition with other software that is used to monitor charging. Hopefully in V12, that is now fixed. But, I found a workaround with that as well that always worked 100% and that was to leave the device on at all times during
 charging. Even when / if the battery goes dead, plug it in, wait to get enough energy to power it on and leave it on while charging. But, this may now be resolved with the latest update.</li><li><strong>Factory Apps:&nbsp;</strong>This was another issue that some complained about. I now have 50 MB free on my C drive even with those installed. So, for me, it's not an issue but, I do know what you mean. Some of those can't be uninstalled as they didn't
 include an uninstaller for those apps for some reason. However, if you choose to do a hard format, those / some will be blown out. Soft reset doesn't but, hard reset will do the trick.</li><li>Other devices: On that note, I just tried the new T-Mo My Touch and it really stunk. Some of the keys do not work on the lower row of the SW keyboard and, I found a similar condition with the iPhone when rotating the device. I tried using that thing many
 many times and, I just can't stand the work flow on that thing nor the keyboard freeze ups that I encountered on the new one. I had a BB Bold that had MAJOR bad software that would crash constantly and just didn't work at all along with a bad camera. Same
 with the iPhone 3G that I had- it hung, froze, the keyboard overlapped and Safari would crash all the time not to mention all the dropped calls.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>All devices have issues. Software and hardware. They rush them to meet deadlines and investor expectations and go through great lengths to just get it out there even though they know they are not ready for final release. I know, I work as an engineer and
 see this all the time. But, if your device is as bad as you think it is, either try a soft reset *#7780# or a hard reset and blow out all the non needed apps. I used to reset mine once a week after I upgraded to V11. It would just not work right at all but,
 I knew it was just bad / unstable software and that eventually, Nokia will give us the real OS that this device deserves. Even with all it's issues and buggy sofware quirks, I love the workflow and real world use along with great battery life and call quality
 and prefer this device over the iPhone, ANY HTC device, any Android OS&lt; any BB, Palm, Win Mo device etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you cmcken1 for your kind reply,&nbsp;maybe you&nbsp;heared&nbsp;about&nbsp;my&nbsp;complains before in the different forums all over the web, and i already heared about some of them before i bought my device and i thought that updates will solve this issues, maybe you hear
 from most of the users that the phone free memory doesn't exceeds 23mb after the memory update, i know that Nokia is under stress for the deadline issue but this normally doesn't mean to loss the customer confidence instead of lossing one month of&nbsp;release
 date for example, maybe the next time i'll wait one year after the release date to buy a new phone.</p>
<p>Bythe way there was another problem i&nbsp;forgot to&nbsp;mention in my previous post is the ability to&nbsp;rename the contacts details label (this facility was available since i was using a 6630!! is this an upgrade or downgrade)</p>
<p>Just remember my target is to help (even with my decent&nbsp;effort)&nbsp;Nokia from fallen in this historical tragedy because one day i was proud of using Nokia products and i wish to continue to be.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Shahbour, we all understand your complains coz we have have them... but try z new firmware, most of the bugs are solved now.. also see some really helpful threads on this forum to solve the C space issues.. you need to reinstall many apps to E &amp; change
 message memory to E.. some apps dont uninstall &amp; it's annoying... we all didnt expect the N97 to be this buggy bt with time it's getting better.. as you said we are here to help.. so good luck..

            I agree. We are all hoping that the device that we paid good money for will one day work as advertised if not better. That's what this site has done for me and, I am glad that I am using it as it has really helped me quite a bit. Stick with it- it will
 be better. At least we have had two updates vs. having to wait half a year to a year. The next one is supposed to be big and offer up all the goods- rumors abound.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I know of no way to do this automatically. Word is set to have each footnote in a separate paragraph. Once they are created, you could edit them, removing paragraph marks and replacing them with spaces or tabs.<br />
<br />
I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.<br />
<br />
Regards

            My experience with replacing paragraph marks with tabs is that Word still allows as much space for the footnotes as if they were in separate paragraphs, so nothing is gained. Recent versions allow you to have all footnotes in multiple columns (even if
 the text is in a single column), so if all footnotes are short, that would be another approach.

    <title>Where is the Adobe Acrobat Menu&#47;Ribbon in Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david.lowe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the Adobe Acrobat Menu&#47;Ribbon in Office 2010 Products&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I had Office 2003 on my machine prior to installing Office 2010. My Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. programs all had "Adobe Acrobat" as one of the menu options across the top (I have Adobe Acrobat 7.0.1 installed on my machine), such as "File, Edit, View,
 Tools, Help, Adobe Acrobat".</p>
<p>When I installed the 2010 Office product (I chose "Upgrade" when I installed it), my 2003 programs were removed and replaced by the 2010 programs, which is fine. But when I opened all of the Office programs, none of them have an Adobe Acrobat menu ribbon.&nbsp;
 I have Office 2007 at work, and all of my programs have an Adobe Acrobat ribbon, so I know this is is a functionality that used to exist.&nbsp; Was this functionality removed with the 2010 version?</p>
<p>When I look at my Add-Ins in the Options menu, I see "Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM Addin", so it appears it is active.&nbsp; Also, I can "Save As" a PDF file and it converts the document to a PDF file.&nbsp; But I still would like to see my Adobe Acrobat ribbon across
 the top.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to get back my Adobe Acrobat menu/ribbon functionality back?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>The Acrobat 7 add -in for Office is not compatible with Office 2010. You will have to wait for version 10 of Acrobat to provide the compatibility. This is an Adobe issue and not a Microsoft issue.</p>

<p>1. Un-install anything that is not really necessary.</p>
<p>2. If any applications are installed in the phone memory un-install and re-install on the Memory card..(..note that some applications need to be installed only in Phone memory).</p>
<p>3. Clear the browser cache.( within the Browser--&gt;Options--&gt;Privacy...). Make it a habit of doing this after every use..</p>
<p>4. Keep minimum of messages on the phone.. If you need to keep them, Sync / Back-up with Nokia Suite on PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though a time consuming job, if you want to start afresh do a Soft Reset by dialing *#7370# followed by 12345 (Default code unless set by you) when prompted. Be warned that this will erase all data from the phone memory..so back-up before doing it. You will
 need to restore data and re-install a few applications (even if they are on the Memory Card)..but the results will be surely rewarding.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you use the <strong>Windows Device Recovery Tool</strong>. Start by downloading and installing&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a> (for Windows 10, 8.x
 and 7). </p>
<p>
</p><p>When the installation has finished, start the application and the main screen will appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c08e8589-7d3f-45ad-be6b-7f24d4aa1143" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure to restore your phone using&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect&nbsp;the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).</li><li>After a few seconds, the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.</li><li>After a few seconds more, the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the '<strong>Install software</strong>'/'<strong>Reinstall software</strong>'&nbsp;button to flash your phone</li></ol>
Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Note!</span> Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Saving Excel file NOW requires login and password...</h2>
                    Anyone knows what gives on this? I run Win10 and an O365 subscription. The last few days, whenever I want to open an Excel spreadsheet, I must enter my Windows login and password. Same to save. Was there a patch or upgrade I wasn't aware of? Thanks!

            Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<h2>            Outlook 2016 rules not running automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; I have several rules set up in Outlook 2016 that aren't running on their own, even when Outlook is open on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These aren't marked as client-only rules, but as mentioned, even when the Outlook client is open, messages meeting the criteria still appear in my Inbox (rather than being deleted as directed by the rules).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into my Outlook client and click Rules | Manage Rules &amp; Alerts | Run Rules Now... | Select All | Run Now, the rules run and the messages are deleted from my Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Abby Miller,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be related to the Outlook data files, you may try to repair it to see if issue persists:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, may I confirm with you the following information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>What type of account are impacted, is it Office 365 account, if so, please close all Outlook desktop clients, go to Outlook Web App and create a new test rule to see if it can automatically run as expected.</li><li>Try to set up your impacted account on other PC to see if this issue occurs on specific client.</li><li>Double-check all your rules to see if there are any rules conflict. Also double check other account settings, like forwarding, or others.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Bug with driving mode not turning off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> directmattyg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug with driving mode not turning off</h2>
                    <p>I think I have found a bug in the way Bluetooth devices interact with each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Lumia 930 with 8.1, I have a parrot car kit that connects to my Lumia via Bluetooth. When I start the car, the 930 bluetooth connects to the car kit, and driving mode on the phone is turned on. When the car is turned off, the parrot hands free disconnects
 from the phone and&nbsp;driving mode turns it self off. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I recently got some nokia treasure tags, which I attached one&nbsp;to my keys. these treasure tags also use Bluetooth, and a constant&nbsp;connection between the&nbsp;treasure tag and the&nbsp;phone is established.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I have found, is&nbsp;when the treasure tag is&nbsp;connected and the parrot car kit is also connected&nbsp;driving mode turns on, BUT driving mode then&nbsp;never turns off!</p>
<p>Even&nbsp;after I have&nbsp;turned the car off,&nbsp;even though Bluetooth does not have a connection to the parrot anymore,&nbsp;driving mode is still enabled. So&nbsp;I am missing all notification sounds on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I go into the driving mode settings in the settings menu, it immediately turns off, as soon as that settings page loads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I have found that if a&nbsp;treasure tag is connected,&nbsp;driving mode will not turn it self off&nbsp;automatically. But by disabling and&nbsp;only using the parrot Bluetooth as the only connected Bluetooth device on the phone. Driving mode turns on and off as it should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Bug? I think so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>What are the ways to select a workbook when it comes to VBA.&nbsp;I know there are a few ways.&nbsp; Basically I want to select the active workbook.&nbsp; Can you explain how I would enter this with regards to VBA Code.&nbsp; Is there more than one way to select the active
 workbook when entering VBA code.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I would run the macro from my personal macro book rather than the current workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also can you explain why some macro don't&nbsp;work from a personal macro book but they do run if the macro is only kept in the active workbook.&nbsp; Is there a&nbsp;command that prevents the macro running form the personal macro book.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am a Microsoft Community expert here to help you. 
<br />
<br />This might work for you:
<br />
<br />Function ActivateWB(wbname As String) &lt;p&gt;  'Open wbname.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;  Workbooks(wbname).Activate&lt;/p&gt; End Function 
<br />
<br />To execute it, you simply pass the name of the workbook you want to activate as follows:
<br />
<br />ActivateWB("vbacode.xls") 
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know I'm happy to try to solve your problem.

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I am bit confused - I asked for ways you can select a workbook with an explanation.&nbsp; I can see you have quoted -&nbsp;activateWB("vbacode.xls") .&nbsp; If a run a macro do I specify the macro name ie sub newmacro() and then insert the activateWB"the
 name of the workbook".xls"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you clarify the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand from my research there are many ways to activate the current workbook.&nbsp; Perhaps you could explain the various ways a workbooks can be selected by using VBA code.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />This is a user-to-user, peer-support, forum. It is not a tutorial nor a book on Excel vba.
<br />
<br />I do not know all the ways to activate (select) a workbook. I am a tyro in Excel vba.
<br />
<br />Here are two statements:
<br />activeworkbook.Activate
<br />workbooks(1).Activate
<br />
<br />Workbooks do not have a "select" method, but rather an activate method which brings the focus to that workbook. Worksheets in workbooks do have a select method.
<br />workbooks(1).Sheets(1).Select
<br />
<br />What, exactly, are you trying to accomplish. I or someone else here can help you do that.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<p>Hi JoLethbridge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Outlook mobile app on your Android phone crashes when you open it, I would suggest that you clear the browser's cache on your device. Once done, kindly uninstall and reinstall the application and check if the issue still occurs.</p>

            I also got a brand new phone with Android 8.1 a week ago. After installing the app, it seemed to work for a couple of days then it started to crash every time I tried to scroll down. Now, it is even crashing upon opening. I tried clearing the cache data
 then the application data and reconfigured the app again to no avail. Sometimes, it seems to open for a few minutes then crashes again. I have the latest app updates installed (yesterday evening). Any solution yet to have it properly working.

            I have probably a hint now why it is crashing at least in my case: Apparently, when an email is deleted or moved to another folder on the server causing the list on the phone to scroll up since it was last opened, the application will crash. Subsequently,
 it won't open normally until a new email arrives (which probably will cause the screen not to scroll up). Perhaps, other community users who are facing the same problem can validate the scenario and hopefully we can get a quick fix then.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Update on the above: The crash seems to be triggered by the presence of an Outlook Calendar Response (e.g. accepted) regarding a requested meeting in the list to be displayed on the phone. Once this request is deleted, the application will behave normally
 (unless there is another meeting response in the list).

<h2>            Need to recover custom functions from a corrupt Addin &#34;.xlam&#34; file ...</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I was&nbsp;using Microsoft Excel 2013 and working on a custom function when my system crashed. Initially,&nbsp;I had problems loading Excel after rebooting. Once I&nbsp; disable .xlam file is there any way to&nbsp;salvage&nbsp;my other custom&nbsp;functions&nbsp;that were saved in this file?
 Is there anyway to&nbsp;access or work on the .xlam file outside of Excel?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide.<br />
<br />

<p>The following will insert the filename in the header and the page number in the footer without the need to use the building blocks which are almost certainly the problem. Note that there are potentially three headers and footers for each section of the document.

    <title>When printing Excel workbook to a PDF, columns get shuffled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kerryeriksen  say:</h3>
<h2>            When printing Excel workbook to a PDF, columns get shuffled</h2>
                    We have a multi-sheet workbook we would like to print to Adobe. We go to File - Print and choose "Adobe PDF" as the printer. It defaults to only print "Active Sheet," so we change it to "Entire Workbook." This causes it to turn black and white so we have
 to click on Page Setup in the print preview and go to Sheet and uncheck the Black and White box that has suddenly become checked. This makes it color the way we want it. But the columns of one (or more) of the sheets have gotten jumbled. It's supposed to go
 "Cost code" then "Sale price" but the Adobe PDF print preview shows that the "Sale price" column now comes before "Cost code." How can we get the columns to print in the correct order?&nbsp;

            <p>We are not printing the Excel file to a paper printer because our intention is to show a PDF version of the Excel workbook to our field employees, so they can view it onscreen. We are largely a paperless company. As to why we would prefer to send them a
 PDF, rather than the original Excel workbook, PDFs are better suited for viewing only, rather than a workbook which is better suited for editing. We are using Adobe Acrobat X and Excel 2016. The "printer" name is just "Adobe PDF." It does not give a version
 number. This issue of the columns not being in the correct order seems to be only with one file so far.
</p>
<p>Here are the recorded steps of when I try to print to Adobe PDF from Excel 2016:</p>

<p>I've also tried initiating the creation of the PDF using Adobe rather than initiating it from Excel but Adobe seems to assume that I only want to use the active sheets of the workbook, when I want the entire workbook. Here are some screen shots of that:</p>

            The replies so far have not resolved this problem. When printing the entire workbook to the printer "Adobe PDF," or when saving the entire workbook as a PDF, either way, the columns of some of the worksheets do not display in the correct order.

    <title>Dropped Calls on Lumia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colonel flame  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dropped Calls on Lumia</h2>
                    
<p>Lumia 610, 800 and 520. When a call connects the signal drops to zero. Regardless of how many bars I have. That's on WP7. On the Lumia 520, again no matter how many bars, it will dial for 40 seconds and then the call will be dropped, without fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had my 520 in the heat for a few hours and since then it's being weird. Trying the sim on a different phone made no difference so I replaced the sim. Awesome for an hour (enough to get home) but then it happens again. Now I've replaced it a second time
 and it's just been the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blue Moon:</p>
<p>A call went through there (Lumia 610) with three bars. Call quality is bad enough (similar to having one bar) even at full reception. Without moving the phone all calls are now timing out. Outgoing: 40 seconds and dropped, Incoming: long pause and voicemail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope this is just some stupid error on my part but I kind of need basic functionality in a phone!</p>

<p>Hi Sserg,</p>
<p>Since the import service feature is currently in preview, we are still working to improve the user experience for this service. Therefore, I suggest you wait some time to see whether you can import successfully. Or, you can use PST Capture. For details about
 it, you can refer to:&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh781036(v=exchg.141).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Exchange PST Capture</a>. Or, you can

use the Outlook client to import the PST file</a>s as a workaround.</p>
<p>Please note: the PST Capture is not supported in our forum, so if you run into any problems when using the tool for the import, I recommend you post a thread in the&nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-us/home?category=exchangeserver%2Cexchangeserverlegacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange
 forum&nbsp;</a>for professional assistance.</p>
