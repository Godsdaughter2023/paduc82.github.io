    <title>Haansoft Hangul 2007 for Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 크리욤터퍼  say:</h3>
<h2>            Haansoft Hangul 2007 for Windows 8</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new computer, Samsung DM301, and have been unable to install Haansoft Hangul 2007 with the cd that the vendor sent to me. It's possible that the application will not run under an English language O/S. It runs without any problem
 on systems with a Korean language O/S. I regularly use a Korean/English English/Korean dictionary, .hwp WP, etc. for my work, but this is an obstacle. Perhaps, someone could recommend a work-around.

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind, courteous and prompt reply. </p>
<p>Initially, I was getting messages such as, "Cannot install the WindowsInstaller,"</p>
<p>and simply, "stopped installation." </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, I had already installed language packs for Korean and Russian. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the solution that ultimately worked and solved some other hangul (native Korean script) recognition issues.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Go to Clock, Language, Region</p>
<p>2) Select Region</p>
<p>3) Click on the Administrative tab</p>
<p>4) Select Language for non-Unicode programs</p>
<p>5) Change system locale to Korean</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After which, the Haansoft application installation proceeded very smoothly and satisfactorily.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thank you for your assistance and thoughtful research. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warmest regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Live Mail saves subject header but loses the email body - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaitie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Live Mail saves subject header but loses the email body</h2>
                    14 years ago I started out with Win 98, upgrading to XP when it came out, and then to Windows 7 (skipping Vista), and during this time I used Outlook Express since its inception, and then Live Mail since its inception. &nbsp; When I transferred my Outlook Express
 database (email store) to Live Mail, well, ever since the "upgrade" there's been a serious problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Live Mail eats and destroys the bodies of email, but saves the header when email is transferred from online storage to local, offline, storage. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every new offline storage folder I create in Live Mail seems to have these properties: &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) &nbsp;The folder appears normal, &nbsp;(2) email transferred from online to the offline storage folder *appears* to transfer correctly, as subject headers identical to
 the online email appear in the email list in the storage folder, but (3) when one actually selects a subject header in the offline storage folder, only the email body of the *first* email placed in the folder is ever displayed. &nbsp; &nbsp; So with the exception of
 the first email in each folder, all others display the wrong email body. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As a result, essentially only one email is actually accessible, the first one. &nbsp; &nbsp;(At least I think it's the first, regardless only one email is ever stored in a normally accessible way). &nbsp; All subsequent emails placed in the folder correctly show their
 respective subject headers, (leading one to believe the email has been safely deposited offline), but the email body is entirely incorrect, simply replicating the email body of the first email in the queue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem appeared originally as a bug in the Outlook Express database transfer option available in Live Mail: &nbsp;many, but not all, of the folders began acting in this way when I first tried to upgrade from Express to Live Mail. &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the new folders
 I created in Live Mail did work correctly, and I used them to replace the malfunctioning folders transferred from Express. &nbsp; Interestingly, if I tried transferring the defective emails from a "bad" folder to a new, "good" folder, it seemed to corrupt the new
 folder as well, so subsequent emails would lose their body and have it replaced with the one replicated email body. &nbsp; &nbsp;However, recently, I noticed any new folder I created would end up losing the email bodies.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I never could get the import function to work correctly between Outlook Express and Live Mail: &nbsp;it always scrambled folder titles (truncating them and adding a garbage alphabetic string, similar to (but not identical to) the way long file names get corrupted
 by the OS when transferring to, or working with, a FAT directory. &nbsp; And as mentioned, many of the "transferred" folders ended up being corrupted with this subject header/email body bug.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>QUESTION: &nbsp; (1) have my email bodies been lost, or are they just being hidden by this bug? &nbsp;(2) How do I fix or work around this bug? &nbsp;(3) &nbsp;Is there any safer way of preserving and transferring the Live Mail stores without getting corruption of the folder
 titles or email bodies? &nbsp; "Import" and "Export" do not seem to work properly.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Kaitie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the inconvenience that you experienced.&nbsp;For your first question, I am afraid the email bodies were lost. Do you still have the backup copy of the messages that you transferred to Live Mail? If yes, you can transfer it again. Before doing this,
 I suggest that you un-install and re-install your Live Mail first. For the steps, please refer to the article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I uninstall Windows Live Mail?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then install back your Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, to transfer the files to Live Mail, please follow that steps provided in the article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I import and export email, contacts, and calendars with Windows Live Mail?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure that you follow all the steps correctly so that the transfer will be successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, I recommend that you read this article, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>
<i>Are you virus scanning emails?&nbsp; What program?</i></p>
<p>
Microsoft Security Essentials ... not sure if it scans emails. </p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<i>How do you use WLMail?&nbsp; Does it run whenever the computer is on?</i></p>
<p>
I manually start WLMail, but may subsequentlly leave it on for awhile, esp. if I'm corresponding back and forth with someone.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<i>Do you close WLMail immediately before turning off the computer?</i></p>
<p>
No, not always, but frequently I do, if only to speed the shut down process.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<i>What are your maintenance settings?&nbsp; Alt, F, O, M, Advanced tab, Maintenance button</i></p>
<p>
Not sure, the instructions provided didn't correspond to anything actionable on my computer.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<i>Have you ever compacted the folders?</i></p>
<p>
I have emails dating back to 1998, I believe the old Outlook Express periodically compacted its email store automatically. &nbsp; I never did this intentionally. &nbsp; Occasionally I compressed folders on my hard drive, &nbsp;but I don't recall ever doing this to the email
 stores. &nbsp; &nbsp;It may have been done unintentionally at some point, though. &nbsp; &nbsp;The stores are presently uncompressed.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<i>How many folders and messages do you have?</i></p>
<p>
about 160 storage folders, and probably 30,000 to 50,000 emails but most of those I think are in a deleted folder. &nbsp;But at the least about 10,000-25,000 emails. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<i>Where are you seeing the incorrect folder name?</i></p>
<p>
On many of the longer folder names which were imported from a prior version of LM, and from OE before that. &nbsp; Basically, I have never been able to import folders without this title corruption occurring on some folder names. &nbsp; Here's an example:</p>
<p>
Utility Correspondence was changed to Utility Cor 364</p>
<p>
So what I have always had to do was essentially reconstruct every (100+) folder names by retyping each full folder name after any import of email stores.</p>
<p>
From my perspective, Live Mail has been a real disaster from the start. &nbsp; I don't recall having so many problems during Outlook Express upgrades, although I could have just forgotten. &nbsp; I've had to basically always transfer emails folder by folder to get them
 in properly. &nbsp; The import function on LM has never worked. &nbsp; It's always corrupted folder titles. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I also associate the email body bug with Live Mail, as that's when I first noticed it after upgrading to it. &nbsp; &nbsp;There's no real pattern to it that I can detect. &nbsp; Some folders are corrupted so that every email dropped in it &nbsp;has its body chopped off while its
 header is maintained. &nbsp; Yet other folders remain ok. &nbsp; Sometimes a new folder which I create will be ok and I can add emails to it, and other times the new folder is the corrupted type which eats email bodies.</p>

<h2>            Problems ripping</h2>
                    I can't rip a particular CD (others will rip), plus, rip sepeed is SLOW! Yesterday, I could rip every CD I tried and they all ripped quickly w/o problems. Today, however, it doesn't seem to recognize 1 CD, and thus, I can't rip it. I am able to rip other
 CDs, but at an incredibly slow rate. What's up?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to know that the information in my response had helped you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any error message when you are using Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The following factors can influence ripping speed:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
&nbsp;<br />
a• Your computer may take longer to rip a CD if it has a slower processor or not enough RAM. Windows Media Player requires a 233 megahertz (MHz) processor or faster to run and at least 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM, but a 1.5 gigahertz (GHz) processor or faster
 and at least 512 MB of RAM are recommended.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b• The amount of free space and fragmentation on your hard disk can affect the speed of the ripping process. Windows Media Player requires at least 100 MB of free hard disk space, but at least 60 gigabytes (GB) of free space is recommended. Excessive fragmentation
 of your hard disk can also slow the ripping process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c• Both the speed and the interface of the hard disk drive that you are ripping tracks to can affect the ripping speed. For example, a 5400 rpm hard disk drive will likely write
 drive.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d• Both the speed and the interface of the CD drive that you are ripping tracks to can affect the ripping speed. Generally, drives at higher speeds will rip songs from a CD faster than drives at lower speeds. Similarly, Windows Media Player will probably perform
 better when using a CD drive connected via IEEE 1394 or USB 2.0 than when using a drive connected via USB 1.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e• The device settings for your CD drive can affect CD ripping speed.
<strong><span>To access settings for your device, do the following:</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;In Windows Media Player, on the Tools menu, click Options. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;On the Devices tab, click your CD drive in the list of devices, and then click Properties.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the Audio tab, when Digital is selected in the Rip area, digital mode is used when ripping CDs. If you have problems ripping tracks when Digital is selected, click Analog instead. This is especially important if you notice hiccups or pops in the ripped audio
 files and your CD drive is a slower drive (either single-speed or double-speed).
<br />
When the Use error correction check box selected in the Rip area, the Player will try to fix problems that are caused when songs are ripped to your computer. This can help reduce any noise in the audio, but it can increase the time needed to rip songs from
 a CD. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
f• A problem with your CD drive or CD can reduce ripping speed. For example, the lens inside the drive—through which the laser passes to read from and write to discs—might be dirty or dusty. You can purchase a CD lens cleaner kit to clean the lens. Also, the
 disc could be dirty or damaged. Try gently cleaning the disc with a soft, lint-free cloth and soapy water, and be sure to keep your discs in jewel cases when not in use.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
g• Settings in Windows Media Player can also affect the speed at which songs are ripped from CDs. To access these settings, on the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Rip Music tab.
<br />
Select different formats in the Format drop-down list box to see if that speeds up the ripping process. For example, ripping songs in Windows Media Audio (WMA) format usually takes less time than ripping songs in MPEG Audio Layer-3 (MP3) format. You can also
 try moving the Audio quality slider to find a balance between audio quality, file size, and ripping speed that works for you.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
h• Using Windows Media Player to do something else while you are ripping tracks—such as playing a video or browsing an online store—can make the ripping process slower. Similarly, running other programs on your computer while you are ripping can slow the process
 as well.</span></p>

            hey Tronix.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See other methods to access Color Mgmt:  <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/5-ways-to-open-color-management-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/5-ways-to-...</a>
<br />
<br />If Access Denied persists Try this:  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this: <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10#comment-334148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />What is the antivirus? I'd uninstall it and use built-in Defender to troubleshoot this.
<br />
<br />If you type Defender Security Center in Start Search, open it, then choose Virus and Threat Protection Settings, is Controlled Folder Access turned On?
<br />
<br />Also in Security Center under App and Browser Control, is Check Apps and Files set to Block?  Change to Warn.  
<br />
<br />Is Device Guard enabled?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enable-disable-device-guard-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary try taking ownership of any folders that won't allow access:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, set up new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />
<br />If all else fails  remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Remote Desktop Services Windows 2016 No Domain Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidreeseprx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Services Windows 2016 No Domain Controller</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just trying to see if I can get a succinct answer to whether I can run a remote desktop service (RDS) on Windows 2016 without having a Domain/Active Directory setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my understanding, I need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>RDS Session Host</li><li>RDS License Server&nbsp;</li><li>RDS Broker and/or Gateway</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't seem to be able to do is select the Standard/Quick Start (one server) setup as it continues to complain about my local machine not being a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: &nbsp;Can I use a 5 User CAL license on a RDS server that is a single host not on a Domain?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does running on an EC2 instance in AWS change this ability?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>You can try buying a more expensive monitor.&nbsp; In my experience, this usually fixes the problem. If that doesn't work (or you can't afford to buy a new monitor), you can take your computer to a local Best Buy. To the best of my knowledge, this is a&nbsp;fairly
 common problem (this happened to my dad's computer).</p>

            What ID?
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core will install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro will install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />To find out if you have the right edition installed:
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Edition.
<br />
<br />If the edition of Windows 10 installed does not correspond with the edition of Windows 7 or Windows 8 you were previously running, then you need to reinstall the right edition.

            Did you run the troubleshooter in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?
<br />
<br />Also, if you originally had Pro, then you need to upgrade again to it.
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro using the following default product key:
<br />VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T

<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate

            <p><span>Hi Neel Jadeja,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should have Bluetooth capability in HP Split x2, check if the driver is working fine in device manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + X, select <strong>device manager
</strong>from the list.</span></li><li><span>Check if you find Bluetooth driver in the list. Right click on the driver and click on Update Driver Software.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also check if the Bluetooth service is running.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows Key + R, type <strong><em>services.msc
</em></strong>in the box and press enter.</span></li><li><span>Double-click the <strong>Bluetooth Support service</strong>.</span></li><li><span>If the Bluetooth Support service is stopped, click
<strong>Start</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the Startup type list, click
<strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>-Is this issue specific to dr. dre beats pill? Are you able to use other Bluetooth devices?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Add the dr. dre beats pill device manually and check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you've verified that a Bluetooth adapter is installed on your computer, and the device you want to connect with is discoverable, you can add most Bluetooth enabled devices to
 your computer. Here's how:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press Windows key + X, select Control Panel from the list, click on
</span></span><span><span>Devices and Printers</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></li><li><span>Click <span>Add a device</span>, and then follow the instructions.</span></li><li><span>Click the Bluetooth enabled device you want to add to your computer, and then click
<span>Next</span>. If you don't see the device you want to add, make sure the device is turned on and discoverable. If you just turned on the device, it may take Windows several seconds to detect it.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows might ask you to enter a pairing code (sometimes called a PIN or passcode). Most Bluetooth enabled devices need to be paired with your computer before they can exchange information
 with each other. To do this, they must exchange protected pairing codes. This means that only the wireless devices you authorize can connect with your computer.</span></p>

            Hi Anil, thankyou for your detailed response. Unfortunately, I am still unable to activate the Bluetooth on this HP Split. I followed all your instructions, and even when applied the changes, the Beats Pill was still not recognized. Is there a Bluetooth
 driver or something I can download? Thank you so much for your assistance, just trying to get this to work...

            I found the product key on the side of my desktop PC, and I've entered it way too much for it to be an incorrect product key. I am trying to download Windows 7 Home Premium x64. It probably has a repair disk to restore Windows 7, but my dad, the original
 owner of the PC lost it. I will attempt to entery the key again, and I'll see what the error message is.

<p>Microsoft has made it difficult to obtain legitimate copies of ISO files for Windows 7 for owners of non-retail Windows 7 product keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, at the present time there are two website from which you can download an ISO file from which you can make an installation DVD or USB flash drive for Windows 7.&nbsp; Each of the websites has an issue.</p>

 with malware and stolen or counterfeit software -- but as far as I know, this site has legitimate files.&nbsp; You will need to install a torrent client to download these files.</p>

<h2>            Can not enable atmos on Xbox One X</h2>
                    <p>Have a Sony STR-DN1080 Atmos enabled receiver. Xbox running through a Caavo box. Installed Dolby app. Switched settings according to app. Then this error:</p>
<p>"There was a problem using this setting. Make sure your audio receiver supports it. Also make sure to choose at least one audio setting. Both can't be off.(0x80bd0009).
</p>
<p>Receiver is atmos enabled. Have tried playing with settings on receiver and xbox. Have reached out to Caavo but i doubt it is being caused by it. I know caavo does not support Dolby Vision but neither does my TV. Trying to avoid tearing apart and trying
 to isolate the problem. Anyone have any advice?</p>

            OK that fixed it. Ran the caavo box to receiver then receiver to TV. Had to try a couple different inputs on the receiver because HDR went away. Now I have green checks on everything but Dolby vision which my TV does not support.

<h2>            Multiple apps in task manager</h2>
                    <p>In task manager should there be multiple of the same apps open E.G. Cortana (2) Microsoft Edge (12) when only 2 pages open and Microsoft Store (2). As I have upgraded my system and on the old system it didn't have multiple apps open on it.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Software conflicts are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. To help you isolate your concern, we'd like to ask a screenshot of your desktop screen along with the
<strong>Task Manager</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please make sure to remove all private information when sending a screenshot.<br />

Looking forward to your response.

<p><strong>Task Manager</strong> is where users can view the informative statistics about a computer's performance. We can use this to start or stop a process but we cannot remove the apps without uninstalling it from the
<strong>Programs and Features</strong>. So long as the CPU and GPU are in 0% and not running, there should be no problem.</p>

<p>The answer to your question is 'yes' because each individual component of Cortana, Microsoft Edge, and many other apps gets its own entry in Task Manager.</p>

<h3> fishholiday  say:</h3>
<h2>            Status 0xc000000f - The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible</h2>
                    <p>There have been similar posts but this computer has no access to any disk device.</p>
<div>
<p>Have completed update on two old PC's - no real problem</p>
<p>Tried main computer with lots of software / development work</p>
<p>Upgrade seemed to be working till 44% / 32% (sub) then froze.</p>
<p>After checking advice (3 hours later) switched off, left for about 20 minutes and then switched on again.</p>
<p>System attempt recovery back to W7 but seems to have failed as the following now appears:</p>
<p>WINDOWS FAILED TO START. recent hardware ............ ........ .........</p>
<p>Status 0xc000000f - The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible</p>
<p>I took the recommended steps like trying to use recovery disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE PROBLEM IS THAT NO DISK DEVICES are recognised by the system anymore and the dvd drive (or hard drives) cannot be read.</p>
<p>Setup still has all the devices and tried changing boot sequence but nothing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One maybe unusual thing I did was have W10 downloaded on an SD card. Not sure if this has confused Windows in some way.</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure that there is a very simple solution and feel that all that is needed is to get W7 to recognise the drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who can help or experienced similar? TIA</p>

            <p>Here is what seems to have happened. <br />
</p>
<p>1. Tried update to W10 using SD card, update failed. <br />
2. System tried a restore to W7 <br />
3. This failed and pc would not boot up (see above error) <br />
4. Eventually managed to boot up using a W7 disk from another PC AFTER setting boot sequence to CD first.<br />
5. Ran sfc /scannow which fixed up the boot partition after working out that somehow the W7 restore had wrecked this. (trying to run dell backup told me that the partition was wrecked)
<br />
6. Finally tried a stand alone reboot and it worked, looks like W7 is back to normal and hopefully will remain so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this will help someone sometime.</p>

    <title>Sidewinder X8 not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skream86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sidewinder X8 not working&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so I just received the sidewinder X8 in the post, I was so happy it had arrived! well....that was short lived. I have installed all the drivers and it does not work. All the lights come on and when i plug the charger in it shows that it is currently
 charging, but nothing happens, I move the mouse... nothing, press the buttons... nothing. I am using it on my desktop currently operating on windows 7. I have tried every USB port, uninstalling and reinstalling the correct software but it never works. It shows
 that the drivers are installed and it recognizes that the X8 is there, but I just can't fathom why it won't work.</p>
<p>I plugged it into my laptop which runs on vista and it worked the second I plugged in the wireless receiver.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with this issue? Thanks.</p>

    <title>Computer keeps turning off WiFi automatically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidgrange  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer keeps turning off WiFi automatically</h2>
                    <p>I'm using windows 10 on my laptop. It keeps turning off my WiFi by itself. If I run the troubleshooter it says that WiFi capability has been turned off. If I tell it to turn it back on it normally does, but minutes (or even seconds) later it turns it back
 off. I went to the internet settings window and can see that it has been turned off. When I turned it back on, I literally watched it switch it back off a second later all by itself right before my eyes. Any idea why it keeps doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>

<p>Did you made any changes to your PC?</p>
<p>Is your PC up to date with Windows Updates?</p>
<p>Is it happening after any Windows Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess some application or infected system files causing this issue. If in case this is happening after making some changes to your laptop, then I suggest you to undo those changes to see if it fix the issue. Also go for a complete system scan with Windows
 Defender or with any Antivirus Software to make sure that your PC is virus free.</p>

            <p>It started happening this morning. When I went to do a system restore, the restore point said to go back to 2/9/16 when a critical update occurred. It does not give me any other restore points. I have tried to do the system restore 3 times but I keep getting
 this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>System restore could not access a file. This is probably because an anti-virus program is running on the computer. Temporarily disable your antivirus program and retry system restore.</p>
<p>An unspecified error occurred during system restore. (0x80070005)</p>
<p>You can try system restore again and choose a different restore point. If you continue to see this error, you can try an advanced recovery method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have Kaspersky antivirus on my computer. I turned it off the last two times I tried system restore but it didn't help. I also use windows defender. I try to bring it up but when I click on the program it says that it is already turned off but doesn't let
 me get to where I can change that. When I go the long way and get to those settings. It says that it is on but the area where you are supposed to be able to switch that is greyed out and does not respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am up to date on all of my windows updates as well. As I am typing this out, I have to go back to my settings each time I change the page to turn my WiFi back on because it keeps switching itself off.</p>

            The last successful update was for Microsoft Office 2013 on 2/9/2016. Then it failed to install Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems &nbsp;(KB3135173) on 2/14/2016. That was the day after the WiFi started switching off. I haven't
 made any other changes to my pc. But when I tried restarting today, I got a notice saying that Windows Host Task was preventing background programs from running, and it listed windows update as the programbeing stopped. My laptop as at the shutdown screen
 but did not restart even after a minute or more had passed. I did a hard reset. Now I am at the update screen and it started to update. I came back and few minutes later and it said it was up to date but that it was last updated on the 9th. So I had it check
 for updates. A minute later it said that it was already up to date. I checked the update history and now it says that it successfully installed that cumulative update on today's date of 2/18/2016.

<p>
</p><p>I just started having this same issue with the latest Windows 10 update December 2017. Tried doing system restore twice but both times failed to restore back to Dec 20th. Does not give other restore points to choose from. Tried troubleshooter and thats a
 joke. It just tells me my wifi capability is turned off. (No s**t captain obvious) when I select the option to fix it...NOPE not fixed!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was running just fine then all of a sudden my wifi is switched off on won't allow me to switch it back on. It also won't let me turn off airplane mode. No clue how that was even turned on to begin with. Don't know if that has anything to do with
 it or not. Somebody please advise!</p>

<h2>            I believe my PC has been hijacked</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1, all security patches up to date, running current mcafee virus and firewall protection. &nbsp;Noticed under Recent folder, MyDocs had been accessed recently, but not by me. &nbsp;there were about 10 .eml files in that folder, which turned out to be very
 old emails from years ago. I did not put them there, and do not even recognize the emails, although I recognized one name in the list of recipients. &nbsp;I opened them carefully with notepad so as to not run any executables. emails normally stay in outlooks confined
 email database environment - how would these old files appear as new all of a sudden?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I did a search for other files updated on the same date as when the emails were created, and noticed new Word templates .dotm with some sophisticated addons same with email templates. &nbsp;I can't imagine Microsoft would download these templates automatically
 and I didn't create them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>any by comment much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Do you mean hacked rather than hijacked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, here is a list of things that I have put together from various websites:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First of all check if any rogue programs are running. Start Task Manager by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc then on the Startup Tab, right-click and Disable any entries that are unknown to you. Repeat this for the Services Tab, where you can check an entry online.
 If you disable anything restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It’s probably not relevant these days but this only takes a few seconds to check. Open a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type cmd and press Enter. Now type system.ini and press Enter. If under [drivers] there is an entry user=user.drv, you may have been
 hacked, so restart the computer and check again. An entry of timer=timer.drv is safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Now check the net statistics:<br />
3A. Open a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type cmd and press Enter. Now type netstat -ano and press Enter. If ‘Established’ is in the State column, make a note of the PID and the Addresses alongside it, as someone may be hacking you. If the IP Address begins
 with 192.168, you are safe as it’s part of your home network.<br />
3B. To check if you are being hacked, open Task Manager by hitting Ctrl+Shift+Esc. Go to the Details Tab.<br />
3C. If the PID that you noted in 3A appears and it is not a name that you recognise, right-click it and End the task. You can click the word PID at the top to sequence the numbers to make it easier to find. Restart the computer and check again.<br />
3D. If you didn’t find the PID, restart the computer and rerun the netstat –ano command. Open Google in a browser window and type the IP Address into the search box. If it’s a suspicious site, restart the computer and check again.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks very much for your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have looked under T ask M anger and there are so many things running that I don't recognize. &nbsp;69 processes running, now have pared this down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Under drivers there is wave=mmdrv.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Under netstat there were 7 established - local address was all 192.168 but foreign addresses were 24.244, and 134.170. When I looked at details for the pid one was running under my username, Settting Sync Host, Host Process. Another was running under
 system, svchost.exe host process for windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a great technician in and he is confident all is well. So again, thanks for responding so quickly and giving me the help. If you have any further comments on what netstat shows, it would be interesting to hear them.</p>

            <p>The dll is for multimedia use and the rest looks OK to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must say the old emails and Word templates seem a mystery, but I think you’re ‘clean’.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you notice any unusual activity, immediately reboot the computer which will disconnect any unwanted guests. Then run the simple Junkware Removal Tool (JRT) followed by your AV program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>JRT is a unique little program that searches for and removes common adware, toolbars and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) from your computer. Download JRT.exe (make sure nothing else is downloaded) from the author’s site here
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/junkware-removal-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/junkware-removal-tool/</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>It runs in a command window and can take up to ten minutes to complete. Don’t interrupt it if it appears to be doing nothing, particularly when it’s checking the registry. You may have to right-click the shortcut and choose ‘Run as administrator’. A log
 file is created on the Desktop and both the program (JRT.exe) and the log file can be deleted when you’ve eventually finished with it.</p>

    <title>could not download file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miked9b  say:</h3>
<h2>            could not download file</h2>
                    <p>I have inherited daughters old laptop, cleared unwanted files, deleted account but remember being asked if wanted to save any folders which I did just incase there was anything she still needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so her account deleted and no longer shows in user accounts,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created my account and a guest account that she can still use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the system although logging into my passworded account seems to have been putting docs by default into her old account, which still has folder visible on C:/ user accounts bt does not show up in system user accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>somewhere down the line vista has confused what it should be using. I noticed date differences on some of my file saves depending on from where I opened them, tried to move items into the correct place but now vista will not let me download basic MS docs
 from web or access L/network correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>doesn't give error code or reason just says cannot download file?????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot download my back statements to update my excel sheets? trouble is my bank does a since last download, I'm hoping they know I didn't actually manage to downlod else I have a lot of work to get things back in order......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously has something to do with user permissions and best option I see is a reinstall, I could easily save important files buit I can't simply reinstall because laptop was not supplied with vista disk even though sold by large outlet..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nightmare of preinstalled OS !!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm tired and have better things to do with the little spare time I have than spend days trying to sort out a problem for which I don't understand why such a large company that sells very expensive software would have allowed to happen :o(((((((((</p>
