    <title>Saving calendar invites to iCloud calendar rather than Outlook default - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Saving calendar invites to iCloud calendar rather than Outlook default</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 2016 with the iCloud addin. &nbsp;When I receive a calendar invite it only populates my Outlook default calendar. &nbsp;I would like the invite to directly populate my iCloud calendar which then syncs with my Apple devices. &nbsp;The only way I can make
 this work is by manually transferring the entry to iCloud after accepting it in the default calendar. &nbsp;This is cumbersome and prone to error. &nbsp;As well some fields in the calendar entry are lost when copying manually to iCloud. &nbsp;I understand that this has been
 a known problem with Outlook since 2010 and that Microsoft and Apple don't generally like to play well together in the sandbox. &nbsp;But after six years, could this limitation be fixed!! &nbsp;Has anyone found a solution? &nbsp;Changing the default file to iCloud does not
 work in Outlook.</p>

    <title>How to prevent or disable compatibility view list downloads in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reinhold f&#252;reder  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prevent or disable compatibility view list downloads in IE9&#63;</h2>
                    We are developing some kind of diagnosis software that must support different IE versions and when on of our integration tests failed for IE9 we found out that thre reason was an unexpected download attempt of http://ie9cvlist.ie.microsoft.com/IE9CompatViewList.xml
 in the middle of the test by IE.<br />
<br />
How can we prevent or disable such automatic and unexpected download attempts completely? While presumably we never ever need this to be downloaded on this continuous integration (CI) host, I would not care if one can still download this via e.g. Windows Update
 (as maybe in the past for IE8, if I have understood some forum entries correctly). Note that Windows Updates are obviously disabled too on this CI host.<br />
<br />
I suspect that "Turn off compatibility view" does not prevent this download, does it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            N82 - 30.0.019 - Features, Errors, Improvements</h2>
                    
<p><font><strong><font color="#FF0000">NOKIA PLEASE READ THIS POST, WE DID NOT FIND ANY IMPROVEMENTS ON NEW FIRMWARE - 30.0.019</font></strong></font></p>
<font><br />
<strong><font color="#FF0000">Summary All Again</font></strong><br />
Even after new firmware updated to 30.0.019, There are a few things which bother me, I will contribute to this list as and when I realize something on the phone is needed as a change or additional feature:
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000"><br />
1)</font></strong> When you play music on the phone, and use provided headset, I would like the buttons on head set to change to next song, just like radio goes to next Radio Station., since I love to listen to music on this phone, and I would consider a great
 threat to other products in the market.</p>
<p>A user always have loads of songs on my phone, considering the 2GB or 4 GB microSD card, some times you don't want to listen to a particular song and would like to skip it instantly, rather than removing you phone from your pocket and, unlocking it, going
 to music app, and changing the song.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">2)</font></strong> When you are viewing any video or image, in the gallery, in options, I would like to have - assign as ringtone to group, or assign as ringtone to contact. (for video, only when you just finished shooting the
 video, in the preview mode you see this option to assign it to a contact as ringtone, but not after you have saved to the gallery or view the gallery later)</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">3)</font></strong> Similarly, when in Gallery, each Video or Image option should have 2 new items, called- Save as Ringtone, (this would hide the video or image from gallery) so these particular videos or images are only available
 on your ringtone list.- Save as Private - this would save the video or image - only for private viewing, using some password, - this will make the private video or image disappear from common one click Gallery - There should be added option in Options to view
 private gallery, on password entering only.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">4)</font></strong> On 5MP Camera, in settings there should be image quality options, right now the pictures you click with 5MP camera are saving to a file size of around 700 to 1MB, I think this is really compressing the images
 and reducing the quality of the pictures, I would appreciate if there are 3 options, high, medium, low, - considering the current to be low - 700 to 1MB</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">SOLVED 5)</font></strong> ***** (desperate requirement) or else the phone will fail sooner than expected in market.</p>
</font>
<p><font><strong><font color="#FF0000">SOLVED </font></strong></font><font>Because the loudspeaker volume is super useless as of now. (the loudspeaker is not that bad, but the GLOBAL setting of the phone is not allowing
 the loudspeaker toe perform well) </font></p>
<font><strong><font color="#FF0000">5a)</font></strong> Global Volume controls needed. - What I mean is, I know you can increase and decrease the volume of loudspeaker or headset, when needed, but as of now, maybe due to some Legal Issues
 I think nokia have reduced the volume of speaker on the phone, even though you make it full volume its not enough (not at all good enough) So what I recommend that let the users decide by this Global Volume Control center, how much volume the user needs, (to
 max or full, even if it damages some idiots ears), Just like a mixer volume control on our computers, there should be a volume mixer control panel on the phone too.<font><br />
</font></font><font>
<p>Global settings - this is the setting for max volume it can be heard on the phone<br />
a) volume for ringtone<br />
b) volume for radio - on headphones (which is good as of now)<br />
c) volume for radio - on loud speaker (which is very BADDD, I have hard time trying to listen to radio in a single room itself)<br />
d) volume for music - headphones<br />
e) volume for music - loudspeaker (which is ok, needs to increase 40% at the minimum)<br />
f) volume for phone call - headphones<br />
g) volume for phone call - ear piece<br />
h) volume for phone call - loudspeaker (this is also useless as of now, I cannot hear any phone conversations on a loudspeaker when I am at any public place, it just isn't loud enough)<br />

j) when in call, using loudspeaker, the more the volume of the loudspeaker, the mic sensivity becomes less. people cant hear you at all. if I reduce the loudspeaker even a bit, I cant hear them, because the setting of the in-call volume on loudspeaker is super

 when you have a unread msg it shows even on the home screen.</font></p>
</font><font>
<p>a) try to give a missed call to urself, then when u see the missed call notification on ur screen, (1 missed call), press Red button, so you can see the who gave you missed call even later. (this becomes unread missed call item), now u will see a small missed
 call icon on top of ur screen, in all the other screens, (menu's) but not on ur home screen.</p>
<p>Similarly when you get SMS, and if you dont read the SMS when you get it, you press RED button, you will be seeing SMS Icon on all screens including HOME screen. So thats what I would like for the missed call too, rather than some missed call icon, some
 huge number how many missed calls. (bold white numbers)</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">10)</font></strong>. Music Player: - In music player we need a few themes, or player skins</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">11)</font></strong>. Music Player: - In music player we play any songs, and the headphones are plugged in, there is no Loudspeaker option, I agree we can unplug the headset and the Music will start playing thru loudspeaker,
 but what if I don't want to unplug the headphones, since they are nicely plugged in the headphone jack, and the phone sits well in my pocket, while listening to radio or music, while i take my walk. I can simply jump quickly to Music player on loudspeaker
 from Radio, if there are no good songs on radio without unpluggin the headphones, and figuring out where to put the loose end.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">12)</font></strong>. Bug: When you make a call : Your contacts list dont close, and it stays exactly where the last call was made</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">13)</font></strong>. Bug: When you make or receive a call:- the Contact list and the Logs are automatically open and they dont close unless you manually close them</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">14)</font></strong>. SMS Does not show Time Date, by default the SMS should show a small time and date text on bottom or top of the screen, instead of opening message details, since sms's are a vital part of communications,
 and we need to know the time and date instantly, mostly even before we read the sms text, we know from whom it came and what time.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">15)</font></strong>. Internet Telephone, - I Love the SIP phone (internet tel) feature, it works awesome on (Wi-Fi), but logically, if we have Wi-Fi around us, we can start using other handsets available with telephony feature,
 + mostly if we have Wi-Fi around us, we may not need the Telephony feature at all, we may be carrying a laptop too.</p>
<p>Point is, if we have SIP, internet phone facility in our phones (N82), and it connects beautifully on Wi-Fi, it should be able to select any type of connection (GRPS too) and try to connect and make or receive a call (bandwidth usage is user decision). Since
 I do have a packet DATA connection on my mobile phone - High speed GPRS with TCPIP, its very fast (128kbps). I would prefer that Nokia includes the selection of all the connections available on the mobile phone in Connections settings for Internet Tel, and
 can make internet phone call over FAST GPRS which I do have, many others also may have.</p>
<p>I do get registered on my SIP phone server using GPRS, but when I try to call the phone try's to find a Wi-Fi connection present. Nokia needs to allow the phone call to be made and received over GPRS (with tcpip)..</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">16)</font></strong> Music Keys: Easy solution, no hardware change required here, please implement this. When listening to music on the phone, and the keypad is locked, any 2 combination keys should be able to control the music
 player without unlocking and manually going to the music application. When the keypad is locked (ofcourse these features can be turned on and off, we dont want another firmware for improvements the features demanded here), Such as: pressing - the 0 key (which
 will be called dedicated key, which user can change) and while holding 0 key, press 1 will rewind to the previous song, pressing 0 key + 3 forward to next song. pressing 0 key + 4 slow rewind, 0 kye + 6 key fastfoward, 0 key + 2 - play/pause.<br />
Even if the phone is in the pocket, this would not be trouble, + the dedicated key can not only be 0 key but also can be play button on the side of the phone, which will make it impossible for such a combination of buttons to be pressed in someones pocket,
 on keypad locked.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">17)</font></strong> When the phone is locked, and the display goes away, I have the habbit to press the unlock - (top left key) once and wait for the light to come on the phone and go away, so i can always see, if there were
 any missed calls while i was away from the phone or sms's. This feature has been great, but I would prefer that the time for the light to come and go, should be increased a little more... so a person can look into other details like, time, area location (cell
 info), battery, network coverage without unlocking..</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">18)</font></strong> Major Loss of important feature: Record calls ??, I know this can be done still, but earlier when a phone call was made or recieved, while the call was on, instantly a user could go into options, and press
 record., which is highly important, since this feature is only used in emmergency situations, when you dont know you would need to record certian part of a conversation, maybe a stupid customer service call - bad behaviour from the call rep to complain to
 the senior.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">19)</font></strong> Radio: - A very good feature would be to allow people to listen to radio while in call. I want to ask nokia Why not ? It would be super fun to have a friend on the phone and listen to a radio, and talk about
 the radio songs or have the radio playing beautiful romantic numbers while 2 love birds keep talking on the phone. It would be super fun, I highly reccommend this feature<br />
Ofcourse, with the feature of allowing to turn down the volume of the radio while the phone and voice call volume can be full.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">20)</font></strong> Continuing from feature 19.- When voice call is on, music player can be turned on, but as you turn down volume the voice call and music player volume also turnes down. - This is why I recommend the feature
 number 5, which can have a option called - Radio volume while the voice call is on. - Music player/multimedia volume while the voice call is on- As requested above, music player or media players or radio application should have software volume controls, so
 the volume can be increased or reduced while the phone call is on. (since the hardware button should be dedicated to voice call volume control)</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">21)</font></strong> Zooming in photos or images in media gallery or gallery or when a photo is just clicked before saving: I have noticed zoomming images (pressing 5) is very slow. While zooming out is instant (pressing 0),
 Please dont make such silly mistakes NOKIA, dont spoil your reputation</p>
<p><strong><font><strong><font color="#FF0000">SOLVED </font>
</strong></font><font color="#FF0000">22) </font></strong>WLAN: I have a home Wi-Fi internet , I defined an access point on N82, It works great. The only problem is, I keep my home Wi-Fi (infrastructure) hidden, and the N82 cannot find the hidden (defined)
 access point, since it wont list the hidden WLAN, very rarely, it finds Wi-Fi : "hidden lan", but still since this is already defined connection, it wont give me access to it.There are 2 routes to this.<br />
a) I can directly set my browser to use my home WiFi as default connection, then it works fine even if my home WiFi is invisible., but this creates another issue, when I am not home the N82 would not prompt for another connection, It would go in a LOOP, trying
 to access the home WLan.b) If I do not define the home WLAN as default connection, and I try to access the internet on the phone, I do get a prompt but I can only choose my other connections "GPRS", but not the defined WLAN. - the home WLAN does not show,
 since the home WLAN is invisible.c) If I EDIT the WLAN access point as "ad-hoc" on the phone I do can choose this hiddin WLAN when I am home only (even if it is hidden by the WLAN router). , or else i can choose other connections, (this is the same way it
 should work with infrastruction mode). But Ad-hoc mode does not give option other than WEP security. So there I am again stuck. Since my HomeWLan is WPA based.Solutions: 1 - Have a new feature on Access Point List in options, as "always visible on AP List"
 (this does not mean WLAN Visible to public) this will only list that Access point always visible on the list to choose from available connections. (just like GPRS is always visible).Solutions : 2 - Make it work same way like Ad-hoc mode, so when the WLAN is
 in range (hidden) still list it, and if not in range it wont list, and allow me to choose GPRS.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">23) </font></strong>Foolish mistake: When I am in a call, and I click options, "lock keypad", I can still cut the call using the RED, button, silly!!!... the whole point of the keypad lock is stay out of keypad totallyl, So
 that I can simply put the phone in my pocket or backpack, and not get dissconnected if the RED button is accidentally pressed - when locked.</p>
<p><font><strong><font color="#FF0000">24)</font></strong>. SMS Does not show number of sms. Earlier it use to show, 1/22 or 5/22..sms you are reading..so you know how many sms's are there and want to delete a few or something like that.
 -its after all how users see and use thier phone</font>. This is not when you read the SMS, its when you are in your inbox or any folders, there are no numbers.&nbsp;</p>

            these comments do get read by nokia firmware teams sometimes. but most of the time they dont bother looking at it. for example the n96 its just been released n now users that post comment on here about the faults n bugs then nokia firmware team look into
 it. to make a new firmware update. im suprised how fast n96 got 2 firmware updates lol.

            <i>Reply to n82phone</i>:<br />
what you are telling i think is too much. I've read your requests and believe me some of them is out of context. One example is listening to radio while being on a call. Who would like to have such options?? It's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
But But it doesn't mean all of them are ridiculous! Just like the #1 concerning music, #4 concerning the camera and #5 concerning the volume, I strongly agree with you as it makes sense!<br />
<br />
So if I was to write to nokia, which I will do in the coming days is to write them again:<br />
Points #1,4,5,9,11,14,15,24! These are strong points!<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>People out there, if you want the changes I specified to be done by nokia, you should write them the same points. If only one or two write, it's useless, they won't take it as a priority.</b></font><br />
<br />
Of course, don't copy paste or they will think the same person is spamming them. I hope it's clear. Write in your own words. Don't think changes will be done by magic or by doing nothing with arms folded. You should do a move.<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>THIS IS A USER TO USER FORUM. YOU CAN POST YOUR PROBLEM HERE. WE'LL DISCUSS ABOUT IT, THEN ALL OF US SHOULD WRITE NOKIA TO CORRECT THE MATTER IF IT CONCERNS FIRMWARE. FOLLOW THE LINK "<i>CONTACT US &gt; CALL OR EMAIL NOKIA CARE</i>" TO REPORT

3- The point about radio while on call is not ridiculus. cause in INDIA , RADIO is very popular, and there are soo many contests, running while you speak on the phone and listen to radio with your friends or spouse or partners. + Phone call here is very cheap,
 this is why we can be on the phone and talk for hours and also listen to radio while we talk. ITS FUN !! - like soft background music while on phone. IT could be romantic for college kids.<br />

I do agree with you mate but for the radio, only a minority would like such option. That's what im trying to tell you. What if im speaking to you on phone and you put on the radio, that would really disturb me. And when the music stops and the radio speaker
 starts speaking it would be like 3persons speaking at the same time. Nokia takes this into considerations as well.

</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Windows Phone Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error you're getting is pretty generic, so we'll have to try some basic things to see if we can get this fixed for you.&nbsp; The first thing I want to do is make sure your primary Microsoft Account is syncing properly on your phone right now.&nbsp; To check this,
 go to <strong>Settings </strong>-&gt; <strong>Email+Accounts</strong>, and tap and hold on the account labeled Windows Live, then select Sync.&nbsp; If that gives an error, stop there and let us know what the error is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next thing we'd want to do is to clear the cache on your phone.&nbsp; Go to <strong>
Settings </strong>-&gt; <strong>Applications </strong>-&gt; <strong>Internet Explorer </strong>
and tap on <strong>Delete History</strong>.&nbsp; Once that is done, restart your phone.&nbsp; After it turns back on, try to add the Facebook account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to get an error, we'd want to have you contact Facebook support to make sure they aren't having any issues on their end of any kind with your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep in touch so we can look into this further with you!</p>

            Hi Rahul, <br />
<br />
<br />
This can be a phone's software or battery issue. Its OS build version may not be updated. Let's go ahead and check it by going to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update and security &gt; Phone update &gt; Check for updates</strong>.
<br />
<br />
If that wouldn't make any difference, we advise you first <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up</a></strong> your phone's data, then reset its software using the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a></strong>. This resolves software issues with the Windows Phone.<br />
<br />
Please let us know what happened. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Unable to access free dowload microsoft office</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP!! I bought a new laptop so wanted to trial the 60day free Microsoft Office trial. I downloaded it and it came up with an error, which re-started my machine. Redownloaded it, and&nbsp;everything was fine (hadn't actually been able to access it yet, just no
 restarts of my laptop for a while)<br />
The Microsoft Office icon was on my desktop, double clicked onto it to open it up and start to use&nbsp;and it said there was a problem, go online to fix, clicked online fix button and said the problem could not be fixed! It has removed my icon from my desktop altogether
 now,&nbsp;and I have just received an email to my Hotmail advising me that my trial has begun...however it doesn't work- I am not able to actually use it.
<br />
It is still in the programs on my laptop so if I uninstall and re-install will that work?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help :)</p>

<h2>            How to conditionally hide rows</h2>
                    <p>How can I conditionally hide rows 14 through 475 if the value in that rows column P is greater than 3.1* the value in the same rows column R.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>P17 has a value of 10. R17 has a value of 32. Thus, the row entire is hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P18 has a value of 10. R18 has a value of 20. The row remains shown.</p>

Adding text is not an option in Microsoft Office Picture Manager.<br />

<p>Control-m no longer inserts a new slide in my POwerPOint 2007 installation. Before I rip it out and reinstall I thought I would check to see if anyone had experienced this or had any thoughts.</p>

            Safe Mode does not disable add-ins in PowerPoint. It does in other Office apps, but not in PPT.

<p>The four inactive ones are add-ins that ship with PowerPoint. (They're part of the Document Inspector.) They won't cause this behavior.</p>
<p>I've not heard of the Acrobat PDF Maker add-in causing Ctrl+M to not work, but you might try disabling it just in case.</p>
<p>Actually, before disabling the add-in, try going to Office Button | PPT Options | Resources and run Office Diagnostics there. With any luck, it will fix the problem.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you've rebooted! I know that sounds snarky, but seriously, when keystrokes stop working suddenly for me, a reboot often takes care of it. And if some program running at the same time as PPT is causing a conflict, you might be able to figure
 it out by starting with a clean boot.</p>

<p>Totally agree with you about doing away with Office Diagnostics. I hate that they did that. (You can still run a repair installation from Windows Control Panel&nbsp;| Add-Remove Programs.)</p>
<p>But I'm not sure that the Ctrl+M thing is really Microsoft's fault -- I'd probably have to blame that on the add-in itself.</p>

            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>Sonix-based cameras are known to have buggy drivers. Additionally Lenovos tend to privacy-lock cameras by default in their system software especially after updates. Try updating your drivers to the generic USB Video Device drivers that come with the OS.
 That may resolve both conditions.</p>

            You will not have a LifeCam in your device manager. That was an example using one of my cameras. You would simply go to your Lenovo/Sonix camera (whatever it is named) in device manager and update its driver.

<h2>            How to make Word 2016 page items more visible without changing to the HORRID black or grey &#34;Office Themes&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Maybe it's just my old eyes, but ever since MS introduced the four Office Theme options, I have become more and more frustrated by how difficult it is for me to be able to see some "things" when working in Word 2016. &nbsp; The "things" I have the most trouble
 seeing are the edges of pages and the "sliders" on the Ruler. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "black" and "grey" themes are -- overall -- stark, depressing and generally colorless, which makes them unpleasant to use for very long. &nbsp;Nevertheless, when using either of those themes -- it's easy to see the document page edges and the "sliders" on
 the Ruler. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either the "white" or "colorful" theme, however, it is extremely difficult to see the edges of document pages or to see the "sliders" on the Ruler. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the 4 "theme" options, I greatly prefer the "colorful" theme over the other 3, but I cannot figure out how to correct these two areas within the theme so I can more easily see page edges and the "sliders" on the Ruler. &nbsp;I've attached a screenshot that
 I've marked up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate it if someone can tell me how I can make these elements of the "colorful" theme more visible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the page edges: &nbsp;My first choice would be to have the area outside of the document page be shaded with something like a very light blue; my second choice would be to just have the lines identifying the page edge be more visible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the "sliders" on the Ruler, anything to make them stand out more would be a great help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Need Help - Excel is always crashing when I try to write or execute a macro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I have a serious problem with Macros in Excel. Since today I am not able to record a macro or open the "Visual Basic" tab in the "Developer" tab. Each time I try this Excel is crashing.<br />
<br />
When I try to open a .xlsm file Excel is crashing. I am not able to open a .xlsm file. I get the warning dialog box "Excel has stopped working" and I can only select "Close the program" and no file is opened and of course also Excel is not opened too.<br />
<br />
I can open Excel normally with a .xlsx file and go into the "Developer" tab but no macro can be recorded. When I try this Excel is crashing and when clicking on the "Visual Basic" tab in the "Developer" tab Excel is also crashing.<br />
<br />
If I set in "Trusted Center" -&gt; "Macro Settings" -&gt; "Disable all macros with notification" I can open a .xlsm file with the "SECURITY WARNING Macros have been disabled". When I click the button "Enable Content" Excel is crashing again.<br />
<br />
I use Windows 7 with all the updates. I made the last Windows update today (Monday, 04. Feb. 2019). I use MS Office 2016 and have also made an online repair today.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had made a system backup with the software HD Manager a week ago on an external hard drive. I unplugged the internal hard drive and used the "internal cables" to connect the external drive with the system backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to start Windows 7 and also Excel. Then I tried in Excel to write a macro and to open Visual Basic with the "Visual Basic" tab in the "Developer" tab and ALL worked fine, no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I have changed the hard drives. I have removed the internal hard drive and replaced it with the external drive. After I had done this Excel still had worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I have partitioned the new hard drive so it was the same as my old one, copied the "old" data to the new internal drive and opened a existing .xlsm file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I had again the old problem!!!!<br />
How is that possible???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now both my old and my new backup drive have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I have completely uninstalled MS Office 2016 AND BOUGHT a NEW PRODUCT KEY BUT the problem is still the same with the completely new installation and product key!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that Excel has "lost" its VBA module or something like that. I have really tried a lot but nothing worked. It seems that it is an Excel settings issue and not a corrupted VBA code since ALL my .xlsm files have the same problem. Last Friday all worked
 fine.<br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me solve this issue. I need my Excel macro as fast as possible to go ahead with my work.
<br />
<br />
Thank you really very very much.</p>

 flash player, but it didn't work. So I installed Google's chrome frame and it seemed fine. However, Hulu said almost the same thing, so I tried to install Adobe's flash player again. This time I was successful. Afterwards, there were some mild issues afterwards.

            <p>As long as links in, e.g., an Outlook, Windows Live Mail, Windows Live Messenger, etc.,&nbsp;message open &amp; fully-load in Internet Explorer, forgot about Step #10 for now. That being said...</p>

            No details about your system, but I will give you a tip that has helped others if you are on a desk top PC do a hard reset (hold the power button down until it shuts down) re-boot, if a laptop do the same but remove the battery and after it shuts down
 remove the AC adapter then hold the power button down for 10 - 15 sec's re-boot with just the AC adapter connected after it completes rebooting install the battery, this tip works with Dell's and HP's
