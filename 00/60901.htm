<h2>            Block windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I got Win10 Pro and by let's say one or two months, I got too many updates.</p>
<p>Well, way too many. Every day, my PC is downloading and installing some updates and it is starting to be
<span>uncomfortable.</span></p>
<span>uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Problem is, that the ACTIVE TIME OF USING with 12hr limit is not enough for me and so the computer always downloads the updates and then processing them on next startup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I really want to keep my computer updated, but I want to choose when updates will be downloaded, installed and processed, when I have a time for that.</span></p>
<p><span>For now, I got SSD for fast boot and work, but it is now quite useless, when almost every start it boots up, it process some updates, then reboots (even before login screen) and then it alllows me to use it.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, it is a laptop, and quite often I need it just turn it off, pack it and go, and I don't have a time for waiting like 2 minutes till he pre-process some updates before shutdown.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, what I am missing:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>-Power off option WITHOUT installing updates</span></li><li><span>-Option as it was in previous windows - Search for updates, but ask me when they should be installed</span></li><li><span>-Active using time limit increased from 12 to like 17 hours</span><span> (so that could not happen, that I get out of limit and it downloads the updates and then, after start next day, it processes them regardless on active using time setting, or
 the other way, I boot it up before the active using setting, it downloads the updates and start processing them when I shut down it during day and have to wait till it process it before poweroff)</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, I have red about 2 workaround:</span></p>
<p><span>a) set your internet connection to metered. That is not as solution for me, as I said, it is laptop and I often use different networks. Also I have no idea, what other services will be limited</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) Shutdown windows update service&nbsp; - That is solution, which I will use, if no other will be available. Still got one problem with it. If I disable it, OK, no updates will be downloaded.</span></p>
<p><span>But when I re-enable it, it will not tell the computer - NOW PERFORM THE UPDATE, I WANT IT TO BE DONE, but it tells the computer - OK, WHENEVER YOU WANT, YOU CAN DO THE UPDATE, which again&nbsp; puts me into situation, that the update can be done immediately,
 or it can also be somewhere during the day, again limiting me other time, when I agin will not have time for that ....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I really don't want to downgrade back to WIN8, but if WIN10 will keep doing what it wants, not what user wants, I will be probably forced to do this step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So please, any solution, how to perform/find points a) b) or c), or any other working workaround?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance :) </span></p>

<p>as you are running windows 10 professional, the best option, IMHO, is to use the group policy editor to control when the updates are downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>click start, type <strong>gpedit </strong>and press enter</p>
<p>in the group policy editor navigate to computer configuration -&gt; Administrative templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Windows Update&nbsp;</p>
<p>right click on 'configure Automatic Updates' and select edit</p>
<p>select enabled then under options select '2 - notify for download and auto install'</p>
<p>click OK, close the group policy editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you will then get a notification when updates are ready to be <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
downloaded</span> you can download them when its convenient, windows will automatically install them when you allow the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you leave them too long (weeks) windows will get upset and start giving a reminder in the middle of the screen.</p>

                    what is a skin file and what does it have to do with media player. why does one need an account; username ;password; provide personal info just to ask a question. why is such a complex password needed and, why the need to enter the squiggly letters. thanks,

    <title>PC Sharing has Stopped Working After 360 Fall Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grokzilla  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Sharing has Stopped Working After 360 Fall Update</h2>
                    
<p>Howdy:</p>
<p>I've just been experiencing a very odd problem with my Xbox 360 S and my Win 7 PC.&nbsp; For years, I've used the simple and easy-to-use wireless sharing from Windows PC to 360 (using Windows Media Player 12) in order to view pictures and play music stored on
 my PC so we can enjoy them on the HDTV and home theater.&nbsp; Worked great, on an original 360, later with an Elite and for the last few years with a 360 S.</p>
<p>We hadn't shared music from PC to 360 recently, but over the holiday it was no longer working with ZERO CHANGES to my network or hardware.&nbsp; But, it seems to have coincided with the October 2012 360 Dashboard Update.&nbsp; Sharing was working fine during the summer,
 but when we tried to do so over the holidays it no longer worked...the only change between when the sharing worked and when it did not was the 360 dash update.</p>
<p>Oddly, the Xbox 360 still has full connectivity to Xbox Live through my home network and router.&nbsp; And, I can see it from my Network Map on the PC, however WMP 12 cannot see the 360 in the media sharing "streaming options" tab and the 360 cannot see the shared
 PC.&nbsp; I have two other PCs on the same network - both Windows Vista - one wired one wireless - and they can all see each other and share music, pictures, files, etc.&nbsp; The 360 used to be able to see both the Vista and Win 7 PCs which are wired to the network,
 but it no longer can.</p>
<p>ALL of my sharing and networking settings are correct, I've tried to connect with firewalls and virus software on and off, recently tweaked some of the "services" in an attempt to get a connection based on threads here on the forums, rebooted, added/removed
 HomeGroups, turned sharing on and off to reset, disconnected and reconnected to the network multiple times, have reset the 360 Default Network Settings and reconnected...Xbox Live and network connectivity come right back up, but still no PC sharing, etc.</p>
<p>I have also tried to establish a connection with the 360 using Windows Media Center (never used this before), but that also does not work -- the 360 "extender" cannot be found by MCE even though I can still see the 360 sitting right on the Network Map, I
 can see it on the router admin page, it has the correct LAN IP, same one reflected in the 360 network dash and it is connected, etc.</p>
<p>My PC is Win 7 64-bit, security software is Norton 360 and I do also use iTunes (which habitually fights with WMP12 for playback dominance), but again I've used these programs for years with no impact on my PC to 360 sharing.&nbsp; Then again...Apple...I wouldn't
 put it past them to muck stuff up.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp; Did the 360 Dashboard Update do anything to tweak PC or network sharing?&nbsp; I'm at a total loss at the moment and have searched far and wide for a solution and have found nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help, tips or suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated!&nbsp; Very bummed out this is not longer working.</p>

    <title>HDMI not working with Windows 10 Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> syphorial  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI not working with Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>I've been using a second monitor with my laptop (running WIN 8.1) for a good long while now. When Win 10 home became available on July 29th, 2015, I upgraded. At first, I had no problems connecting my second monitor and using it instead of my laptop screen.
 But once I shut down my computer (for the first time after the full win10 install), upon starting up again, Windows could no longer detect my monitor through HDMI. I had changed nothing with the cables or settings on either the monitor or in windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Machine: HP Envy dv7 (built for Win 8)</p>
<p>Monitor: Debranded HP 23" something or other.</p>
<p>Display Adapter: Intel HD Graphics 4000</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, before the upgrade and the first shutdown, the external display worked just fine. Now, when I go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Display and click "Detect", it tells me "Didn't detect another display."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked to see if my display driver needed to be updated or could be rolled back, but neither were options.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to connect second display using DVI port or other VGA port available on your PC and check if the second display works. If second display works in other port, then the possible cause for this issue may be discrete video card driver.

<p>Thanks for the tips, but i follow all your instructions and still it cannot detect multiple display, i still cannot use properly my HDMI. Isn't there any more options?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to all who replied with an offer of help to the Windows 10 HDMI problem. I followed each suggestion meticulously without positive results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Acer Aspire 7745G with ATI Mobility Radeon HD5650 video card originally purchased with Windows 7 operating system was upgraded to Windows 8.1 as it was released. My HDMI stopped operating then. Acer responded by saying they were not offering new video
 drivers for the ASPIRE 7745G. ATI responded to the problem by saying it was&nbsp;a card released to oem's and were not able to provide any assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had&nbsp;another ASPIRE laptop with an NVIDIA Geforce GT 33M.&nbsp; HDMI stopped working when upgraded to 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was resolved on both finally by deleting 8.1 video drivers and installing&nbsp; an AMD&nbsp;Catalyst driver suite 12-8_vista_win7_win8_64_dd_ccc_whql.exe</p>
<p>The same driver resolved the windows 10 HDMI problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Deleted the&nbsp; windows&nbsp; 10 drivers making sure to remove all traces from the registry.</p>
<p>restarted the machine and an error message popped up saying there was no HD driver.</p>
<p>I then copied 12-8_vista_win7_win8_64_dd_ccc_whql.exeto my desktop and ran setup with my HDMI cable hooked up to my Large screen. Completed the
 install and my large screen immediately responded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This driver resolves problems for AMD Radeon HD 6500M/5600/5700 Series cards. That&nbsp;were installed on many different Manufacturers Laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck</p>
<p>

            Thanks for all these suggestions. I also have an Intel (R) HD 4000 and my HDMI stopped operating as soon as I updated Windows 10 two days ago. Updating was the first thing I did. I went through windows, which told me I had the most recent driver, so I
 went online and found the most recent there and installed it. But nothing. This is getting really irritating, the updates have obviously created some kind of conflict. I am seriously thinking about going back to Windows 8.1 as much as I hated it.

<p>What can't Microsoft just fix this in one of their updates!</p>
<p>Windows 8 was enough of a challenge, but so far I only have regrets for upgrading to Windows 10!</p>
<p>I shouldn't have to pay someone to do all of this stuff you list to do!</p>
<p>It should have been right&nbsp;in the 10 upgrade or at least in an update since!</p>

<h3> really bad with computers  say:</h3>
<h2>            My windows 10 laptop won&#39;t do anything, at all</h2>
                    I just got a new HP laptop with Windows 10 not too long ago. Suddenly, out of nowhere, nothing would work. The lock screen is fine and would let me change my network or log in, but after that nothing loads. I've tried everything from the keyboard to trying
 to load files and even the windows start menu won't pop up. Please help as I'm not a computer expert.

    <title>Explorer.exe flickering after RDC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeyuan zhu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer.exe flickering after RDC</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a desktop computer A with windows 8.1 and when I connect to it from some other computer B with windows 8 through Remote Desktop Connection, because of the screen resolution change, the entire desktop (explorer.exe) flickers desperately and is
 extremely slow.</p>
<ul>
<li>What I do typically is to kill explorer.exe (which is still slow due to the flickering, because TaskManager responds slowly) and then restart explorer.exe. Everything back to normal then.</li><li>If I wait long enough (perhaps 5min) it may go back to normal but I'm not sure.</li><li>The same problem shows up even if I log into A locally (while having RDC logged in previously from B), because a resolution change is still needed in this case.</li><li>The same problem was there when I had A in windows 8 rather than windows 8.1.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what is going on? </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
RDC is supported via TechNet so check with the Experts there. The video drivers would<br />
be suspect. Others include 3rd party antivirus and&nbsp;maybe startup programs.<br />

            Hi Arora.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Go to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors and change Default View to Light Mode to compare.  
<br />
<br />Also in same location choose High Contrast Settings and disable them.  
<br />
<br />2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />

    <title>MMC Snap-in error Computer Management corrupted or not installed CLSID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exsfcp - rangers lead the way  say:</h3>
<h2>            MMC Snap-in error Computer Management corrupted or not installed CLSID &#123;58221C67-EA27-11CF-ADCF-00AA00A80033&#125;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>This is a suggested fix for the below error with MMC Snap-in Computer Management</strong></p>
<p>After helping a friend after a virus infection. &nbsp;I re-applied SP3 for XP Home. &nbsp;There was a problem with the installed devices, leading me to have to remove a device and reinstall it. &nbsp;But when I tried using the Control Panel | Admin
 Tools | Computer Management console, I got the above error message.</p>
<p>There was a corruption in the mmc snap-in for computer management. &nbsp;I do not know if the snap-in was broken before or as a result of the SP3 update, or something with the virus removal / cleanup done by Kaspersky and Super Spyware removal
 tool.</p>
<p>Read all of the KB articles and tried all of the suggestions. Banged head on wall for several days reading all the forum entries that I could.</p>
<p><span>The compmgmt.msc still would not install and gave the same error message. &nbsp;Reinstalled all of the .NET&nbsp;Framework ... still would not install. &nbsp;Copied all good *.msc files over from working test unit. Still failed.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, using just the CLSID number as the search term, I read an article from 2004 about Win2003 server having the same issue. I double checked the installed XP Home registry for the required InProc Default entry from the forum
 suggested fix that worked, and for the file C:\WINDOWS\System32\mycomput.dll ...</span></p>
<p><span>I checked the registry and the dll was previously registered with the system, and when I tried to re register the dll, I found the dll was missing. I did not have the system disk and could not find the file under the temp/I386
 folder.</span></p>
<p><span>I copied the mycomput.dll from a XP Pro system, over to the XP Home \windows\system32 dir and registered the dll with regsvr32&nbsp;</span><span>C:\WINDOWS\System32\mycomput.dll</span></p>
<p><span>I tried running mmc from the Start | Run | mmc &nbsp;... at the prompt it opened the console &nbsp;without the msc registered. I then selected computer management. &nbsp;It opened the Computer Management mmc and all the items appeared. When
 it closed, I re-saved it into MMC 3.0 format. </span></p>
<p><span>Also, tested it using the normal Start | Control Panel | Administrator Tools | Computer Management which worked as well.</span></p>
<p><span>I thought that since the problem is still out there without this possible &nbsp;fix being&nbsp;prominently&nbsp;displayed, I could place an answer for this specific problem with this specific CLSID number into the MS forums.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Moderator please place into the correct forum.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p>Seeing as how it has suddenly happened, try a System Restore to before the problem began:</p>
<p><strong><span>Restore Point:</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Do System Restore in Safe Mode, if unable to do it in Normal Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sfc.dll is a legitimate system file that should be found in the C:\Windows\System32 folder. Check to see if it is there (you may need to set your folder options so that you can see hidden and operating system files in order to properly do this).</p>
<p>Otherwise, try this: Click start and type CMD. Right click the menu entry that appears, choose 'run as administrator'. Click continue at the UAC prompt. From the command line, type "sfc /scannow" (without the quotes)&nbsp;and hit &lt;enter&gt; to begin. This function
 should validate and replace any damaged system files. When complete, reboot the system.</p>
<p>Note: If you find sfc.dll in other locations on the system, there is a possibility that this could indicate an infection by a variant of the satiloler virus. Proper antivirus scanning in safe mode is required for removal.</p>

<p>Hey, Mick, thanks for your attention. Yes, did several restores, even did one all the way back, and it still persists. Did a sfc scan, the log file says it cannot repair the file, and that the store version of the file is also corrupt. This is a fairly new
 low-usage computer that has some expensive modeling software on it that I can't replace. I was in the process of cloning the drive when this problem appeared. I hope to be able to find a solution without losing my software.</p>
<p>I also ran Registry Booster to no avail. Is the next step a full virus scan in safe mode?</p>

<p>Never use Registry Cleaners/bosters, etc.</p>
<p>They do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Scan with this Program to make sure your System is clean of Malware:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here is how to access those SFC log files, and do a Repair install, if necessary:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928228</a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

<p>That is why&nbsp;I provided you with the link; so that you could read it completely before starting a Repair Install.</p>

</p><p>Only setting that i can access is to turn a live tile off by right click on that live tile. Right-click-&gt;more-&gt;turn live tile off. Nothing else available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this problem in start menu since I've updated my windows 10. It was fine when I updated it from 8.1 but after some updates of Win 10, this problem is there.</p>
<p>Using Windows 10 Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.71)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help plz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Fortunately my problem has been solved but unfortunately none of the above mentioned procedures (of editing registry or something else) worked. Instead it was all the same no matter what. But then some update came for windows and as usual i updated it and
 suddenly problem was gone. Now i can edit start menu tiles as i want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are interested then this is the update that resolved my problem</p>
<p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3147458)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now i'm running Windows 10 Pro version 1511 OS build 10586.218</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried Method 3 about 3 days ago. It didn't fixed anything. Method 2: Troubleshooter just fails to recognize if something is wrong with windows.</p>
<p>Finally I tried method 1 which fixed my LAN Proxy settings (which i didn't knew were of the way somehow :D ) but couldn't resolve the required issue. It showed two other problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No rootcauses found and created logs.</p>
<p>2. Some settings have sync turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know about the first one but about second one; all of the sync settings are turned on in system settings from start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks alot</p>

A number of the games you rattled off for the PS4 aren't free ( at least not for me in the US)
<br />
<br />
Don't Starve ( excellent game but not free&nbsp;) Driveclub ( not even released ) Doki-Doki ( not free ) Contrast ( free at launch but no longer free ) Planetside 2 ( not released&nbsp;) War Thunder ( not released )</p>

Contrast isn't free in the US anymore on the PS4 but still showing free on website ( I have it already so who knows )<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up on Don't Starve, have it on PC and almost bought it yesterday for PS. Nothing on US website regarding next months free Plus stuff which is strange.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to War Thunder ( played on PC ) but I can't find a US release date.</p>

That's Warframe, DC Universe, and Blacklight in his list.<br />
<br />
I play the first two and haven't spent a dime so I'm not seeing what's not free. Trophies don't unlock is about only downside.</p>

    <title>GameGuard Games Issue on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> negimax  say:</h3>
<h2>            GameGuard Games Issue on Windows 7</h2>
                    Okay, I've been trying to figure out how I can play Grand Chase in Windows 7, but as soon as I ran the game, the Blue Screen suddenly pops up and restarts my PC...<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 currently on x32<br />
I have a 1 GB Ram.<br />
<br />
Any solutions? Also, I tried the FF:<br />
1. Played the game in Safe Mode, the gameguard ran perfectly although when the "Initializing" stage is up, an error window pops up saying "GameMon is already Running."<br />
2. Tried to fix Compatability&nbsp;to Windows XP SP2&nbsp;and Run as Admin, it still gives the blue screen.

<p><span>Hi Negimax,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
It sounds like your video card may need updated drivers.<br />
I suggest visiting the manufacturers website to see if they have windows 7 drivers, or at least updated Vista drivers.<br />
I would suggest doing this for your sound card also, unless it's on-board.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this helps.</span></p>

    <title>How do I bypass an unwanted update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smarshman  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I bypass an unwanted update&#63;</h2>
                    I recently transplanted an old socket 1366 computer into a new case. My old video card was too long for the new case, so I used a different card. When I turned the computer on, updates began to flow...some from Microsoft, some from Nvidia. The Nvidia software
 updated drivers to the current release while MS Update ran a bunch of backlogged updates. When everything completed, I was left with an error for a MS Update-provided video driver with a 2009 publication date that will not install. My Nvidia-provided drivers
 are current, published in 2017. How do I get the old driver, which I do not need, out of the MS Update queue? This is Windows 7 Pro, 64 bit.

            I strongly advise you to refuse ALL Microsoft driver updates.&nbsp; Their track record over the last 2 years has been dismal.&nbsp; Take updates ONLY from the OEM of your equipment, and then only when you have an urgent problem to solve.

</p><p>I've been having issues, well basically one issue with loading Steam.<br />
I recently got a new desktop PC with win 10 pro and I can not install steam.<br />
Download the client all fine, execute it and it starts downloading its usual update and after some time when it starts loading an error message displays<br />
"Failed to load steamui.dll"<br />
<br />
I have looked everywhere and tried everything, from deleting certain files, trying to download a steamui.dll from elsewhere and replace it to starting the PC in safe mode... nothing. Its been installed and uninstalled over 15x with all the methods I tried.<br />
<br />
Contacted steam and they basically said it was a windows error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have latest windows update, completely up to date so I tried to download steam on a laptop that also had win 10 but not all the way up to date with no issue, everything worked fine right away. So that is why I also think it might be a windows issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />If your computer begins to feel buggy and you notice problems during boot, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) command-line utility to check the integrity and replace any corrupted or missing protected system files with a known good version.
<br />
<br />When SFC is unable to fix the problem, chances are the utility was unable to get the necessary files from the Windows image, which might have become broken. In this situation, you can use DISM to repair the Windows image (.wim), which then it will allow you to use the System File Checker to fix any issue with your Windows 10 installation.
<br />

<br />
<br />Tell me how you are doing and let me know if the information has been helpful in solving your query.

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first ran the&nbsp;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth as instructed through that link and the operation completed successfully<br />
Then I ran&nbsp;sfc /scannow with a result of "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>

            Try going back to a previous Windows point to repair.
<br />Follow the steps below to restore your computer to a previous date using a restore point:
<br />
<br />1- Type recovery in the search box of the taskbar and choose Recovery (Control Panel).
<br />2.- Click on Open System Restore.
<br />3.- Click on Next.
<br />4.- Select your restore point, and click Next.
<br />5.- Click on Finish.
<br />
<br />The computer will reboot and present a message on the desktop confirming that the restoration was successful.

<p>There is basically no restore point I can go to as it is a fresh install of win 10 pro.<br />
I have never run steam on this PC before so there is no recovery point i can go back to where steam worked..</p>
<p>any other solutions?</p>

            I recommend checking the Hard Disk and Ram Memory
<br />
<br />1.- First, close all the programs and files that you have open.
<br />2.- Click with the right mouse button in the Windows Start menu and select Control Panel. Then choose the category System and security. On the next screen, look down Administrative Tools on the right and click on that option.
<br />3.- One of those tools is the Windows Memory Diagnostic. Double click on it to open it.
<br />4.- The diagnosis gives two options to choose from. See what each one does and click on the one  you prefer:
<br />
<br />     Restart now and check if there are problems. It is best to select in most cases. Make sure to close all programs as I have asked before. The PC will reboot on its own when choosing this option. Right after, the check also starts automatically.
<br />
<br />Then check the Hard Disk.
<br />
<br />1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Press the Windows + X button at the same time, then choose Command Prompt (Admin))
<br />2. Type the following command, and replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan: “CHKDSK X:
<br />3. Hit the enter key, Command Prompt will now start CHKDSK.

<p>with that much mess, better reset windows which can save personal files but otherwise is a fresh install</p>
<p>
</p><p>then install steam again also with a game to test to see if its all well again</p>

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

    <title>Windows 10 update error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cocobrah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update error</h2>
                    So I recently installed Windows 10 onto my PC using a 1709 build image file I had and I can't get it to update for anything. I've been receiving the error code&nbsp;0x80080005 and I've scoured the internet looking for clues and tips on how to fix it. My wuauserv
 update service is stuck on starting, and I've tried stopping it in command prompt as well as disabling it in services and starting it manually after a reboot to no avail. I've used Windows Update Troubleshooter, I've downloaded the service pack from Microsoft
 catalog, I've edited the registry, I've even reinstalled Windows a second time attempting to fix this. Can someone please give me some idea of what I'm doing wrong?

<br />If you have any difficulty using the link above, with these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade

<p>Hi Babs_Skype,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For the record I am not a complete idiot and yes, I have read the detailed "guide"!&nbsp; It did not work, which is why I have been posting here.&nbsp; It did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a message a few weeks ago from Skype saying my credit card was going to expire and my subscription would not renew unless I updated my credit card details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I logged into Skype.&nbsp; I did not catch that due to a new log-in procedure I had logged into a Skype account I did not know that I had that was, I assume, created attached to my Office 365 account when Microsoft bought Skype.&nbsp; I updated my credit card details,
 noted that auto-recharge was not enabled - I enabled it and was immediately charged to my credit card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I logged into the Skype app and was puzzled to see the balance not updated and a credit card expiring warning.&nbsp; This is when it began to dawn on me that Microsoft had created a new Skype account for me without warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I figured the obvious thing to do would be to merge the two Skype accounts so that I can make use of the credit in the one that I did not know I had, have never used and need about as much as I need the constant brag reminders about Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the guide instructions you mentioned.&nbsp; Followed them. They DO NOT WORK!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I feel that Microsoft has scammed me out of money that I will never be able to effectively utilize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft certainly seems to be determined to make it as difficult as possible to make this most likely simple to fix problem fixed.&nbsp; It is in strange contrast to the great support that I have received with other Microsoft products.</p>

<p>Hi Babs_Skype,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For the record I am not a complete idiot and yes, I have read the detailed "guide"!&nbsp; It did not work, which is why I have been posting here.&nbsp; It did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a message a few weeks ago from Skype saying my credit card was going to expire and my subscription would not renew unless I updated my credit card details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I logged into Skype.&nbsp; I did not catch that due to a new log-in procedure I had logged into a Skype account I did not know that I had that was, I assume, created attached to my Office 365 account when Microsoft bought Skype.&nbsp; I updated my credit card details,
 noted that auto-recharge was not enabled - I enabled it and was immediately charged to my credit card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I logged into the Skype app and was puzzled to see the balance not updated and a credit card expiring warning.&nbsp; This is when it began to dawn on me that Microsoft had created a new Skype account for me without warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I figured the obvious thing to do would be to merge the two Skype accounts so that I can make use of the credit in the one that I did not know I had, have never used and need about as much as I need the constant brag reminders about Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the guide instructions you mentioned.&nbsp; Followed them. They DO NOT WORK!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I feel that Microsoft has scammed me out of money that I will never be able to effectively utilize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft certainly seems to be determined to make it as difficult as possible to make this most likely simple to fix problem fixed.&nbsp; It is in strange contrast to the great support that I have received with other Microsoft products.</p>

I'm also&nbsp; not able to use Skype minutes or even see them, and I don't see a detailed guide at your link.&nbsp; I have a previous Skype account. Skype has no Office 365 option on their screen.&nbsp; I tried the Skype option at the top of this page (drop down)&nbsp; It gives
 me the option to get a Skype account or "buy minutes".&nbsp; This is very irritating! Since I have a 365 subscription, your MS site&nbsp; should know that I have this when I am signed in!

<p>You need to essentially link your Office account to your Skype account to claim your minutes. Once the appropriate account is linked, the 60 minute subscription will appear in your Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process in the following FAQ should help you link the accounts to claim your minutes.</p>

            In 2011 Apple started to discontinue support for Firewire and by 2014 they stopped building them into Macs. They're not supporting Firewire now, so you won't find a Windows 10 driver for that technology.

    <title>BSOD an attempt was made to write to readonly memory - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD an attempt was made to write to readonly memory</h2>
                    <p>My computer went nuts and crashed last night. I have no idea what the issue is, I get the blue screen error "an attempt was made to write to readonly memory"...sometimes. My anti-virus "blocked a threat" just minutes before the crash, so I'm not sure if
 it could be virus related. The computer crashes on every attempt to start it, startup repair and system restore were not helpful either. Startup repair said it could not fix the problem, and system restore said it was successful...but still crashing. I was
 able to get it to start up in safe mode only (networking disabled) and grab the dump and sys info files</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have no idea what to do with that information.</p>
