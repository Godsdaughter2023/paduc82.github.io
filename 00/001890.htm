<h2>            Can&#39;t create a new meeting on Outlook 2011 and crash issues</h2>
                    I'm facing two main problems on my Outlook 2011:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) It doesn't allow me to create a meeting or an appointment. The button, on the top left side, appears disabled and also the option of creating a meeting on the menu bar. I can create a meeting on OWA, iCal and iPhone/iPad and it syncs well, but I still
 can't schedule from Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) My Outlook is crashing very often and for many different reasons. Sometimes when I acces a folder, when I right-click in a specific message or folder, when I try to create a contact. I rebuilt the identities, following some instructions I found here
 at the forum and also following Microsoft's official response (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2360509), but the problems (1 and 2) continued the same.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have MacBook Pro 13", with OS X Lion with all the latest updates. My Office is also updated, with the version 14.2.0 and the latest installed update 14.2.3.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use Exchange and this is only the one account configured in Outlook.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, does anyone know or have a tip how to solve this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>
<div><br />

<p>HI,</p>
<p><br />
I think I know what the issue is here and it's an easy fix. You must have started by using one of our five newer Access templates.</p>
<p>- Open the database again and then dismiss the error message and macro dialog box.</p>
<p>- Open the Settings table in datasheet view (just locate it the Navigation Pane and double-click on it).</p>
<p>- There will be only record in this table and one editable field called ShowWelcome. Clear that check mark for the record and then close the table to save the record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should do it. You can try closing and then re-opening the database and you'll see that no error is presented again.</p>

            Figured it out account is there, problem is it doesn't show up on initial screen. This very frustrating for those me who never use ms account email and should be fixed. So many little annoyances I almost returned phone andi only windows phone for years.
 Example i am hunting and pecking this message because text swiping drops words. Shows correct word just wont add it to message takes screw it I give up

            <blockquote>it doesn't show up on initial screen</blockquote>
<p>I do not understand that part, yet. What do you mean by initial screen: Lock screen, start screen or the initial screen of the app Outlook Mail? You said, you do not use Outlook.com – neither do I and I do not understand why it is shown in Outlook Mail at
 all, because I use my own E-mail as username. Therefore, are you about another E-mail account?</p>
<blockquote>I am hunting and pecking this message because text swiping drops words. Shows correct word just wont add it to message takes screw it I give up</blockquote>
<p>Which message are you about: Are you access Microsoft Answers via your Lumia 950? By the way, not a solution but a workaround: You are able to access Microsoft Answers via a desktop computer as well.</p>

            To be clear the steps I did, went to account setup, setup non ms email. Nothing happened no email access. Clicked on Outlook mail icon the intial screen asks which accounts to setup only account listed was Outlook. So I assumed itdid not find the other
 account

 you hit a software bug in Windows 10 Mobile. However, I have no idea how to circumvent that bug except through starting over again.</p>

<p>Did you properly uninstall AND CLEANUP all previous realtime antimalware before installing MSE?</p>
<p>Perform these checks:</p>
<p><span>Verify that you have removed<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>all other<span>&nbsp;</span>real-time antimalware products</strong> that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial
 product that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc). Then, use the cleanup tools here:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>List
 of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></p>
<p><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET).<span>&nbsp;</span>Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></p>
<p><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set.</span></p>
<p><span>Verify that you are using version 2498 of MSE (as of 2010-10-07).<span>&nbsp;</span>For more information, review<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2254596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2254596</span></a>
 .</span></p>
<p><span>Remove Zone Alarm if you have it and use the Windows Firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>Verify that the Windows Firewall is on, and set to defaults.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Verify that you are not using a proxy server.</span></p>
<p><span>Verify that you have “install updates automatically” selected in Windows Update (even though the MSE definition updates are optional).</span></p>
<p><span>In IE, reset all security zones to default level.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to remove and reinstall MSE as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To improve performance, do a disk cleanup and defrag, and then perform a full scan with MSE (this can take several hours).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Examine the necessity of the number of startup programs you have.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To examine your startup programs, go to START, RUN (or START, SEARCH) and enter MSCONFIG.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>Hello Ofer,</p>

<p>Thanks for the updates. From the screenshot I can see that, you clicked the <strong>
Reply</strong> button directly in the main Outlook window. Under this circumstance, it is a normal behavior that it won’t have the

            Hopefully you have backed up all your contacts using the backup to memory card that way you can simply do the old * 3 Green trick. I had the same thing on my old 6600 once and it worked perfectly then I simply restored from card.

This <i>might possibly</i> be a trickle charging issue with the battery. I stress the words might and possibly because this is rather rare to see on a mobile phone battery and is more frequently seen with laptop batteries so its extremely unlikely.<br />
<br />
What basically happens (This is something of an over-simplification) is because these batteries are designed to be run down to the point where they are exhausted, they keep a little bit of power in them to restart the recharge process. However sometimes this
 tiny power reserve can be lost and the battery doesn't really recharge itself even though it says that it is.<br />
<br />
Try getting a new battery for your phone and seeing how far that works.<br />
<br />
A more likely situation is a software fault so try and get down to a NSC and get them to look at your device as they are able to retrieve data from your phone memory before they reflash anything, however there is a charge for this.

            hi...<br />
<br />
i have been facing a similar kind of problem, but i guess it couldnt get any worser. my phone battery went dead one day and then tried charging and nothing appeared on the screen. absolutely nothing, not even the charging status usually shown on the top. took
 it to a nokia service centre and they said its perfectly fine and to put in a new battery... i did that, and the new battery got destroyed (no idea how). took it again to the nokia service centre and they said, they couldnt figure whats wrong with my phone.
 tried another nokia service centre and the guy there found when he put in another battery it worked, but on charging it the backlight failed. on continuously charging his battery got destroyed (incidentally he too was using an N80). after over a month he finally
 gave up and said he could rectify it. i tried everything written in this post but to no luck :'(<br />
<br />
the phone was bought from the UAE and i live in India. unfortunatlely for me i lost the bill even though the phone is still under warranty. i called up the store where i got thephone from and they said unless i have a bill, they cant help me out, (some kind
 of silly company policy of theirs). any advise or help is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks

            Does the phone work when you have the power cable plugged in?<br />
<br />
If it does, that would suggest the problem is the battery. If it doesn't, it would suggest it's the charging mechanism in the phone.<br />
<br />
From what you say, it sounds like it's the charging mechanism, in which case you have to send the phone to Nokia for repair.<br />
<br />
I would contact Nokia in UAE and get an address you can mail your phone to: if your phone is within warranty it should be fine even without a receipt as they can check its age from the serial number.

            hmm... like i said earlier... 2 Nokia Service Centres have given up hope on my phone... once in a while when i switch it on.. it works (Thank God). But then i switch it off immediately (i am scared , what if something happens!!!)<br />
<br />
there is no nokia service centre in the UAE, but they have a company there called "Emirates Computers" which does all the repair on behalf of Nokia (thats what the silly store said.)

            <p>FYI i have sorted this issue.</p>
<p>It was not a Windows 10 issue rather an issue from doing a fresh install of Windows 10 and Office 2013 that re-enabled an old Outlook setting i had disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The notification with the circle&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">with the picture of the person is coming from the Outlook option 'Display a Desktop Alert' pictured below.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea80e107-4ab4-408a-bce8-88236201c675" /></p>
<p>2. The notification with the blue Outlook envelope <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
is coming from the Outlook Rules and Alerts. I had created a rule to 'Display a Desktop Alert' pictured below.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bda8c59-1d80-4a32-8eed-c0313df6eef3" /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have disabled the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Outlook option to 'Display a Desktop Alert' and left my Rule&nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>to

<h2>            Transport Rule notifications - no FROM&#58; field in header</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Let me discribe the situation first. Exchange Online Protection is deployed in a standalone mode protecting the on-premise Exchange infrastructure. EOP-facing hub transport servers are Exchange 2007. Rest of the infra is 2010. All mailboxes are hosted on-premise.</p>
<p>In Exchange Online Protection, there is a rule that moves to quarantine messages containing a certain types of attachments. Each time some message is put to quarantine by this rule, another Action of this rule should be sending a notification to the recipient.</p>
<p>And here is the problem. Notifications are sent with a blank (or actually missing) FROM: field in HTTP headers. The result is that on-premise hub tranposrt servers are dropping such messages due to 554 5.1.0 Sender denied error.&nbsp;This seems like a serious
 bug on O365 side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, the notification goes through (like the first one sent in a given day), so I managed to gather its HTTP headers:</p>

<p>Basically the notification has no sender address and no FROM field at all. I've opened case with MS, but they were not able to help. The notifications work for Exchange Online hosted mailboxes, but not for on-premise ones. I've been advised to configure
 an on-premise transport rule that will be allowing such messages in. However I can't figure out an action that such rule should take in order to allow them in. Unfortunately you cannot edit the FROM header using a transport rule.</p>
<p>Any idea how this could be worked around? Maybe someone already struggled with simmilar problem?</p>

<p>Microsoft has never built a 'self-defense' module into the program because they understand that once malware has successfully bypassed your anti-malware it owns the PC and can do whatever it pleases.&nbsp; The fact that these 'tests' were passed by some doesn't
 mean that someone with better malware can't disable any of them, since they often do.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;side effect of adding self-protection is 'bloat', since this necessarily increases the size and complexity of the anti-malware program as a whole.&nbsp; This is a trade-off in the attempt to create the 'do-it-all' anti-malware, which has always eventually resulted
 in overly large and complex programs.</p>
<p>The best method to protect the anti-malware and thus the PC as a whole is to normally&nbsp;operate as a 'Limited' or 'Restricted' user, since these don't have the privilege to remove or disable programs that only an Administrator can install.&nbsp; Operating as an
 Administrator increases the risk of a successful infection, since many of the vulnerabilities discovered only allow the malware to attack with the privileges of the user logged in at the time.</p>

            Just add that however, if Malware try to modify or terminate Anti-Virus in first place MSE would detect it as Malware but once Malware pass Anti-Virus , the control is over Virus as Rob said.

Yes, very worried at the really poor attitude of MS SE essentially waving the white flag to an intruder!&nbsp; This issue is so basic that it beggars belief and I think unfortunately symptomatic of the ages old attitude in Microsoft towards matters of security in

Sorry Frank Poster, but you don't have a clue!</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, once malware has managed to breach a system's initial defenses and gained administrative access&nbsp;all bets are off and it can basically do whatever it wants.&nbsp; This is regularly proven by many of the socially engineered malware such as
 the 'Fake Antimalware' products, since these often disable the existing 'real' antimalware applications no matter what "self-protection" they claim to have in place.</p>
<p>However, since this thread was written about a year ago, MSE has added some file system level security configuration to the installation process.&nbsp; Though this doesn't guarantee that malware which has gained administrative access to the system will be stopped,
 it does help to slow it down some by requiring it to undo these changes, which is something that MSE's behavioral monitoring can detect and thus attempt to block.&nbsp; Note that this doesn't require an add-on 'self-protection'&nbsp;module, since the behavioral monitoring
 is already part of the built-in protection that MSE includes.</p>
<p>So unlike your belief that MSE doesn't try to protect itself, the reality is that it just can't currently be done with 100% success by anyone, but it is being attempted without the addition of a useless module that would simply add overhead.</p>
<p>As I also mentioned above, the best way to reduce the chance of a successful malware infection is to operate as a 'Limited/Restricted' user, since this removes the ability for malware to gain administrative access directly&nbsp;through your account.&nbsp; Though this
 still doesn't protect from unpatched&nbsp;vulnerabilities which allow&nbsp;either&nbsp;elevation of priviledge or direct administrative access, it does greatly reduce the day to day risks for an otherwise well patched system.</p>

            MS SE processes can be easily terminated in the task bar, so what kind of self-protection is that?
<br />
<br />
Even if a malware is detected it cannot be guaranteed that it will be successfully handled, especially if that malware is then able to terminate the AV.<br />
<br />
If the malware is not initially detected then the behaviour monitor may suspect something but again it could be neutralised before that step.<br />
<br />
There are other attack vectors that make it very surprising that MS SE can be terminated without any effort whatsoever, let alone by sophisticated malware.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong it has very good malware detection especially with rootkits, and we have it installed on several PCs here, but we are now examining the situation and reviewing it since discovering how easy it was to disable this very promising AV.<br />

            <p>You're not listening Frank, no process on Windows can truly be 'protected', just restarted.&nbsp; Continually restarting a process when another process which is designed to kill it is watching means that it will simply be killed again, creating a pathological
 situation which makes the PC basically unusable as a result.&nbsp; Microsoft knows this, apparently others still don't.</p>
<p>The real point here is that there is absolutely no such thing as true process&nbsp;'protection' available within Windows.&nbsp; If this were true than someone else would have already done it and would have the only 'perfect' antimalware application that couldn't be
 killed, so don't you think you'd have heard of this if it actually existed?</p>
<p>The only way to insure that this can't happen is to keep the malware from being allowed to gain administrative access in the first place, which is why Microsoft (and every true security knowlegeable person) will tell you to operate only in a Limited/Restricted
 account whenever possible.&nbsp; I've done this with multiple systems I support including at a medium sized business and have never had malware successfully embed itself in critical ares of the operating system.</p>
<p>What you are trying to believe is that two processes continually attempting to kill each other is somehow successful protection, which is a fallacy.&nbsp; Instead, MSE will stop the infection if it's known (signatures, heuristics) or attempt&nbsp;to notify you if
 it's not (behavioral), before the malware can actually kill it.&nbsp; Even if it does, the missing (or Red)&nbsp;MSE Icon is an indicator that something is wrong and needs your attention.</p>
<p>Finally, let me ask you a question.&nbsp; Have you ever found an antimalware application that malware is completely unable to shutdown?&nbsp; Not in quick tests, but in real world use where everyone using it never has this issue?</p>

<br />
No that is not what I am saying at all.<br />
<br />
People with a wider experience of other antimalware solutions are aware of successful self-protection in other products, in fact it is a critical success factor in dealing with malware. Simply not designing that into the AV and instead only relying on limited
 user account is not sufficient.<br />
<br />
This clearly is not getting anywhere so it is time to find expertise elsewhere.<br />

            <p>I noticed that you've posted in the other thread relating to self-protection, so I won't bother trying to get you to understand what that thread also already states, which is that only a few&nbsp;core Windows modules are not allowed to be terminated.</p>
<p>What I will&nbsp;repeat though is what I asked above; Exactly which antimalware self-protection in other products are you referring to?&nbsp; Specifically, which of these has been shown in third-party&nbsp;testing to&nbsp;successfully 'protect' the antimalware application and
 not result in it being disabled?</p>
<p>I'd be very interested to know which security application has managed to perform this feat, since I've never heard of it and have more than 30 years in the computing industry (pre-PC) and over 20 years dealing with malware and security products in education,
 industry and home use.</p>

<p>Hello, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8bd7d44f-06ab-4b1a-a131-8f73667d10a1" title="jenzsh6t">

<p>
</p><p>Glad you reached out. The best way to transfer your music files from Hp laptop to your Windows phone is by uploading the files in
<strong><a href="http://onedrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive</a></strong> in your laptop and downloading it to your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards with the second question, may I know what application are you using? You might want to try reinstalling the application and check if it made any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>You have changed from albeit old Symbian S60 3rd Ed. FP2 device with more features to a newer Series 40 6th Ed. FP1 which runs JAVA applications so perhaps

<h3> samara.n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tech Issue&#58; Cursor runs left in MS Word document. After it reaches the beginning document, MS Word is stuck minimized&#47;inactive</h2>
                    <p>I'm on ASUS laptop, Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>This has happened to me several times while I was typing in MS Word document. Suddenly, after a certain keypress or something, my cursor started running left as if I was holding down the left arrow key. Nothing I did could stop it, be it pressing Page Down,&nbsp;End,
 right arrow, etc. When I switched to other windows and back, the cursor was shown top-left of the document (shown in small window demo when I hovered over MS Word on the start bar), and I could not get the minimized MS Word to come back active after that.
 The only thing I could do was right-clicking it on the start bar and XClose Window, and let it go Not Responding, and try to recover my document later.</p>

<p>I'll try to work in safe mode and see if the problem persists, although it doesn't happen too often so it might take quite a while to conclude whether the problem has been fixed. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, another MS-related key problem which happens more frequently is that when I type something, the first letter of the word often gets doubled or tripled as if I was pressing down on the button for too long, which I am certain is not the case, because
 I need to deliberately hold down the key for at least 0.5 seconds before my computer recognizes it as a 'held' key and starts producing the same letter in a row.</p>

    <title>Notebook access issues in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonl-j  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notebook access issues in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had an incredibly frustrating day with OneNote today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Universal OneNote app from the store as my sole note taking method in college. &nbsp;All of last year, this worked pretty much flawlessly. &nbsp;I have my primary Outlook address, which is how I log into all of my Office services, and a college address through
 which I qualify for a 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This month I began at a new college which also offers a 365 subscription. &nbsp;In advance of the new semester I closed all of last year's notebooks and created fresh ones for this semester. &nbsp;Once I completed the upgrade to Windows 10, I noticed that the app
 seemed to be having syncing issues, but assumed that they would resolve themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now two weeks deep into my third year of Engineering school. &nbsp;Today I attempted to open up one of the notebooks from last year to check something, but found that it was not available to me. &nbsp;In fact none of the notebooks I created and maintained last
 year are accessible at all! &nbsp;When I attempt to access the shortcut in my local OneDrive, I am met with:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9518cb17-db0d-4297-bae0-9d665b868609" /></p>
<p>This despite the fact that I am logged in as myself. &nbsp;I am the owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was very upsetting, and led me to investigate the contents of my OneDrive further, only to discover that none of the notebooks I have created this semester are present! &nbsp;Nothing I have worked on in the last two weeks has been uploaded. &nbsp;Working from
 the desktop version of OneNote 2013 yielded nothing; it could not see any of my notebooks either, despite being logged in with the identical credentials. &nbsp;Manually selecting the sync option in the store app accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then created a new notebook in the store app as a test, and it immediately synced to OneDrive and was accessible from the desktop app. &nbsp;Still, all of my classwork notebooks returned the same sync error. &nbsp;I then created a new notebook in the store app with
 an identical name to one of the notebooks with the sync error. &nbsp;Not only was the new notebook created successfully, it also synced to OneDrive with all of the content of its non-syncing counterpart except for the first section, which ended up in its entirety
 in the Misplaced Sections notebook, along with a syncing error of its own:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fde4dce-32e3-47ec-b53d-52c8e70055a7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the Learn More link leads to a page instructing me to simply drag the misplaced tab into the notebook I'd like it to be in. &nbsp;I'd be happy to do this, except that I can't in the store app, and the notebook doesn't sync to the desktop. &nbsp;I also can't
 drag tabs from the store app to the desktop app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since repeated the duplicate name procedure with each of my other non-syncing notebooks, all with the same results as the first: a version of the notebook appears on OneDrive, minus its first section which is now in the misplaced sections notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, while attempting to restore access to my classwork from last year, I added both of my school accounts to OneNote. &nbsp;When attempting to open other notebooks, I am met with the following error message:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4d2e221-1a8b-414f-a346-a9334c1f00e1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly, this is all horrible. &nbsp;I don't know what is going on, but I have at this point lost access to an entire year's worth of schoolwork and notes and was potentially one buggy app update away from losing all of this year's as well. &nbsp;Though I seem to
 have devised a workaround for the latter issue, I cannot afford these kind errors from my daily driving software. &nbsp;Please advise on the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How do I restore access to my old notebooks? &nbsp;I could open them all as of a month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How do I move the sections from the misplaced sections notebook in the store app into the notebook in which they belong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Can I please have some explanation as to how all of this could have happened in the first place? &nbsp;It is incredibly unnerving, and does not make me comfortable entrusting my data to OneNote if it is too unstable to keep it safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help. &nbsp;Please advise if you require any further details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Simon</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to restore the missing sections of each of my notebooks by creating new pages and copying and pasting over content. &nbsp;All notebooks are not syncing and everything from this year is in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am still no closer to opening my notebooks from last year. &nbsp;Since I have not heard from a Microsoft representative here, I will create a new post pertaining only to the inaccessible notebooks.</p>

    <title>Mail failure when trying to send PDF excel file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ihidalgo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail failure when trying to send PDF excel file</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet in Excel that I usually share going through File - Share - Email - PDF. This feature was working perfectly before, but now when I follow these steps to PDF the spreadsheet and send it as email through Outlook, I get a general mail failure
 message. Also PDF Maker box comes up and I have to choose the spreadsheets that I want to PDF. Multiple people will be sharing the same spreadsheet and I would like the PDF process to be as simple as possible. Has anyone found a solution for this issue? Thanks
 in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I'm using Office 2013.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With regard to your concern, the option to send as PDF and send as XPS commands in Excel, no longer work after the recent security update (KB3128008).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive Microsoft Installer (.msi)-based updates for Office 2013, download and install the January 10, 2017, update for Excel 2013 (<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3141475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB3141475</a></strong>).<br />
<br />
If you receive Click-to-Run updates for Office 2013, update to version 15.0.4893.1002. You can either wait until you’re prompted to install the update or get it immediately by clicking
<strong>File &gt; Account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update Now.</strong></p>
<p>

<h2>            Text Code not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to get a code sent to my phone I type in the last four digits of my phone number and hit next and an error comes up saying "There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later."<br />
<br />
This started happening when trying to verify my Microsoft account my two computers when I reloaded Windows 10 on them. I've been trying this every day for the last week on both machines and get the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching the forum and the last posts I see are here:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/osecurity-osafe/theres-a-temporary-problem-with-the-service-please/469d4d9f-be86-4dfc-9f2b-ec4348dbd54b&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it looks like that was 5 years ago and people were helped on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>I already know my password, it started as trying to get a code to verify my account within Windows 10 after I built a new PC and also fresh installed Windows on my laptop (it's unable to verify on either one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it signs me into my account on my comp but it's not verified. So I go to Windows&gt;Settings&gt;Accounts. There's then a message there "You need to update some info on your Microsoft account" and there is a clickable link under that "Update info". I select
 that and a windows pop-up comes up. Full disclosure, the first time it did it the window asked me to verify by sending a text to my device so I typed in the last four digits of my phone and it gave the message&nbsp;<span>"There's
 a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later." Then I tried to select the option "I don't have this" and setup to use my Yahoo! email to send the code to but now it's showing that I need to wait
 30 days for that request. I tried cancelling the request though and it asks me to type in the last four digits of my phone number and send a code but then it gives me the&nbsp;</span><span>"There's a temporary problem with the service.
 Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later." message again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it appears to be somewhat stuck, I can wait the 25 more days but I'm still not convinced it'll work after that, and I'm not sure why it's not letting me cancel it either.</p>

            It's the two factor authentication that's the issue, not really my password.

            Still no luck unfortunately, I cleared cache and history and the two factor authentication still will not send me a code so I can't change the password. I guess I will wait until the 27th to see if I can get a code via the second email that I setup. If
 not, then I'll have to go through the recovery options. The weird thing is that my account seems fine EXCEPT the sending the code to my phone, that appears to be the issue. Maybe it's a Microsoft problem.

<p>Hi Ann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why you're not able to save a Microsoft Word document. This can include a recent update, system files that got corrupted or permission settings that got changed to name a few. For us to resolve your concern,
 kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made or updates installed prior to the issue occurring?</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Where are you trying to save the </span>Microsoft Word document<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">? Is it on the local drive or a network drive?</span></li><li>If you're saving on the local drive, does the issue only occur when saving to a specific folder or does the issue occur in any folder that you tested?</li><li>Does the issue only occur with saving a Microsoft Word document or are other Microsoft Office applications affected?</li><li>What is the device your using as well as what is the operating system installed on your device?</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows Tech Preview 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>I was just wondering, about the windows update. I have had the Tech Preiew 10 installed now pretty much since it first went public. and I havent had one single update except for the normal drivers for my other hardware and software that I get on any version
 of windows.. Is this correct ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just figured that since this is work in progress that there would be many updates on the windows update center.. but I have seen none..........</p>

            <p>It's only been a week. This isn't a 'daily build' preview. There will be updates, but likely in the weeks or months timeframe. The only announced 'update' we have is the consumer focused preview in the spring. Be patient and keep giving feedback on the bits
 we have.</p>

    <title>Default Picture Style in Outlook to Drop Shadow Rectangle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moxie greenwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Picture Style in Outlook to Drop Shadow Rectangle</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I would desperately like to paste pictures into emails and have them automatically have the drop shadow rectangle style to set them apart from the rest of the text, especially when I'm sending screenshots of text on a screen. &nbsp;Even if I add the Picture Styles
 gallery to the Quick Access bar, it's still a several-click process (select photo &gt; click picture gallery &gt; select drop shadow style) for every picture. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!

            The individual items in the various galleries can't be added to the ribbon or QAT individually. There is a shadow on/off command, but it doesn't appear to work. 
<br />
<br />If you can use a macro and always use the same setting, you could use a macro. (I don't think I have any in my macro stash that do this.)
