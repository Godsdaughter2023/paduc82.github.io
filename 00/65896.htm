                    <p>HOW ARE YOU?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HAVE A PROBLEM TO SWITCH MY CANON SCANNER FROM WINDOWS 7 TO WINDOWS 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DOWNLOADED A NEW DRIVER FROM CANON WEBSITE:</p>

<p>
</p><p>1) CANON PRINTER IS WORKING WELL.</p>
<p>2) CANON SCANNER DOESN'T WORK. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I TRIED MORE THAN 2 DAYS TO FIX BUT SCANNER DOES NOT WORK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------------------------------------</p>
<p>FINALLY I FOUND HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. </p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) INSTALL DRIVER CANON MF3240:</p>

<p>
</p><p>2) INSTALL A SECOND DRIVER: CANOSCAN LIDE 120</p>
<p>
</p><p>sc68-win-lide120-1_02-ea33_3</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) IF YOU DON'T INSTALL CANOSCAN LIDE 120, CANON IMAGE CLASS MF 3240 WON'T WORK.</p>

            <p>I have Windows10, in use with a Canon MF3240 printer/copier/fax/scanner. &nbsp;The printer, copier, and fax all work fine, but the scanner does not. I use a scanning tool called PaperScan. &nbsp;Whenever I try to use it I get "No device is available. If your device
 has a WIA driver you should select the WIA acquisition standard". &nbsp;How do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried both methods listed above and neither one worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I be using a scanning tool other than "PaperScan"? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help that you give me.</p>

<h2>            WAY To MANY Services Running in Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit</h2>
                    I Have (My PC) has way Too Many services running constatntly and I don't know what ones my system needs to kept running and which ones it doesn't!!&nbsp; I read the details about each service but unless your a Microsoft Tech or a PC Tech people like me who
 is just a the average user has NO IDEA what any of it means!!!<br />
<br />
I am running a Cisco Wireless Wifi Adapter that is connected to a household Network router located in another room and I am constantly having issues with my connection to our network (meaning I lose connection) and in the windows services there are WAY too
 many services that is related to networks and such and I have no idea what services could be conflicting with one or the other. I also have some network related services that won't start AT ALL and I get a message stating that "they are marked for deletion"
 What does that mean and Where do I fix it??????????<br />
<br />
some more issues I believe the services are causing!<br />
<br />
My PC Graphics are not as Clear as they should be! <br />
I don't think my systems memory and other stuff is being read correctly!<br />
<br />
WHAT PROGRAM can I download to Fix my Problems and Where is there a BASIC Plain English Dictionary for what The services are and what do they mean (to where a NON GENIUS 8 yr old)&nbsp; could understand all the High Tech Mumbo JUMBO!<br />

You have listed nothing here to help you with.&nbsp; Just general complaints.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
How many processes/services are "way too many"?&nbsp;&nbsp; I am at 130 right now - running fine on my four year old laptop... Outlook 2010, Firefox 20, Internet Explorer 9, Acrobat Reader XI, TeamViewer, and about a dozen other active applications being used.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
It's probably beyond you to fix it and beyond anyone to lead you through it without remotely taking over (don't recommend that) or getting more information from you about what services/processes are running that you are concerned with, etc.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
In general...<br />

Great Thank you for Responding But I still Don't Know what Process's are needed and For what its needed for!
</p>
<p>as I stated earlier about All Of The Network Related Services There are services for a Modem connection and a Ethernet Connection and A Wifi Wireless Connection and some of the services that are needed to run my wifi adapter are needed&nbsp;for a&nbsp;Ethernet connection
 or a WAN? I don't know what most of everything is and or how&nbsp;what is related, etc.. Do I Need The Windows Media Player Network services or no.. ANYTHING related to the word NETWORK makes me think I Need&nbsp; that to connect to our home wireless router!&nbsp; and when
 I said that basically all the services are running.. I meant Every Service that is Using Hi-Tech Descriptions as in "IEEE ..."&nbsp; the services are easy for Computer Tech's to Understand but for a mom like me that just uses the pc for a game or web searches I
 AM LOST!</p>

Google or Ask with SPECIFICS.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
There are millions of possible combinations of millions of hardware devices of millions of configurations and such.&nbsp; No one here knows your system.&nbsp; You have given no specific process names, no specific hardware details (make &amp; models).<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Cisco is *not* specific.&nbsp; Windows 7 is *not* specific.&nbsp; "IEEE ..." is not specific.<br />

Go to http://www.blackviper.com/ there is a complete list of every possible permutation<br />
<br />
Just realize if you delete (or disable) a service now and 6 months from now you install something that needed it, that app would fail and you wont remember what you did.<br />

    <title>Xbox LIVE Gold Membership Trouble... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iansluck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox LIVE Gold Membership Trouble...</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone, I've been having a lot of trouble with my Gold membership recently.......so here is I guess a shorter story of a longer story. Here it goes: Microsoft was unable to charge me for Gold last month (April) because I had insufficient funds. They
 sent me constant emails saying to renew or buy more. Finally in May I renewed my membership with a new credit card. So I purchased new membership and it said "Congratulations, you renewed your membership!". So, I didn't think about it and moved on. Then, the
 next day I went to my console looked out Account Management and it said next bill date 7/2011? I figured MS charged me twice for the month I missed and the month I just bought. No worries. Now today, I looked again under Account Management and it says next
 bill date 8/2011? I have no idea why it says this and I just checked on Xbox.com and it says my next bill date is in fact in June. What is going on? Which one is it? Will MS renew my membership in June or August? Will I be charged? Can someone help, please?
 Thanks.</p>

<p>ok btw 7/2011 is july</p>
<p>ok back to the subject</p>
<p>please login into <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://billing.microsoft.com</a> </p>
<p>it will explain the purchases</p>
<p>but you were 27days into the month when you went into suspension now the odd part is normally an account goes to silver after 45 days</p>
<p>to be honest with billing questions if you are having issues with info displayed by billing.microsoft.com its best to call support and ask for billing which they can explain it to you (i can't because i don't see your billing info and thats private info
 anyways)</p>
<p>unfortunately i'm as puzzled as you are</p>
<p>if you purchased a month to month membership it should end at 6/2011</p>
<p>unless you added a prepaid membership card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh maybe this will help</p>
<p>recover your account or test xbox live connection</p>
<p>this will update your account according to the website</p>

<p>Okay thanks. I'll contact billing. But it's strange as I already tried recovering my account and it still says 8/11 is my next bill date on my console.</p>

<h2>            USB ports stopped working after windows update.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A few days back, my windows got updated and since then two of the three usb ports are not working. The device manager shows everything alright with no yellow exclamation marks at all under Universal Serial Bus Controllers. All drivers are up to date with
 no problem devices detected. I have tried running my laptop in safe mode, but still the usb ports didn't work. I have also tried refreshing and resetting my PC to default settings but still the malfunctioning of USB ports remains as it is. Suggest me a doable
 here.</p>
<p>PS: I am not a geek when it comes to PC troubleshooting, so I am expecting a really workable solution of the above posted issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop specs are as follows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Model Number: Haier 7G-5H</p>
<p>CPU: intel core i3-4010U @ 1.7Ghz</p>
<p>RAM: 4GB</p>
<p>500GB Hdd</p>
<p>windows 8.1 (64-bit OS)</p>

            <p>If you reset the system (clean install of Windows) and verified the device drivers (chipset drivers for your motherboard) are the latest from the actual manufacturer: sounds like the hardware died (or you noticed the death of said hardware) at a coincidental
 moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to REALLY test it out - make a Linux LiveCD (the term "LiveCD" may be deprecated, as it could be a bootable USB device too) and boot with it - then try to utilize the USB ports in question while booted to the completely different operating system
 on the same computer.&nbsp; If they work - it is a SOFTWARE issue inside your Windows install - likely a driver one.&nbsp; If they do not work - it is a HARDWARE issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/try-ubuntu-before-you-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Try Ubuntu before you install it</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It shouldn't NEED to be repeated, but you want to "Try Ubuntu" when booting from it and not "Install Ubuntu" (at this point - maybe you will decide you do want to install later, who knows..?)</p>

            <p>This is a bs answer.&nbsp; Have the same issue.&nbsp; Thought if may be a virus even though all my virus protection found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried rolling back update, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>broke down and bought windows 8.1 and still same issue.&nbsp; If this is a hardware issue, WINDOWS CAUSED IT.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if not, it is a WINDOWS issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix this, this is all over the windows forums and everywhere else... windows has not solution for it at all and keeps tossing out bs band-aids.</p>

            <p>Wow - a little hostile towards the volunteers on this peer-to-peer volunteer-based worldwide public web forum, eh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows did not CAUSE your hardware issue *if* it is a hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is a software issue and you bought Windows 8.1 but just UPGRADED in-place - you left the software issue in place too.&nbsp; You would need to do a CLEAN install to really test if it was software only issue (other than trying the LiveCD suggestion.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft did not likely make or do they likely supply the drivers (beyond generic) that allow the operating system (Windows) to communicate *properly and completely* with the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the LiveCD test given, report back and maybe someone else here (or even myself) will volunteer some more time to resolve a another complete stranger's issue with them...</p>

            <p>apologies for the tone.&nbsp; you are right that I was harsh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the full deal</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the last windows update on my windows 7 I had sever mouse lag.&nbsp; gaming, using word, internet, or any program was painful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought at first it was the mouse... replaced it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought maybe a virus, double and triple checked all 3 programs I run.&nbsp; AVG, fine, Malewarebytes, fine, Hitman Pro, Fine... none of them could fine anything more then some tracking cookies to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>did lots of reading and found it was a common issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a number of fixes and nothing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, thought maybe it was a hardware issue.&nbsp; Bought a new hard drive and windows 8.1 and new wireless mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; So clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still mouse lag and keyboard hang ups.&nbsp; The mouse lag is not as bad if I use the gearhead mouse, but still lags and the keyboard hangs... so stuff is not always typed properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is not a hardware issue.&nbsp; It is a Windows issue.&nbsp; Windows needs to fix it.&nbsp; All these other fixes are band aids as I said and work for some and not others.&nbsp; I've read like 10 different ways to fix and some work for some.&nbsp; So far, my issue is only
 improve, but even typing this Ive had to backspace over a dozen times to fix what the keyboard hung up on... given I use this for work, that is a big pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh, and specs are; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Gigabite Mother Board</p>
<p>Intel i5 750 @ 2.67 GHz</p>
<p>16 GB Ram</p>
<p>1TB WD 7200 RPM Main HD (New)</p>
<p>1TB WD 7200 RPM back up HD</p>
<p>GTS 450 GPU </p>
<p>Windows 8.1 (64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Literally the only other possible issue would be the motherboard... but just not thinking that is it given everyone is having the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, Apologies on the hostility :)&nbsp; was typed in frustration after installing new HD, Windows 8.1 and new mouse/keyboard...

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The frustration is understandable.&nbsp; Not sure your issue is actually the same as the OP (they are reporting USB ports that don't seem to be working at all - you are reporting poor performance from the USB ports in question - and I assume ALL of them or you
 would have just moved your keyboard to a port that works to at least lessen your frustation.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were in the situation, here is what I would try, in order, and why/what I would be testing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First - I would restart the system, log in, open nothing but NOTEPAD and begin typing to see if I notice the issues I am noting elsewhere.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?&nbsp; I want to eliminate the issue being APPLICATION related.&nbsp; Notepad is a simplistic application that allows me to type a large amount of data without worrying about anything like spell checkers, Internet speed, etc.&nbsp; If I can type a long set of text
 (a few paragraphs, minimal - more if I want to be sure of a valid test) and not see the issue - the problem may lie elsewhere (in a specific application, perhaps.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the NOTEPAD test essentially produced no problems, I would then likely open WORDPAD and perform the same test with the same text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?&nbsp; WORDPAD is a bit more sophisticated than NOTEPAD, but not by much.&nbsp; It does concern itself with formatting and the likes, so I just wanted to step up the backend processing a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the WORDPAD test produced no issues, I would then try whatever word processor product (Microsoft Office Word, Libre Office, etc.) I have installed with the same text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?&nbsp; A true word processing application will have all sorts of checks and balances going on while one types.&nbsp; This added backend processing could be very telling in discovering the root of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that still produced no issues, I would then try entering data on WEB FORMS - such as these forums - to see what the result was.&nbsp; I would do that in several different web forms and several different web browsers (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla
 Firefox, Opera, etc.) and record the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?&nbsp; I have now throw the Internet and networking in general into the mix.&nbsp; Another variable to eliminate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, if all the tests went well, then I would guess I was done or I would try in the application I always see the issue in and start troubleshooting from there.&nbsp; If, at any point in the process I noted the issue I had before, I would have an idea
 where to start from.&nbsp; If the NOTEPAD resulted in the issue revealing itself - I would want to then do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot the system into SAFE mode so that the device drivers being loaded are the GENERIC ones and a lot of the background applications that might get loaded on a normal boot would NOT load - given me a system that is all but completely JUST Microsoft Windows
 and not all the other stuff that may have gotten loaded (device drivers, other software, etc.)&nbsp; I would then perform the NOTEPAD and WORDPAD tests.&nbsp; If the issue showed itself in NORMAL mode but not in SAFE MODE - it is a DEVICE DRIVER or SOFTWARE issue beyond
 just Windows generic stuff.&nbsp; If the issue still exists - then it is time to continue with another test:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would then create and utilize the LiveCD I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; In my case, it would actually be a bootable USB stick, but no matter.&nbsp; I would create my bootable USB stick with UBUNTU on it (or another bootable Linux distribution) by downloading the ISO
 image <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">from here</a> and I might follow instructions
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">such as these</a> to create said bootable USB stick.&nbsp; I would then figure out how to tell my system to boot from the USB stick at startup and do so.&nbsp; I would choose to TRY UBUNTU
 and let it boot into the fully functional UBUNTU install with drivers loaded and ready to go.&nbsp; I would open some applications and start typing in them, to test for the issues I noted in Windows (even in SAFE mode) to see if they exist.&nbsp; If they do: something
 is wrong with the hardware most likely at this point.&nbsp; If the issues do not present themselves: it could still be a hardware issue, but unlikely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I got to that point and the issues did not exist in the UBUNTU boot but did int he Windows boot: things would get interesting then.&nbsp; Especially given that since from your story I gather it was working at some point in the past but stopped working recently
 under Windows 7 . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are willing to go through everything I just described like I would if the problem presented itself to me and document the results as you go along and post them all here: you might help yourself and others and you definitively would show what does
 and does not work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way: which specific Gigabyte motherboard?&nbsp; (Model)?</p>

<p>Hi JKSmoothCrminal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest update your Skype for Business 2015 to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4011638/january-2-2018-update-for-skype-for-business-2015-lync-2013-kb4011638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the latest version</a>, if the issue persist after updating to the latest version, please try the following steps to clean the cache up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log out of Skype for Business</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigate to Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete the folder whose name begin with sip_</p>

                    The scanner of my multifunctional Epson Stylus PHOTO TX800FW does not work since upgrading from Windows Vista to Windows 8. I downloaded a printer driver from Epson which work with the printing function but no the scanner. Scanner is istill with scan drivers
 for Windows Vista. Is there any way I can solve this problem?...Epson washed their hands saying that there is no scan driver to support Windows 8.

            <p><span>Hi William,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for coming up with your query on Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have mentioned that you’re not able to get the scanner drivers from the website for
<b>windows 8.</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, as the scanners are still not working, try installing Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode..</span></p>
<p><span>Kindly click on the link to get the drivers:</span></p>

            <p>Thank you very much Vikrant, following your advice I downloaded the Window 7 Epson Scan driver 3.49 (for Windows 7) to my desktop and the changed its settings to run it in compatibility mode as an administrator and also I had to change it to Windows 7 since
 it was set to Windows XP by default. Then I pressed the Scan driver icon from my desktop and the installation ran smoothly and after restarting my PC, now my Scanner and my printer both work very well.</p>
<p>Epson also advised me to use this driver, but did not mention the most important thing, that is to change the settings. Otherwise I would have been very frustrated by&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Thanks to your advice now I have a printer and scanner working properly.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Williams Elera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: I would like to ask you about the background colour of the Start Page in Windows 8.</p>
<p>Is there any possibility in Windows 8 to change the background colour of the Start Page. My background colour is green, but my new applications tiles&nbsp;are also coming&nbsp;in green colour.</p>
<p>Thanks for any idea how to resolve this.</p>

<h2>            Need a D drive on a laptop with 1 SSD drive and 4 primary partitions preinstalled</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell XPS 13 laptop with only one SSD Hard drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I installed all my software in the C drive, so hopefully I don't need to reinstall everything again by resetting Windows 10.</p>
<p><br />
There are 4 primary partitions in this MBR system.<br />
1- The 39.19 MB (FAT) partition, as far as I understand is essential for this laptop so it can start up fast, and it needs to be a primary not logical partition to work.<br />
2- The 15.67 GB (NTFS) Recovery partition is needed to recover the laptop, it needs to be primary, and it's essential as the laptop doesn't have a DVD disk drive for recovery.<br />
3- The 214.76 GB (NTFS) OS partition is where windows is installed, and this needs to be a primary partition also as I read that making it logical can cause many issues.<br />
4- The 8.01 GB (Other) partition is as far as I understand is needed for hibernation, and also this needs to be a primary partition to work properly.<br />
<br />
Basically, I need to create a D drive as my software programs are set to find files in a D drive, but it seems the system being MBR it's limited to a maximum of 4 primary partitions.<br />
<br />
I have tried to split the C drive (to create a 70 GB D Drive) but then a logical partition is created, and although I can get the 70 GB as unallocated space I can not complete the creation of the D drive!<br />
<br />
As far as I understand many people are faced with this same issue, specially Dell &amp; HP laptop users where there only is one slot for hard disk, and where all partitions are preconfigured as primary.<br />
<br />
So I already called Dell &amp; Microsoft for a solution, Dell said I should call Microsoft, and Microsoft said it's an OEM situation and that I should call Dell, then Microsoft said I should otherwise post my issue here @ answers.microsoft.com.<br />
<br />
Can anyone come up with a solution ?<br />
- I really don't want to reinstall all the software again (it took me 3 days) in case the solution would mean resetting the PC and creating a D drive during the installation (again I wonder how that would be possible as again there would be 5 primary partitions
 needed).<br />
- I tried 3rd party software like EaseUS Partition Master &amp; MiniTool Partition Wizard but so far these also could not create a D drive.<br />
<br />
Please help me.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your comment John, but this thread was not helpful for me at all.<br />
It just says that if you have a GPT setup you can have many partitions, with MBR (which is the case 99% of the time) only 4 are available and even special 3rd party partition software (which we are unnecessarily installing with hopes) can not create a D drive
 as far as I understand.<br />
<br />
My issue (and tens of thousands of others) is that specially with smaller laptops with only one physical hard disk (and in many cases these laptops don't have DVD drives for recovery disks), all 4 primary partition slots already have been taken once windows
 10 is installed, and it's therefore not possible to create a D drive unless you "give up" on functionalities like hibernation, system recovery, &amp; fast startup. The 4th primary partition is of course the C drive where the system is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we urgently need a solution!</p>

<p>Your first partition is EFI boot the 2nd is Recovey and you must keep them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You create new partitions on your C drive. The 8.01 GB is not allocated and can be merged with the C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Format the 8.01 GB to NTFS use merge it with C</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use create new partition type in the size you want</p>
<p>It will show as unallocated &nbsp;Format To NTFS</p>
<p>Select change drive label and give it a name IE Back_UP</p>
<p>Select change drive letter and select D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this by Clicking on the partitions concerned right or use the menu. You use * for the first 2 C Remain's Create D and change your to E if you have one and the rest will default to F G USB"S and EHD.</p>

            <p>Hi OctavianQR thanks alot for your input!<br />
</p>
<p>You <strong>seem</strong> to have a simple solution <strong>but</strong>..<br />
</p>
<p>1) I didn't quite understand what you say except for the last part where you say "change your to E if you have one and the rest will default to F G USB"S and EHD."
<br />
<br />
If I create a D from the 8.01GB partition, when I place a USB drive in the laptop I assume that will become E and F if I place 2 USB drives into the laptop. By the way what is EHD (extended hard disk?) and what do you mean by it ?<br />
<br />
2) On a forum I bumped into <strong>this info below</strong> concerning the 8.01GB partition, so it may be tricky to merge this space with C ?<br />
<br />
<strong>**</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The 39.19MB partition and 8.01 GB partitions are used for the Intel Smart Response, Rapid Start, and Smart Connect Technologies. Dell has a white paper describing how they work, but it does not explain the partitioning scheme.
</strong><br />
<br />
Smart Response is not used in an SSD-only laptop, as it is only used when both an SSD and HDD are present (the SSD being used as cache for the HDD, making it like a hybrid drive).
<br />
<br />
Rapid Start is kind of an improved version of hibernation that the system can use to save power and resume quickly. Smart Connect is a technology that leverages Rapid Start to occasionally wake a sleeping/hibernating system to access the internet to check email,
 update social media, etc. <br />
<br />
<strong>If you don't want to use any of these features</strong>, these partitions can go away, but Rapid Start is nice to have as long as space isn't critical.
<br />
<br />
The 15.67GB partition is Dell's factory recovery partition, if you have made restore media or ordered the free recovery media from Dell, it's not needed either.
<br />
<br />
So you COULD eliminate the 15.67GB partition and add it to C: to have more storage, and eventually the 8.01 GB partition
<strong>if you're willing to give up Rapid Start and Smart Connect</strong>. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
What is Intel® Smart Response Technology?<br />
Smart Response is a feature that uses both a traditional hard disk drive (HDD) and a small solid state drive (SSD) together. It dynamically monitors file, data, and application use, and stores frequently used content on a special partition on a small SSD device
 for faster access. It provides SSD-like read/write performance for the files used most frequently, while providing lower overall storage cost by sorting and storing less frequently accessed content on the larger-sized traditional HDD.<br />
<br />
What is Intel® Rapid Start Technology?<br />
Rapid Start is a feature that provides power savings similar to Windows® hibernate state, while improving resume time vs. hibernate by ~2x. Rapid Start may be combined with Smart Response on some systems to enhance overall system performance while also reducing
 power consumption when not in use.<br />
<br />
What is Intel® Smart Connect Technology?<br />
Smart Connect is feature that periodically wakes the system from the Windows® sleep state to refresh email or social networking applications. When the system is equipped with specific wireless devices, it can detect the presence of known networks while asleep,
 waking only when connectivity is available. When properly equipped with specific wireless devices, Smart Connect can also provide quick internet connection readiness, by keeping wireless devices active in a low-power mode during sleep. Smart Connect may be
 combined with Rapid Start on some systems to help reduce power consumption while still keeping email and other application data current.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Disabling<br />
Warning about deleting the Smart Response partition (!), or removing the Smart Response SSD cache device: Manually deleting/erasing the Smart Response partition is strongly discouraged. Depending on the state of the system, and what files have been cached to
 the SSD during use, deleting the Smart Response partition could result in permanent data loss. Should the need to disable Smart Response arise, the safest way to defeat the feature is from within the Rapid Storage Manager application.<br />
<br />
Disabling Smart Response within the Rapid Storage application: This is the preferred method of disabling Smart Response. Doing this will allow the cache to be properly flushed back to the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Removing the mSATA/SSD or HDD:<br />
Before removing the HDD or cache from the system, the Smart Response feature should be disabled in the Rapid Storage Manager application by clicking the “Disable acceleration” link either on the main status page, or under the Acceleration menu.<br />
<br />
Repairing Inaccessible Cache:<br />
If the HDD or mSATA/SSD cache device are replaced without disabling Smart Response first (due to a HDD repair process, or upgrades), the status of the cache may appear as “Inaccessible”:<br />

            <p>Thanks John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I could, and I have tried a few times...</p>
<p>The problem is that the guarantee period has expired and I can not get help on this matter just like many many other users of such compact minimal laptops (Dell / HP / etc) with OEM setup. They say I need to contact Microsoft. Miscrosoft says I need to contact
 Oem. There just is one slot for SSD and there is no DVD drive for recovery disks, and it seems all the partitions have a needed function (as described above) with which the laptop will not function efficiently.<br />
<br />
I'm really hoping someone here can help us out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Did you make any changes to your computer recently for this issue to occur?</div>
<div><br />
b) Do you have security program installed on your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to Disable automatic restart on system failure on your computer and note the error message you are receiving in the event viewer and you need to post back to us.</div>
<div>In order to do that you need to follow the below steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Right click Computer&gt;&gt;properties&gt;&gt;Advanced System Settings&gt;&gt;Advanced Tab&gt;&gt;Startup and Recovery Settings&gt;&gt; Uncheck Automatically restart.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Use the Event Viewer to look for information about the issue.<br />
<div>Here's an article on how to do that:</div>

<p>Hello meligira,</p>
<p>After the upgrade have you updated all of your drivers for the chipset, video card, Network adapter etc?</p>
<p>If you will post the entire event id and all of the details, we can try and determine what is causing the problem that is causing the computer to shutdown.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Since you are having problems just to get Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to run, you might want to run SFC /scannow to see if there is any problem with your system files.&nbsp; KB 929833 - How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted
 system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</p>
<p>The upgrade advisor may not work if there is a conflict with the third party program or service. I would suggest that you try to run the Windows vista upgrade advisor after disabling the third party program or services by following clean boot procedure<br />
&nbsp;Perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135<br />
Reset the computer to start as usual<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;Refer the below link to download the Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor.<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx<br />
&nbsp;Refer the below link to download the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx<br />
&nbsp;Note if you trying to upgrade to Windows 7 you cannot upgrade to Windows 7 from Windows XP you will only be able to do a custom installation of Windows 7.<br />
&nbsp;For more information refer the below link.<br />
Upgrading from Windows&nbsp;XP to Windows&nbsp;7<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7<br />
&nbsp;On your question if your computer can run 64 bit of Windows vista or windows 7 or not, the quickest way to find out would be to contact your PC manufacturer.&nbsp;
<br />
You cannot upgrade from 32bit operating systems to a 64 operating systems. You will have to do a custom install after which you will have to reinstall all the programs and application on the computer.<br />

                    <p>Hi All.....I have a laptop running Windows 8.1 that has become unstable to the point of ridiculousness....I cant use any type of internet connection without getting a popup which says that my pc "is infected and is being hacked remotely and sending credit
 card details and facebook login" blah blah blah.....additionally I am having AutoCAD and 12d Model crashing every 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I back up my data to an external HDD and format my C: drive....how do I reinstall Windows without having a disc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help ;-)</p>

<h2>            Shrink a DVD</h2>
                    I have a movie that is 10gb - I have a dual disk that holds 8,5 gb How can I shrink the movie to fit on the disk? I did it in the past using Softarc Showbiz - I recall there was a button to&nbsp;click for "Fit File to Disk," but it's been a&nbsp; few years since
 I did it and now I don't remember how. I've been searching for software to do it but can't find any. One article implied Windows DVD Maker could do it.

</p><p>With the way Microsoft is distancing itself from DVD Movie functions, I would doubt that any Windows process would do what you need...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A internet search would probably come up with some free programs that could do that... Nero Recode is a paid example...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a free program called DVD Shrink that is very similar to older Nero Recode versions.. I just checked, and there are still download links available...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This program may be 10 years old, in case you want to look for something else..</p>
        </p>

            As far as I know, there is no such bug. It might be a problem with name of you folder(s) if you use non-latin symbols in it. Also, it might be you anti-virus software if you use one. If you are using 32bit Windows, I would recommend you to check application
 called <a href="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Unlocker</a> . It will show what is using that file/folder and will allow to unlock it.

You have to make the right choice. As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible.

    <title>Crysis 2&#58; Retaliation DLC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephfromnc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Crysis 2&#58; Retaliation DLC</h2>
                    
<p>I have been logging some time with this map pack and cant get over, yet again how mazing these and the shipped maps are for this game. I hope more players decide to try this amazing game as it has all the hallmarks that make an online shooter good or at
 least preferrable as far as those to tend to migrate to the genre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a good&nbsp;mode either unlocked or included with the DLC that groups all the team based multiplayer modes into a shuffled playlist as well. One last thing, is does anyone know if the regular playlists (non-dlc specific) included these new maps or are
 they going to be "phased in" much like what happens in other titles?</p>

<p>I traded in my 360 copy because nobody plays it ( rarely trade in games). &nbsp;Even when people do play it, it's a laggy mess, or takes 6 minutes to connect to a match.</p>
<p>I think its a really good single player game, and has solid multiplayer....but nobody supports it.

<p>I also traded it in. I felt really betrayed by the multiplayer. I bought it expecting a new, interesting multiplayer that was innovative. Boy was I wrong. Activision should almost sue them for stealing their game. It's got perks, kill streaks, small and
 claustrophobic maps. Everything.</p>

<h2>            When will Microsoft Fix the 100&#37; disk usage error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had it up to here, and beyond.&nbsp; I have done everything on these pages.&nbsp; I no longer have skype, I no longer have my MacAfee and my Google is no longer allowed to prefetch, save any cookies or do anything to load anything faster.&nbsp; I have fiddled with
 regedit, and practically everything else.&nbsp; And then i Downloaded, because it said it could fix it, a Speedyfix program from a Microsoft Partner that I had to pay 6 bucks for 7 days free and then they will charge me 60 bucks if I don't cancel, and it is stalled,
 and I have trouble getting to the info on how to cancel because NOTHING IS WORKING.&nbsp; I spend all my time waiting for things to load.&nbsp; I use to do that when I had a 300 baud modem that hooked to my phone receiver!&nbsp; It should not be happening.&nbsp; I have been unable
 to download any window updates, Error 0x80070017 and Error 0x80070570 and Error 0x80070643.&nbsp; All I get is error and slowdowns and I shouldn't have to work this hard to make my computer work.&nbsp; I got this Toshiba to get things done.&nbsp; It came preloaded with windows
 10 and if there were a way to go back to windows 7 I would do it in a MINUTE.&nbsp; This is not on me.&nbsp; It has been almost six months now of fixes that last for two to three days, or don't work at all.&nbsp; FIX IT.&nbsp; And put it in an update that even under these lousy
 condition that YOU leave me in with this version of windows, I can download it.&nbsp; FIX IT!&nbsp; I have done EVERY suggestion on this and every other forum imaginable and it's not me, it's Windows 10.&nbsp; FIX IT!</p>

<p>Also, You should run disk check first and restart PC. This will take awhile to do but will fix bad sectors and file system errors on your hard drive, just in case this is what started this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open This PC</p>
<p>right click on C:\</p>
<p>select properties in menu</p>
<p>click on Tools Tab</p>
<p>select check in error checking</p>
<p>if it prompts you to choose to fix all errors select it</p>
<p>restart PC and the process will begin</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can also run system file checker. But it has never did anything useful as far as I ever experienced.</p>

<p>Just update your system to the newest version 1709 and update that version with January 3, 2018 Cumulative—KB4056892 (OS Build 16299.192) update as I mentioned earlier. I believe this will most likely fix your issue, unless your hard drive is bad. Good Luck</p>

<p>I have tried, and I have tried and I have tried, and finally, I had to take a break.&nbsp; This is affecting my health.&nbsp; I closed my new windows 10 computer that is nothing more then a large useless coaster, and I went back to my windows 7 ancient system that
 has a giant splat on the dying screen, but IT WORKS.&nbsp; It's been over a week now.&nbsp; I'm opening up the giant coaster.&nbsp; I've reprinted out all the steps AGAIN as I shredded the last batch rather then kick my windows ten coaster, and I'm going to try again to
 upgrade to the new version 1709 and apply the cumlative patch.&nbsp; BECAUSE I NEED WHAT IS ON THAT SYSTEM TO WORK, what's LEFT that is since I've taken so much stuff off to try to make it not conflict with anything.&nbsp; I'll let you know how it goes, but the question
 is, if AGAIN it will not in any way shape or form do the update, does Windows give a refund to me for mucking up my computer with their software?&nbsp; Will they replace my system with a New Computer with windows 7 on it (because there is no way in hell I'm going
 to try windows 10 again)&nbsp; Will it give me a refund on all I spent on that computer only to have windows 10 kill it??&nbsp; Does Microsoft cover emotional distress?&nbsp; Because I have been experiencing it.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The only way to fix the issue is by doing a clean install which would wipe out all files on your system. For you to have the latest Windows 10 version 1709, please download the recovery media using media creation

<h2>            Destination Folder and File Access Denied&#63;</h2>
                    I tried to organize my Downloads folder, but a message popped up stating that access was denied and that I needed permission. It appears every time I try to create, delete, and rename a file or folder. This only occurs in the Downloads folder, all other
 folders allow me make changes. I've been able to make changes in the past, so this is the first time this has occurred. I've searched and attempted solutions online, but none seemed to fix the problem. I am the administrator of this computer. How can I regain
 access to my Downloads folder?

            <p>Hi Brendon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissions are rules associated with objects on a computer or network, such as files and folders. Permissions determine whether you can access an object and what you can do with it. For example, you might have access to a document on a shared folder on
 a network. And even though you can read the document, you might not have permissions to make changes to it. System administrators and people with administrator accounts on computers can assign permissions to individual users or groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check the permissions of&nbsp;the download&nbsp;folder:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Right-click the file or folder, and then click <span>Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>b. </span>Click the <span>Security</span> tab.</p>
<p>c. Click a user name or group under <span>Group or user names</span>.The permissions for the selected user or group are shown in the lower portion of the properties dialog box. If the permissions are dimmed, it means the permissions are inherited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp; may try to take the ownership of the Download folder and check if that helps.</p>

<div>I appreciate your assistance. Unfortunately, this does not resolve my issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When attempting to take ownership, no Edit option appears in the Advanced settings. I don't think this matters though, as it already states that I am the owner.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have all permissions except special permissions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The file is not encrypted. In fact, the option is grayed and I am unable to make that change.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it turns out that the file or account is corrupt, what should I do? I've read the Corrupted files FAQ and it states that there is software online that can possibly fix the file. I've found no software that seems reliable.</div>

<p>This seems to be baloney. &nbsp;The things to click on do not exist and I can't find sufficiently similar ones to use. &nbsp;My problem is that from time to time I can't access "My Pictures" for example. &nbsp;I spent 2 hours with a MS person and signed up for paid support,
 then he went through the whole thin, but I still have a problem. &nbsp;Please give me a way to own my computer. &nbsp;I do not have that althoug the help desk person set me up as administrator. &nbsp;HELP!</p>

    <title>Recovering Skype video calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewgneale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering Skype video calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a music journalist who occasionally conducts interviews via Skype. It's been so long since I've done one with Skype, I forgot last time I had to use third party Skype call recorder software. I've now finished an interview and I don't think it's recorded!
 Is there any way I can recover the video call?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Apologize nicely and setup another interface and make sure you setup your recording properly, test it out with a friend or your cat or dog to make sure it records. :)

            Feared that might be the answer! But thanks for the replies. Do you recommend any good (preferably free) recording software?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 games whether they are on Microsoft's PC game pass App or Play Anywhere titles, use the standard Windows Universal Platform for installation.&nbsp; This places all downloads (apps and games) into a hidden Windows folder called '<strong>WindowsApps</strong>'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your game or app is installed on C:\ drive, the <strong>WindowsApps </strong>
hidden folder will be located within the <strong>'Program Files'&nbsp;</strong>folder.&nbsp; On other drives the folder will be located in the root location of the drive e.g.
<strong>D:\WindowsApps</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've un-hidden the folders and found the WindowsApps folder, you'll next need to take ownership of said folder.&nbsp; To do this, follow instructions on
<a href="https://www.intowindows.com/how-to-access-windowsapps-folder-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this website</a> from intowindows.com (not a Microsoft owned website).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not require you download or install anything, just follow the instructions in the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps</p>
<p>

            Hi there&nbsp;SpideryWand1101,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mess around with any files relating to microsoft store and xbox beta app all the games installed are designed to not be tampered with or manipulated, its best that such data is not touched at all. if your looking for a specific file or information
 on the file I would search for those separately without touching that folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />
Alec&nbsp;

<p>The folder needs to be owned by a specific user for installs to work sometimes. Backing up the folder won't necessarily retain permissions (backing up is still a good idea for the content though).</p>

            I would agree with this.&nbsp; Many years ago Curse took over the folders for World of Warcraft for interface mods.&nbsp; The game was then not able to update.&nbsp; Always be careful messing with Registry's or hidden files on windows systems.

<p>You can of course change the permissions back:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open File Explorer.</p>
<div>Browse to the system file you previously changed ownership.</div>
<div>Right-click the file, and select <strong>Properties.</strong></div>
<div>Click on the <strong>Security tab.</strong></div>
<div>Click the <strong>Advanced button.</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>On the "Advanced Security Settings" page, click the <strong>Change link</strong> on Owner.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the "Select User or Group" page, type the following to add the TrustedInstaller account and click Check Names:</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>NT Service\TrustedInstaller</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click <strong>OK</strong> again to complete the task.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>These steps now restored the ownership of the file to the built-in TrustedInstaller.</p>
<div>Also, don't forget to check the "Replace owner on the sub-containers and objects" and "Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object" options, if you previously changed these settings on system folders.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, if you granted yourself full control to the system file, you may also want to remove these settings as well, and to do that you can use the following steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right-click the system file, and select Properties.</div>
<div>Click on the <strong>Security tab.</strong></div>
<div>Click the <strong>Advanced button</strong>.</div>
<div>On the "Advanced Security Settings" page <strong>select your account.</strong></div>
<div>Click Remove.</div>

<h2>            XP&#58; Windows Explorer generating Data Execution Prevention error when copying files</h2>
                    
<p>Recently, my XP SP3 began generating this error:</p>
<p>Data Execution Prevention - Microsoft Windows<br />
To Help Protect your computer, windows has closed this program.</p>
<p>Name: Windows Explorer<br />
Publisher : Microsoft Corporation<br />
EventType : BEX<br />
P1 : explorer.exe<br />
P2 : 6.0.2900.5512<br />
P3 : 48025c30<br />
P4 : unknown<br />

P7 : 04c49290<br />
P8 : c0000005<br />
P9 : 00000008</p>
<p>Explorer closes and is restarted.&nbsp; Sometimes, DrWatson itself will crash during the error reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens only intermittently, when I copy/move files.&nbsp; It may be limited to copying/moving multiple files; as few as 2 will set it off.&nbsp; It does not happen with every copy/move, however.</p>
<p>I do not want to disable DEP protection.&nbsp; I want to correct the underlying problem.</p>

<p>Me too!!!</p>
<p>I just upgraded to XP SP3. My box was virus free and running fine before the upgrade. Now after the upgrade many times after I boot up (or within 30 mins thereafter) I get a popup "Data Execution Prevention". It says Windows Explorer. Close the message then
 shortly after the desktop crashes. BTW, I have XP Home Edition.</p>
<p>I have had people suggest to configure DEP to ignore the error (ie add an exception in DEP config box) but I am hesitant to start adding exceptions in DEP becase doesnt that leave those programs unprotected? I'd rather fix the ROOT CAUSE. Does anyone have
 any inisght into what would be causing this to suddenly happen on SP3 but not before when I was on SP2? I'd like to identify and fix root cause.</p>
Whats is causing this and what is the fix? Many thanks!!

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Let me translate those kinds of suggestions for you:</p>
<p><em>I have no idea what the problem is, I don't know how to figure it out and I don't know how to fix it.</em></p>
<p>You are on the right track to find the root of the problem instead of just hiding it.</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot,&nbsp;AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<div>You should next run some good scans for malicious software and try to make sure that is not the problem:</div>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></p>
<p>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</p>
<p>After running the scans, be sure to reboot and then test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data Execution Prevention (DEP) messages mean that Windows feels threatened by some program running on your computer, so it shuts it down.&nbsp; This is actually a good thing since Windows recognizes the threat and is trying to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>You could tell Windows that the program is okay by making an exception for the program, but this is generally not a good idea.&nbsp; You could also just disable the DEP protection entirely to suppress the error, but that is also not a good idea either - DEP is
 there for a purpose.&nbsp; You will not fixed the underlying problem and have made your computer vulnerable to attack by disabling the protection or choosing to ignore the threat.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If it is Windows Explorer that is reporting the Data Execution Protection error, suspect a non Microsoft Explorer Shell Extension. Shell Extensions help make up the Right Click menu for files you see in Explorer. &nbsp;(Internet Explorer DEP errors are dealt with
 a little differently).<br />
<br />
You can download ShellExView from here to see which ones you have loaded:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
When you launch it, the non MS extensions will be in light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move the Microsoft column closer to the top so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and
 right.<br />
<br />
Sort the display by clicking the Microsoft column so all the "No"s are at the top and easy to see.<br />
The "No"s in the list would be things you have added (non Microsoft).<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this unless I know all your extensions...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those. The Extensions are not uninstalled, just disabled.<br />
<br />
You can also disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the condition.</p>
<p>Always put a reboot in yor test cycle to be sure you have isolated the&nbsp;suspicious&nbsp;Extension. &nbsp;You may have more than one.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one Extension that causes the error and then you can figure out what to do about it - usually get an update from the maker of the extension from their WWW page. &nbsp;Example: &nbsp;if it is an Adobe or PowerDesk extension, you probably
 need an update to their products.<br />
<br />
When you disable/enable the extensions, the Extension is immediately disabled/enabled, so disabling one does not actually require a reboot but if you think you have the right one, I would reboot anyway to really be sure your changes "stick".<br />
<br />
When you find the extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so i can add it to my&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be some clues in the Event Log.</p>
<p>Here is a method to post the specific information about individual events.</p>
<p>To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.</p>
<p>A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc /s</p>
<p>Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some logs such as Security and Internet Explorer may be completely empty or have only a few items. &nbsp;The default&nbsp;settings for XP is not to log all that activity unless you need to troubleshoot some issue in those areas. &nbsp;If&nbsp;you enable the logging for them
 the logs fill up quickly and could negatively effect your system performance with&nbsp;all the extra (usually unnecessary) activity.</p>
<p>If you have Microsoft Office installed, it has its own logs and they may be empty or occasional boring activity&nbsp;or very little activity if there is no problem with your Office applications. &nbsp;This is normal.</p>
<p>Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.</p>
<p>No event should defy reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>Each event is sorted by Date and Time. &nbsp;Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Information messages have white is. &nbsp;Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting. &nbsp;Try to find just the events at the date&nbsp;and time around your problem.</p>
<p>If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information. &nbsp;On the right are&nbsp;black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the
 event details to your Windows clipboard.</p>
<p>When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button&nbsp;under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste&nbsp;or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.
 &nbsp;Remove any personal information from your information&nbsp;after pasting if you are compelled to do so.</p>
<p>If you paste an Event, it will look something like this boring system startup event:</p>
<p>Event Type:<span> </span>Information</p>
<p>Event Source:<span> </span>Service Control Manager</p>
<p>Event Category:<span> </span>None</p>
<p>Event ID:<span> </span>7035</p>
<p>Date:<span> </span>7/14/2010</p>
<p>Time:<span> </span>5:54:18 PM</p>
<p>User:<span> </span>Jose</p>
<p>Computer:<span> </span>Computer</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The Remote Access Connection Manager service was successfully sent a start control.</p>
<p>For more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.</p>
<p>To get a fresh start on any Event Viewer log, you can choose to clear the log (backing up the log is offered),&nbsp;then reproduce your issue, then look at just the events around the time of your issue and troubleshoot the&nbsp;events that are happening when you have
 your issue.</p>
