<p>Hi Meghan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message you received has something to do with the usage rights of the game. For us to isolate the main issue, we would like to know if you're using the correct account who purchased the Dragon Mania Legends game?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you follow the steps below which will help us in resolving your concern:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Run the troubleshooter for Windows Apps.</strong></p>
<p>Run the troubleshooter for Windows Apps on your computer by clicking the&nbsp;Run troubleshooter&nbsp;button on this&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
 This process will check and resolve common issues with the apps on your PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Re-register the Store. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The error might also be due to a miscommunication with the servers, and re-registering the Store may solve the issue if this is the case. Make sure that you don’t make a typo when you’re entering the command below, as you might make more problems than you’ll
 solve.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>key on your keyboard and type in <strong>cmd</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> result, and choose <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. OR.</li><li>Press simultaneously the <strong>Windows </strong>and <strong>X </strong>keys on your keyboard.</li><li>From the menu that opens, choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Once the Command Prompt opens, type in the following command, and press Enter to execute it.<br />
<strong>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command “&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + ‘\AppxManifest.xml’ ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}”.</strong></li><li>Once the command is executed, close the Command Prompt and try updating/downloading your apps again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Disable proxy.</strong></p>
<p><br />
If you’re using a proxy connection, this might be causing issues that don’t allow the store to download the apps you need. All you need to do is follow the steps below to disable the proxy.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press simultaneously <strong>Windows </strong>and <strong>R </strong>on your keyboard. In the
<strong>Run </strong>window that opens, type in inetcpl.cpl and press <strong>Enter</strong> or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to the Connections tab, and click on <strong>LAN settings</strong> near the bottom.</li><li>Find <strong>Proxy server</strong>, and make sure that <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN
</strong>is unchecked.</li><li>Press <strong>OK </strong>twice to close the windows and save the settings. This should solve your issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done. make sure that you restart your device and check if the issue happens again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after performing the aforementioned solutions. We'd be glad to further assist you.<br />

<p>I have the same issue as described in the second line above, but a different error number: 0x80131509.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased Age of Empires: Definitive Edition on Windows Store (windows 10) and it installed successfully. The game boots up, and asks me to sign in with xbox. Clicking sign in doesn't do anything. I open the xbox app to sign in there, but only see the
 error code and "sign in" button which doesn't do anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As described here, it seems like it's not connecting to the store. This is weird because in the Services window, all the ones with "xbox" in the name have status of "running" and the Windows Store seems to work fine. I can use other apps that don't require
 xbox just fine too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(On the web, I connected my xbox account to my microsoft account so I'm able to sign into the website at least, just not the app.)</p>

<p>We were able to check this issue on our end and it seems that there's an Xbox Live service alert regarding buying items, redeeming codes, or downloading/ launching purchases. You don't need to worry, our technicians are now working around the clock to have
 this fix so you can go back to your gaming and install your game without any issues. You may check this

<strong>link</strong></a> for your reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your kind understanding. Feel free to post back should you need further assistance.

            <p>Hey there ThepumaLeo.<br /><br />Have you changed your home console three times in the past 365 days? There's a max number of changes you can make to your home Xbox One, which may explain why you're receiving this error.<br /><br />Let us know when you get a chance, that way we can get you down the right path for support.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>external hard drive access denied in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            external hard drive access denied in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I need help please... <br />
i have a hard drive from my old laptop that still has files, pictures, music ect.... recently i tried to access this hard drive from my current laptop that is running windows 10 and i got the error message "the parameter is incorrect - access denied" but i
 was able to access it no problem before upgrading to windows 10 and a couple of times after, after searching online i found this link<br />
<br />
http://www.windowscentral.com/how-take-ownership-files-and-folders-windows-10<br />
<br />
well i was stupid enough to follow the directions and figured that i needed to change permissions and ownership to view my files... anyway as i was able to change the ownership to the drive and all of the subfolders (which i now can view the folders and files)
 the problem i now face, is that when i open some folders they are empty when i know they should not be, and all of the files i would like to access are under a user profile that is not showing up when i open the "users" folder. so i have to clue where all
 my pictures and documents have gone or why i am unable to see all my stuff. what i would like to know is if anyone can tell me how to change back the ownership or if that will even bring my files back or if by changing the ownership i have lost all my pictures
 for good? is there anything i can do to find my files? i appreciate any advice or suggestions, and ask anyone with knowledge about the issue to please share with me or help me to understand what i can do from here or what my options now are.<br />
thank you</p>

            <p>before i changed ownership of the drive it did show up in file explorer as drive: F but i could not open the drive. prior to changing ownership i did not look in disk management to see if the drive was showing up, although since changing ownership i can
 see the drive in disk management as Drive: F and also can see folders in file explorer but none of those folders contain the pictures or documents i would like to view. i did not try to change the drive letter of the old drive because it had the letter F so
 i didnt think it would make a difference. basically what i did in this order</p>
<p>1. change permissions to get access to the drive using this user account on my new laptop. (still no access)</p>
<p>2. changed ownership of the drive to my current account on this laptop. (was able to open drive now)</p>
<p>3. open the drive and see 7 folders one was AVG, another was a mixture of letters and numbers (i believe it was a program folder) then there was Downloads,&nbsp; program files, program data, users, and windows. downloads is empty, but all the other folders have
 multiple folders and files. when i open the users folder it has 4 folders default, digital boy, public and guest... digital boy was the original username or computer name when i got the old laptop from a friend, but i did end up using the recovery disks and
 recover the drive and started from scratch, which i did not use digital boy for anything, and named it sexy kitty instead, anyway the digital boy folder is the only one that is not empty, it has all the regular folders any user would have like pictures, documents,
 music, videos, app data, links, favorites... however pictures, music, videos, and documents are all empty. so really i guess i just dont understand where all those files, pictures, and everything else went... is it possible that by changing ownership of the
 drive on this laptop somehow erase these things, or are they still on the drive and i just do not have access to them still?
</p>
<p>thank you for your response by the way.</p>

<h3> lukaswolfe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Was I just scammed by a fake Microsoft&#63; please help.</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to re-install Windows 7 due to adding a new motherboard and CPU to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few days, I got the little window popping saying that the Key I provided could not be registered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I phoned the number provided (1800 642 008) and after two attempts was told that I had registered this copy more times than was allowed in the license.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">This part is probably true, because despite only ever using this copy on the one machine - I had been unable to uninstall the old versions before reinstalling.. maybe 3 times I have re-installed this copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was transferred to a tech support department somewhere in Malaysia judging by the accent of the representative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The agent then used LogMeIn to control my computer. I was a little concerned at this point. From what I could see he basically applied some windows updates, then was able to enter the confirmation key and activate Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then asked to restart the computer, and was a little surprised to find LogMeIn still running when it restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He checked that everything was good (and it was) and then closed the connection. He took my full name and made me type my email address into the LogMeIn chat window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then, to arouse my suspicion even more he offered that I could pay for two extra levels of premium support - something like $80 and $120. This was apparently because the version of Windows I am operating was purchased in 2010, and default support had
 expired... makes sense but it didn't seem right that Microsoft would be asking me for more money... I politely refused saying the only issue I had was with activation. He was ok with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He said that there were some updates that were not installed, and that was preventing my Windows 7 from activating properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The guy was very friendly, and in no way to he act in an unprofessional manner, but I have never had to have anyone remotely access my computer just for activation... so I am a little paranoid.... is this legitimate? am I being overly suspicious?</p>
<p>
</p><p>He then followed up with an email survey that I could respond to (Thunderbird warned me the email may be a scam).. naturally I hovered over the links in the email and found they were not going directly to Microsoft, but were prefixed with another location,

<p>LogMein is installed so it persists after a reboot - they should have uninstalled it when they finished the job.
</p>
<p>If not, then check your Installed Programs listing - if it's not there, see if you can find the entry in MSConfig and track it back from there. (Probably in the C:\Program Files\LogMein folder)</p>

<h2>            BSOD 0x1e and more</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having alot of troubles with BSOD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Link to the most recent blue screens dump files:&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0LZz4z-8SPeNmZmQ1pwQkFRXzQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0LZz4z-8SPeNmZmQ1pwQkFRXzQ/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of them were caused by Rt64win7.sys. As I could figure out, this has s.th to do with realtek LAN or Audio driver. I've tried to update them or even completely disable them in the bios (still getting the bluescreen 0x1e just without the rt64win7.sys
 listet in bluescreenview).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the Bluescreens have different error codes. In bluescreenview nearly every time another .sys file is listed, so it is very confusing for me to find out what's wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a memtest (memtest86+) for several hours without any errors. My graphics card was just replaced by gtx980 from gtx580 (same bluescreen behavior before and after) I've got a Samung SSD 840 evo as main drive. My Mainboard is Asrock z68pro3, processor:
 intel i7 2600k.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried&nbsp;chkdsk /f /r and used the verifier.exe (added all .sys files, had no violations detected)</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
BlueScreenview does not always show the correct actual driver however it is very good<br />
at showing the other information in the minidump - especially the lower pane driver<br />
listing. In the lower pane click the column heading "Filename" then clich the column<br />
heading "Product Name" and the non-Microsoft drivers will mostly be in alphabetical<br />
order - scroll down past "Microsoft Corporation" in Product Name column to see if<br />
there are other non-Microsoft drivers listed. It will not show drivers that have been<br />
unloaded during the crash.<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Heat related<br />
does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible that something is too sensitive<br />
to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help<br />
of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the
<br />
System Maker's Support.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />
<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;- set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and<br />
chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>&nbsp;

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to
<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

 like a standart post, ignoring the main message at all (sry if I am wrong).</p>
<p>The only thing mentioned was the heat problem: I am all the time aware of my cpu and gpu temperatures which are in "usual idle mode" @35°C when playing games both below 60°C but the pc even crashes when completely unused. So I am pretty sure the cpu and
 gpu are not getting too hot. I'm not sure of other components (mostly mainboard). RAM was tested several hours (as mentioned in the main post) without errors. My case has 3 fans which are all working (big tower). I will try to figure out to get the temperature
 of other components.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you read from the top of my next to last post you will see the analysis of the minidump.<br />
The rest of those two replies are methods to troubleshoot the issue.<br />
<br />
Heat related does not always mean the temps are unusually high as often a component can<br />
be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat. So try to add more cooling to see if that
<br />
has an effect. <br />
<br />
<strong>Issue is most likely to be the processor, heat sink, or the compound between them.</strong><br />
<br />
Again this is from your minidump :<br />
<br />
BugCheck 124, {0, fffffa8010f36028, be000000, 800400}
<p>Probably caused by : GenuineIntel<br />
<br />
<strong>Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and</strong><br />
<strong>the heat sink which are common causes.</strong><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The 1E Bug_Check showed Windows components so that means something else drove the<br />
Fault. So yes they are almost 100% connected to the same event. It is not at all unusual for<br />
hardware issues to cause more than one type of Bug_Check, especially if any heat issue is<br />
involved.<br />

    <title>Cannot buy Xbox content from money in Microsoft account, or any FREE - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot buy Xbox content from money in Microsoft account, or any FREE xbox item without giving credit card info</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I use Windows 8.1, and&nbsp;have sufficient amount in my Microsoft account through gift cards. I am able to use this balance to buy apps from Microsoft store, including Xbox games. But I cannot buy any "extras" for these Xbox games, neither within in-app, nor
 from the "Xbox Games" app. Even when I try to buy the free extra content ($0.00), it keeps displaying me "You do not have a valid payment option", and forces me to add a credit card to my account. The same happens when I&nbsp;try to buy any avatar gear, free or
 paid, from the Xbox Avatar Marketplace.</p>
<p>All these services I'm talking is about US region, hence there is no region clash either. I did not try to make any purchase in Xbox Music or Video, as I do not intend to spend my balance on those. Is it that the Microsoft account balance cannot be used
 on Xbox Games or avatar content? Even if this is the case, I do not understand why am I being forced to add credit card to my account even for "free" content. I'm highly disappointed by Microsoft for using such strategy to get users add their credit card.
 Kindly provide me a solution to use my Microsoft balance, or atleast get free Xbox games content without adding my credit card.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Quick question for you,</p>
<p>When you're trying to purchase this free content, are you doing it from the Xbox.com web site, or your console?</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking is because, right now the xbox.com Marketplace doesn't allow purchases to be made for Xbox 360 content using currency. It's something that's been brought to Microsoft's attention, but I'm unclear if it was an oversight, or something
 done on purpose.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that it SHOULD work when you're attempting a purchase through the console itself.</p>

<p>I do not use a console. I tried purchasing things from Xbox.com website too (avatar gear, free &amp; paid both), and tried to purchase the "extra" game content from my Windows 8.1 Xbox Games app, as well as within the Xbox game itself. But it asks me for my
 credit card info in all scenarios.</p>
<p>If I get it correct, your question is about the "free" content only, right? In this case, even if the Xbox.com website is not able to utilize Microsoft account balance at this time, there is still no need to add my credit card info for the "free" content,
 as there is no transaction involved at all.</p>

<p>Actually, the ability to purchase anything for Xbox 360 using currency stored on your account is missing completely. Whether it's free, or charging. Even though the purchase doesn't cost you anything, it's set up in the system to 'charge' you for $0.00 so
 it's still affected by the inability to purchase anything using currency on the web site. =/</p>
<p>I'm not real sure about how purchasing the content via the app works, but I would assume that it talks to the web site to make it work, so the same rules would apply.</p>

<p>Same issue when I tried to download some DLC - I don't have a cc on file but I do have prepaid credit from a gift card. &nbsp;No option to use the credit, the site wanted a cc. &nbsp;I added a cc just to see if it worked and no joy - the site wanted to charge the
 DLC directly to the cc and skipped the prepaid credit. </p>
<p>Sorry for resurrecting a dead thread, but is this a glitch or what? &nbsp;Last time I did a transaction with xbox live was in 2011. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Updates - how to EFFECTIVELY disable them</h2>
                    <p>Hello, words can't express how frustrated I get with the compulsory Windows Updates. The main reason is I am one of those who lives on a budget and has limited data each month and it pains me that these updates actually contribute more towards my data usage
 than my own browsing of the internet and basic checking of emails. I have spent far too much money on excess usage charges and most of the time it is because of the updates rather than my intentionally going over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have talked with MS and they recommended the approach of going to "Services" and choosing to disable the following services: Windows Updates, Windows Search, Cryptographic Services, and Background Intelligent Transfer Service.&nbsp; That is all well and I good
 and I do this each time I turn on my computer, because even though I select "disable" and then "apply" and then "OK", it does not actually save my selections and these each revert back to "manual" the next time I turn on the computer!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this - is there a more convenient/permanent way to turn off the updates (and anything else that might turn itself on in the background without me knowing and consume my data)?&nbsp; I don't mind doing the above routine each time if it means I have
 more control over my data, but surely there has to be a better way! Please only answer if you can give an actual PROVEN SOLUTION. I would be very grateful if anyone knows how to overcome this and thanks very much for reading my post.</p>

            Here is my standard template. StopUpdates10 might help you.
<br />
<br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-windows-10-stopupdates10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-win...</a>

            Hi HumbleBears, the old methods no longer work, this method will permanently stop Windows 10 Updates:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find Windows Update Service
<br />
<br />If it is Started, double click it and stop that service
<br />
<br />CLose the services App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />sc delete wuauserv
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If you also have the Update Assistant installed on your system:
<br />
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!
<br />
<br />When finished and after a system restart, open the services app and make sure the Windows Update Service is now gone . . .       
        </p>

            You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.
<br />
<br />stop-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= disabled
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= disabled
<br />net stop dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />start-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= auto
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= auto
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= auto
<br />net start dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />Now you can simply right click on stop-updates.bat and select “Run as Administrator”

<p>Windows 10 <em>is</em> a series of updates. That's how it was designed so that's how it works. It's like a subscription to a magazine or the episodes in a season of television.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therein lies the reason why there is no completely effective method of preventing updates - that goes against the whole idea of Windows 10. It's the same reason why Microsoft makes every effort to ensure that users receive updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want continuous updates, you don't want Windows 10. There's nothing sinister about it. Microsoft isn't trying to 'force' something on you. You're only getting what was promised in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is clearly the wrong operating system for someone with limited internet access. And not just Windows 10, because more and more software is moving to the cloud and relying on the internet. Everything by Google works that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People without sufficient internet access, even entire areas of the world, are clearly going to suffer because of this tend, but that isn't Microsoft's problem, nor Google's nor Adobe's and on and on. You can't turn back the clock on technological innovation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than advise you how to break your computer to stop receiving updates - because that's what you have to do - I can tell you that mobile operating systems (Android and iOS) were built from the beginning for low bandwidth. Attach a Bluetooth keyboard
 and mouse to your phone or iPad, and a monitor, and you've got a serious low-bandwidth computing platform.</p>

<p>Well actually it IS MS problem because as you just mentioned there are still large areas of the world, even in the USA that suffer from a lack of internet service. MS will lose market share because of this issue, so it is in their interest to work to change
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One solution and it's still a viable one, is to offer a free CD/DVD of the latest updates and just charge bulk shipping for that disc plus $1.00 to produce the disc. I think many of us would be more than willing to pay that price so that our connections
 are not choked or held up for a day or more at a time, which is the case for me.&nbsp; I don't have a data cap in place but my 768/128k DSL connection literally takes 24 hours or so to download a cumulative feature update and even then I can't do anything else
 on my system during that time as it stalls everything due to upload of just 128k.</p>

            Your solution would have worked in the good old days. In fact, I've got some old Windows and Office service packs on CDs. But not today, because updates are cumulative - you get whatever you're missing. So part of the update process is checking your computer
 to see what updates it needs.

<p>Thanks very much to each of you for your contributions. I am grateful for the couple of ideas there which I may try, but am also thankful for those who posted to warn me that if I do try to sort of permanently remove the updates that it might "break" my
 computer, I will weigh up these options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a bit of feedback to MS (not that it will get looked at but I would like to put in my two cents) … I appreciate that yes we are in a day and age where we need to continuously keep software such as Windows updated and hence it becomes more akin to
 a subscription in one sense than a single outright purchase/installation that stops there. It is problematic for those who struggle to afford the costs of data usage associated with keeping such a service running. When you go and buy a computer nobody tells
 you about this! You spend close to $2000 but nowhere is there any mention that the operating system will require a bit of a data commitment to be able to keep using your computer. I feel it is unfair that people like me can get into this kind of situation
 because we simply didn't think to ask more questions when we bought a computer that came with a Windows OS. I think that we get told a lot about the machine itself, but no info is given on the product of Windows 10 that comes in-built into the machine and
 that it requires a data commitment. It should be like if you went to buy a certain software, the box or the webpage clearly tells you what specs, internet speed etc you might need to run the software effectively. Why isn't such info given about Windows 10
 when it comes in-built into the computers that people buy (which is the case most of the time)? I really think that it should be, because for those who aren't able to fork out for the data required to keep it updated, it almost renders their $2000 purchase
 useless if they are too worried about turning it on each time because they don't know what is going to happen in the background once it connects to the internet until it is too late and there is excess data usage and then charges to pay.&nbsp;</p>

            word of caution about shutting down update.&nbsp; windows will start shutting down programs and some hardware.&nbsp; I have a desktop system that's been off the net for a year or more and windows shut down audio (hardware) and video programs.&nbsp; It also shut down
 my wifi on my laptop to force a reboot to do a install of updates it did over a meter connection.&nbsp; Good Luck.

    <title>Xbox One DIGITAL games not launching. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One DIGITAL games not launching.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone! I am brand new to the Xbox community, and really excited to form part of it.</p>
<p>I'll go directly to my problem: Launching Xbox One Games. I recently downloaded a<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong> DIGITAL/VIRTUAL copy</strong></span> directly from the Xbox Live Store of
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Dead Rising 3</strong></span> onto my console. It took sometime to install, but as soon as it reached 80%, it mentioned that it 'Was ready to launch'. I immediately tried to launch it, but mentioned it was missing
 certain 'updates' and I guessed I had to wait until a 100% completition.</p>

<p>When 100% installation finally came! I tried to launch the game, and the DR3 image stayed static for about a minute, until I got kicked back to the Xbox Dashboard with the error message:<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong> 'PLEASE TRY AGAIN:
 For some reason, Dead Rising took too long to start (0x8027025a).'</strong></span>&nbsp;In panic, I proceeded to check the forums, error code and possible solutions, and tried the following with
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>no success</strong></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tried re-launching the game (5 attempts, no success) </li><li>Restarting the console normally </li><li>Restarting the console with the boot method (Holding down power button) </li><li>Tried switching Power Mode from Instant-On to Power Saving. </li></ul>
<p>As I mentioned before, none of this measures worked, and I was wondering if any of you knew of any other alternative solution rather than re-downloading the game, which has worked for any of you with the same issues. I am guessing Microsoft is as well working
 on a patch for this, but I'm unaware of any information about it.</p>

<p>If any of you had any info on this, it would be largely appreciated as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and help!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>you seem to have the DRAM problem or language issue with the game.</p>
<p>First of all i suggest to put your console in english location USA.</p>
<p>if this not resolve your issue try to clear the DRAM cache.</p>
<p>here the steps:</p>
<p>1- Go to dashboard mainmenu</p>
<p>2- Press start from your controller at the same time press the power button</p>
<p>3- Hold it for 10-15 seconds until your xbox reboot or shutdown </p>
<p>4- Once its done retry your game.</p>
<p>If this is not fixing your issue i suggest to uninstaill/install but usually reinstallation don't resolve that issue.</p>
<p>Let me know if it's working well and enjoy your game !</p>

<p>I've posted this one before too, if you still have issues with your digital content try turning off the power saving features on the xbox one during downloads:</p>
<p>I have been having extended issues with ALL of the digital downloads for full versions of games on the Xbox One. &nbsp;If you want a long read &nbsp;-
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4271/t/1645924.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../1645924.aspx</a></p>
<p>I am currently on my third xbox one, and with my last message from support that they were going to send me to hardware support again (aka - to send me another xbox). &nbsp;Recently I came across a post in the forums here and decided to try it out - so far after
 performing the setting updates I have yet to experience an issue with Forza 5, Lego Marvel SuperHeroes and CoD Ghosts. &nbsp;I am going to be re-downloading BF4 (which typically breaks sometime during episode two or three - so easy enough to test). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the settings that (so far appear to have resolved my issue) I have set now on my xbox one after deleting the games and then re-downloading:</p>
<p>Settings &gt; Network</p>
<p>***Verify that your Network Type is 'Wired' (you can go back to wireless and try again if everything works to see if it is your wireless that could be dropping in the middle of the connection and causing the issue)</p>
<p>***Verify that your NAT Type is OPEN!!!!! &nbsp;If it is not, then you have some work ahead of you - place the xbox one in your dmz on your modem and/or turn port forwarding on for the required ports</p>
<p>Settings &gt; Network &gt; Detailed network statistics</p>
<p>***Verify that the test results do not result in any packet loss and that your MTU is 1384 or higher!
</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../network-settings</a></p>
<p>Now, change the following settings:</p>
<p>Settings&gt; Kinect</p>
<p>***I turned it off, everything about it - unplug it if you want (not sure if this actually helped or not, but it made me feel better)</p>
<p>Settings&gt;Preferences</p>
<p>**Show Skype notification: False</p>
<p>**Show messaging notifications: True</p>
<p>**Show party notifications: True</p>
<p>**Show all other notifications: True</p>
<p>**Allow Play to Streaming: FALSE</p>
<p>**Record gameplay with Game DVR: FALSE</p>
<p>**Preferred video provider: None</p>
<p>**SmartGlass Connections: From any SmartGlass device</p>
<p>Settings&gt;Power &amp; Startup</p>
<p>**Turn off after: DON'T TURN OFF AUTOMATICALLY</p>
<p>**Power mode: ENERGY-SAVING</p>
<p>Just for good luck, power off the xbox one by holding the pressing in on the power for 15 seconds (supposedly to clear the cache)</p>
<p>Once you power it back on, download the game again. &nbsp;Wait for the game to be fully installed before trying to play!</p>
<p>Just a reminder, you will now have to power the xbox one off in order to turn it off. &nbsp;So if you leave it on and run to the store, it will continue to run. &nbsp;It will also continue to run the entire time for the larger downloads for games. &nbsp;So, just turn your
 monitor/tv off and let it run and check ever now and again to see if the game has finished downloading.</p>
<p>Please respond and let the community know if this resolves the issue!</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player 11 album art disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> humbledore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 album art disappeared</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, this is quite a mystery but suddenly and without any obvious reason, about half of my albums don't show any album arts regardless what view I'm using. However, when I browse the corresponding folders in Windows explorer I can see that the images (Folder.jpg,
 AlbumArtSmall.jpg and so on)&nbsp;still are there. And even if I paste a new image into the album inside WMP&nbsp;no album art shows up.</p>
<p>Thanks for any&nbsp;help!</p>

<p>I suggest that you try resetting the media library. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:</p>
- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, rename the&nbsp; <strong>Media Player</strong> folder to something like&nbsp;<strong>Media Player old</strong> . If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt. Check if the issue still occurs.

            <p>The fact that it runs on your copy of Windows 10 means that it runs on some machines, but not on others. I have a Windows 10 machine where Chrome also runs OK, but then I have a newer one where it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A panel is any rectangular area meant to be filled with content. Like a window within a window.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. If you are running Chrome and are signed in, your name appear on the far right of the title bar. Click on it. A panel opens that shows your avatar and a couple of links you can click on. Well, on my machine that 'panel' is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likewise, the big main 'panel', where you have your Web content, you know, the one below the address bar and all the way down to the status bar, is also blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is different between my Windows 10 and Chrome and yours? I suspect three things: my Windows 10 is a 64-bit Enterprise edition and is the newest build, yours is possibly 32-bit and a bit older. My Chrome is 64-bit, your might be 32-bit. My video card
 supports hardware acceleration (NVidia), you might have an on-board video card that does not.</p>

<p>My copy of Windows 10 is the Pro version, but that makes no difference.</p>
<p>My copy of Windows 10 is the 64-bit version and it's the newest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in the Insiders program and Chrome has been my default browser on every build of Windows starting with the early builds (8xxx) and continuing to the most recent build (14367.) Never a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My video card supports hardware acceleration.</p>

<h2>            Formating CD&#39;s and DVD&#39;s in Windows 7 for data storage not music and videos.</h2>
                    <p><strong><span>Format a CD or DVD</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Before you can burn files to a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray Disc, the disc must first be prepared using a process called formatting. There are several ways to format a disc. Your choice of format determines which computers and other devices will be able to
 read the disc.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Insert a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recordable or rewritable disc into your computer's CD, DVD, or Blu-ray &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disc burner.</span></li><li><span>In the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AutoPlay dialog box that appears, click Burn files to disc using Windows &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explorer.</span></li><li><span>Type a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name for your disc in the Disc title box.</span></li><li><span>Click one &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the following formatting options:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Like a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USB flash drive</span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>The disc will use the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Live File System</span> format.</span></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>With a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CD/DVD player</span></li></ul>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>The disc will use the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Mastered</span> format.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click Next &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to prepare the disc.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>Now you can burn files to your disc using whichever method you selected. For more information about burning a CD or DVD, see
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Burn a CD or DVD in Windows Explorer</span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you format a CD or DVD, you can choose either the Live File System or Mastered format. Use the following information to help you determine which formatting option you should choose.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Where do you select “Live File System” or “Mastered”?
</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">First: the window to format a CD-RW or a DVD-RW has no choice for ”Like a USB flash drive” or “Live File System” or
</span></em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">“With a CD/DVD player” or <em>“Mastered”.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Second: format a CD-RW in Windows 7 and insert it into a computer running Windows XP Service Pack 3, that is up to date, an you will get the blue error screen with the bold white text and your computer reboots.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not what the description, herein, of “Live File System” formatted CR-RW and DVD-RW states being able to function in Windows XP</span></em>.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Sorry this system will not accept JPG screen shots that tells part of the problem better than words.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Live File System discs:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Enable you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to copy files immediately to the disc by dragging them.</span></li><li><span>Are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; convenient if you want to keep a disc in your disc burner and occasionally &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy a few files at a time.</span></li><li><span>Are convenient &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because there is no lengthy recording step as there is with Mastered &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discs. Each file is written to the disc as you drag it to the disc folder.</span></li><li><span>Enable you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to save a new file directly to the disc.</span></li><li><span>Enable you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to update or delete individual files.</span></li><li><span>Enable you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to format the disc again when you use a rewritable disc, such as a CD-RW, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVD-RW, or DVD-RAM.</span></li></ul>
<li><span>Might have &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">closed</span> before &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they can be used in other computers.</li><li><span>Are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compatible only with computers running on Windows&nbsp;XP and later &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; versions of Windows.</span>
<p><strong><span>Mastered discs:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Enable you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to drag files to the disc and then burn all the files at once.</span></li><li><span>Are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; convenient if you need to burn a large collection of files.</span></li><li><span>Are compatible with computers running older or current versions of the Windows operating system, a different operating system other than Windows, as well as consumer electronic devices such as CD players, DVD players, and Blu-ray Disc players.</span></li><li><span>Might &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; require a large amount of free <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">hard disk</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space to burn (up to twice the capacity of the disc you're burning).</span></li></ul>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When burning a CD or DVD with Windows, you’ll be asked whether you want to use a Live File System or a Mastered disc format. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Bulgarian language subtitles &#40;English language films&#47;movies&#41; not showing correctly when using WMP or any other player.</h2>
                    All players I've tried to use Bulgarian subtitles with say that codecs are missing - the subtitles display but not with the correct characters (something like Aiiiiiiiiiioooooo instead of Cyrillic) How do I resolve this? Do I need to change some settings
 on my laptop or download something else?

<p><span>Hi Mel_BG,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The message you receive indicates that you need to have third party codec pack installed on your computer to display the subtitle in Bulgarian
 language. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to find more information about codec.</span></p>

<h2>            COD MW2 Data Reset</h2>
                    <p>I’ve recently been trying to get back onto Modern Warfare 2, but cannot access my profile data. When I enter the multiplayer screen, a notice appears that says “Your data is from an old version of the game. You must reset your rank and unlocks to continue.”
 This occurs both on Xbox One and 360.</p>
<p>Has anyone had this same experience or know how to work around it? I really dont want to have to reset my profile.</p>

            Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; I've looked up this error code online and it seems as though this has happened to a lot of people and is usually due to getting into a modded lobby.&nbsp; I'm afraid you may need to either delete your save and start over or contact the devs
 for more assistance.

<div><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having a similar problem with the Mail app; but it keeps re-occurring. The Mail app has disappeared on my Windows 8.1 pc. When I go the all apps it is NOT listed. When I go to Store, it is available and I install and open it. Then it is available,
 but as soon as I close it or go to another app, it disappears again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any ideas? I cannot recall making any changes but there were a few Microsoft updates I think. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Babu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestions, but unfortunately the problem persists. After running the Scanhealth the response was that there were errors that could be repaired. After running Restorehealth the response was that it was successful. I rebooted, just to be
 sure and I then checked and Mail was still not on my pc,so I went to Store My Apps where it is listed but "Not Installed". After installing it is was available, but soon disappears when I go to any other app. When I go back to store it is again listed as "Not
 Installed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help,</p>
<p>

 hit. Any ideas of what caused this problem?

            This is not a server problem. These PCs are in a lab enviroment, three different labs in three different buildings. All the PCs recieved the same error message at the same time, all running windows xp. The PCs are not connected to a server. AD is not installed.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the post and i have read the support article from micrsoft. The question I have is why all 90 PCs had the same problem at the same time when 2000+ PCs on the same network was not affected. The only similiarity in the 90 PCs is that they are the same
 model, separate from the other 2000+ PCs. We have discovered that the problem is a corrupt \windows\system32\config\software file. How is it that these PCs all corrupted this file at the same time. Remember the PCs has Deep Freeze installed, if that matters.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Paging files are essential files that Windows uses like Random Access Memory and hence needed for virtual memory. The paging files are by default stored
 in the drive where you have installed Windows. It is not recommended to delete the paging files, as it will result in poor system performance. However you can move the paging files from the boot partition to another partition. But when you move the paging
 files from the boot partition to another partition, windows cannot create a dump file which contains debugging information in case a kernel mode stop message error occurs. So, the ideal solution is to create another paging file in a different partition and
 then reduce the paging file size in the boot partition. Refer to these steps:</font></font></font></p>
