<h2>            To Enforcement&#58; cheating clan</h2>
                    
<p>I just played with a clan who was on the other team while they also had an extra clan member on my friends and my team.The clan tag is zoso. As soon as the clock went down to zero and we started a second went by and the other clan threw a bomb or something,none
 of us saw what it was but we all died. This happened two or three times in the game. I understand clan wars is going on but that wasnt cool. Then when I told them I was reporting them for cheating, the clan member Classic Crimson said he was going to shut
 my internet down. The other clan members names are ClassicSTAZ,CpG GVanillaIce,EpsilonsxReaper,PUshyShMack,tryhardninja567, and XXXMEIXI3MXXX.</p>

            Hi Robert, well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known SCAM 
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get control of your PC, they will cause your PC to become corrupt and then require you to pay to have it fixed and even though you might pay them, they will not fix it!
<br />
<br />Do not give them Remote Access to your PC 
<br />Do not give them any personal details 
<br />Do not pay them       
        </p>

            Scam certainly., Microsoft will never cold call you, they will only phone if you have requested a call back from them via support.
<br />If you gave the scammers access to your PC then they may have installed malware, first uninstall any Remote Desktop software (if installed) &amp; run these:
<br />Try running these programs:

<br />
<br />Change your Microsoft account password &amp;/or set up two-factor authentication for the account, change all your passwords for other accounts, if you store your debit/credit card details on your PC then inform your Bank to cancel these cards due to you being scammed &amp; they should issue you with new ones.

<br />Microsoft takes seriously its commitments to protect and maintain the privacy of its customer data and empowers its customers to implement and use our services in a protected manner. Unfortunately, technical support scams have become all too common across the industry, affecting consumers worldwide. Customers, family, friends and Microsoft employees are receiving unsolicited phones calls and pop-up advertisement from fraudsters claiming to be from a reputable company or a partner of Microsoft.
<br />
<br />Report a technical support scam here:

<br />Definitely, it's a tech scam. Block that number and don't give any information to them.

<div><span>It was a scam, and&nbsp; with various names and phone numbers, one that has become very common lately. Microsoft *never* makes such calls.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>See&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/virus-scams-social-engineering-victims.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/virus-scams-social-engineering-victims.html</a></div>

<div><span>Besides their getting money from you for doing nothing of any value,&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>if you let them into your computer, who knows what they did there or what confidential information they stole.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>So if you did, I highly recommend that you do both of the following immediately:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>1. Do a clean reinstallation of Windows.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>2. *After* reinstalling Windows, change all of your passwords, especially any for banks or other&nbsp;</span><span>financial sites.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>Since they *might* have installed a key logger, simply changing your passwords without first reinstalling Windows may not be good enough.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And for the future, you should never let *anyone* take control of your computer unless it's someone you know and trust implicitly, both with regard to his honesty and technical skills.</div>

<h2>            Printer Driver error&#58; &#39;The data is invalid.&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>Just replaced my hard drive and reinstalled WindowsXP.&nbsp; Updated it to SP3.&nbsp; Attempting to install a USB mouse or printer results in a 'The data is invalid.' error.&nbsp; I have a HP 2175 and have downloaded the latest driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried using both an old InteliMouse and Logitech Trackman, both fail on USB, but both work with an adaptor in the mouse port.&nbsp; USB flash drives and network adaptors work just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried installing a HP 840C on my network print server,&nbsp; Windows starts copying files, then generates a 'Printer driver was not installed. Operation could not be completed.' error.&nbsp; The printer works fine from the other computers on the network.&nbsp; I
 even tried installing a 'generic' printer on LPT1 using the driver included with Windows and got a signed driver warning.&nbsp; I then got the same error as with my 840C.</p>

    <title>Quick Launch&#47;task bar removes icon for my Ditto program multiple - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pat71896  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quick Launch&#47;task bar removes icon for my Ditto program multiple times</h2>
                    <p>I think it is called the quick launch bar.&nbsp; The battery, volume, and Internet access icons are also there.&nbsp; It may well be the Task bar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Ditto (excellent small app) dozens of times a day.&nbsp; It comes and goes which is a problem because I use it so much.&nbsp; The 'show/hide notifications' area says it is "Show icon and notifications"&nbsp; If I try to change it, it says "This notification icon
 is not currently active.&nbsp; It will be shown the next time it becomes active."</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it to be 'ACTIVE' ????&nbsp; I use it all the time and this is strange.</p>

            <p>Hi Pat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to know that the issue is not yet resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to perform a clean boot to ensure that the issue is not caused by any 3<sup>rd</sup> party services.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Put the computer in clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused by a program or service that starts up when you boot
 the machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After performing the troubleshooting steps for clean boot refer the section<strong> “how to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”.</strong></p>

            <p>Your Language and/or Keyboard are no longer set as UK English. Just use "Settings" or "Control Panel" to get to and review both the "Language" and "Keyboard" settings and change them to your preferred option and you should be back to normal. &nbsp;You probably
 slipped up on the Language and Keyboard selection option when you did the Win 10 install/upgrade.

<p>

<h2>            How do I setup an XP Home PC with two NICs for Internet &#38; file&#47;printer sharing with a Win7 PC&#63;</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I am trying to set up my home so all the wired &amp; wireless devices have internet access and also file/printer sharing.
<br />
<br />
The devices I want to connect are:<br />
<ol>
<li>One WinXP-Home/SP3 desktop PC with 2 ethernet cards (NICs).</li><li>One Win7-Home Premium/SP1 PC.</li><li>A modem/router supplied by my infrastructure (cable) supplier. The wireless function of this modem's router is permanently disabled. I do not have the admin password for it to access/modify its setup.<br />
</li><li>My own wired &amp; wireless router.</li><li>One USB inkjet printer.</li></ol>
My current configuration is:<br />
<ol>
<li>On the XP pc one NIC connects by wire to ethernet port #1 (of 4) on the modem.</li><li>The other NIC connects to the WAN port of my own wireless router.<br />
</li><li>The Win7 PC is connected by wire to a regular router LAN port.</li><li>The XP PC accesses the Web via a VPN which was supplied by my ISP. It is required by my ISP. This VPN port is set up for shared internet access. It appears as "Connection Manager" in Network Connections.<br />
</li><li>The printer is connected to the XP pc.</li><li>At least one smartphone connects wirelessly to my wired &amp; wireless router</li></ol>
<p>With this arrangement I have succeeded to get internet access available to all users/devices. I have been unable to get file/printer sharing to work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Before reaching the above arrangement, I tried this config:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the XP pc one NIC connects by wire to a regular LAN port of my own router.</li><li>The modem connects by wire to the WAN port of my own router. <br />
</li><li>The other NIC was not connected to anything and was disabled.</li><li>The Win7 PC was connected by wire to to a regular router LAN port</li><li>The XP PC accesses the Web via a VPN which was supplied by my ISP. It is required by my ISP. NOT set up to be shared.<br />
</li><li>The printer is connected to the XP pc.</li><li>At least one smartphone connects wirelessly to the wired &amp; wireless router.</li></ol>
<p>With this arrangement I succeeded to get file/printer sharing to work between the 2 PCs. This was not checked on the smartphones. I was unable to get internet access to work for the Win7 pc or smartphone(s).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help me set up so I have both file/printer sharing and internet access on all devices.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Thanks for your reply, but it does not help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read my original post carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 2 different hardware configurations described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one configuration I used (under "Before reaching...") I <strong><u>succeeded</u></strong> to get file &amp; print sharing to work, but in this case the Win7 pc and mobile devices
<u>did <strong>not</strong> have Internet access</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the other configuration I used (under "My current configuration is:") the Win7 pc and mobile devices
<u><strong>did</strong> have access to the Internet</u>, but in this case I <strong>
<u>failed</u></strong> to get file &amp; print sharing to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What combination of h/w and s/w configuration must I set up so that&nbsp;file &amp; print sharing
<strong><u>AND</u></strong> Internet access both&nbsp;work at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>I think that you might be trying to make things too complicated. But first I need some info...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device you refer to as a modem is also refered to as "A modem/router supplied by my infrastructure (cable) supplier", right?</p>
<p>And this device is your internet connection device?</p>
<p>Does it have more than one Ethernet port?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the brand and model of your 'modem' as supplied by your cable supplier? Do you know if it is acting as a DHCP server?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the brand and model of your router and are you OK with altering its settings? For example would you know how to set it up purely as a wireless access point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you be happy with a general description of how to proceed? Or would you require very specific instructions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Correct. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modem-modem/router is the same device. It is a combination cable modem and router with WiFi and 4 ethernet ports. It is labeled&nbsp;"Hotbox" (Model&nbsp;Fast 3184)&nbsp;and is made by Sagemcom. It also includes 2 phone modem ports that are not used. Yes, is is acting
 as a DHCP server, at least, the nic it connects to (I'll call it nic1)&nbsp;is set to get its IP from a DHCP server, so I assume the modem is what supplies it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to one local website (not in English) this is a <u>special version</u> supplied to my cable company of this model:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sagemcom.com/EN/products/communications/broadband-access/broadband-access/sagemcom-fst-3784.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sagemcom.com/EN/products/communications/broadband-access/broadband-access/sagemcom-fst-3784.html</a>#</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My own router is an Edimax BR-6424 , with WiFi and 4 wired ethernet ports. This has its WAN port connected to my other nic (I'll call it nic2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not a trained IT professional (which I guess is why I'm having these troubles) but I am an electronics engineer so I am reasonably competent with technology. I have already made minor changes to its setup like changing its Wifi access password from the
 default. There are some parameters that I am not familiar with, but I think I could change it to Wireless access point only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General descriptions how to proceed should be enough. If I have any problems I could request more specific details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>OK, thanks for that info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I would suggest that you try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connect the XP machine and the Win7 machine to the "Hotbox" with Ethernet cables. The PC with two NICs effectiveley has one redundant NIC.&nbsp;I would connect the fastest NIC&nbsp;to the Hotbox, or if both operate at the same maximum speed it doesn't really matter
 which one you choose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set both PCs&nbsp;so that&nbsp;their NICs&nbsp;get ip an address automatically and also get DNS automatically. Verify that both PCs have an internet connection through the Hotbox. Find out what their ip addresses are and make a note...</p>
<p>On the XP PC:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Click Run</li><li>Type cmd and hit enter</li><li>In the resultant black command prompt window type ipconfig and hit enter</li></ul>
<p>In the resultant black command prompt window type ipconfig and hit enter</p>
<p>On the Win7 PC:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Type cmd and hit enter</li><li>In the resultant black command prompt window type ipconfig and hit enter</li></ul>
<p>Also make a note of the gateway ip address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When that is working OK, disconnect one of the PCs from the Hotbox and use it to connect to your router, the Edimax. You might need to reconfigure TCP/IP to do this next bit. Configure this router as a wireless access point only, remove any internet connection
 details&nbsp;and disable DHCP on it, give it a static ip address in the same subnet as the gateway. The gateway will probably have an ip address of 192.168.x.y, so your router should have a static ip address of 192.168.x.z, where z does not clash with either the
 gateway ip address or the ip address of either of your PCs. Make z as big a number as you can without clashing (max 254). Make&nbsp;a note of the access point's SSID and set up some form of encryption for wireless connections (WEP/WPA) and make a note of the encryption
 key too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having set up the Edimax as an access point, disconnect it from the PC and reconnect the PC to the Hotbox (reset TCP/IP to automatic if you had to alter settings). Connect the Edimax to the Hotbox with an Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connect any devices that need wireless connection to access the internet or your internal network (e.g. smartphone/printer/television/laptop etc.) to the SSID of your router using the encryption key that you set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ever get notifications of ip address conflicts, power off <strong><u>all</u></strong> devices (routers, access points, PCs, notebooks, smartphones, printers, televisions etc.), then&nbsp;power up in this order...</p>
<p>Hotbox (wait for stable indicator lights)</p>
<p>Edimax (again, wait for stable indicator lights)</p>
<p>Other devices in whatever order you want</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know what ip addresses the Hotbox gives to the PCs, what your gateway's ip address is, what the ip adresses of the PCs are and&nbsp;also&nbsp;what ip address you assigned to the Edimax.</p>

            <p>Hi Tricky,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your very detailed reply, and apologies for taking so long to respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem has been solved, but not by using any of your above suggestions (sorry :-) ). Before trying them, I decided to speak to my infrastructure supplier about this issue, to check how much I would need to pay extra&nbsp;to enable the HotBox router &amp; Wifi&nbsp;functions
 . After I explained my problem and before I could ask about any extra fees, without saying anything to me, they accessed the HotBox remotely and changed its setup (I lost web access and saw it reboot itself 2-3 times), and when it retuned to operation, all
 4 ethernet ports and the Wifi were working. All devices have web access and can print to the shared printer. They did this because, when they checked what services package I had, I was entitled to have full access to the HotBox router &amp; Wifi&nbsp;functions without
 any additional fees... why these features were not enabled in the first place is a very good question for another time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I no longer need the 2nd (slower) NIC nor my own Edimax&nbsp; wifi router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really&nbsp;appreciate the time you took to try help, and will keep your suggestions for possible future use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Charles,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community and we will be glad to assist you with your concern.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description it looks like you are facing an issue while performing Windows Backup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the service status of Volume Shadow Copy and Windows Backup.<br />
<br />
To do follow the below steps: <br />
<br />
Step 1: Volume Shadow Copy <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, in the start search box, type Services and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Scroll down and find the Volume Shadow Copy.&nbsp; Double-click “Volume Shadow Copy” in the Services list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, make sure the service is started under “Service status”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK. +</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Windows Backup</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, in the start search box, type Services and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Scroll down and find the Windows Backup.&nbsp; Double-click “Windows Backup” in the Services list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, make sure the service is started under “Service status”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable all the security software including Windows Firewall and then check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer the links for disabling the security software.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Disable antivirus software:<span>&nbsp; </span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a><span>
<br />
<br />
Turn Windows Firewall on or off: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</span></a><span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Note: </span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method
<span>3: <br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
Clean boot</span><span> will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Once the troubleshooting is done, make sure that you try the step 3 in the article to reset the computer as
 usual</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We would be more than happy to help you further if the above steps did not resolve the issue.</span></p>

            <p>First... Thank You for the quick response too my issue. Unfortunately I had the Mail app working flawlessly in Windows 8.1 and was performing exactly as I required for my business. However upon installation of 10, nothing about the mail is as it was to start
 with, not near as user friendly nor does it appear to have half the features the 8.1 version offered. Examples...</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Spam / Junk folder after reviewing all junk... being able to "select all" with single check then delete. Not so now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Folders / Files aren't syncing to where they belong withing the hierarchy I had set in 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Accounts not syncing automatically, must hit sync in order too get the mail and even then sometimes hours after I have already viewed it on my iphone of windows xp desk top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Attachments not showing in mail if lucky enough to have mail itself sync. occasionally the attachments will download but take for ever and cant be selected for "save"... Copy only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been through every setting available for each individual mail account as well as firewall and avast software I ave installed and everything is correct. Also the troubleshooters do not find anything wrong. I am sure this is going to have a learning
 curve and I sincerely hope that is doesn't turn out to be a BETA test like Windows Vista was as I have three desktops that have less than 50 hours of use each on them that have simply been stacked up in the basement as junk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do appreciate your assistance with this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your time and consideration.</p>

            <p>I agree with everything Ken R. stated above.&nbsp; I'm having the same problems and have attempted every troubleshooter, every setting and still can only get the W10 MAIL app to only show the attachments exist on an intermittent basis.&nbsp; Some show up, some do
 not.&nbsp; Syncing is poorly executed and not dependable.&nbsp; Locked "conversation mode" is a very poor choice when real chronological sorting is required.&nbsp; Often other mailers change the subject upon "reply"&nbsp;by one or two letters, making conversation mode totally
 useless.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>W10 Mail is designed for a touch tablet and is not a useful mailer at all on a desktop.&nbsp; It has so many bugs, so few options.&nbsp; I'm ready to go back to W8.1 on three computers in our facility, as clearly the W10 MAIL app is only a very early test version,
 and not worthy of the great stability of the rest of W10.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Creators Device Driver INF Changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graham48251  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Device Driver INF Changes</h2>
                    <p>After updating Windows 10 to Windows 10 Creators, my Device Drivers no longer install. I have traced this to the INF file. In the [SourceDiskFiles] section I was specifying a sub-directory two levels below the INF file. After the update Windows 10 no longer
 recognizes this as a valid directory and ignores it. If I rearrange the directory structure so the driver files are only one level down from the INF, then all is fine.</p>
<p>So the question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Microsoft changed the specification of the INF file or is this a Microsoft bug that will get fixed in due course?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A reason why some device drivers failed to install is due to hardware and software incompatibility. To better assist you and to give you an accurate answer to your question, we need to ask some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>What is the version and build of your Windows 10?</li><li>What is/are the device/s that you are trying to install?</li><li>Did you try to install the device drivers using the installer provided by the device manufacturer?</li><li>Is there an error message when trying to install a device driver?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are waiting for your reply. </p>

            <p>The Devices are all our own. We are the hardware manufacturer. The error message is that the files cannot be found.</p>
<p>The problem is that Windows 10 Creator has changed how it reads the INF file. If a Sub-directory is specified for the Source Files then it can be only one level down from the INF file. The specification of the INF file only states that a sub-directory can
 be specified and no more. It is only this&nbsp;update of Windows 10 Creators that has change the way the INF file is read. So the question is still the same. has Microsoft change the specification of the "Sub-directory" or is it a bug which will get fixed with
 an automatic update. I have proved that this is the problem because I have a 32-bit computer with this update and on this I can make changes as the drivers don't have to be signed. What I now have to do is get a new certificate and resign all the drivers using
 the modified directory structure.</p>

                    I am trying to copy a video from my sd card to my computer.&nbsp; I have already copied the pictures over successfully, except the video is not showing up on the sd card on the computer. I can watch the video on the camera, but it doesnt show up in the dcim
 folder on the computer.&nbsp; Can anyone suggest a way to copy it over?&nbsp; My friend used her sd card in the computer and it successfully copied over her videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp; Jaclyn

            <p>This is becoming quite a mystery...<br />
<br />
Even if your computer could not play the video I<br />
would think you could at least copy the file to a<br />
folder on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
There is a sample AVCHD - MTS video clip you <br />
can download from the following site. Just right<br />
click the filename and choose...Save Target As.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to see if you could download <br />
and play this file. (I notice the camera also records <br />
in the QuickTime .MOV format...have you tried that?)<br />
<br />
Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR3 Samples<br />

<br />
It&nbsp;may be worth a try to download and install one or<br />
both of the following freeware Media Players:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Media Player Classic<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_media_player_classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_media_player_classic/</a><br />
(just unzip it and run it...no installation required)<br />
(the filename to download is : mplayerc_20070918.zip)<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/</a><br />
(runs on XP/Vista/7)<br />

Good luck....</p>

Subject: Windows 7 Ultimate

<p>Date: Fri, 07 Jan 2011 11:31:16 -0400</p>
<p>MIME-Version: 1.0</p>
<p>Content-Type: multipart/alternative;</p>
<p>boundary="--"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content-Type: text/plain;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has come to my attention that you might have an interest in purchasing the operating system</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am selling Windows 7 Ultimate DVD --- the FULL Ultimate version.</p>
<p>This is not the retail version from the store shelf, but it is the one that Microsoft gives out at</p>
<p>IT Professional Conference Meetings to Engineers and Sales Professionals who are invited to come to these meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it does not have the "Activation" policy files attached to the disk,it was not sold to the public,instead it</p>
<p>is used to promote their software which is a regular practice with Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a beta version, trial version, pre-release or anything like that.Although this is a copied DVD and not an</p>
<p>"official Microsoft disk" it works exactly the same,and has even more benefits since it has no activation files, it can</p>
<p>be installed unlimited times on as many computers as you like which is a big plus!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only down side to this is that there is no Web Based Support from MICROSOFT because it was not bought from them.</p>
<p>This is the same with any &nbsp;preinstalled programs in a store-bought computer. Microsoft states on their website</p>
<p>registration page for windows 7 that it &nbsp;is..."Completely Optional"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This Windows 7 version can be updated at any time via windows update(just the same as any retail version though, so that</p>
<p>is no problem either.This is Windows 7 DVD. It is the full version, and as such it can be used to upgrade from an existing</p>
<p>operating system and can be used to perform a "clean" installation on a blank hard drive.</p>
<p>Windows 7, the next generation OS from Microsoft is now RTM. This DVD is bootable .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd be willing to sell it to you for a very low price of $40.-plus a small shipping &amp; handling fee. If you include</p>
<p>64 BIT Windows 7 with it, I will include free shipping for a total of $60.- us dollars.You simply cannot beat this offer.</p>
<p>This would cost you $299.-plus tax in any store, or $600 for both items, and you can only install the store bought</p>
<p>version on one computer.As I said there are not any limitations or restrictions with this type of version other than</p>
<p>the web-based support, but who really needs that anyways? &nbsp;I don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to purchase Windows 7 32Bit($40.-) or Windows 7 64 Bit ($40..-) or BOTH PROGRAMS ($60.-) email me with your</p>
<p>shipping address and inform me which item you want, and I will even send it in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You will receive it in 4-8 business days (sent from outside the United States) and check it out for free to see if it</p>
<p>is in perfect condition (just check out whether it is readable on your system or not) just open it up and see if your</p>
<p>computer can read the files and if so then it will work with your system. Then email me back and let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After I get your payment via an online-payment service such as PayPal which usually seems to work best for most people</p>
<p>I will email you the code-number to install the programs .This is the best method to do this type of business online....</p>
<p>for all parties involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank You,</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Quote, "Are you aware that this kind of thing is goin on"?</p>
<p>Email is free all over the world, and as a result, there are frauds like this for almost every service and product in the world.</p>
<p>We should every thing to get rid of it, but it is not going away soon.</p>
<p>The good thing is that in the past when <strong>Snake Oil</strong> was sold over the years, it took time to propagate the info warning people about it.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil</a></p>
<p><strong>With the Internet, there is good info that can be found (if the person wants to) within seconds to avoid almost all scams.</strong></p>

    <title>How do I disable resolution change when entering full screen video - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I disable resolution change when entering full screen video playback.</h2>
                    I have connected to my sony TV via HDMI output. Whenever I switch to full screen when watching a movie either on VLC or Windows media player my display mode changes.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First it changes resolution to match the film, usually somewhat lower than 1920x1080 which is my native and hence the film looks un-sharp on a now non native resolution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Second it changes the color&nbsp;settings&nbsp;to a more vibrant temperature than my default desktop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Third movie playback is choppy and delayed in full screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Playback is fine in windowed mode, how to I stop the display change when entering full screen mode.</div>
                </div>

<h3> ankitsaluja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 has provided its users to unlock their laptop using either a Pin which is numeric or a password which can be alphanumeric.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've always used my Pin to unlock my laptop so I remember it; but yesterday I received an OS update for Windows 10 online, after which I am being prompted to unlock my laptop using the password only, which I have forgotten by now, since I have always been
 using my PIN. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can unlock my laptop if Windows allows me with the option to use PIN. This is seriously ridiculous. Anybody has any idea, then please help!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Michael, Thanks for the quick response! I would like to update you on the points you asked which are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I am using local account for my laptop.</p>
<p>2. I'm getting the "Incorrect Password" message along with the hint which I must have created while setting up the password.</p>
<p>3. There was nothing I could do except restarting my laptop hoping for a new Windows update that would allow me to login again with the PIN instead of the Password.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Pandora App won&#39;t work on my Xbox 360</h2>
                    <p>Pandora App wont' work on my 360. Tried to re-download the app, when launching it just switches over to an app called Groove, which only plays one song at a time. Is the Pandora App no longer available/working on the 360? I&nbsp;also tried to go to my Internet Explorer app, then access it from there and it will not even load anything or allow me to click on options from that screen. Please advise ...</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>D=)<br /></p>

            Hi Robert.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Re-register the Start Menu from <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-menu-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-men...</a>
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
