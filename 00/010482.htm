            You are probably experiencing OSX's sandbox restrictions. Google "OSX Sandbox" to learn more about the problem. There is also quite likely a bug in VBA, where it throws an error because access is denied instead of having the OS ask for permission. Hopefully
 this will be fixed in a future version.<br />

<p>Hi Ron (and Bob),</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your suggestion. Unfortunately I am very much a beginner to VBA and so I looked for a simple way after reading your notes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved the xlsm workbook to the UBF8T346G9&nbsp;folder. Wrote the following VBA code. &nbsp;It worked as expected. However, &nbsp;After execution, when I tried to exit the program kept telling me that the program could not be saved. I then made a copy of the file outside
 of that folder and then forced an exit. When I tried it again the same problem occurred but this time the message was that there was a compile error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish there was a simpler solution because the task does not seem complicated. &nbsp;I just want to copy 3 worksheets from an xlsm workbook to an xlxs workbook and save the xlsx workbook. &nbsp;I can do this manually easily enough. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that it is an Apple problem. &nbsp;Not sure what to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your effort to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help from you or anyone else would be greatly appreciated.<br />
</p>

<h2>            Using IF &#40;or another&#63;&#41; function for critical path question</h2>
                    
<p>I am doing a project management problem for school.&nbsp; We are given Activities A through H, each with its own duration time.&nbsp; Certain activities must precede other activities, e.g.,&nbsp;Activities B and C are each preceded by Activity A, E is preceded by Activities
 B, C and&nbsp;D, etc.&nbsp;We are asked to determine the number of possible paths, then use the Crystal Ball add-in to determine the probability of any particular path being the "critical path" (the longest in duration).&nbsp; We've been shown how to do that, using the MAX
 and IF functions (if any particular path duration is the Max duration, then 1, otherwise 0).&nbsp; Therefore, each of the 5 critical paths has a 1 or a 0 by it.&nbsp; (In Crystal Ball these values are forecast cells, because they are determined using the durations and
 standard deviations&nbsp;of the activities, which are assumption (random variable) cells.)</p>
<p>We are then asked to determine the probability that any individual activity (A - H) is critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way I can see to do that is to see if one of the possible paths that a particular path is on is critical.&nbsp; For example, activity A is on all 5 possible
 paths, activity B is on 3 possible paths, activity C is on 2 possible paths, activity D is on 1 possible path, activity E is on 2 possible paths, and activities F, G and H are each on 3 possible paths.&nbsp; Therefore, if one of the 5 paths that A is on is critical
 (it has a 1 value), then A is critical and should be given a 1 value.&nbsp; Otherwise, A should be given a 0 value:</p>

</table>
</p>
<p>I tried using the IF function to make this determination.&nbsp; For example, if any of the "if critical" output cells for paths ABEH, ABFGH, ACEH, ACFGH, or ADFGH&nbsp;have a&nbsp;"1" value, then the "if critical" output sell next to Activity A would be "1", otherwise
 "0".&nbsp; The same would be repeated for activities B&nbsp;(for paths ABEH and ABFGH), C, etc.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't get IF to work for more than one value comparison.</p>
<p>I also tried using the OR function, which did give me a "TRUE" value for each activity,&nbsp;but it seemed to give me a "TRUE" value for activities that are clearly not on a possible critical path.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long posting but I'm a neophyte and this is a bit complicated (to me anyway!).&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Chuck, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I actually tried the LOOKUP function as I understand it, LOOKUP is more of a "take the value(s) from this&nbsp;cell(s) and put the value(s) in this cell(s)".&nbsp; I'm trying to do more of an "if this, than 1, otherwise 0" action.&nbsp; However,
 instead of putting into, say, cell B1, "=IF(A1=1,1,0)", I want to say (in more human terms), "if A1 =1, or A2 =1, or A3 = 1, or A4 =1, or A5 = 1, then B1 = 1, otherwise B1 = 0."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Hi T.</p>
<p>Not sure I'm understanding it correctly. Are you looking for a formula that counts how many times each task is in the possible tasks?</p>
<p>With Activity "A" in cell A2.</p>
<p>Enter in E2:</p>
<p>=COUNT(FIND(A2,$A$11:$A$15))</p>
<p>Enter this formula as an array function: CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER</p>
<p>Drag it down for the other activities. My results are:</p>

<h3> duplica123  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change client names to numbers in Excel 2007</h2>
                    I have an excel sheet tracking client names and the dates they've had appointments. &nbsp;I need to submit this for tracking purposes, but cannot have anything "identifying" like a name on it.
<div>Is there a way to change the name "john smith" to "1" and "Jane Doe" to "2" automatically, and then change it back?</div>
<div>I know I can just go manually and type 1, 2, 3 etc but I was hoping there is an easier way.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>and copy that formula down to match your Names. Then copy those cells and paste values over the names in your file.&nbsp; After it has been returned, you can then get the names back by (if they haven't changed anything in your file) by copying and pasting the
 names over the number. If they have changed the sheet, then you would need to use a formula to lookup the correct name based on the number from the replacement.</p>

<h2>            Unable to enable Wi-Fi &#40;Option Gryed Out&#41; after Windows 10 TP Installation</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a HP Pavilion dv6-7104tx Notebook PC. It was factory shipped with Windows 7 and I dual-booted it to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just yesterday I had upgraded the Windows 7 partition to Windows 10TP. At that point of time my Wired LAN was connected and the Wi-Fi was off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept turning on the Onboard Wi-Fi Hardware&nbsp;using the hardware switch (F12) on my notebook but the indicator light remains orange and the Wi-Fi option in the settings in greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this same problem is happening to my Windows 8.1 partition as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcf412ef-cd73-4b5a-95d5-dee5e3f100c1" height="641" width="829" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi refers to the onboard WiFi chip which I am unable to turn on and WiFI 2 is the USB WiFi I am currently using for backup.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling the Broadcomm Driver from the HP Website as well as the wireless switch driver from the HP Website. It worked temporarily on the Windows 8.1 partition but as soon as I switched to the Windows 10 partition it doesn't work now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/422192be-f030-47ae-89d6-ef762ed50901" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried resetting the BIOS Settings as I thought there was a conflict between the Airplane Mode and the Hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using HP Support Assistant but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried reinstalling Windows 10 TP but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP Diagnostics Software (Pre-Boot Environment) doesn't show any problems with the Wi-Fi adaptor, it shows a pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Should I reinstall the factory OS (Windows 7) again?</p>

</p><p>You need to have access to the account you wish to be removed from Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I know how frustrating it is to fill out the form multiple times and still not able to recover the account. But please be reminded that such form is established in the interest of data and account security. This means that
 the system will only grant access to the person who will be able to pass the verification process.<br />
<br />
Fill out the </span><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">"Recover your Microsoft account"
</span></a><span>form to regain access to your old Skype account. To verify you own this account, you will need to fill out as much as possible on this and the following forms. Even if your original information has changed, be sure
 to use the information you had associated with the account originally.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kindly consider below tips when answering the said form. This has helped my previous customers:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Fill out the form from a computer and from a location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where the previous successful sign-in occurred.</span></li><li><span>Make sure that you use an alternate email address that you have access with in order to receive the security code and not the email address of the account you want to recover.</span></li><li><span>The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)
</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough
 for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            How secure is VBA code in an Excel 2007 xlsm file&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I am curious, are the security improvements in Excel 2007 effective for VBA passwords?</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm just looking in the wrong places, but I've spent a couple hours researching and I can't find a thorough answer.</p>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>
<p>- What's the most secure way to protect your VBA code from view?</p>
<p>- How does the protection work?</p>
<p>- Is there any software out there that can break it / replace the password / backdoor it? There is tons of freeware to break Office 2003 passwords. I also saw an article that said you can open an Excel 2007 file in a hex editor and find the password easily.</p>
<p>- Have there been any improvements in Office 2010?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Following retirement I make a modest income from recovering lost passwords for any type of file. Amongst the easiest are MS office passwords and in order of difficulty:-</p>
<p>passwords to open--- hard for a PC user but generally can be removed instantly by decryption. see</p>
<p><a href="http://www.decryptum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.decryptum.com/</a></p>
<p>Once into a workbook then forget it, you can do it with Google and the will to do it.</p>
<p>I have no intention of revealing the secrets here but internal passwords are incredibly weak and in some case the password isn't even stored, instead the password is hashed into a 12 character string of which the first 11 characters are A or B and the last
 is one of 95 other characters so the formula</p>
<p>95*2^11= 194,560</p>
<p>is the total number of passwords that protect the workbook and no matter what password you use one of thos strings will open it.</p>
<p><strong>- Have there been any improvements in Office 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Password to open hasn't changed and I haven't yet encountered any difficulty with internal passowrds</p>
<p>If you feel like splashing out the cash this software which I use is dangerous</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer. I realized after I posted that I should have said an xlAm though I'm not sure it makes a difference.</p>
<p>I guess what confuses me is that Office 2010 is supposed to use 128-bit encryption on at least some of the passwords (I assume to open) and that requires a strong password. A strong password should essentially be impossible to recover. I thought the hash
 was only used for worksheet/workbook structure protection, which I'm not concerned with.</p>
<p>For instance, the software you linked to guarantees password recorvery UP TO version 2003. I assume 2003 is included, but even if it is, I think 2007 is a different ballgame. I just can't figure out how, exactly.</p>
<p>I don't think I necessarily want straight password to open anyway, since an XLAM needs to be open to be used... do you have more detail on each type of password, and what's different between 2003, 2007, and 2010? For some reason I can't find a good answer
 in technet.</p>

<p>Password protection of VBA in Excel 2007 is the same that you have Excel 2003. The removal process for VBA password&nbsp;is (almost) the same(.xls, .xlam, .xlsm). Excel is not secure in any version.</p>

<p>You mentioned the .xlam file type later on in the discussion, and I'll offer up a method of really tightening down the accessibility to an add in that comes from Jan Karel Pieterse in a post in the old usegroups.&nbsp; He apparently found it&nbsp;somewhere else, but
 couldn't remember the source.&nbsp; It was actually provided as a method to protect the code within a workbook (.xlsm) instead of a .xlam file, but should work for that also.</p>
<p>It's a bit complex in setup and I haven't tested it in Excel 2007/2010 but I don't see any reason it shouldn't work with either of them.&nbsp; I'll just say to be sure and work with copies of your workbooks rather than the originals.&nbsp; Also, when it does work,
 the original code is going to be hidden from YOU also, so keep another copy of that code as you go along in the process.&nbsp; Here's the steps to the process:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Save the Excel workbook (.xls) file into an add-in (File &gt; SaveAs.....)<br />
2. After you have the saved add-in (.xla), close the Excel workbook (.xls)<br />
3. Double click on the add-in to open it <br />
4. Press Alt+F11 to access the add-in's vba project<br />
5. Lock the vba-project with a password<br />
6. Double-click on the "ThisWorkbook" code module<br />
7. Press F4 to open the Properties window<br />
8. Change the "IsAddin" status to FALSE<br />
9. Return to Excel by Pressing Alt+Q (or close the vbe window)<br />
10. Go to Tools &gt; Share Workbook <br />
11. When the dialogue appears, check the box for: (Allow changes by.....)<br />
12. Press OK to close the Dialogue<br />
13. When prompted to save, Press OK<br />
14. Press Ok to accept that "macros cannot be accessed"<br />
15. You should feel giddy at this point because you just realized what you have <br />
been missing right under your nose <br />
16. Verify that the [SHARED] appears in the application title bar<br />
17. Now save the workbook again as an Add-in (File &gt; SaveAs...) overwriting the<br />
previous one<br />
18. Close this Excel workbook without saving the changes (you don't need it)<br />
19. Test out your newly saved add-in (open it, access the vbe, try to expand <br />
the project window, you should get the new message "Project is Unviewable"<br />
20. Your done</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p><strong>JLLatham, </strong>thank you for that technique. That might be&nbsp;what I'm looking for, I'm not sure, as&nbsp;I'm not quite sure what it's doing? Does this actually completely lock off the macros for all use, period, or can they still be run, and the code
 simply isn't accessible?</p>
<p>Also, what is the security level for "macros cannot be accessed" from the shared workbook?</p>
<p>Finally: I saw a very basic end run for an Excel 2007 workbook where you can find the VBA project by opening the workbook in a hex editor. Are you familiar with this technique?</p>

<p>I've never used a hex editor to examine an Excel file of any type; but having used such low-level tools in the past, I have no doubt that you can see anything that's in the file, and edit it on a byte-by-byte basis if you want to.&nbsp; There are many tools available
 even for the 'casual' forensic examiner: Knoppix can let you work with Windows created disk files even when Windows itself can't even find any of the contents of the drive!&nbsp; Hex editors are just another such tool.</p>
<p>It seems to me that what Jan Karel Pieterse has outlined here is a method that pretty much emulates the way many add-ins work that come from commercial sources.&nbsp; Although some of them I believe I've gotten into by way of password cracking using some tools
 like the one mentioned by Mike H.</p>
<p>In this 'solution' I think you have to separate your code from the actual workbook and you're then creating an .xla file from it that you'd load with the non-code loaded workbook.&nbsp; This can create some problems, I'm sure if you've used object references
 like "Me." or "ThisWorkbook.", but ActiveSheet. should be ok.&nbsp; Because your code is going to effectively reside in another workbook.&nbsp; But I could be wrong.&nbsp; I only saved the instructions because you can't find anything like them anywhere else, and when you
 follow them to their end, you do end up with code that's inaccessible through "standard" means such as trying to view the VBA Project in the VBA Editor, even if you succeed in cracking the password.&nbsp; But I've never taken it to the next step: putting together
 a 'package' to use the add-in created.</p>
<p>Because it would be, if I'm fully understanding it, an add-in then you're going to have to make the code in it provide access to Subs and Functions within it if you'd previously been dependent on buttons or worksheet events to trigger them.&nbsp; Those types
 of modifications that it appeared to me would be needed are why I didn't take it to that "next step".&nbsp; You might try touching base with Jan Karel to see if he has any further enlightenment.&nbsp; You can find his website by doing a web search on his full name,

            <p>The actual code can be protected using a small application called "Protect VBA Code".&nbsp; I purchased&nbsp; mine from Dombaj Soft for $15 or $20 - a cheap investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have lost your password, and you do&nbsp;not&nbsp;want to write a code to unlock the project, you can use another program called PasswordTools from PasswordTools.com; I only purchased the VBA Module because that's the only thing that I would use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, i do not get anything for this - I had to find/test/pay for these myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>these two tools have been helpful to me, but before you use the Protect VBA Code to lock the project, make sure that you have an unlocked copy somewhere (password protected thumbdrive for me) because the PasswordTools or other software will not beable to
 remove or reset the password - learnt that the hard way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this only leaves the last issue of the digital certificate that you will use to sign the project.&nbsp; Even though td the code is protected from beign viewed or changed, users can still change the digital certificate and redistribute the code as with their own
 digital certificate.</p>

<h2>            iCloud in Outlook, Changing the Data File - NO LONGER ABLE TO EMAIL</h2>
                    <p>I want to use iCloud along with Outlook as a means to wirelessly update my phone without having to have the internet to log onto icloud.com; rather I’d like to use Outlook to update my calendar, tasks, etc. regardless of internet access and when and if I
 get the internet the iCloud and Outlook link will sync appropriately, ultimately passing the information onto my new iPhone 5, from Outlook to iCloud to the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Downloading iCloud, I’ve learned that it creates it’s own folders within Outlook, which I
 don’t think I have any problem with. To most efficiently use Outlook, I want the To-Do Bar to reflect my iCloud information since that is where I will be putting the information within Outlook, in order to do this, I researched and found that this required
 me to change the default data file to iCloud (IF THERE’S ANOTHER MEANS, I’M ALL EARS).&nbsp; Initially I didn’t think this was an issue, but then I tried to send an email and got the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You don’t have permission to create an entry in this folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Right-click the folder, then click Properties to check your permissions for the folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>See the folder owner or your administrator to change your permissions.”</p>
<p>Any tips are much appreciated,</p>

            After further testing it is now working for me. Three users tested that had Illustrator installed and two that did not all were able to save as .ai.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why I saw this behavior originally other than I possibly did a cache cleanup between tests.<br />
<br />
If you don't have Illustrator and save. Then try to open with Preview, Preview will default to opening it in .pdf.<br />
<br />
Try deleting com.apple.LaunchServices.plist in your User's LIbrary then log out/in to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you might try one of the utilities like Onyx to delete caches.<br />

            <p>Definitely decrease the margin size and keep tweaking until you get it right. Usually when a document goes to print and the margins are not correct you get a message to allow the document to be "Fixed" then you can just click "okay" to print.</p>

<h3> mooly  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;NewYahoo&#34; mail problem that may be nothing to do with MSE... High processor use, MSE near top of list in CPU activity.</h2>
                    Today when&nbsp;logging on to&nbsp;BT/Yahoo mail I was informed that&nbsp;this was new version. The page is cetainly different and I was prompted to install Java (I didn't... and haven't needed it up to now) and to install yahoomailupdater-05.exe (to manage attachments
 better ??) which (after taking Acronis image) I did. Problems with that, and a "not compatable with windows32" message appeared.&nbsp;Not happy with it all I recovered the image backup.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;The problem is this... the "new Yahoo" BT mail page is appearing to cause a lot of CPU activity and the fan to be on more than it's off. Performance monitor shows MSE as being near the top of the list for CPU processes. If I close&nbsp; BT/yahoo&nbsp;and just keep say
 google open and for example, as of now on this site there is no processor or fan activity at all. As soon as I open&nbsp;BT/Yahoo&nbsp;MSE shoots to the top of the processor list. Close it and MSE appears to drop off the list.<br />
&nbsp;So is this a compatability issue with this so called "new Yahoo"<br />
&nbsp;Why should MSE appear to work so hard on what is just an "email" home page. Before today and this later version there was no issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Fabien,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve the issue, let us remove and re-install Office on the computer and then verify the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To uninstall Office, you may run the
<strong>Fix it</strong> from the following article to remove all traces of the Office 2013 on the system.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to save the
<strong>Fix it</strong> file on the desktop and then run the file.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the Fix it completes, you may install Office 2013 and then check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To download and install Office 2013, you may login to the My Account page on Office.com with the Microsoft account you used to register or purchase.

    <title>How to format cell text color to row text color automatically&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joesimpsoniii  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to format cell text color to row text color automatically&#63;</h2>
                    I need some help with a spread sheet I am working on.<br />
&nbsp;I am trying to format a Cell so as when text is entered it will also format its adjacent cells in the same manner.<br />
I am only trying to format text / date / number colors<br />
Column A contains "Managers Names"<br />
Column B contains "Start Dates"<br />
Column C contains "Duration" (number of days)<br />
Column C contains "Stop Dates"<br />
I want to be able to enter any "Managers" name into any cell in Column A and the text Color will be automatically formatted for that name as well as the data in the adjacent cells of columns B,C,D would also be formatted .<br />
<br />
Like this: I type in John Doe into Column A Cell 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the formatted text for John Doe is Blue his name now appears in Blue
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When START Column B Cell 1, DURATION Column C Cell 1, STOP Column D Cell 1 data is entered it too will be in blue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

            Apparently you need the Google Cloud add-in to open Google Docs directly (from your Google account). Whether that will add further complications attributable to the add-in, I cannot say.

<br />
However as the document has been downloaded already, Google only appears to allow that in a range of formats

Granted the lack of extension may prevent Word from recognising the file type which is likely to be one of the following: Word, OpenOffice, RTF, PDF, HTML or zip (Zip, PDF and HTML in this instance seem unlikely).
<br />
<br />
Set Word to prompt for the file format on open (File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; General &gt; Confirm File Format Conversion on Open) and try the various options. You may be lucky. I would start with Open Office.<br />

            The pictures that are associated with contacts in Outlook will not sync to your Windows Live account.&nbsp; You'll need to copy the pictures over to your phone and then edit each contact for which you have a picture and add the picture to the contact.&nbsp; I've
 documented the easiest way to do this in an article that is posted on my blog, entitled "<a href="http://snippets.pocketprimer.com/2010/11/23/how-to-restore-contact-pictures-to-your-windows-phone.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to restore contact pictures to your windows phone</a>

<p>The main thing i want is that in PASTE GSTR-1 i want to get values after "no of&nbsp; records " eg ,from d21 ,d26 etc but the format would not be same just wording like "4A, 4B, 4C, 6B, 6C - B2B Invoices would be available</p>

<h2>            Back Button Returns to Top of Page</h2>
                    
<p>We just recently upgraded to IE 8.0 at our office. I am getting reports that pages on our internal site when the user hits back, it returns them to the original page but at the top of the page versus how IE6 returned them to the section of the page they
 were previously located.</p>
<p>I have search high and low and see quite a few people on the web with the same issue but with no resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have determined is that with IE 9 Beta, this problem seemed to have been resolved; however, I cannot roll out a beta :).&nbsp; There are no addons, no spyware, no adware. Problem is duplicated on mulitple machines so not a cache issue or a setting problem.&nbsp;
 Most users are on a Terminal Server which regular permissions; which would rule out most of those issues anyways.&nbsp; However, I have cleared all settings, reset settings, went in with addons off... all of the suggestions mentioned with no resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The site is dynamic using ColdFusion to split out a list. That list can be quite large and danting to scroll through everytime.&nbsp; Sure the new tab is a work around, but since this seems to be 'fixed' in IE9; that tells me that someone at MS knows about this
 and has another solution (hotfix?)</p>
<p>Tested with both IE 8 on Windows XP and on Windows Server 2003 (TS Server).&nbsp; Problem did not exist previous of the upgrade and does not occur with other browsers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The site is internal and therefor part of the Intranet Zone; so it shouldn't be a restriction
 setting.</p>
<p>Looking for solutions... Thanks!</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cite?&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn�??t expect this to be fixed in general.&nbsp; IMO it�??s user error expecting it to look that way.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does work that way it is just relying on quirks in the construction of the page.<br />
<br />
BTW I think another workaround that has always been available where possible is setting&nbsp; Work Offline before going back.&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, it would be an indication of a caching issue (or a scripting issue) in not being able to go back to the same location.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter
 case just reminded me that you might also have to disable scripting before �??going back�?� to avoid its effects too.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, when you know you want to return to a page in the same state that you left it, opening a link in a new tab is not just a workaround, it is good practice.</div>

    <title>Differences between Office 365&#43;Domain from Federated partner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questorfla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Differences between Office 365&#43;Domain from Federated partner</h2>
                    
<p>First, If someone could explain how to post a question that both needs an answer as well as being the start of a new discussion I would like to be able to do both but don't want to type the whole thing twice.</p>
<p>Our Office 365 Small Business as well as our Domain were purchased from a "Federated Partner" (GoDaddy). &nbsp;At the time of purchase we were told that it was the same product with the same features as if we had gone through Microsoft. &nbsp;As the "partner" &nbsp;already
 handled our Domain, it was easier to go through them. As time has passed it has become more evident every day that this statement was "somewhat misleading" to put it mildly.</p>
<p>Almost every week that passes some new problem crops up that we cannot get support for from Microsoft due to purchasing from a &nbsp;"Federated" partner. However, the "partner" has no answers for the questions asked and I am ready to move from them to a fully
 supported Microsoft product if I could get someone to explain to me how to do this without having to deal with any loss of email access or other "downtime" or having to&nbsp;change the name of our domain.</p>
<p>The issues we are having need answers yet all we get are passed back and forth with each party saying the other is at fault. &nbsp;I can understand Microsoft's problem &nbsp;providing support for something that they did not directly sell especially when the "Federated
 Partner" has made changes to the original product but it seems there should be some "Published and tested" manner of getting out of one vendor's pocket and into another.</p>
<p>Our current issues with OneDrive and Office 365 in general are all things that are beginning to pile up with no one willing to offer support either because in the case of one party they don't know the answer or the other party not able to help because the
 product is not exactly the same as the one they sell. &nbsp; Which leave me , the IT Manager in the position of telling people that "No one can help". &nbsp;This does not give anyone much faith in the Product itself.</p>

<p>How about a hint as to how to crate a new discussion as well as needing an immediate answer on the same question.</p>
<p>The specifics of "Roberts Thread" are not exactly the same as mine as i am dealing with a Business using Office 365 Small Business Premium but I get the gist of it is the same.</p>

<p>Hi Questor,</p>
<p>We can only select "<strong>I need an answer to my question</strong>" or "<strong>this is the start of a new discussion</strong>" to start a new thread. It is not feasible to select both.</p>
<p>If you have any questions which need immediate answers, please select "<strong>I need an answer to my question</strong>" and express the urgency in
<strong>the subject of your post</strong>.&nbsp; We will sort the customers' posts by priority based on their description in posts and reply to them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
