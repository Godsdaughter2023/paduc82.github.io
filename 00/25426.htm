<h2>            My account was suspended pending a fradulent investigation. I now want to re-activate the account but I need a representative to activate it. Please help</h2>
                    <p>Someone got a hold of my information and somehow hacked my Zune account (my account information was corrupted and it said someone else owned my account, my card was used by someone posing as me, changed my email and everything)&nbsp;to buy XBOX points. I do not
 own an XBOX, or know anyone who does. I reported the fraud with ZUNE, but I was told it was an XBOX issue and to report it with them. I reported it to XBOX and they could not solve the issue because although my card had been used to purchase point, I did not
 have an XBOX account (hence the fraud case). I opened a case with XBOX for investigation, and on the other hand asked my account with Zune be suspended/blocked until the issue can be resolved. XBOX said their findings were inconclusive and that they could
 not refund me my money because they cannot prove it was fradulent (meaning they couldnt prove the fraud because they said I could have bought the points for a friend, I didnt). I was referred to my bank and Zune. I then started an investigation with my bank,
 my bank found the charge fradulent and refunded my money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am asking my account to be restored, to return it from the suspended/blocked status to normal. I wish to have my account back and I have taken the necessary steps I needed to make sure my account does not get hacked again (stronger passwords, different
 email). Please restore my account so I do not lose what I have built with Zune. I would like my Zune pass to start immediately, Ive been without it for almost 4 months due to the corruption that happend to my account.</p>

    <title>How do I recover all lost outlook files after re-entering email - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I recover all lost outlook files after re-entering email account settings&#63;</h2>
                    Outlook was not downloading new emails from hotmail due to an undisclosed email error.&nbsp; I downloaded the new outlook hotmail connector (32-bit) then shut down the laptop and rebooted.&nbsp; This did not change the problem.&nbsp; I went in to the email account settings
 and verified that the password was correct, and attempted to send and receive.&nbsp; The send and receive process just hung and never completed.&nbsp; I then deleted the hotmail settings.&nbsp; After rebooting, I opened Outlook which then asked for the email account info
 via a wizard.&nbsp; I gave all the same info but may have changed the nickname from my hotmail address to "Firstname's Hotmail" (Firstname=my given name).&nbsp; When I opened the email, all the folders were empty.&nbsp; The same for contacts and calendar.<br />
<br />
Please help me restore my old files.&nbsp; I have found them in the Outlook folder within App Data, but I'm concerned that I'll mess them up without instructions on how to do this.<br />

    <title>Saving last position of userform - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Saving last position of userform</h2>
                    <p>I was not able to find much on the subject of saving the last used position of a Userform so that the next time&nbsp;the Userform is&nbsp;shown, it will be in the same place. Therefore,&nbsp;I thought that it might be worth posting the solution that I came up with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The method is to save the last position by using the "UserForm_QueryClose" event. The Left and Top of the Userform is saved to Defined Names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The defined names can be manually created first or use the following Sub and UDF to&nbsp;first test for the existence of the Defined Names and if&nbsp;they do&nbsp;NOT exist, then create them and Show the Userform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user can then move the Userform to the desired location on the screen and <em>
<strong>provided the workbook is saved before closing the workbook, </strong></em>then the Userform position is saved ready for the next time it is Shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Feel free to comment and in particular, if you believe you have a better solution, then post it. Personally I don't like the solutions where the Registry has to be altered.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>The following code is associated with the code to Show the Userform. (Normally in a standard module):</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub ShowUserform()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '*****************************************************************************************<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> 'After the first time the code is run, IF THE WORKBOOK IS SAVED then</em><br />

<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'or commented out because no longer required.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<p>You can also look into my AddIn, e.g. the Userform Show Duplicates is resize able and the code re-/stores also the width and height.</p>

<p>
</p><p>BTW, if you store the position into names means you have to save the file, otherwise the position is lost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you'll run into a problem it you move the userform to the 2nd monitor, save the file, and reopen it on a single monitor system. In that case the userform is outside of the visible screen.</p>

</p><p>Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the comments. I appreciate discussion on the subject to determine if there are better methods and also to point out any limitations on its use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the saving issue, I actually indicated that in my post in bold print "<strong><em>provided the workbook is saved before closing the workbook"</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't doubt that your AddIn is probably&nbsp;quite good but&nbsp;I avoid them and then if I should have problems with Excel then I know that it is not AddIns causing it.</p>

            How are you going about it? If you don't describe exactly what steps you're taking it's virtually impossible to suggest what might be going wrong. One guess is that you aren't selecting more than one cell at a time - just picking a different font changes
 the formatting for only the selected cells, not the entire sheet or for the entire workbook.<br />
<br />
To globally change the font for the entire sheet, click the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Select Sheet</span> button at the spot where the <span style="font-style: italic">
Column Headings</span> &amp; <span style="font-style: italic">Row Headings</span> meet (upper left corner of the sheet) or use the

If you still have a problem, please include complete details in your reply.<br />

    <title>Word 2016 Needs to Verify Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goh zhang-he  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 Needs to Verify Account</h2>
                    <p>When I opened Word 2016 today, and wasn't connected to the Internet, there was a pop-up message in Word 2016 requiring me to "retry" connecting to the Internet so that there Microsoft could verify my Word account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Does this mean that every time I use Word 2016, I will need to be connected to the Internet? It doesn't make sense, as some may want to use Word offline, such as in cases when I don't have Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If I choose not to "retry" that connection to Word 2016, what features will not be available? If I choose not to "retry", what features in Word 2016 will I be missing out on?</p>

 getting drained with in 10 Hrs. Bluetooth OFF, WiFi OFF, Background applications OFF. Remaining operating conditions like mobile signal strength are same like before software up gradation. Kindly look in to the matter.</p>

<p>Re installation older version of phone software at home with ovi software is not possible. there is no feature to go for older version. i believe Nokia care only can do it. Didn't understood why can't they test the sofware and then release....</p>

<p>i too have the same problem and the Customer care personal has reinstalled the OS with the fresh Anna. But even then the battery performance is not much improvement. Formerly I use to get 2.5 days and now getting only 15 hours. I want to go back to my old
 symbian os and it was better by all means. Please advise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Better ask customer service to install older version (Symbian) which is giving 2-3 days battery life.</p>
<p>I saw couple of good features with Anna version but other side fast draining is a problem.</p>
<p>I understood from different Nokia users in my company that "after installing latest software battery life came down to 10-15 hrs from 36 hrs life". It's really hard to digest. Practically it's impossible to recharge every 10 hrs.</p>

<p>I have the same problem, except my battery lasts for only 5 or 6 hours. This started only after upgrading the new software 25.007,,, &nbsp;the previous symbian anna worked pretty OK (when I say OK, I mean terrible, but it's as good as s60 gets)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the new software not only has terrible battery life, it also locks up frequently (I recently went to london - my phone completely locked up so I could not use it). Had to use a phone box to call home to the wife, to get my brothers number from my laptop,
 and call him like that. thanks nokia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's also much more sluggish than the previous software</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About hte battery problem - I noticed my email settings have changed from "every 15 minutes" to "always on"... I just changed that back again to see if it helps. There is something else that is keeping a packet connection to the network (even with widgets
 onffline mode). This was not the case before -- so somehow the new software is keeping a connection to the network + I suspect this is the problem. I have battery monitor application, and according to this "background" has consumed 3 entire batteries since
 I installed it a few days ago -- while everything else including voice calls, maps, web, camera, home screen, has taken only about 50% of 1 battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so need to track down what this "background" application is that has been installed with the new update.</p>

    <title>Too much time in service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erik read  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too much time in service</h2>
                    <p>Over the past year I have purchased the original MS Band and the Band 2. The first band died around Christmas and the second band died in the middle of April. The first band just started falling apart (band separating from clasp, etc) and the second one
 would power down as soon as I clasped it. MS Support refused to replace my first band but they are replacing the second one. All together my bands have been in service for about a month over the past year. Before people say I must be hard on my devices...I
 am not. I run maybe 3 times a week and work as a software engineer. The bands are just not durable (at least in a humid midwest climate).</p>
<p>That's a lot in my opinion. During this second period I have found replacements that seem to work as good or better.</p>
<p>I got the band because it had on board GPS and I wouldn't have to take my phone with me. Well, I take my phone with me anyway.</p>
<p>I got the band because it gave me notifications and I wouldn't have to have my phone out. I have my phone out anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of time my bands have been in service have shown me how unnecessary a device like the band is.</p>
<p>Sorry MS...another customer lost.</p>

            <p>I got my Band 2 in January. &nbsp;I used it every day, and just recently the band tore in 3 separate spots. &nbsp;I believe it is probably due to weight lifting and my forearms were stretching it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just sent mine in, and I am hoping it gets replaced. &nbsp;Since it got torn, the HR monitor stop being accurate and it stopped tracking my sleep altogether. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MSFT Band 2 is awesome, there are so many GREAT things about it, the durability though, is god awful. &nbsp;Its a poor design. &nbsp;Most other activity trackers have replaceable bands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my next Band goes bad again I will be buying a new activity tracker, and it wont be the band 2. &nbsp;As a consumer, when you spend $250 on ANYTHING, you should have the expectation that it is built to last....not just a few months.....and we are talking about
 an activity tracker....you know, something that is supposed to last through constant strenuous activity.</p>

            It has a lot to do with Regional Demographics and your Search Interests. Rewards are geared for these "Group" categories. You might try contacting Microsoft Rewards Team and request the card be made available in your Particular Group.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t drop slides from one PPT into another in OneDrive</h2>
                    Hello. I'm collaborating on a powerpoint presentation and would like to have my colleagues drop their slides into my shared ppt. We can't just drag and drop and cannot find any "reuse slides" function. I'd prefer not to have them download the file, update
 it, then send it back when so many people a building at one time. Am I missing something? Is this possible? Thanks!&nbsp;

<p>Hi UnisaAnn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm glad to help you.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to say that you can't drag or drop the slide in PowerPoint Online. As a workaround, you can upload the presentations to OneDrive for business, then
<a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2Fcopy-and-paste-in-powerpoint-online-e5bf5376-cf9f-482c-a72c-c98f8a1ba4ed&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7af7de3bca8a4ce7eb8808d6868bcc54%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636844332316392076&amp;sdata=7iZTB%2FAjNICe%2FIDb15LzLFJZcyryP56NP0Zb9JLHDkY%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
copy and paste in PowerPoint Online</a>.</p>
<p>I understand it would be more convenient if you can do that. Thus, I suggest you submit your feedback to our PowerPoint Online User Voice via the link

<br />I'm sorry to give you bad news but unfortunately your conversations are saved on your hard drive for a period of time, which you can specify in your history settings. So that info was only in your old PC.

<h2>            Text from existing text boxes is duplicated and errors follow after I draw a new text box</h2>
                    <p>I am working in compatibility mode on a document that was originally created in Word 2003 that has several text boxes with text inside.</p>
<p>When I draw a new text box, the text from other boxes within my document is included in the new box. After that, the behavior becomes very erratic: Sometimes when I try to delete the text from the new box, it is deleted from the other boxes, other times
 that doesn't happen, sometimes it displays text from multiple text boxes, sometimes when I try to delete the new text box it deletes the old text box as well.
</p>
<p>The boxes are not linked.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas of what might be happening?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi meurgood<br />
<br />
Sorry it's still a bad Nokia day for you!<br />
<br />
I am referring to values recorded in the "registry" of your PC. Please be aware that altering any values can stop your PC working, so if this takes you out of your comfort zone, it would be best to leave this process alone.:(

    <title>Find and return the intersection of a row and column - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodneypj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Find and return the intersection of a row and column</h2>
                    <p>I have a large matrix of Distances between locations.&nbsp; e.g. in Column A I have a list of 200 locations and its transpose in Row 1.</p>
<p>At the intersection of (say) Row 57 and Column 83 I have the distance between the locations in Row 75, Column 1 and Column 83, Row 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without loss of generality, let us assume that Row 57 Column 1 refers to Norhampton and Column 83 Row 1 refers to London; the Intersection of the column row (R57C83) contains 66.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In two cells away from this table, I have set up two data validation lists so that I can select two locations.&nbsp; So let us further assume that I have chosen two distnct locations.&nbsp; What I now require is a function that will take the contents of these two
 cells to return the distance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly trivial to the Excel expert, but baffling to me!&nbsp; Any suggestions or help please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(As a further supplementary question: is there any way to ensure that the user selects distinct values from the two data validation lists?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<h2>            Office 2007 and Windows 10</h2>
                    I can open Word files in Windows 10 but only as Read-only, even though their properties do not show them as Read-only.&nbsp; Even after ticking the box and then unticking it and apply each time I cannot edit and save the new input because it says I do not have
 permission.&nbsp; I have looked at the Administrator information and their is nothing stopping me except Windows 10.&nbsp; This is not a good situation to be in when I have regular updates to input and pss on to others.

            <p>I also switched from W7 to W10 and had the same issue with "read-only."&nbsp;Here are&nbsp;several possible ways to get around this that have been working for me, (although I think W10 should work properly to begin with!)
</p>
<p>(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">There is another thread dealing with the "read-only" problem that may help you.)</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">How
 to get around "read-only:" 1) when you are ready to save your document,&nbsp;save it to your desktop (or of course, to a thumb or external drive.)
</span></span></p>
<p>Saving to desktop:</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">-click onto&nbsp;the square "save” icon shown at the top left on the toolbar (it looks like the old floppy disks.)
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">-It should bring down a menu of places on the computer, such as desktop, documents, downloads, music, pictures,
 etc. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">-Click onto desktop and then click “save.” You should then&nbsp;see the familiar Word document icon&nbsp;(page with "W"
 on corner) appear onto the desktop itself (this will be your saved to desktop document.)
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">-I have started a desktop file for these saved documents. So far the “read-only” application doesn’t seem to
 touch these documents. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">Or you can try this: 2) copy/paste your document onto email to self; this saves document for transferring to your
 desktop folder later. (It’s a hassle, right?) Fortunately for me, I had saved all my documents to my external hard drive before I switched to Windows 10 and every single one on it has been preserved without “read-only!” Now when I start a new document or revise
 an older one, I save it to my desktop folder (so far it is working for me.) Let’s hope Microsoft figures out soon why there is a major flaw in Windows 10, I mean, composing (Word) documents after all!

            <p>Murray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;decide to pursue&nbsp;this&nbsp;beyond the Desktop workaround that you are currently employing then&nbsp;I suggest these steps.&nbsp; Note that if the first&nbsp;or second&nbsp;step&nbsp;fixes it then there is no need to proceed any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I appreciate that steps 1&nbsp;&amp; 2 are technical procedures that you might not normally use.&nbsp; They can be done, however, even without knowing about the complexities of the permissions schemes involved.&nbsp; Just read each stage and complete it before proceeding
 to the next.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Use the procedure given in&nbsp;the MS Knowledge Base article that Doug gave a link to above&nbsp;-
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3086786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><em>icacls "%programfiles%\Microsoft Office 15" /grant *S-1-15-2-1:(OI)(CI)RX</em>
</span><span>needs to&nbsp;be changed to </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>[for computers running </span>32 bit <span>
Windows 10] </span></p>
<p><span>icacls "%programfiles%\Microsoft Office" /grant *S-1-15-2-1:(OI)(CI)RX</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>or [for computers running 64 bit Windows 10] </span>
</p>
<p><span>icacls "</span>%programfiles(x86)%<span>\Microsoft Office" /grant *S-1-15-2-1:(OI)(CI)RX</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>or [for those rare cases of 64 bit MS Office 2007 in either type of Windows 10]</p>
<p><span>icacls "%programfiles%\Microsoft Office" /grant *S-1-15-2-1:(OI)(CI)RX</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Disable OneDrive in Task manager, Startup tab&nbsp;and restart the computer for this change to take effect.&nbsp; Then use&nbsp;the augmented permissions resetting procedure provided by another user, an MVP for Outlook, in &nbsp;<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/pst-file-access-denied" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Fix
 read-only access to Office files</span></a>. Whilst the procedure was written&nbsp;with Outlook in mind, it applies to write permissions for all the documents etc folders - start from its sub-heading
<em>Resetting all permissions for your user account</em>.&nbsp; One essential component of the procedure is&nbsp;in its para 6 -
<em>Replace all child object permissions entries with inheritable permission entries from this object</em> because omission of that&nbsp;step fatally undermines the fix being attempted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; If you subsequently use OneDrive [by, for example, opening an Office document from a OneDrive folder], check folder permissions again as some users have reported that the problem returned when doing so.&nbsp; If this happens then you can try repeating steps
 1 &amp; 2 above or moving on to step 4 below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; If the fault persists, reappears after a system restart or&nbsp;reappears after re-enabling OneDrive use the further procedure created by the user Figment in &nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/bug-windows-10-onedrive-default-settings-causing/43700b79-31a3-43c8-8d30-7863e40d9576"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">[BUG]
 Windows 10 OneDrive @ Default Settings Causing Major ...</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.1&nbsp; You will see references in that thread to using the "Default" ["Built-In"] Admin account if mistakes are made during fixing with the result that "permissions" are set so badly that further remedial action is inhibited.&nbsp; That's fine but it is much&nbsp;safer
 to create two additional password-protected local Admin accounts beforehand instead and to make a "password reset disk" for each of them.&nbsp; By&nbsp;avoiding use of the Built-In admin account as much as possible, the chances of this special &amp; irreparable account
 suffering user profile corruption are minimised so that it ought to remain fully&nbsp;functional &amp; ready for&nbsp;a day when there&nbsp;might be&nbsp;no alternatives left.&nbsp; Having two additional password-protected local Admin accounts&nbsp;ready is not just a precaution for this read-only
 problem, it is a precaution that all users ought to take as soon as they have installed&nbsp;Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.2&nbsp; The standard precaution of making an up to date system image beforehand also applies.&nbsp; As does booting from your Recovery drive first just to make sure that it works and that it will therefore be available to enable restoring from that system image&nbsp;should
 the need arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.3&nbsp; Personally, I do not agree with using the tool Figment suggests [CCleaner] even just to clean up files.&nbsp; Windows has a perfectly satisfactory &amp; safe tool for doing that [in&nbsp;File explorer, right-click on a drive, select properties then Disk cleanup].&nbsp;
<em>CCleaner can do this job but some say it is not safe even for this limited use;&nbsp; moreover, it has a Registry cleaning mode&nbsp;that is definitely dangerous as it can seriously &amp; irreversibly corrupt the Registry.</em></p>

</p><p>The linked thread has been rewritten.&nbsp; I have therefore rewritten my earlier post above.&nbsp; In doing so I have taken the opportunity to explain that I would not use CCleaner -&nbsp;I appreciate that Figment has only suggested using its temporary file cleaning facility
 but it could so easily be misused once installed.</p>

            <p>I have found a temporary solution but it has to be followed each time I switch on my computer.&nbsp; In Task Manager go to Troubleshooting and then Programs and then Run programs for previous versions of Windows. Go to Advanced settings and Run as Administrator.&nbsp;
 Follow this and you can open your Word documents with the option of Read Only or not - choose Not.</p>
<p>Like I say this has to be done each time I switch.&nbsp; Surely it cannot be beyond the wit of man to find a more permanent solution.</p>

</p>
<p>And every time I hit the back button, It sends me to another Malware site. And I didn't click on anything.

            Hi Michael,  
<br />
<br />In case you have somehow picked up browser redirect malware, you should run a scan with the free MalwareBytes and ADW Cleaner:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a> 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />When those scans complete, restart your PC, you can then uninstall MalwareBytes and just delete ADW cleaner, because it does not install into your PC
<br />

    <title>Cannot associate .rtf file type to Microsoft Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n.connors  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot associate .rtf file type to Microsoft Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand new computer with a fresh Windows 10 Pro installation and fresh Office 2016 installation (stand alone program, not Office 365 subscription). When I open an .rtf file I get the dialogue box asking "How do you want to open this file?" I select
 Word and check the box that says "Always use this app to open .rtf files". The file opens in Word, however the file association does not stick as I get the same question and need to repeat the same process every time. I also tried to set up the file association
 using Settings: "Choose default apps by file type." I scroll down to .rtf and press the "+ Choose a default" box and select Word, but the association does not work as the "+ Choose a default" box remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Nate</p>

            Setting File Associations, especially Office Application file associations in Windows 10 is currently a mess, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open Excel (Word)
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />Find Excel (Word) on the processes Tab in Task Manager
<br />
<br />Right click Excel (Word) and choose 'Open File Location'
<br />
<br />Note down the location of the Excel executable
<br />
<br />Close Task Manager
<br />
<br />Right click a tls file and choose 'Open With' - choose another app
<br />
<br />Important - Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open tls . . .'
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps'
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom again, click 'Look for another app on this PC', then navigate to the file location you noted earlier and set that file association to Excel (Word) . . .

            Then, try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />An additional step would be to run a scan to find and repair files. 
<br />
<br />To do that, you would bring up a command prompt window in administrator mode.
<br />1. In Cortana type Command.
<br />2.You will see Command Prompt.
<br />3. Right-click on that and run as Administrator.
<br />4. Then type or paste the following into the command prompt black box:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />5. Then press the Enter key.

            As far as I can tell, Windows 10 is hopeless at retaining file associations. I have been having the same problem with .jpg attachments in Outlook (get the popup every time despite checking the box and despite having explicitly set the file association
 in Windows), and others have had similar problems with PDFs and other formats. The only solution I have found so far is for setting Internet Explorer as the default browser to open links in Outlook, and that requires a Registry edit. I would gladly perform
 a Registry edit to fix the .jpg problem (as would other users to fix PDF, RTF, etc.), but so far no one has come forward with that as a solution. It is extremely frustrating.

            I installed the latest pre-release version of Windows 10 Pro and it fixed my file association problem. Some other areas of functionality are now a little sketchy but since I spend most of my time in Word, I'm fine with the trade off.&nbsp;

    <title>logging on to myphone from my cell phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redfeather  say:</h3>
<h2>            logging on to myphone from my cell phone</h2>
                    I have more than one issue here. The first issue is this: I had previously been using the sync program with no problem, and it was doing the sync automatically for me, fine, whenever I went to MY Phone. However, I have just installed a software update
 for my Samsung Omnia Phone, that Samsung recommended. I backed up all my data, as Samsung recommended before doing the upgrade, because&nbsp; the upgrade process would remove all the data in my phone. I did this fine. After the upgrade I went back to my phone to
 make sure all the data were restored. They were using Active Sync to backup data. However, when I went to my Programs on my phone, I noticed that the My Phone Icon was gone. It was there before I upgraded the phone software. I then went to reinstall it, and
 did so with no problem. However, when I hit My Phone Icon, it keeps on telling me that my ID or Password is incorrect. I know I did it correctly, and tried several times.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second issue is: All the pictures that were in my camera before the update are gone from my phone. When I go to the MY PHONE website on my laptop, all the pictures are there. Nowhere on the website does it say how
 to restore anything to the phone. I find this incredible!! Is restore on another website? Also, instead of making me go thru a forum, why can't I e mail Tech Support directly. This is really a hassle. Also there is no contact phone number<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help with all of the above issues, and please don't leave any out. Thanks so much<br />

I'm assuming there was a change after you performed the upgrade from Samsung and the MyPhone service does not see the device as the same device it was.&nbsp; I would recommend that you go in and remove the device that is listed.&nbsp; Your data is safe, it will not be
 deleted from the MyPhone service if you remove the listed phone.<br />
<br />
Select the "Microsoft My Phone" application from the <strong>Programs</strong> or
<strong>Settings</strong> menu on your phone to complete setup. After you sign in with your Windows Live ID and sync, the information stored in your web account will be downloaded to your device.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to choose the items to sync from the Menu/Sync Options on your device<br />

No it is not stored on another website.&nbsp; If you archive your photos then you can restore them to your device from the website.<br />

            What do you mean, "remove the device", what device?, and how do I remove it from my phone?<br />
I see that you probably mean the phone , is the device. Is that correct? Do I actually go into the phone to remove the device or into the laptop to do it? Please tell me the steps needed to remove the device, and how I bring up the listed device. Thanks!

            I'm not sure just what is happening to you.&nbsp; In theory if you have deleted the device from the MyPhone site, when you sign in with your Windows Live ID and sync, the information stored in your My Phone account will be downloaded to your new phone.<br />
<br />
Since you were able to log on to the MyPhone website and remove the device so you could add it again, make sure that you are absolutely correct in the user ID and password you entered on your device.&nbsp; Look under menu/account/Change Windows Live ID to verify.&nbsp;
 You might want to re-enter the passwork again just to make sure.<br />
<br />
If that does not work then I would remove the MyPhone application and reinstall it (but you really should not have to do that).
