            There are a variety of factors why your laptop’s battery might suddenly stop charging or won’t charge to full capacity. These can include, age, health and possible firmware or hardware issues. One of the easiest things you can do is power down your computer, plug it in and let it charge overnight. If you don’t see any differences, try some of the following suggestions below.
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply. Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

                    <p>I hope this is posted in the correct forum,</p>

<p>I have been trying to find the enforcement.xbox.com forum.</p>



<p>I have recently served a week communication suspension and discovered I still could not send messafes etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I contacted xbox over the telephone, I found that there was another suspension made on the same day affecting my account, although on my accounts enforcement actions the suspension isnt at all visable, and therefore I am unable to view or even apply for a case review.</p>



<p>I was hoping to do the latter and apply forna case review.</p>



<p>If an xbox representative would like to contact me please leave a reply on this post.</p>



<p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Regards.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is my third post, I will continue to post until my issue is resolved.</p><p><br /></p><p>I sooner sell my xbox and delete my account than serve a 2 week suspension followed by an absurd 3MONTH suspension that i cannot appeal... are you serious after the thousands of pounds ive spent at microsoft and now youre making money off my account because of a frankly now useless membership.</p><p><br /></p><p>Im disgusted at microsoft at this point.</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I think I actually managed to get it going.&nbsp; At least I got to the screen for selecting language and such, (for the first time since 1809 took me down).&nbsp; So maybe is going to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A series of unfortunate events had gotten in the way.&nbsp; A DVD I had labelled as Win10 install was blank (I think it turned out too small for the download, and I had forgotten), and the Surface specific USB I had made doesn't seem to be bootable on any computer.&nbsp;
 And my couple of efforts to boot with a Win10 DVD in a USB drive that I thought had failed, might have actually been working and taking so long on a blank blue screen that I thought they weren't and aborted them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I miss the good old days when you could see what was going on, instead of long periods of waiting without indication of what it is doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your reply.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Shawndra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error that prevents you from saving files on your hard drive may occur due to no appropriate permissions, folder ownership has changed, encrypted file, corrupted file, or corrupted user profile. For us to resolve the issue, we recommend that you follow

<strong>Edit </strong>and select the boxes for the permissions that you must have.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Make sure that you have the ownership of the file or folder.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the file or folder, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Security </strong>tab, and then click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Change</strong>, then type your credentials if asked.</li><li>Type the name of the person that you want to give ownership to, and then click

<p>Hello Gerard. I have full control and am the Administrator of my machine. Attached are screenshots showing I have full control on the folder. Please let me know next steps. This only happened after the recent Windows 10 updates. It's quite frustrating.</p>

<p>Thank you for the screenshot that you've provided. Since you have full control and permission on the file or folder, we also need to make sure that the file is not encrypted or corrupted. Follow the steps below on how to check if the file is encrypted or
 corrupted:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check if the file is encrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the file or folder, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>General </strong>tab, and then click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>If the <strong>Encrypt contents to secure data</strong> check box is selected, you must have the certificate that was used to encrypt the file or folder.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the file is not encrypted, proceed to step 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check if the file is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Try opening the file, if the computer crashes or it loses power, it means that the file is corrupted.</li><li>Try repairing the file, if it can't be repaired, it means that the file is corrupted.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop with the result.</p>

<p>After performing several troubleshooting steps with the file, we were able to identify that this is not a file-related issue. The next thing that we need to check if the user profile is corrupted. Corrupted user profile may prevent you from opening, saving,
 or deleting files and folders. We suggest that you create a new local user and check if the issue persists. For your reference, check this article on how to

<p>Gerard,</p>

</p><p>I had to have a professional computer repair guy resolve the issue. That cost me $130. This was an issue caused by an update pushed to my device. I' extremely unhappy and have requested reimbursement. Microsoft should not be pushing updates that corrupt
 components of users machines. Point blank</p>

<h2>            windows remote desktop unable to connect to PC on different network band &#40;2.4Ghz&#47;5Ghz&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I don't know whether this is a known issue, or a bug that has not been fixed yet, but it is annoying as ****. I have two Computers, A desktop running Windows XP Professional SP3, and a Laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate x64. both computers have all available
 windows updates installed. I have the RDP update package for Windows XP installed on the desktop. both computers have full network capability and no connectivity issues. I am using a netgear n900 WNDR4500 router. the desktop is connected to the 5Ghz band,
 the laptop is connected to the 2.4Ghz band. both PC's are equipped with Wireless N adapters. router's wireless isolation feature is off on both bands. desktop is detected in windows 7's network map. I can access shared directories that exist on each computer
 remotely through the \\computername\sharedfoldername\ method in explorer. windows 7 laptop has RDP 8 update installed. this issue occurs with Windows Remote Desktop 7.0 (windows 7 default version) as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;when I try and connect using Windows Remote Desktop, from my laptop, I get an error message "Remote Desktop can not connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons: 1) remote access to the server is not enabled 2) the remote computer is turned off
 3) the remote computer is not available on the network. make sure the remote computer is turned on and connected to the network, and that remote access is enabled." A similar message is given if I try to connect to my laptop from my desktop using Windows Remote
 desktop when the desktop is connected to the 5Ghz band. both computers can see each other, and exchange data, but Windows remote desktop is unable to do so. since the laptop is unable to access the 5ghz band, if I tell the desktop to connect to the 2.4ghz
 band, Windows remote desktop is able to make a successful connection.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is a design limitation, a bug, or what. Given that with proper access rights, one is supposed to be able to use Windows Remote Desktop over the internet, why is it not able to connect across the to bands that make up my network? since

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance to your post, the adapter installed in your laptop supports <strong>
B/G/N.</strong> If you refer to my previous post, it states that if your system supports B or G and N, it connects only at 2.4 GHz. So, I would request you to refer to the following driver support link&nbsp;for various
<em>Wi-Fi</em> network adapters for your Toshiba laptop.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=2584418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Satellite P500-ST6844 Support</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the above link, you can <em>filter by</em> Wi-Fi drivers, and you will get a list of adapters. You may check with your system manufacturer which of the adapter supports dual band, i.e., both 2.4 GHz and 5GHz bands. In other words, the adapter which supports

 installed in your&nbsp;laptop will connect at both, 2.4 GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Hope this information is helpful. Please reply back with your results for any further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>this is not a driver issue, as neither PC has connectitvity issues except as described in my OP. I am aware that my laptop cannot receive the 5 ghz band. I am not trying to get my laptop to connect to the 5 ghz band. only my desktop is able to connect a
 the 5ghz in this issue. this is how it should be.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the issue is while my desktop is connected to the same network but using the 5ghz band, windows remote desktop will not connect the two computers even though the two computers can still see each other in windows networking.&nbsp; having the two computers connected
 to separate bands should make no difference what so ever as long as they are both connected to the same router or network. but this is does not appear to be the case. in order for me to initiate a successful RD session, I must tell my desktop to use the 2.4ghz
 band, the same band the laptop is already on. since both wireless signals are going to/from the same router, and there are no communication issues, a remote desktop should be possible but it is not.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>should I use the steps recorder and post it to my skydrive so you can see what it is I'm talking about?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>using win7's network map,&nbsp;you are&nbsp;able to see whether my desktop is connected to the 2.4 ghz band or the 5 ghz band.

            That's an interesting problem.&nbsp; I suspect it's an issue in the router rather than Windows 7 and it probably involves traffic on TCP port 3389 not being passed by the router when the desktop is using the 5Ghz connection.&nbsp; I would look to the router manufacture's
 support.&nbsp; Also, it would be interesting to try explicitly configuring port forwarding in the router for a test.<br />

<p>the current router is a netgear wndr4500. it has been a great router with no issues. I will try asking on the netgear forums to see what they say.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will try configuring tcp port 3389 to get forwarded to the ip's of my laptop and desktop to see what happens.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>port forwarding on the netgear is really basic.&nbsp;I could forward the port on one computer or the other, but not both at the same time. i tried forwarding to each pc, but no&nbsp;RD connection was possible.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>seeing as this issue existed with two other routers from different manufacturers, I would think that this is a either a design limitation to the RD component, or a bug.</p>

            <p>i downloaded the MS utility PortQry Command Line Port Scanner Version 2.0, from here:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17148</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>when i ran the command "portqry -n 192.168.1.7 -p tcp -e 3389"</p>
<p>I&nbsp;got this:</p>
<p>Querying target system called:</p>
<p>&nbsp;192.168.1.7</p>
<p>Attempting to resolve IP address to a name...</p>
<p><br />
IP address resolved to COMPUTER</p>
<p>querying...</p>
<p>TCP port 3389 (ms-wbt-server service): FILTERED</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>when the same command is run to test my laptop it says port 3389 is listening.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure what "FILTERED" means, but I assume it is the cause of the issue. RD is properly setup on both systems and windows firewall is properly set up on both machines. this is demonstrated by the fact that I can get a RD connection when I connect the
 desktop to the 2.4Ghz band.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have checked my router settings and any filtering settings are either turned off or not setup.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>FYI: any references to PC named COMPUTER will mean my XP based desktop, any references of CHRISSOLOMON-PC will be my win7 based laptop</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next up, I will run portqry from my desktop to see if results are the same</p>

            I almost hate to point this out, but my desktop's network adapter DOES support wireless A on the 5ghz band. that said, I have both pc's connected as N regardless of band

            Ok, I ran portqry on my desktop, and both the local and remote (coming from laptop) port 3389 was listed as listening. I did come across&nbsp;an&nbsp;older article recently that stated the M$ added NLA support to XP with SP3 but it is not&nbsp;enabled by default. I&nbsp;followed
 the instructions on adding the&nbsp;proper settings to&nbsp;the registry to enable NLA on XP. I will see if it helps any.&nbsp;I&nbsp;<em>was</em> seeing an error when I tried to connect&nbsp;XP remote desktop to&nbsp;win7 laptop&nbsp;saying that the remote system&nbsp;(my laptop) required NLA support
 which my system did not&nbsp;have.&nbsp;will see if changing the registry keys works. I already had the RDP 7 update installed, so I should be half way there already.

            Hi ADSpitt,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
a. Do you get any error message when trying to print?<br />
<br />
In the mean time, you could check if the print spooler service is running in the services. If it is started, you may stop the same and restart the print spooler service.
<br />
<br />
1. Open Administrative Tools by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type administrative tools, and then click Administrative Tools.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
2. Double-click Services. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
3. Right-click the Print Spooler service, and then click Properties.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
4. On the General tab, next to Startup type, make sure that Automatic is selected.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
5. If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />

<p>Sorry I had to open another thread but the foruns won´t let me reply to messages!I had already stated my problem and Mister Fitzer asked me to answer some questions.Here it goes:</p>
<p><strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in? Portugal</strong></p>
<p><strong>Router brand &amp; model number: Netgear CBVG834G</strong></p>
<p><strong>Network Connection Type: Tried both</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is UPnP Enabled? No but I also tried and it did nothing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is NAT Type Open? Usually yes</strong></p>
<p><strong>What type of internet do you have? Optic fiber</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)?&nbsp;ZON</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" what is the exact message shown on screen? A problem ocurred when signing in.Then I press for more info and it says that my console is connected to the Internet but can´t contact Xbox Live.</strong></p>
<p>The few times I can connect it disconnects some minutes later.It started happening since the update and I already erased it and downloaded it again.Some days before the update though,I was already receiving the message that a problem ocurred while signing
 in but I always managed to connect and play well,with an occasional freezing of the console.I also noticed that since last week,it took a lot longer for the console to connect to LIVE.I´ve also been having some problems on my pc,some sites are very slow,like
 the xbox foruns for example.That´s why I don´t know for sure if the problem is with my router but I have the router firewall turned off and I followed the steps to open the ports on the port forwarding section.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>Hey mate, the easiest way to determine if the issue is with your router is to bypass it entirely, by wiring your Xbox 360 console to the modem. Don't forget--you'll need to power-cycle your modem when you do so by unplugging it!</p>

    <title>Re-upgrade to Windows 10 on HP laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nobody-important  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-upgrade to Windows 10 on HP laptop</h2>
                    <p>I accepted the free upgrade offer to Windows 10 before the offer expired. At the time, HP's drivers were awful and/or unavailable on HP's website. I returned to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at HP's website today and saw that most of the drivers are available. I thought the rule was that if a PC was ever upgraded, Microsoft servers remembered the event and would allow a subsequent attempt. Can I upgrade again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this was a desktop, I could download a current ISO from Microsoft's website and install it. But this is an HP laptop, so would that work?</p>

            Hi nobody-important , you can go back to Windows 10 any time you like, you will not need a Product Key, and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Correcting an entry in Windows 10 Mail Address Book</h2>
                    I have a very strange issue with the Windows 10 Mail Address Book (People). I made an error in an entry (reversed two numbers). I selected Edit and corrected the entry. Then when I entered the first letter in a new email, BOTH addresses appeared and I
 had to choose the correct one. So I deleted the person's name entirely. Now when I enter the initial,
<em>both </em>names and addresses still appear!<br />
Is this just a glitch in the Windows 10 Mail program? Or is there some way to make only the correct address pop up? (If I were to delete ALL entries, would they still be there

            I don't think that People is a store app. In any case, synching the list from People and from the server's address list still does not remove the old, corrected, email address. It is a mystery and very frustrating. Other names in the People list can be
 changed or deleted from there or from the server. This is the exception. I enter the first initial--and both the new amended address and the old uncorrected one pop up. Not so when addressing an email on the server site. Surely someone knows how to remove
 this phantom entry!<br />

            If it is only occasional, then it could be automatically scheduled restarts to install Windows updates. &nbsp;You could check to see if installation of updates does coincide with when the restarts have occurred.

<p>The issue seems to be that ME3 is, at random, replacing the .gpd file in your gamer profile with a fresh copy.<br />
<br />
For those who don't know, every game you play adds a .gpd file to your gamer profile. That is why it gets larger as you play more games. This file can contain many things, such as preferences, what missions you have unlocked, etc. But it always contains the
 text and icons for achievements. <br />
<br />
When the file is reset for ME3, your currently unlocked achievements, which are stored in a separate file, are preserved, but any progress you have made towards other achievements, along with all bonus powers that you have unlocked, are reset, as that data
 is stored solely in the .gpd file. That file also stores things like your control settings, which is why those are going back to default.<br />
<br />
I suspect that this issue has something to do with the process of connecting to the EA servers. The login info for your EA account is also stored in the .gpd file, and it is accessed immediately when the game starts up. (side note: anyone notice how long it
 takes to log in to those servers? Compare that to ME2, which also connects to EA servers at launch....)<br />

Its been reported many times on the BioWare forums - if any devs are working for a fix, nobody knows. All you could really do is add your name/post to that BSN thread &amp; hope they sort something out. Its happened to my mate about 4 times now too.</p>

<p>Had a similar experience, luckily I had most of the game completed by then anyway. It did force me to load my 1st run again and re-complete before I could unlock the long haul achievement but otherwise I got off lightly. I do know someone who had over 4k
 kills only to get it reset though which kinda sucks.</p>
<p>Hope they fix it soon.</p>

<h2>            &#39;Unidentified Network&#39; after every reboot with Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi guys, <br />
<br />
There seems to be a lot of people with this issue and a myriad of suggestions on how to fix it. I have no had any luck.
<br />
So far I have tried everything, including this pretty extensive list here (excluding those of 'method III' which I am working through): http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/windows-7-loses-my-network-and-becomes-an/7b305de9-3793-4c32-b9da-a1f83d6a57b2<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Ultimate and my network card is a Asus USB-N13 which has up to date drivers.
<br />
As the title indicates the issue of 'Unidentified Network' occurs every time I restart the computer. Interestingly when when the computer 'connects' to my wireless network but is on an 'unidentified network' my router does not see it. Not totally sure what
 to make of this.<br />
<br />
If it helps two temporary fixes I have found iinclude: <br />
<div>Resetting the TCP/IP stack by doing the following (taken from http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/homegroup-network-disappeared-on-desktop-replaced/258ca60f-d2bf-41f5-a37a-ff391d64e0d2)<br />
</div>
<div><br />
a.&nbsp;Click on <strong>start </strong>button, type <strong>cmd</strong>.<br />
b.&nbsp;Now in the search result right-click on <strong>cmd.exe</strong> and select<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.<br />
c.&nbsp;Enter the following commands, one at a time, and press enter:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>ipconfig /flushdns<br />
nbtstat -R<br />
nbtstat -RR<br />
netsh int reset all<br />
netsh int ip reset <br />
netsh winsock reset<br />
</strong><br />
d.&nbsp;Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
As well as deleting the network, uninstalling the network driver and restarting the computer.
<br />
<br />
The above fixes have to be reapplied the next time I turn on the computer though.<br />
<br />
This issue is particularly annoying for me as I planned to use the computer as a headless server but I can not connect to it remotely due to this issue.<br />
Any help would be appreciated. Cheers.<br />

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
I recommend that you uninstall the new driver you installed by either going into device manager and rolling back the driver or doing a system restore back to before you installed the new driver.<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
<br />
Click Finish.<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need additional help.<br />
Thank you,<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, please answer the following questions:<br />
1. By "customize icon", do you mean the options for minimizing, maximizing and closing at the top right of the window?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps below to display two windows/documents on the monitor and check if it helps.</p>
1. Open the <strong>windows </strong>or <strong>documents </strong>you want to split across the screen.
<br />
2. <strong>Hover </strong>your cursor to&nbsp; the <strong>topmost </strong>part of the open window on your screen.<br />
3. <strong>Hold down </strong>the <strong>left mouse button </strong>and drag the window all the way over to the
<strong>left/right&nbsp; edge </strong>of your screen. It will automatically resize to take up the&nbsp; half of your screen.<br />
4. <strong>Repeat </strong>the same with the other window/document.<br />
5. Each app/window will now take up 50 percent of the screen.<br />
6. <strong>Tap </strong>and <strong>hold </strong>the <strong>black vertical line
</strong>that splits the two windows and drag it to the left or right to make the window/document you want to view larger or smaller.<br />
<br />
In addition to snapping windows to the left or right half of the screen, you can also snap windows to four quadrants of the screen. This will give you a bit more flexibility when working with multiple applications.
<p>When you drag a window to the left or right, just move it towards a corner, and you'll see an animated transparent outline of the window fill out the quadrant. As soon as you release the mouse button, the window will snap to that position.<br />
<br />
You can also use the Windows key. When a windows is on the left or right half of the screen, just press Windows + Up Arrow to move it to the upper quadrant. Press Windows + Down Arrow to move it to the lower quadrant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with the result. We will be glad to help if you need further assistance.

<p>Hi Carolina</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you do not call any phone number at all and or contact them at any cost. In the meantime, could you please take a screenshot of the error/pop-up that you are receiving. I would also recommend to run Windows Defender to see if it can scan and
 remove or isolate the piece of software that is in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, do not contact anyone and especially do not give out any information about yourself and or your machine.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Thanks, Rohit, for your reply. The problem still persists even I press "Store Default" as you have suggested. here are the screenshots leading to the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: click "Restore Default" and click "Apply". Then, click "Yes" to create a new SkyDrive folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92398d9c-56c7-4302-9878-7bb3268826eb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Click "No" to allow the system move nothing to the new folder.</p>

            <p>I don't know what the reason for a 'internal system error' would be, but Win7 has DX9,10 &amp; 11.</p>
<p>However, a clean install of Win7 is missing some files that were released after the release of Win7.World of Warships would be using one of the later DX9 files.</p>
<p>These files would be in the <em>DX Redist (June 2010)</em> installer, which I gather you are having a problem with, but
</p>
<p>if you run the <em>DirectX Web Installer</em> it will install any missing files as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Web Installer displays a message that your DX is up to date there is a possibility of a corrupt file or files.</p>
<p>In this instance using the DX Redist (June 2010) installer is the better option as it overwrites all DX files.</p>
<p>Note that this installer first unpacks the files to a folder of your choice ( a folder on the desktop is good, but</p>
<p>do not unpack the files to Windows or System32) You then need to run the <em>DXSETUP.exe</em></p>
<p>that can be found in that folder. Once the install is finalised you can delete this folder.</p>

<p>
</p><p>- If you continue having problems try reinstalling DX from <em>Safe Mode.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- You could also try installing wile running in <em>Clean Boot.</em> Clean Boot can also help identify conflicts</p>
<p>with <em>Services</em> or <em>Startup</em> programs which may prevent DX from installing or prevent the game from launching.</p>
<p>- Disabling your Anti-virus may also help. AV's are known for causing problems from time to time.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You could also try repairing any corrupt DX files by running System File Checker - sfc /scannow.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- I also see a shortcut for Intel drivers. Which Intel HD graphics processor does your machine use ?</p>
<p>Older Intel GMA graphics (the 'on board' chip vs the newer Intel HD which is part of the cpu) may not be
</p>
<p>capable of running this game. This can also generate a DirectX error.</p>
<p>Similarly, I believe that an inadequate cpu or RAM may result in a DX error, depending on the game in question.</p>
