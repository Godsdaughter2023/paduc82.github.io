<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in Automatic Repair boot cycle even after reinstall.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometime last week I turned my PC on to an automatic Windows update. I left the room to let it finish, but came back about an hour later to a blue recovery screen saying "It looks like Windows didn't load correctly". So I tried restarting a couple of
 times which didn't help and eventually triggered Automatic Recovery. I've gone through and tried every option available to no prevail as I've never created a backup image or a restore point and in the terminal, all the commands lead to an error, unable to
 complete, or access denied message.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't really have anything of importance on the PC, so I eventually kicked the bucket and reset my PC, which did nothing. I've removed the CMOS battery and reset the BIOS, washed the HDD, and reinstalled Windows multiple times. Doing so allowed me
 to log onto to a fully functioning desktop that restarts after a few minutes and sends me back into the Automatic Recovery loop again. There were a few times where Windows was able to reboot successfully only for the desktop to restart almost immediately after
 I log in. I've done pretty much everything I can think of and everything I could find on Google and a bunch of forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If it helps, I'm using a OEM version of Windows 10 I bought off of Amazon.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My PC is custom built with following specs:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; AMD FX-8350 processor</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ASUS M5A 78L-M USB3 mobo<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kingston HyperX 8gb DDR3 RAM<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1tb WD Blue HDD<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; EVGA GTX 750 ti 2GB GPU</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; EVGA 450BT Bronze 80 plus PSU</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My PC also has a optical drive if that means anything. The cooler is the Cryorig M9a. I re-pasted the CPU and GPU a month ago with Kryonaut so thermals are in check. First time posting on the forums, but I think this counts as a question.</p>

            Hi Epseit.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with preferably bootable diagnostics long test:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />I recommend Seatools bootable long test:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Then do a Diagnostic Install:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Install each group of Updates, program and settings change with plenty of time in between to observe performance changes.  Set regular System Restore points and take periodic images so you can go back when you find the failure cause:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Camera App Crashing and Freezing LifeCam Studio Webcam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> njphist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera App Crashing and Freezing LifeCam Studio Webcam</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft LifeCam Studio attached to my custom built PC (Intel Core i7 extreme 975 @3.33GHz, 12Gb RAM). I'm running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Version 1709, OS Build 16299.214).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I launch the camera app, it displays a decent moment briefly then scrambles and freezes. The camera/microphone no longer functions after that until I restart the PC. This is a persistent issue. The built-in microphone pics up sound at all times
 (I can access Cortana) but as soon as the camera app is started it "kills" both camera and mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is up to date, as are the latest versions of all drivers (graphics cards etc.), so too is the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve this?</p>

<p>Hardware support, including but not limited to any drivers and other software, comes from the hardware manufacturer.&nbsp; Microsoft did not make your Palm Zire m150 - so they don't support it.&nbsp; ;-)<br />

            Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;Windows update is fine, no Google chrome is my default browser just like before. &nbsp;No I did a clean purchased install of Windows 8 Pro from a dvd. &nbsp;I have discussed the problem with an IT at work and I guess I need to reinstall Windows
 8 again to resolve the problem. &nbsp;I installed a new ssd and it works great, I purchased a new cpu for my board at the same time but was sent the wrong socket. &nbsp;So while I was waiting on the new one (P not M socket), I installed the ssd and Windows 8. &nbsp;I guess
 now that the correct cpu is in, &nbsp;reinstalling Windows to regain my usage rights for my Zune pass is the only option, especially since I don't want the new non "keep 10 songs a month" version. &nbsp;

            <p>Tip =&gt; Try re-asserting Internet Explorer as your default Browser then reboot &amp; test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most MS&nbsp;applications (e.g., Zune; Windows [Live] Essentials; Hotmail; Outlook.com, etc.) will only be "happy" when IE is the default -
<em>especially</em> when DRM is involved.</p>

            Yes I already tried internet explorer but the only way I could get Zune to work properly was to reload a clean install of windows 8 from the disc, then redownload zune software and then restore both my subscription and purchase history. &nbsp;Of course this
 did not bring back everything, but I will just have to download what was missing again. &nbsp;This was the only thing I could do in the time frame I had available. &nbsp;It seems that there is a problem since xbox is now the default pass menu now for us old zune pass
 (ten songs keep) with windows 8 having my account sync to work ....if I change it, I won't have this option anymore. &nbsp;Thanks for your help.

            <b>Media Center, Zune Destop Player, and Windows Media Player Windows 7/8 DRM Reset Success!!!</b><br />
<br />
This is for anyone getting the dreaded "Video playback device does not support playback of protected content" on Windows 7 or Windows 8 Media Center. One way to determine if your problem is a common DRM incompatibility is if that message appears, but you can
 minimize and then maximize Media Center to make the TV play, then this should work for you.<br />
<br />
After hours of searching and trying every possible combination or steps from various FAQs and trial/error, I have finally found the set of steps that will reset DRM on both versions of Windows Media Center.<br />
<br />
You must do this with an administrator account and Media Center closed.<br />
<br />
<b>3-key takeaways relative to other FAQs for those who have attempted this before</b>.<br />
a) no need to manually rename or delete files in the DRM folder<br />
b) no need to use the Microsoft DRM web page - it won't work with Windows 8 at all and is not required for Windows 7/8<br />
c) ResetDRM must be extracted and run manually<br />
<br />
<b>1)</b> Under control panel / folder options / view note your current settings and then<br />
a) enable show hidden files, folders or drives<br />
b) disable hide protected operating systems<br />
<br />
<b>2)</b> Apply control panel changes but leave window open to reset at the end<br />
<br />
<b>3)</b> Open control panel / administrative tools / services and select "Windows Media Center Receiver Service". Stop the service<br />
<br />
<b>4)</b> With Windows explorer remove the following files / folders<br />
a) C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\PlayReady\mspr.hds<br />
b) C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\PlayReady\cache<br />
c) C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome\mcendindiv.hds<br />
d) C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome\cache<br />
<br />
<b>NOTE: </b>I just renamed the above items A thru D <i>(i.e. Example: mspr.hds to mspr.hds.org and if it was a folder I just named Cache to Orgcache)</i>. Then returned them to there proper original name when I got done.<br />
<br />
I only needed to get my Zune Player to (i.e Play DRM Protected Music again and Download from Zune Market Place), and Windows Media Player to play DRM Music again after I replaced my motherboard and CPU running Windows 8 Pro with Windows Media Center.<br />
<br />
If you want to delete the files and folders above as per the original instructions that's entirely up to you.<b><br />
<br />
5)</b> Download ResetDRM.exe from <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=105000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=105000</a><br />
<br />
<b>Important</b> The ResetDRM tool deletes all existing Windows Media DRM licenses and Zune DRM licenses on your current installation of Windows 7/8. The ResetDRM tool should
<i>only</i> be used if all Windows Media DRM and Zune DRM content playback is nonfunctional. After the following process is complete, you have to reacquire DRM licenses for your Windows 7/8-based computer.<br />
<br />
<b>6)</b> Use winrar or winzip to extract files from ResetDRM.exe (ADVPACK.DLL CleanDRM.exe resetdrm.inf) to a temp folder. ResetDRM will not run by itself on Windows 8 in any compatibility mode so you MUST extract it.<br />
<br />
<b>7)</b> Use explorer to find cmd.exe at C:\Windows\System32<br />
<br />
<b>8 )</b> Right click on cmd.exe and "run as administrator"<br />
<br />
<b>9)</b> cd to the temp folder where you extracted ResetDRM.exe<br />
<br />
<b>10)</b> Run <b>CleanDRM.exe -v </b>. A text window will open after a few seconds and verify that several files were removed. If there is an error that a resource could not be opened for exclusive access, you might need to reboot and try again after making
 sure that Media Center does not start automatically<br />
<br />
<b>11)</b> exit cmd.exe<br />
<br />
<p><b>12)</b> <b>IMPOTANT:</b>&nbsp; Now you have to upgrade your security components again. Right click on Internet Explorer and run as Administrator. Go to the web address below and&nbsp; upgrade your security components, click the
<b>Upgrade</b> button.&nbsp; The button should <b>NOT</b> be grayed out. You must use Internet Explorer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Firefox, Opera, Chrome, etc.. won't work.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp?force=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp?force=1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Note:</b> When you click Upgrade, your computer will connect to a Microsoft-operated Internet site and send information about your digital media player, including a unique hardware identifier. No information will be sent that can be used to personally identify
 you or track your activities. Microsoft will then upgrade the security components of your digital media player to ensure that it runs with optimal security.
<br />
<br />
<b>13)</b> open Media Center<br />
<br />
<b>14)</b> navigate to settings / TV / TV Signal / Update PlayReady<br />
<br />
<b>15)</b> if Update PlayReady fails:<br />
a) minimize Media Center without closing it<br />
b) stop the Media Center Receiver service again<br />
c) maximize Media Center<br />
d) "try again" to update PlayReady<br />
<br />
<b>16)</b> PlayReady should show a success page<br />
<br />
<b>17)</b> go to TV Guide and attempt to watch a show<br />
<br />
<b>18)</b> if everything went properly, you should be able to watch live TV<br />
<br />
<b>19 )</b> go back to control panel / folders and return the hidden/system file settings back to your original options<br />
<br />
Please leave feedback if I missed anything or if you have suggestions to make this list more complete. There are countless posts about Windows DRM issues so hopefully this helps people out.<br />

    <title>Karaoke for the Daughter, on Xbox One&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Karaoke for the Daughter, on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My daughter loves to sing, and I want to get a karaoke machine for her, for Christmas. However, we recently got an Xbox, and I'm curious if there is any way to play a karaoke CD (I think their format is CD+G) on the Xbox? (and getting a mic goes without saying).&nbsp;</p><p>I know there are karaoke games like Just Sing, We Sing, and Now That's What I Call Sing, but they all include their music tracks. I want something where we can play our audio CDs (like the various Disney karaoke series).</p><p>Can I just put a karaoke CD in and play? Do I need a particular app or program like&nbsp;Xbox Music Mixer (if that's still usable on the Xbox One)?</p><p>Thanks</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

<p>This question is a bit more complex than is handled in these consumer forums, I'd suggest heading over to the TechNet forums where the IT Pro crowd hangs out, they'd likely know if this can be recovered.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for answers.</p>
<p>I use Windows VIsta 32bit.</p>
<p>The problem have appeared when I instaled MSE. MSE cannot update too.</p>
<p>Kasperski Internet Security (full version)&nbsp;and McAfee (pre installed) has been instaled on the computer. Only Windows firewall works on the computer.</p>
<p>My internet provider said there is no server proxy. I donot know what to do?</p>

<p>Had your Kaspersky subscription already expired by the time you installed MSE?</p>

<p>Have you ever downloaded/run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?</p>
<p>Neither Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1)&nbsp;nor Vista SP2 is installed, correct?</p>

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my nfs share was exported by my centos os.</p>
<p>and I refer the doc to mount the nfs share by nfs client on my windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sfu/2009/03/27/can-i-set-up-user-name-mapping-in-windows-vista/</p>

<p>mount nfs share successfully and permission acccess are all right&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On windows 10 version 1809</p>
<p>mount nfs share successfully, but permission access is not correctly set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after some investigation, I find with win 10 version 1809, despite what I set&nbsp;<span>AnonymousUid</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>AnonymousGid
 in the regedit under&nbsp;</span></p>

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\Default

</p><p>Unfortunately, due&nbsp;to ongoing changes, unlinking of Skype and Microsoft accounts is currently unavailable. I can understand that you're used to having skype separated with Microsoft. However, as you know Skype is now a program being owned by Microsoft and
 the main reason why you are unable to unlink the separate Skype account to Microsoft is to align Skype's usages and policy with Microsoft as a part of our One Microsoft Program.</p>

            I use XBOX One and I use Skype. But for some reason my SKYPE account in XBOX is not the same as the one I log into on the desktop version. Therefore I do not have all of my contacts and settings. How can i get the XBOX to forget my incorrect SKYPE name
 and account and use the one I am using on my desktop? I have just followed the "close my account settings" in Skype but it actually closes MS account as well and then I lose access to my XBOX as well. Who can help me? Should &nbsp;just create a new account in XBOX?
 Im sure ive tried that already and it "autolinked" me back into the incorrect account again. Oh yeah... All instructions say to "UNLINK" Micorsoft account in settings but I mine only says "LINKED" with no unlink option.

            I need to change my Microsoft account that is linked to skype to my new office365 account. Unlinking and re-linking would have been an option. So how about offering a "change Microsoft account" alternative instead of just discontinuing the unlinking option?

<p>Of course we have further concerns. It's like watching fireman going home at the end of their shift while the building is still burning and hearing them say to the people still stuck in the building, sorry, our shift is now over, but if you have further

<h2>            Piant 3d Crash and little black squares</h2>
                    HI, I found this same topic posted already to the community but that was on my mobile device, now I'm on my Laptop trying to participate and cant find the question within the community.&nbsp; Its pretty deep and complex so I'm probably just overlooking something.&nbsp;
 I have ran the troubleshoot and saved the project as a new project and still was unable to get rid of the little black squares covering what was suppose to be a white capsule 3d object.&nbsp; I copied another capsule and readjusted it and deleted the affected capsule
 so I'm good, but What's the issue am I doing something wrong? Also I'm running Win10 from a 64 gb USB flash drive and it takes a long time to save and open my paint 3d projects.&nbsp; Can I do anything to increase this performance?&nbsp; Like allocate more resources
 because I'm running Win 10 on a Mac from a USB drive.

            Hi Everyonesdead2,
<br />
<br />I would suggest checking the read and write speeds of your USB device, as this can be easily the bottleneck you are experiencing. The following article you can find how to properly test for the speed of the USB drive. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2455205/test-the-speed-of-your-usb-drives.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2455205/test-th...</a>
<br />
<br />Also if the USB speed is the problem, check if your Mac has a Thunderbolt port and check if it's on budget to get a thunderbolt external hard drive or external SSD.

            <p><strong><span>Hi John,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Blue Screen errors also known as the Blue Screen of Death are STOP errors that hinder the functioning of an Operating
 System. You receive a blue screen error on the Windows XP computer. </span><span>It can be difficult when something that is important to you does not work as expected. It is pretty simple and
 we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Please answer these questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>
</span></span></span><span>What are the troubleshooting steps performed by you?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>
</span></span></span><span>Have you installed any new hardware or software on the computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Blue screen error that you receive is known to be caused due to a virus infection. I will be suggesting few troubleshooting
 steps that would help you remove the virus.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><i><span>Note: Assuming that you are unable to boot to the desktop, I would have you perform the troubleshooting
 steps.</span></i></p>
<p><span>I would have you disconnect all the external devices connected to the computer apart from the keyboard
 and the mouse. Now, try to boot the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, then proceed to Method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span>Try logging into Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
To start the computer in safe mode

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you get the computer back to Normal mode after performing the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try the Last Known Good Configuration on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
To start the computer using the last known good configuration

<p><span>Make sure you back up the data on the computer before proceeding further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3-</span></p>
<p><i>Note:
<span>&nbsp;</span></i><i><span>Assuming that you are able to boot to the desktop, I would have you refer the articles-</span></i></p>

<h2>            In Windows 10 How to retain files and folders after search is completed</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 and I'm searching for something that I have on the had drive and the search is completed with a list of the results, how can I keep the list from disappearing after I selecting one file/folder to examine like Windows 7.</p>
<p>I must be doing something wrong or not aware what to do in Windows 10.</p>
<p>In Windows 7 after the search was completed, I would click on something (I can't remember what it was) and a&nbsp; large screen would open with all of the file and folders saved. There must be away to do the same thing in Windows 10 but I haven't found how to
 do it and it's very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can some one please help me. It's probably simple but I haven't found it.</p>

            <p>Try the Search and Index troubleshooter.</p>
<p><span><span>Here&nbsp;is the steps to run the trouble shooter:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type “Troubleshooting” without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.</span></li><li><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select “View all” option from the left panel.</span></li><li><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select “Search and Indexing”.</span></li><li><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If still the same then, go ahead and use Windows 7. Windows 10 OS is for the people who changes and ready to adapt with the new generation.</span></span></p>

                    <p>How do I upgrade from Windows XP Professional /Windows Vista Capable? Would upgrading be done incrementally or from XP to ?? that I can use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is an old Dell, donated by a local charity, and is equipped with Word. I was using it, with no problem, but ignored the "warnings" I was receiving about not having Microsoft support after a certain period. Then, one day, I was shut out completely.
 What can I do, how fast, and how much!?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Just because Microsoft stopped supporting XP doesn't mean you can't use it.</p>
<p>There is another reason why it stopped working; whatever it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support for Vista has also ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check at Dell's website to see what operating systems (Drivers provided) they offer for your exact Dell Model Number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on the hardware requirements of later operating systems and also&nbsp;whether the computer/laptop manufacturer supports and supplies drivers for the later operating systems as to whether it is possible or feasible to upgrade or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no free upgrade from&nbsp;XP to Vista,&nbsp;7, 8.1 or 10.</p>
<p>Forget about Vista as the extended support for Vista SP2&nbsp;ended&nbsp;in&nbsp;April, 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you buy Windows 7; extended support Windows 7 SP1&nbsp;until January 14, 2020 .</p>
<p>Microsoft no longer sells 7; try amazon.com.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Based on your reply, should I hire someone to do the upgrade? Everything I know about a computer I taught myself. I have owned a computer since 1996, and have done quite a bit of minor "touch up" myself. But, now that I am getting older my patience is not
 so long. I will try, but I will need to print your answer and study it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What caught my eye is that something else might be amiss since it will not boot up. I will check, again. I just know it shut down one day, and I thought it was because the OS was no longer supported. Hmm!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good part about this is that I have an external hard drive that has stored what I need, BUT, I am hesitant about touching it because the external hard drive was also connected once to the HP Pavilion that is sitting here with a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I won't waste anyone's time. I will see what I can do. I am working on getting some funds to hire a tech to come in and help me with my several computers and their problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so very frustrated at this point, but I do appreciate your response and I am going to try...</p>

            I'm back!!&nbsp; One more time with one more "thank you"!! I am so very glad you suggested that the OS might not be the problem.&nbsp; It wasn't!! Earlier today, I turned on the computer, and got nothing...just a black screen. So, I started pushing buttons, and
 finally held down the "on" button and noticed some writing (a sentence or two) appeared at the top of the black screen. I could not read it because it flashed on and off so fast, but I did see "F-1." So, I pressed on F-1, remembering from way back when, all
 the different F-&nbsp; (numbers) I had used to troubleshoot. Never one to back down from a problem, I was determined to find the culprit. The hard drive sits on the back of the monitor on this model, and I have not used it in over a year, at least, thinking it
 was shot because I had not upgraded the OS. Thanks to you, I knew I would need to check further. I did, and to my surprise (or chagrin), I remembered there was a disc drive. Hmm! I pressed until it opened, and there inside was a CD... I don't remember ever
 having seen it but was so glad to have seen it then!!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right this moment, it is on; the screen saver is up, but there was a note for me to check out regarding the OS. I went to find a mouse. I think I will put this on the back burner until tomorrow morning. I must print out all your directions for upgrading to
 try to successfully upgrade the OS.&nbsp; I am so very happy that I have access to this computer!!&nbsp; I am a writer of sorts, and I have a lot of stuff I've written stored on that machine. Since it's not been working, I have purchased a laptop, and two HP Streams
 (are the considered laptops?). The laptop is out of commission; just stopped one day. It was running Win10, along with the two Streams. I gave a Stream to my 13 y/o grandson for his birthday in February. I am trying very hard to work on this Stream I kept.
 A question about it will be my next venture here. I've already discovered it has no disc drive. SMH<br />
<br />
Again, thank you!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Minecraft Windows 10 Refuses to Install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Refuses to Install</h2>
                    I recently redeemed a code for Minecraft, the windows 10 version. Upon attempting to install Minecraft to my PC I am greeted with the following message: "Installing on your devices:&nbsp;<span>To download to your Xbox, it must
 be on or set to Instant-on, with automatic updates and purchases on, and have enough space." My installation has nothing to do with my Xbox, I click the 3 dots next to install, select install to 'My PC's Name' and then install now which prompts the previously
 mentioned message to pop up. This procedure is not linked to any form of communication with my Xbox which makes the error message confusing. Any advice is appreciated, thanks in advance guys.</span>
