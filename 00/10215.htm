<h2>            Mail Merge into shapes vs. letters or labels</h2>
                    Is it possible to merge data into a shape, such as a star?&nbsp; If so, what process would I use?&nbsp; I would like to print a sheet(s) of stars with different data in each one.&nbsp; The data is in an excel spreadsheet right now.

<p>It depends on exactly what you mean.</p>
<p>In essence, merge is probably always going to merge into a rectangular area. So, if you need to merge onto (e.g.) label stationery with stars, it might be difficult to make the text fit the star.</p>
<p>If you just want to pick an autoshape and merge into that, then</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. again, a rectangular piece of text will likely overlap the star (unless it's a big star!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. you can select the shape, click Add text, and then you can insert text and field codes as in normal text. You may find it easier to add field codes by using ctrl-F9 to insert the special "{}", then insert everything else in the usual way</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. I'd do that for one copy of the shape, then duplicate it as many times as you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. however, you then have the problem that these shapes are in the graphics layer and the merge fields generally take the same value (i.e. you cannot get { NEXT } fields to work). I think the only reasonably simple workaround for that is to organise that
 your data source has enough data for the entire page in each row. So for example, if you have 8 stars per page, and you want 1 field in each star, then you would need an eight-column sheet with the following columns (for example):</p>
<p><span>star1data, star2data,...,star8data</span></p>
<p><span>So you would then need to modify the field code in each star so that the first has</span></p>
<p><span>{ MERGEFIELD star1data }</span></p>
<p><span>the second has</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>{ MERGEFIELD star2data }</span></p>
</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;and so on.</span></p>

            <p>Got the same when I added the Hungarian keyboard or Hungarian keyboard 101. Showing the on screen keyboard the alt key does not show any difference. Pressing alt in Windows just wants to do the menu's for me. Looking at
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_alphabet#Keyboard_layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_alphabet#Keyboard_layout</a></p>
<p>noticed alt-gr and that does as expected (but not the combinations you mention) and on screen keyboard shows that as well.</p>
<p>I am sure you know more about Hungarian keyboards than me! is yours a standard Hungarian keyboard? did it have a different driver previous versions of Windows?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually neither AltGr or Alt worked.... I tried to find a solution, but could not , so I rolled back to Windows 8.1. I will wait at least 6 months before I give a try to Windows10</p>

<h2>            Disabling notifications in web portal</h2>
                    <p>We upgraded our subscription from E1 to E3.&nbsp; Every time I load the admin portal page, I get multiple notifications about my (intentionally) expired E1 subscription.&nbsp; Despite clicking on these notifications, they persist.&nbsp; This wouldn't be as annoying except
 for the "bong" sound <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>every time</strong></span> that an admin page is loaded.</p>
<p>For my sanity, please tell me how I can make this stop!&nbsp; A quick search of the forums indicates that many others have experienced this as far back as 2012.&nbsp; Is there hope?</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After accidently unlinking my microcroft account, I rejoined the Insider Program two days ago but it does not show I am participating on the update page. Going to the advanced options does not provide any options as to the rejoining the fast program. In
 a nutshell, Microsoft acknowledged my participation but it does translate on my PC. I am current stuck on build 14366. Please advice. Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hello David,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The Windows Update database is corrupted.</span></li><li><span>Antivirus software is configured to scan the %Windir%\SoftwareDistribution folder.</span></li><li><span>The Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) service does not receive a content link header.</span></li><li><span>A required system file is registered incorrectly.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Please follow the methods mentioned below and see if it helps to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
<span>I suggest you to run the&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong><span>&nbsp;it will automatically fix some common problems installing updates and check if it helps to resolve the issue. Click the below link:</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, try the below method and check if it helps or not:</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Updates
 quickly. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Press&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Key + X</strong><span>&nbsp;on the keyboard and then select “<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)”</strong>&nbsp;from the menu.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Stop the&nbsp;</span><strong>BITS, Cryptographic</strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><strong>MSI Installer</strong><span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update Services</strong><span>.
 To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “</span><strong>ENTER</strong><span>” key after you type each command.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Now rename the&nbsp;</span><strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>Catroot2</strong><span>&nbsp;folder. You can do this by typing the following
 commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “</span><strong>ENTER</strong><span>” key after you type each command.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>ren &lt;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old&gt;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ren &lt;C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old&gt;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Now, let’s restart the&nbsp;</span><strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong><span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update Services</strong><span>. Type
 the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the&nbsp;</span><strong>ENTER</strong><span>&nbsp;key after you type each command.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net start bits&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Type<strong>&nbsp;Exit</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;</span><strong>Command Prompt</strong><span>&nbsp;to close it and then restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Hello Nachappa C K. ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running build 14366 on ASUS laptop x64 and when i go to settings/update, the results are that it is up to date (no errors). When i go to settings/update/windows insider program, i can't link a Microsoft account at all although i know i am enrolled. I
 found that i joined using the wrong Microsoft account along the way, however the previously used Microsoft account was deleted in December 2015. I was able to join the program using the the account that i thought was deleted but that did not fix the problem
 either. Currently i am enrolled by both. I am quite frustrated about it all and am thinking about giving up since i have tried every remedy offered by the Community. Will just waiting for the Anniversary Update fix the problem? Please help. Thank you for your
 reply.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 drivers for older PCs and Laptops</h2>
                    <p>Hello there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the announcement that Windows 10 will be<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> free for the 1st year for Windows 7 &amp; 8</a>, which is great news, it raised a question with me.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who will be responsible for providing drivers for all the PCs and Laptops etc. out there for Windows 10? I ask this specifically because most manufacturers of PCs and Laptops will only release drivers for their hardware for the current OS of the time, and
 if you are lucky, they may release drivers for the following OS. But what about Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>People, such as myself,&nbsp;who have purchased a laptop or PC when Windows 7 first came out do not have the option to obtain drivers for anything past Windows 7 from their manufacturer. Heck, I can't even get Windows 8.1 drivers for&nbsp;my laptop. Only Windows 7
 drivers are offered and Windows 8.1 freezes all the time on my older&nbsp;laptop that was released with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft will be offering a free upgrade&nbsp;from Windows 7 to 10, then is Microsoft providing those drivers or are they relying on the PC and laptop manufacturers for those drivers? Generic drivers for most hardware may be sufficient, but never work as
 well as drivers specifically written for a piece of hardware and OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the mindset of the manufacturers as well.... Why would they bother to invest the time and money for writing drivers for an old laptop or PC originally made in 2009? The simple answer is they won't because it costs too much and they want
 people to buy a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non technical people who know little to nothing about drivers would simply say "oh, a free upgrade to Windows 10,&nbsp;I'm in.", and blindly upgrade not even knowing if their hardware is going to work or not with Windows 10, and if it doesn't work or has issues
 with freezing,&nbsp;then Microsoft is going to take the heat because in&nbsp;the users mind, Microsoft released another crappy OS. I personally like Microsoft products for the most part but feel that this driver issue needs to be handled carefully as to avoid another
 Millennium, Vista , or even Windows 8 debacle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

</p><p>This is always a concern for users who are upgrading to a new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an older Dell Inspiron N5110 Laptop as one of my test systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far it has been running every build of the Technical Preview without the need to update any hardware drivers.</p>

</p><p>Keeping mu fingers crossed that this will continue into the final version.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10 uses the same driver model as Windows 8.1 and Windows 7. So if your PC can run Vista or later, the same drivers are likely to work. Also, Microsoft releases driver updates through Windows Update too. So existing drivers will work and manufacturers
 will release drivers too, even if Windows 10 is free. Not because Windows 10 is free for existing PCs mean PC manufacturers are not going to pre-load it on new computers when it launches later this year.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>People, such as myself,&nbsp;who have purchased a laptop or PC when Windows 7 first came out do not have the option to obtain drivers for anything past Windows 7 from their manufacturer.
</p>
<p><strong>Normally those same Windows 7 drivers will work or you will be able to obtain updated drivers through Windows Update. For instance, my HP Z210 did not have any native Windows 10 drivers for the Intel HD Graphics and the existing one did not work,
 but I was able to get an updated driver through Windows update. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Heck, I can't even get Windows 8.1 drivers for&nbsp;my laptop. Only Windows 7 drivers are offered and Windows 8.1 freezes all the time on my older&nbsp;laptop that was released with Windows 7.</p>
<p><strong>Did you run Windows Update? Did you try installing existing Windows 7 drivers using Compatibility mode?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/using-compatibility-mode-in-windows-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/using-compatibility-mode-in-windows-8-1/</a>

<p><strong>Microsoft does not develop drivers, but they will likely rely on PC manufacturers update drivers and have them delivered through Windows Update. The success of Windows 10 depends on it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the mindset of the manufacturers as well.... Why would they bother to invest the time and money for writing drivers for an old laptop or PC originally made in 2009? The simple answer is they won't because it costs too much and they want

<p><strong>If that were the case, then there would be chaos, Microsoft has a close relationship with OEMs and ODMs, ISVs and IHVs and works closely with industry to ensure that it provides updates for systems beyond releases that might be supported by the manufacturer.

            <p>Hello everyone and thanks for your responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is really&nbsp;about the issue with Microsoft relying on manufacturers to update their hardware drivers for Windows 10 when we know many manufacturers do not update at all after a year or so of a products release.&nbsp;Also, my point is about&nbsp;the casual Windows
 user without any technical skills taking&nbsp;on the free upgrade themselves and then finding quickly thereafter&nbsp;that in trying to make things better, they now have a broken machine. This will look very bad for Microsoft in the eyes of those users having trouble.
 Who is going to fix all those machines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andre is correct in saying that this would be chaos if&nbsp;manufacturers didn't update the drivers for newer Windows versions such as&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;but we have seen&nbsp;this has already been the case with a lot of people having issues with getting Windows 8&nbsp;and or&nbsp;8.1
 working on an older Windows 7 machine. In addition, when people upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1, many had driver compatibility issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.stuff.tv/microsoft/updating-windows-81-not-so-fast-buster/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.stuff.tv/microsoft/updating-windows-81-not-so-fast-buster/news</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For my laptop, several of these drivers written for Windows 7 do not work for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=g73jh&amp;p=3&amp;os=30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=g73jh&amp;p=3&amp;os=30</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since several of these drivers&nbsp;do not work for Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 uses the same driver model as previous Windows versions, then they will not work in Windows 10 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried running/installing an older driver in compatibility mode in Windows 8.1. Thanks for pointing that out Andre and I will definitely try this&nbsp;however when you say if your PC can run Vista or later, the same drivers are "likely" to work does
 not sit right with me as I and many others have found that they do not. True there are a few manufacturers out there who do update their drivers, but most do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am using Windows update and the drivers&nbsp;provided do not work with all of my hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can certainly sympathize with ATM and his graphics driver issue.&nbsp;If you have to get someone to vote on an issue you are having and&nbsp;then you have to post on
 of all those people also trying the Windows 10 Technical Preview, and of those people who will be able to find ATM's post about his graphics card issues, and of all those people who do find the post how many will be logged into the forum to vote on it. Sounds
 pretty unlikely that this will get resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I'm wrong, but it's looking like a bumpy road for people with Windows 7 era laptops going to Windows 10.</p>

I have an older laptop made in 2009 and I still can't find updated drivers for mine.&nbsp; Recently had Microsoft Support install Office 2013 to get Outlook to work.&nbsp; Orginal HP install was Office 2002 or 2003 and I had no problems upgrading to Office 2010, but
 when Microsoft Support tried to fix to get Outlook 2010 working again it failed.&nbsp; Few months later I&nbsp; repaired/reinstalled Office 2010 still no functioning Outlook 2010.&nbsp; Microsoft Support tweaked my registry and eventually got Office 2013 w/Outlook 2013 to
 finally work.&nbsp; I also made a hard copy of my dxdiag log in case I'm missing functioning drivers necessary on HP Pavilion laptop before the update of Windows 10.&nbsp; Also running Belarc app before upgrade and after upgrade.&nbsp; Making an ISO which is advised by Zdnet
 site and CNET, because according to Microsoft it will be easier this time to go back to old OS.&nbsp; What happened when people who had Vista that tried to go back to Windows XP and couldn't?<br />

            <p>Cool Dude is bang on!! I have updated my laptop with W10 from W7, certain drivers do work BUT its the specific drivers from the PC manufacturers which need updating. I Believe its easier to update from W8.1 to W10 than from W7 to W10.
</p>
<p>My laptop (Fujitsu) needs drivers to switch on and off features like bluetooth, brightness controls and the like. Unless Fujitsu releases new drivers for those and perhaps a bios update, i would rather stay with&nbsp;my W7. I have tried updating, fresh installing,
 compatibility mode, W8 drivers you name it, it also seems slower than 7 (<em>on my laptop</em>).</p>
<p>I do like W10, i have installed it faultlessly on a desktop and a few other laptops W8.1 &amp; W7 but they had Bios / Uefi options. My laptop never had the W8 option. I bought my laptop new in 2012!!! I cant see them releasing new drivers for it.

            Being that is a 3rd party software and most makers haven't updated &nbsp;drivers, you need to check with the maker of the software and see if any new drivers.

</p><p>We are very close to the release date of Windows 10 . Microsoft could put a little more effort in "requesting" it's 3rd party business partners to have a stable working product for July 29th. It's pushing it's users hard, but seem soft on the 3rd party.
 End user can not move to Windows 10 while 3rd party are sat on their thumbs.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created Alt text for the image in Word 2010, but I' m facing some problems like:</p>
<p>1) On hovering Alt text is not shown, and</p>
<p>2) How to make that Alt text to be narrated <em>(on clicking, hovering or by any way)</em> for that image</p>

            <p>Alt Text is a feature useful when a document is saved in HTML format and then viewed in a browser. It may also appear in a PDF but this would depend on the method you use to create the PDF.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are looking at a Word document in Word then I wouldn't expect that the Alt text will appear on hover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about adding a Comment to a graphic? Does this provide the functionality you want?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank You for replying.</p>
<p>Your answer has explained my question upto some extent, but what I was actually trying to do here is that I want a Screen Reader/Narrator to read/narrate that&nbsp;<strong>Alt text&nbsp;</strong>attached with the Image (or better to say, any other object)
<strong><em>present in the Word doc file</em></strong>, by hovering, clicking or by any other method.</p>
<p>I'm trying to do it basically for the <strong>Accessibility </strong>purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the <strong>Speak </strong>feature which is part of Word 2010, but the limitation of that feature is that it only reads/narrates the text of the document only (I think because it is just a TTS functionality), not the Alt text attached with the
 image (it narrates slash (/) when used for the image).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, please let me know if any other tool/software is available on net which can help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            <p>Alt Text is not intended to display for sighted people. It's for people using screen readers. Make sure to put the Alt Text in the Word 2010 or above</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Description" field in the Alt Text dialog. If you correctly add Alt Text in Word, it will NOT show on a mouse hover on an image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people in the past incorrectly added Alt Text to web page images in order to pop up text on hover and some browsers did incorrectly display that text on mouse hover. But the correct attribute in those cases is the Title attribute, not Alt.</p>

    <title>Sums based on conditional formatting&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> megibson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sums based on conditional formatting&#63;</h2>
                    I have conditional formatting in column E of my spreadsheet so the cells turn red if I enter an 'N' and green if I enter a 'Y'. I also have prices in column C. I have a sum at the bottom of column C to add up the total cost of all the prices. What I'd
 like to do is be able to set up another formula to only add up the values where there is a 'Y' in the F column. I.e. if F2 + Y then C2 should be added to the total. If F4 = N then C4 should be excluded from the total. I've got no idea where to start. Please
 can someone help!

            <p>In this situation, don't even worry about the conditional formatting.&nbsp; Think about the Y/N entries.</p>
<p>Excel has a SUMIF() function perfect for this.</p>
<p>If you have Excel 2007 or 2010, you could use this formula:</p>
<p>=SUMIF(E:E,"Y",C:C)</p>
<p>If you are using Excel 2003 or earlier, you must specify the rows to include and of course they should at least cover the rows with your data in them, such as:</p>
<p>=SUMIF(E2:E500,"Y",C2:C500)</p>
<p>This is also more efficient in 2007/2010, but might need attention from time to time if your data goes down beyond the last row in the formula (500).</p>
<p>NOTE: in your post, first you said column E had the Y/N entries, later you said F, so I have used E in my example, change to F:F or F2:F500 if it really is column F.</p>

                    As the title says, After updating to build 9860 it has killed off my dual boot. Easy to fix but a bit of a pain to have to do it.<br />

            <p>How did you fixed this? I have the same problem. After I installed the 9860 build, it set up the&nbsp;disk with Windows 10 as a master (I don't know how SATA works). Anyway I had to disconnect disk with Windows 10 to be able to&nbsp;boot into Windows 8.1 as usual.</p>

            Ok after closer scrutiny, I decided to delete w10 tp and reinstall it to see if I could replicate this and it did. The thing is the boot loader isn't dead it's just wounded ;) I found it is still there it's just not showing up for some reason. If I moved
 down the list to where my w7 would be in the boot order and pressed enter it would load w7, Same if I pressed once for the 10 tp. So for some reason it isn't showing the loader just a black screen, but it is still there.<br />

            <p>I saw the same thing, black screen about the time the menu should be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I moved my mouse back and forth the drive light would flicker then stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is the start menu is there just hidden. Have to find it with eyes closed.&nbsp; LOL</p>

 short wait.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to win preview build 9860 yesterday. &nbsp;The download and install was slow but it worked great. &nbsp;I didnt lose any installed programs or files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I dont have the OS selection anymore. &nbsp;It automatically boots up to the default. &nbsp;ny idea how to correct this??</p>

            <p>One solution that worked for me is to run msconfig. In there you can set your boot options. Setting the default to Windows 7 instead of Windows 10TP will make your computer boot to the the classic style boot manager. With that, you can see all your boot
 options, but unfortunately, your default boot will be Windows 7 if you don't select anything. I know there used to be a way to disable the timer for this, I just have not gone looking for it yet.</p>
<p>My theory as to why the Boot Menu GUI has disappeared is your video card now seems to be initializing just after the Windows Logo at start-up on this build. This is at the same time your boot menu should be loading, but your card is not fully initialize
 at this point to catch the Boot Menu GUI display.</p>

<h2>            Kindle App no longer works on Build 100130</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first upgraded to 100130 from 100122, the Kindle app worked fined.&nbsp; 100122 was a direct upgrade from 8.1 I believe.&nbsp; Soon after upgrading to 100130, I started getting the critical error shell host errors....&nbsp; I reinstalled keeping all of my old settings
 and that worked for awhile (and the Kindle app also worked).&nbsp; But, I eventually got the same Critical error Shell host errors and so I reinstalled from an ISO of 100130 and chose to do a fresh install w/o retaining any of my previous data.&nbsp; That appears to
 have corrected (so far) the Critical Error Shell host error msgs but now the Kindle app no longer works.&nbsp; It will flash on screen when tapped and then immediately shut down; no error msg of any kind.&nbsp; It just shuts down.&nbsp; I've reinstalled from both stores
 to no avail.&nbsp; Today's update hasn't fixed the problem either.&nbsp; Any ideas how to correct or what the problem might be?</p>

            <p>Nothing at that link is helpful nor useful. This worked at one time under win 10 and now does not. Nothing has changed other than it doesn't work under a clean install whereas it did under an upgrade.&nbsp; the People app it he same damn way. It just doesn't
 work. This kind of lack of functionality is alarming being so close to RTM. The next build better be a whole lot better or I'll be putting off the upgrade until this kind of stuff gets sorted.

<ol>
<li>As you said nothing has changed other than it doesn't work under a clean install whereas it did under an upgrade? Do you mean to say Kindle app works?</li><li>Are you facing the same issue with people app as well?</li></ol>
<p>I would suggest you to try the below methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: perform clean boot and check if the issue persist:</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</strong>to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Try this workaround for problems where apps are not starting or are stuck at the splash screen:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open an Elevated <strong>Powershell &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
prompt by pressing the Windows Key, typing <strong>Powershell,</strong> then <strong>
pressing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl+Shift+Enter</strong></span></li><li><span>Paste the following <strong>command</strong> into
<strong>Powershell</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and execute it:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></li></ol>
<p>Hope this information helps and let us know the status of the issue we will be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            How to enter fixed cost for a resource being part of fixed-price contract in project for EVM analysis&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We have signed a fixed-price contract with a vendor and the vendor resource is assiged multiple tasks at various phases on project. I want to enter fixed cost for that resource in MS project 2010 and carry out EVM analysis. Down the line, if there are more
 changes requeted by business, incremental cost wil be approved and that also needs to be added to the project plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other resources in project who are daily/ hourly rate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When all costs are entered and plan finalized, the plan will be baselined and every week, the performance will be measured based on Earned Value Measurement.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried few options of entering the fixed cost for the vendor resource but it doesn't seem to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll appreciate if someone can help me in providing steps for entering the fixed cost for the vendor in MS Project 2010 so that I can carry out EVM analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rajeev</p>

<p>
</p><p>Add one extra milestone task and name it something like Vendor Payment Due or Vendor Paid.&nbsp; Apply the entire vendor cost in the Fixed Cost column for that task.&nbsp; You can use a Must Start On or Must Finish On constraint to lock the milestone task on the date
 the vendor payment is due.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are only using the Fixed Cost column to track the vendor cost, you could enter the entire fixed cost amount on the Project Summary Task (Row 0) as I indicated in my previous post.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            How can a non existent email account be linked to a site I often go to&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&lt;original title: So everythings just gone?&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So because of inactivity on one of my accounts, the entire thing has been terminated? I created my first account at least 8 years ago, and through it I have created log ins for many different sites. All of my passwords are remembered on my computer, so I've
 never really had a need to send log in information to the email linked with my various accounts. But now since I've switched browsers, I've been going around trying to apply all my log ins to their respective sites. I got through with my old Yahoo account
 that's over 10 years old and hasn't been accessed since 2009. Even with how annoying Google has been forcing gmail upon Youtube, I still managed to get through. However, my hotmail that's linked to my Tumblr account apparently doesn't exist. Weird, because
 it's still logged in. How can a non existent email account be linked to a site I often go to? I guess I'm just screwed huh? I'm finding it hard to not be incredibly angry about this.

<h2>            Windows boots directly to the desktop and opens Internet Explorer, how to stop this&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title: Internet Explorer on the Start screen<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>When I log onto my computer, instead of the Start screen opening, the Desktop opens, AND when the Desktop opens, Internet Explorer immediately launches there.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other times, when I log-on, my computer will open on the Start screen, but then immediately launches Internet Explorer on the Start screen.&nbsp; I didn't click any Internet Explorer icons."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Also, when I am doing something on the Start screen and decide I want to go to the Desktop and I click the "Desktop tile" it switches me to the Desktop and launches Internet Explorer. &nbsp;Again, I did not click the Internet Explorer tile. (I just wanted
 to go to the blank Desktop.)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There is something telling my computer to always open Internet Explorer first.&nbsp; When I tried a warm boot, the problem went away momentarily, but returned after a few days"</strong></p>

            <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 and a docking station. When I power on the SP3 stand alone, it launches to the start screen, which is what I'd expect. When I power on the device in the docking station, however, it launches to the desktop and tries to start msn in
 internet explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My home page is set to about:blank and I don't have MSN as a bookmark. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this thread - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-iewindows8_1/windows-boots-directly-to-the-desktop-and-opens/9f96b6d4-6ed1-4e34-8e4d-5aaa4631319e">

<p>
</p><p>Any ides?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This causes a major issue for me, because the docking station is at my workplace. We're behind an authentication app (BlueCoat) and the launching of IE to MSN causes IE to request my credentials a dozen or more times.</p>

                    <p>"Present Online<br />
<br />
Error starting online presentation<br />
Cannot connect to this service. Check your network connection and try again."<br />
<br />
On March 31, we starting experiencing this issue across our entire domain. We have not made any changes to our network configuration. We are using the same ISP, routing hardware, computer hardware, software versions and group policy settings as we were on March
 30.<br />
<br />
The issue appears to be related to network connectivity. <br />
<br />
Here is what I have found so far:<br />
<br />
We have three networks in our building and two ISPs.<br />
<br />
Network-A uses ISP-A and is affected by the issue. Network-A is our corporate domain.<br />
Network-B uses ISP-B and is affected by the issue.<br />
Network-C uses ISP-B and is not affected by the issue.<br />
<br />
If I take a Network-A domain member and launch PowerPoint while connected to Network-A and ISP-A I am unable to upload PowerPoint presentations.
<br />
If I connect the same computer to Network-C, the issue persists.<br />
If I close PowerPoint, connect to Network-C, and reopen PowerPoint while connected to Network-C, I am able to upload presentations.<br />
<br />
A non-domain computer is affected by the issue if PowerPoint is opened while connected to Network-A or Network-B, but unaffected if PowerPoint is launched while connected to Network-C. Again, in this scenario, switching connections while PowerPoint is open
 has no effect.<br />
<br />
The issue appears to be caused during PowerPoint start-up and not while attempting to share a document.<br />
<br />
Microsoft is either unwilling or unable to find a resolution and has finally resorted to simply ignoring my calls, voicemails, emails, and ticket requests regarding this issue. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Here is a brief description of our configuration and what I have tried so far.<br />

<p>Basically, presenting online is what we need. The feature doesn't just allow you to share the presentation, it allows you to present it live. The user can control the PowerPoint presentation locally while the remote viewer can observe. We would like to be
 able to do this without installing screen-sharing software on all 100 domain computers.<br />
<br />
We have already implemented a solution where the presentation is shared online and the remote viewer can browse to a URL and watch the presentation. We also have a solution where the remote viewer can manually click through the presentation one slide at a time.
 Present online however allows our employees to control the presentation as they would normally, while broadcasting the PP portion of their screen to a remote viewer. This also ensures that both the employee and the customer see the same thing on their screens
 at the same time, given a slight delay due to latency.<br />
<br />
It was very cool when it worked.</p>

            User installations are not allowed on our network. We would need to install it for them. Even if we didn't the point would be to lower the scope of support and decrease liability, so we try to avoid installing additional software whenever possible.&nbsp;<br />

            In this case it would be the host software that we would be concerned about. I tried to host a go-to-meeting and I had to download and install an application which not only remained after use, but installed as a service and started upon boot. Still, this
 is the best, if at least not the only, reply I have received both here and on the identical post I made in the TechNet forum which received no replies at all.<br />
<br />
We do still however experience the same exact issue when using a standalone laptop connected directly to a home wireless router with the firewall turned off. I agree it is definitely a network issue but it as a result of something that has changed on Microsoft's
 end. There is not much else I can do once I have removed everything from the equation but a laptop and an internet connection, including both the Windows Firewall and the firewall on the wireless router.&nbsp;Perhaps I should try connecting my laptop directly to
 the cable modem, but I am not sure what that would accomplish if it were to work.<br />
<br />
Is there another place I should post that is more suited to network problems?

    <title>Recurring Outlook Task in OneNote Mobile App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> worzhak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recurring Outlook Task in OneNote Mobile App</h2>
                    I&nbsp;am using the android phone app.&nbsp; Everything syncs great,&nbsp; but when&nbsp;I check the check box all&nbsp;I get is a checked checkbox in OneNote.&nbsp; What&nbsp;I want is for it to change the status of the task to done so that the linked Outlook task will also change to done.
 &nbsp; And in the case of certain recurring tasks it will then recreate the next occurrence of that task.&nbsp; This will then change the onenote task from done to being due on the next occurrence of the task. and DING!! sharable, recurring tasks on almost any smartphone.&nbsp;
 (All of this actually works as intended for OneNote and Outlook on my computer)&nbsp; All you need is Office 2010 and its free accessories.&nbsp; The only part missing is the ability to mark the task as done and have it change the status of the task to done.&nbsp; As a team
 leader, this is the perfect follow up tool for tasks

    <title>Missing Deleted Items Folder in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas fetter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Deleted Items Folder in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Office 365 onto Windows 7, and I am migrating my email accounts from Windows Live mail to &nbsp;Outlook 2016, since the default Window's 10 email client does not support&nbsp;local folders&nbsp;.&nbsp; I am doing this in preparation for migrating to Windows
 10.&nbsp; I am doing this first under Windows 7&nbsp;to ensure all my offline folders and stored emails make the migration from eml's to the pst format ( I used a separate allpication to complete the format conversion) before Live Mail goes away with the migration.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, everything is working, except...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my email accounts were created in Outlook without a Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; So I selected the Inbox folder for one of the email accounts, and clicked on the IMAP button on the Folders tab. I did a Query&nbsp; to see the list of available folders from the email
 service provider, and subscribed to a Deleted Messages - Inbox folder.&nbsp; The new folder appeared under the email account.&nbsp; But all the messages in this Deleted Items folder were emails that were deleted from the Live Mail client when its Deleted Items folder
 was last emptied (two days ago).&nbsp; None of the emails that have been deleted from the Outlook client appear in this new Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; Where are these newly deleted items going?&nbsp; I suspect there should be a local Deleted Items folder where Outlook first
 holds deleted items until it is emptied, at which point the&nbsp;service provider is told these items are being deleted and the service provider moves these items to its deleted items folder, the one I have subscribed to.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I create this local Deleted Items
 folder?&nbsp; I added a folder and named it Deleted Items, but that, alone, did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also note that the&nbsp; email account when set up under Live Mail was a POP account.&nbsp; Under Outlook, the account was automatically set up by Outlook as an IMAP account&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

            <p>When using Outlook 2016 with an IMAP account, the client and server negotiate on which folders are to be used for Sent. Deleted, and Junk folders using the XLIST or LIST-ENHANCED IMAP command. You no longer get to choose which Outlook special folder maps
 to which server-side folder. SO, the Outlook folders might be mapped to folders with different names. I don't know if that changes the Outlook folders names or not. I'm not i a position where I can look.</p>

<h3> hydropc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Forms in Outlook Keeps Showing&#47; Bringing up Old Form</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Outlook account setup to book meetings and appointments only. This email/ account/ calendar is shared to co-workers so they can see what rooms are booked, etc. We have it setup so that when users request a room- they send a custom form with the
 room info, time, accommodations, etc. to this specific inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the problem is that we had a 'older' custom form setup before years ago. So now whenever a user send the new custom form, it still shows as the old form in the Outlook inbox. The new form has some additions of new rooms, and so we added this change
 to the new form. The new form acts fine and all when opened and sending the request from others. However, once actually received on my end and opened in Outlook it shows the old form. Any info that is not in the old form is then just missing (not showing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Why is this not the correct forum? You linked to the windows insider forum but Groove music is out for everyone to download? I'm also appearing to have this issue. I have&nbsp;a large amount of purchased .mp3 music transferred to&nbsp;the music folder on OneDrive
 and only the music I have downloaded through Xbox music is&nbsp;showing up&nbsp;on Groove. It's not a DRM issue so idk I'm looking through them now, if I find out what the issue is I'll post.

            There are a lot of people having this issue (groove music doesn't refresh music library or don't see it at all, cortana does not play music) but microsoft has no answers. Some says it is a problem related to ms account and with a brand new account set
 as administrator it works, but i already have a ms account and want it to work. We have to hope (cannot say "wait", just " hope") for a ms fix with updates, that's all.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you able to find a solution to this problem: Groove Music not seeing all your music.</p>
<p>I upgraded to a w10, and also bought a PC and transferred my music.&nbsp; I am having the same problem with both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you found a solution, please let me know before I invest into another app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Max</p>

<p>Uninstall <strong>Ding!</strong> (not Bing), reboot &amp; test.</p>
<p>NB: If it's a Win7 64-bit and/or a WinXP&nbsp;64-bit computer, you'll want to access the website via IE 32-bit.</p>
