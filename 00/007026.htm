<h2>            Build 16257.1 RS3 Update</h2>
                    Had 2 computers to try to update to 16257.1 from 16251 and both came back to 16251 after several hours of trying.&nbsp; However, one computer on the second try has updated to 16257.1 RS3 as expected.&nbsp; So far the only strange issue is that the Mail icon is gone
 so used Outlook.com to get to mail.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that an add-in is causing the sluggish performance of Outlook 2016 when typing. Just to check, are there any installed add-ins/extensions in Outlook 2016 you are using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may know if add-ins or extensions are causing problems to Outlook by opening it in
<strong>Office Safe Mode</strong>. Here's how to open Outlook in Safe Mode:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close the <strong>Outlook </strong>application.</li><li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>button + <strong>R </strong>to open the <strong>
Run </strong>window.</li><li>Type the command below, and press <strong>Enter</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Outlook /safe</strong></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>After opening Outlook in Safe Mode, see if Outlook still exhibits a sluggish performance when typing.</p>

<p>Via a chat with Microsoft in order to not have the cursor delay I was told to use Internet Explorer instead of Edge, since Edge is still in beta? My Hotmail/Outlook email in Internet Explorer works fine, but a white envelope was placed on my taskbar for
 access to Outlook 365 Mail and my general Hotmail/Outlook email was added to my Outlook 365 Mail.&nbsp; Great, except every time I go to send a message through the white envelope taskbar icon - the program closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially on Edge my cursor works fine, but the longer the program is up, the slower the cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not open Hotmail/Outlook as below because it directed me to my Office 365 Outlook account.&nbsp; I wasn't having problems with that one.&nbsp; (This forum moved my question to another category and I could not find it to reply at that time thusly the "chat".)&nbsp;
 I think that somehow the 2 email accounts are now combined. Read above.</p>

Hi Arish,</p>
<p>The workflow issue may be caused by the delay of the server or internet instead of browser itself. About the error in the SharePoint designer, there should be the issue with your port 443. You can shut down the Windows Firewall or check whether there are
 any antivirus software which may block the port. Here is a similar issue for your reference:

Please also check the proxy settings of your environment.<br />

<p>Moreover, I suggest you also try using the computer in your home or another network environment with the same account to check the outcome.</p>

 he said, the "Word cannot find the data source..." prompt still persists even though I've re-located the data source. What could be causing the prompt?<br />
<br />
It's tedious on my part to do the "Options, Remove Data/Header Source" process always because I've been processing numerous letters the whole day.<br />
I somebody can help me regarding this issue. Thank you in advance.<br />

            Hi Raju,<br />
<br />
MS Office Word Version: 2003<br />
Windows OS Version: XP Service Pack 2<br />
<br />
My data sources are in text file format.<br />
<br />
Previously, we resolved the issue by creating a new user in Windows. Using that new user to run the mail_merge main document, we seldom encountered the "prompt" for data source. We used to create new user every month just to avoid the continuous prompting of
 "cannot found data source" which actually exists.<br />
<br />
But now, even though I create a new user in Windows, the prompt still persists. And more data sources seem cannot be detected/located by the main mail_merge document.<br />
<br />
To give you a picture of the scenario, the mail_merge document and data sources are in mapped network drive (L:\). I've tried running the mail_merge document on three different machines with either old or new Windows user, but still the prompts keep on appearing.<br />
<br />
I hope you got my point.<br />
Thank you.<br />

            Hi Raju,<br />
<br />
While I was still searching for answers, I found this article helpful : <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/834699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/</a>. Although the prompts do not appear for now, I'm still observing the mail_merge document for how long will it endure on not having the prompts anymore.<br />
<br />
I appreciate you reply. Thank you! ^_^<br />

    <title>Where did the Entourage Outbox holding place disappear&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrymiller35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where did the Entourage Outbox holding place disappear&#63;</h2>
                    Used Entourage Mac a long time. Now Mac Outlook 2011.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Entourage used to have three ways to handle a new, not-yet-sent message:</div>
<div>1. Send it now, which Outlook also has.</div>
<div>2. Put it in the Drafts folder, to edit or send later, which I used for items I was still working on, which Outlook also has.</div>
<div>3. An Outbox folder for current emails I wish to send soon or at the next scheduled Send, which Outlook DOES NOT HAVE.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>?A. I'm told there is an Outbox which shows for a millisecond during the Send process. But I am looking for a place to store emails I wish to send within the hour, but not this very second. This is useful in case I think of a new thought to incorporate.
 Does it exist somewhere or somehow in Outlook? I can't find it if it does exist.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>?B. It seems that now the Drafts folder is for things you want to send soon, or want to send some indeterminate time in the far future. For me they are two separate requirements. How separate the "soon" from the "someday"?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>?C. A last query re the Drafts folder: If I place one or more items in the Drafts folder, then instruct the program to Send, does it send what's in Drafts? If not, what does it find to send as I know no other holding place?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for helping me work through this.</div>
                </div>

            Who know why they chose to do it this way. You can set Outlook to "Work Offline" and the message will save in the Out box until you select to work online.<br />
<br />
I believe Apple Mail uses this same "hidden" Outbox. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;If this is a feature that you consider useful, be sure to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook’s Help menu)<br />

<p>These settings should provide good playback on 5800:<br />
<br />
Container: MP4.<br />
Video: MPEG-4, 640x360, 16x9, 25fps, 750 kbps.<br />
Audio: AAC, 44100 Hz, 2 channels, 96 kbps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To increase quality you can increase bitrates, etc, but this will give larger filesize. Depending on source file you may not notice much difference anyway.</p>

<p>Some options you could try to reduce the size further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had good results in the N97 using 368x208 resolution instead of the larger 640x360. In the small screen of the phone it doesn't make "much" difference to have the additional pixels. IMHO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also you could use 64 kbps for audio instead of 96 kbps. For movies, tv shows or other programming that's mostly voice centric higher bitrates are not needed. Only if you are doing music videos or something like that then you require high bitrates in audio.
 Voice is very simple and can be highly compressed.</p>

            Hi - I am a new E71 owner and noticed the same problem out of the box... I turned off the tones, hearing those terrible noises coming out of my sparkling new device was just too depressing. Had a N80 before this and am a long time user of Nokia's IT devices
 N8x0 etc and have grown used to these incredible devices having some rather annoying flaws that seem to go unfixed. I understand some of the issues with my new E71 such as camera quality and frequent browser/bookmark menu crashes have been fixed in the last
 2 firmware updates - updates that I am not 'allowed' to install... Never really understood why this is.

<p>Oh my God, yes!!!! I have the exact same problem and coincidentally made a post about this today. See here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/06241E0D-8A86-4F42-9E79-22B1AE5A294E">
/t5/Eseries-Devices-and/e71-hangs-intermittently-external-speaker-crackles/td-p/698966.</a> If you put the speaker to your ear while pressing the navigation buttons you can clearly hear how faulty the speaker is, crackling/distorting after every 5-8 beeps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Argh, this is so frustrating because it has been like this ever since I bought the phone. What on earth has happened to Nokia. It used to make quality, user-friendly products but now its smartphones seem to be so buggy. I am really disappointed because I
 especially bought the e71 as a way to help differentiate myself from all those annoying iPhone and Blackberry users. But now it seems I will have no choice but to sell this phone at a loss and buy a different brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think one thing is clear, Nokia hasn't beta-tested its products enough.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd like assistance with is the ability to upload some documents confidentially and anonymously to the Windows Insider area to help improve Windows 10. This sort of stuff can't be uploaded via Twitter and similar. Did you have any further suggestions
 on how I may be able to do this ? Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please see the comments from BarcodeZero in this discussion. I've just installed W10 TP for the purposes as you suggested but within the Windows Feedback App can find nowhere to do as you suggested. As I do not wish to make any of the information available
 on a public basis, would it not be a good idea at this stage to ask a Developer to include the ability within the Windows Feedback App for large amounts of documentation to be uploaded confidentially and securely to a secure area ? Thanks.</p>

    <title>How to bypass OneDrive when sending attachments in new 2018 version of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donlefaive  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to bypass OneDrive when sending attachments in new 2018 version of Outlook</h2>
                    My Hotmail/Outlook interface was just updated this past week (I'm assuming it's called Outlook 2018?). Now if I try to send an attachment my only option is via OneDrive (which I have no interest in using). Previously I had the option of sending attachments
 as a 'copy' or 'fi;e' (I forget the exact term that was used), and I was able to bypass One Drive completely. In the new 2018 Outlook interface, if I go into settings, and attachments, there is no option to select&nbsp; sending attachments as a copy / file. Is
 there a way to bypass OneDrive when using this new 2018 interface, and send attachments as I was able to prior to the recent update to Outlook? If not, is there a way to switch back to the previous version of Outlook? And if not, is there a program or app
 I can use to send attachments via my Hotmail account, so I can bypass One drive? Thanks for any info you are able to provide.

            Hi Jason - yes I can send attachments of files located on my hardrive - but thats not the problem. The problem is when I send an attachment (even if it originates from my hardrive), the recipient receives it as a file located on OneDrive. And that's a
 problem as most people don't use OneDrive, and don't want to, or don't know how to, access the attachment from OneDrive. Until my Outlook interface was recently updated, I use to have the option of sending the attachment as a 'copy' or 'file' (I forget the

    <title>Accde strips code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maarkr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accde strips code</h2>
                    
<p>Revisiting my prob with making an accde from a couple of my accdb files.&nbsp; It seems to make the file but has no functioning code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Have decompiled and recompiled the files.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Although trust settings are locked thru a GPO so they cannot be modified, I don't think it's an issue because I CAN MAKE accde files from smaller dbs.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Tried importing all objects into a blank accdb file with no difference.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I recall reading something about having too many objects to make an accde file.&nbsp; I link to 16 tables... have 30 queries... 34 forms... 10 reports... 2 macros and 3 modules.&nbsp; Is this a possible issue?&nbsp; I don't know how I can strip this down much.</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Converting to accde compiles the code in your accdb and, in effect strips the the VBA code from your modules so they can't be modified.</p>
<p>Also Access won't convert&nbsp; to accde if it finds syntax errors in your code. You have to run a Debug and clear all those up or the conversion will fail.</p>
<p>If you are saying that the compiled code is not running in your accde, then there are probably errors that the compile didn't catch. And you don't have sufficient error trapping to catch them.</p>

<h2>            Copy &#40;CMD&#43;C&#41; keyboard shortcut not working</h2>
                    <p>I am currently on OneNote for Mac 15.25 (160806), and copy command keyboard shortcut (Command+C) does not reliably work every time on first try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to end up doing CMD+C multiple times or sometimes have to re-highlight a different area and then do it multiple times for it to copy the new data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit + Copy menu or Right-Click + Copy works every time though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is not using any external keyboard -- just on the built-in Macbook Pro keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experience this, and is there a fix for this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are not alone. I have seen this issue off and on for a couple of months now, but every time that it happens and I try to reproduce the issue so that we can investigate it - things work just fine. It is
<em>very </em>frustrating when it happens though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been one of those elusive issues that we are still trying to track down, but rest assured that we haven't given up on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you happen to find any particular pattern that can cause this issue to reliably, repeatedly happen *please* let me know. That would be very helpful!</p>

            <p>I finally managed to track down a <em>fairly</em> reliable way to reproduce this issue. If Cmd+C is pressed while the mouse cursor is still moving (which happens fairly often if you are using the mouse to drag-select over a range of text) and this is the
 first time that you have used the Copy command since launching OneNote, then the copy will very often fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has to do with lazy-initialization of the Edit menu. If you manually open the Edit menu by clicking on it after launching OneNote then Cmd+C should work for the remainder of that session. That should provide a pretty basic workaround for now. We
 have a fix in the works that should be available in the near future so that you don't have worry about that workaround.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I'm currently on 15.26 (160817) and though I sometimes do get the issue (maybe like you mentioned when I initially open OneNote, though it's hard for me to quantify that), it is far less often than the previous non-fast insider version
 I was on before. Then I was getting the issue a lot, even after I had used the drop down menu to copy / paste etc. within the same session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to hear it is being looked in to though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>After gathering information from various sources I have finally managed to compile a decent guide to install NGage on the Nokia 5800XM using the files which have been circulating the web for the past week.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions please PM me on the forum or reply to the topic and I will try my best to help.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Installing NGage</u><br />
<br />
Step 1<br />
Download the NGage Install Package which I have compiled below:<br />
- <a href="http://www.1filesharing.com/download/RIROTQGS/NGage%20-%20Nokia%205800.rar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.1filesharing.com/download/RIROTQGS/NGage%20-%20Nokia%205800.rar</a><br />
<br />
Step 2<br />
For this to correctly work, you will need to have your phone hacked, this should be no problem providing you have a little confidence and common sense. I can confirm that using HelloOX does work as it is the method I used and I can use NGage fine. If you're
 phone is already hacked with HelloOX and you're having trouble, ensure that all patches (open4all etc. are applied and set to auto using ROMPatcher.<br />
<br />
Step 3<br />
Copy the file "NGage 2.0 Installer.sis" to your phone and install it. You will need to sign the file using SignSIS GUI or a similar application, you should already have a certificate if you have hacked your phone as you need to sign HelloOX to hack successfully.
 The install process will take quite some time and you will be prompted to press "Yes" to various warnings. I can confirm that no harm has come to my phone from this process, however, proceed at your own risk. I take no responsibility.<br />
<br />
Step 4<br />
Once NGage has been installed, you will be able to find it under "Applications" on your phone. The icon will be an orange "N" and it will say "Games" underneath. To play NGage games they must be copied to "E\N-Gage" with "E\" being your memory card.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Controlling NGage</u><br />
Since NGage is designed for phones with a keypad, and the Nokia 5800 is almost completely touchscreen, the controls must be customized. I have so far come up with two solutions, they are as follows.<br />
<br />
<br />
Control Method #1<br />
This is the most stable and easy to configure control scheme, I can confirm this works OK.<br />
<br />
Step 1.<br />
Sign and install "Virtual Keyboard.sis" which can be found in the "Control Method #1" folder of the Install Package.<br />
<br />
Step 2.<br />
Run the virtual keyboard application from your "Applications" menu and then start the NGage application. You can use the Virtual Keyboard to control your games.<br />
<br />
<br />
Control Method #2<br />
This control scheme is still a work in progress but, with some fiddling and a varying degree of luck, you may be able to get it to work. Some people have confirmed it working with different settings. I feel that this setup, if working correctly, would be the
 best way to control NGage on a Nokia 5800. I would like to request feedback from anyone who has this method working!<br />
<br />
Step 1<br />
Sign and install "Virtual Keyboard.sis" and then "Virtual Key.sis", both of which can be found in the "Control Method #2" folder of the Install Package.<br />
<br />
Step 2<br />
Start up "Virtual Keyboard" so that you have it running on screen and then proceed to start up "Virtual Key".<br />
<br />
Step 3<br />
In the Virtual Key application, choose "Options" then "Load Mode" and choose "Custom Mode 1".<br />
<br />
Step 4<br />
Press "Options" then "Add". Highlight "Original Key" and then press the Right arrow on the Virtual Keyboard application you loaded earlier. Then highlight "Mapped Key" and hold down the "Volume -" key then press the "Volume +" key. If all has worked correctly
 the mapped key should change to "Vol+". Then do the same for the following<br />
<br />
Vol+ .................. Left<br />
Vol- ................... Right<br />
No ..................... Up<br />
Yes ................... Down<br />
Camera .............. K<br />
<br />
Then press "Options" and save your "Custom Mode 1".<br />
<br />
Step 5<br />
Set the Virtual Key application to run in the background and completely exit the Virtual Keyboard application.<br />
<br />
Step 6<br />
Start up the NGage application and try to play a game. Hopefully the Up/Down volume keys will control Left/Right when holding the phone horizontally, and the other keys should do what you mapped them to above. You may have to use the volume keys in the same
 way you had to set them (Hold down Vol- and press Vol+ etc. So now hopefully you can play NGage. Let me know of any other control schemes you guys come up with!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Messages Received But Not Appearing In The Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Outlook 2016 on my new PC. My old system had Outlook 2010. I also have several iDevices and a laptop that all receive email from 3 accounts (AT&amp;T and two Google accounts).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I installed Outlook 2016 on the new PC everything appeared to be working fine... I imported my pst files and all of my historical information was where it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that new email messages are not appearing in my inboxes... I know I am getting them because the slider bar in the lower right hand of my screen appears whenever I get new mail (I can even click on it and read the message). My other devices
 are also receiving the messages. Just not the inbox associated with each of the three accounts. The last message they receives was the one generated when I created each email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions gratefully accepted....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tony</p>

            <p>If you set up MS Outlook for first use on a new PC and in the process added your mail accounts, if this was done using the first screen auto detect process it would have added your mail accounts as IMAP accounts</p>
<p>Within Outlook, File&gt;Account Settings.......Email Tab, what does it say for mail a/c Type - for each mail a/c the Type would be Pop/SMTP if set up manually, or IMAP/SMTP if auto set up</p>
<p>It would also show where each a/c is delivering new msgs to.</p>
<p>Its also the case that an export/import of a pst loses various data/settings. With Outlook closed on the old PC you copy any pst files to media and thence to a Documents location on the new PC then within OL you open the pst.</p>

            <p>I did the install manually and set the accounts up as POP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook was closed when I copied the pst files... Outlook did not appear to have any problem reading the pst files when I did the initial install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning when I tried to access Outlook to check the settings it would not respond. It tried to recover my information and closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to restart Outlook it told me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The file</p>
<p>D\Outlook\*** Email address is removed for privacy *** cannot be opened"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced the (apparently) corrupted *** Email address is removed for privacy *** file with the original, but Outlook still will not open (it gives me the same error message). I want to emphasize this point: I made a copy of this file, and that was what I was using yesterday
 when I set up Outlook, which was able read it with no problem so I do not believe it is a problem with my pst file.</p>

            <p>OK, I think I figured out what is going on... I did not import the 2010 formatted pst files - I just imported them and started using them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted Outlook in recovery mode and followed these steps for each account:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I re-created the accounts and let Outlook create the pst file (on my C: drive).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Then I moved that file to my D: drive and re-directed Outlook to use it instead.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Then I imported the data from mu 2010 formatted pst formatted files</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I can now receive email. Hopefully this will clear up the problems that caused Outlook to hang.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last question: is there any reason why I should be concerned about keeping my Outlook files on my D: drive? (my PC has the SSD as its drive C and a 2 TB SATA drive as my D: drive... I want to minimize the use of the C: drive as much as possible to enhance
 system performance, and maintain disk space. Also, keeping all of my data files on my D: drive will make the next system migration a lot easier).</p>

<h2>            A way to use a drop down listbox with Powerpoint that can populate the list from an excel worksheet</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;work in&nbsp;the Operations Branch in the Health Physics office at a hospital. You might most simply understand Health Physics as Radiation Safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each week we conduct surveys in departments where medical radiation is an issue (e.g. Nuclear Medicine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those survey sheets&nbsp;have been created in Powerpoint. Currently, they are just generic forms. What I want to do is the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Create several tables of values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Surveyors (co-workers) to select from in a drop drop listbox (DDLB).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Survey Meter. (Essentially this is a Gieger Counter; each one carries a Model, S/N, and a calibration expiration date -- all of which we need)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create an entry form to be used at runtime, to contain:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A&nbsp;DDLB to select one surveyor (or, alternately,&nbsp;select multiple selections)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A DDLB to select a Survey Meter (or, alternately,&nbsp;select multiple meters)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Enter the survey date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Calulate "Week of" from the survey date entered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Take the input information and replicate it across all slides in the powerpoint. Thus, all slides (each one was created off the same template that asks for Surveyor, Survey Meter, etc) would display the information selected in the entry form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did this process using Excel and by naming groups in the same spreadsheet, but&nbsp;a different worksheet. Everything was already created in PPT when I arrived here, so I do not want to have to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can this be accomplished?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            OK yuo have quite a job ahead.<br />
<br />
The basis of inputting data from Excel is to have a reference to Excel in the VBE Tools<br />
<br />
And then <br />
<br />
Sub populate()<br />
Dim objXL As Excel.Application<br />
Set objXL = GetObject(Class:="Excel.Application")<br />
With objXL.Sheets(1)<br />
ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange = .Range("A1")<br />
ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange = .Range("A2")<br />
End With<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
This is a simple demo to put the text from A1 &amp; A2 into PowerPoint shapes on slide 1. The Excel Sheet needs to be open.<br />

<h2>            Restoring IMAP email account files from backup to Outlook 2007 on a Vista 64-bit system.  Files are deleted as they are restored.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having problems restoring IMAP&nbsp;email account files from backup in Outlook 2007 on a Vista 64-bit HP Laptop. My primary email is an IMAP account that had over 19,000 incoming messages before my hard disk crashed. I have backups made off-site with carbointe.com
 as well as on an external hard disk in my office, and can see them listed as soon as Outlook is first started after the pst files are copied into the Outlook folder (C:/computer/users/test/appdata/local/microsoft/outlook). However, as the incoming messages
 are loaded, they are simultaneously being deleted as wel, and within minutes there are zero incoming email messages in my inbox.. How can I stabilize them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling Outlook 2007 and all the files found in the Outlook directory, then reinstalling the program and copying folders back into the Outlook directory, but am not getting anywhere. I've stumped my email service provider's tech support,
 my backup provider's tech support, Geek Squad tech support and have resisted paying the ridiculous $249 charge that Microsoft posts to get their help direclty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; I am missing a full year's worth of email that are business emails.&nbsp; It's absurd because the files were backed up and should be safe, so I think something is just not communicating right internally somehow and it's driving me
 insane..............</p>

            IMAP accounts don't use their PSTs as the primary storage.&nbsp; They're cached copies of the messages that are kept on the server.&nbsp; You do not restore IMAP accounts by reusing their PSTs.&nbsp; In fact you cannot reuse an IMAP PST.&nbsp; You simply re-add the account
 and allow Outlook to create a new PST, populating it from the master data on the IMAP server.&nbsp; There's no way you can have messages in&nbsp;an IMAP&nbsp;PST that are not on the server because any change you make in IMAP gets reflected both in the PST cache&nbsp;and on the
 server.&nbsp; If you do have messages in the PST that are not on the server, it must be because you created your own PST independent of the IMAP PST and moved or copied messages from the IMAP account to that PST.&nbsp; If that's the case, put the PST in some folder
 other than the folder where Outlook stores the IMAP PSTs and then add those PSTs to your mail profile with File&gt;Open&gt;Outlook Data File.

            Another question: in my case, I use my email daily...it is my primary email address, and I have never allowed it to go inactive. Yet starting about 2 weeks ago, every email older than about a week has been automatically disappearing from my inbox. I've
 lost hundreds of emails, and every day I notice that more are deleted (as I type this my emails only go back to Feb 28th o this year - I've lost emails from as far back as 2010). Tomorrow I will probably only be able to access March 1st and later. Any idea
 what is causing this?

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Allow me to assist you today.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A. <span>If you were accessing your emails&nbsp; on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but&nbsp; didn’t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due&nbsp; to inactivity in web account.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>B. If your account was&nbsp; hacked and the hacker had already deleted emails in your account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>C. </span><span>If the feature&nbsp; Conversation Threading feature is turned on.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It means, m</span></span>essages are usually grouped in a hierarchy by topic, with any replies to a message arranged visually near to the original message.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did Silverlight and Java install successfully?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if the system files associated with Internet Explorer are not working properly. It could also&nbsp;</span><span>occur if the Internet Explorer settings are not set correctly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p>Check the time and date settings to ensure that the computer isn't set in the future or past. You can check the time and date settings by double clicking the clock that is displayed in the toolbar.</p>
<p>Further, try running Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if the same issue occurs, here is the link:<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to reset all zones to default level and then try to access the desired website:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Open “Internet Explorer”.</span></p>
