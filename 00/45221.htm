<h2>            XBox One Surround Sound Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>I feel like I've tried everything.</p>
<p>I have a home theater set up (7.1) in my basement. For some reason, my XBox One won't play any games or apps (Netflix, HBOGO, YouTube) in surround sound. The only sound that comes out is from the front speakers.</p>
<p>A few answers to questions:</p>
<p>"How are you connecting your XBox to your receiver?"</p>
<p>- Through HDMI. And I've tried swapping the HDMI adapter with another but same result.</p>
<p>"Have you tried changing the Display/Audio settings on XBox One"</p>
<p>- I feel like I've tried almost every possible setting, from HDMI Uncompress 7.1, to Stereo Uncompressed, to Bitstream Out, Dolby Digital, etc. Nothing seems to work</p>
<p>"What about the TV?"</p>
<p>- I don't have any cable tv hooked up to my XBox</p>
<p>"How do you know your speakers are set up right?"</p>
<p>- I have a Blu Ray player connected to another input on the receiver that plays 7.1 blu rays to all of the speakers. The XBox built in Blu Ray player does not.</p>
<p>"Did you try changing the audio settings of your receiver?"</p>
<p>- I feel like I've tried every possible combination. I've tried to leave it on Auto Surround Sound for now.</p>
<p>"What else have you tried?"</p>
<p>- I've tried hard reseting my XBox One, switching HDMI cables. The only thing I haven't tried is to get a fiber optical cable to see if that combined with HDMI will work. I have heard that the audio quality of HDMI is better than optical cable, so it'd be
 nice if there was a way to get it to work.</p>
<p>Receiver is a Pioneer SC-37</p>

<h2>            PS&#47;2 Compatible Mouse driver in Windows XP doesn&#39;t plug and play mice to be installed with an error message &#39;Code 10&#39;</h2>
                    <p>My Dell DS 620 Laptop has a navigational mouse pad that is listed as a PS/2 Compatible Mouse driver.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have been unsuccessful in being able to install any plug and play mice in to my laptop.&nbsp; I have tried multiple models of Microsoft mice with the Hardware Installation Wizard coming up with a Code 10 error each time.&nbsp; I read somewhere that PS/2 Compatible
 Mouse drivers are no longer recognised by Windows?&nbsp; If this is so, what do I need to do to allow my Device Manager to allow me to use both the navigational pad and plug and play mice to be used on my laptop?

            <p>Hi CillKelly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer the Microsoft Knowledge Base article for instructions on fixing code 10-related error messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Description of Code 10-related errors that Device Manager generates in Windows-based computers</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since code 10-related errors result due to incompatible/outdated or corrupted drivers, download and install the latest Windows XP drivers for your laptop/computer from the manufacturer’s
 website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

 onto my flash drive, but it cannot boot without another program. How can I make that flash drive a bootable device, if I'm on a Mac, and my Windows PC won't boot?&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit and blitting</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to get an old game I love, Pizza Syndicate (aka Fast Food Tycoon, aka Pizza2) to work on my Win7 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works ok for a minute or two, but soon enough it'll get a critical error, a message telling me that it can't blit will pop up, and the game crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm only a home computer enthusiast, I have no training/experience in the industry, so I apologise beforehand if this question is ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can read up on 'blit' or 'blt' it was phased out after directx 7. So I thought 'perhaps if I install directx 7 it might help the game to function'.&nbsp;So I attempt to install directx 7, but I then receive the error message telling me that it's not
 compatible with the version of Windows that I'm running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of any way in which I can adjust my PC to get around it's Pizza Syndicate blitting problem?<br />

</p><p>After a quick google, I found this ( translated from German ) -&nbsp;<a href="http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://retrolympia.de/fora/index.php%3Fpage%3DThread%26postID%3D310&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Pizza%2BSyndicate%2522%2B%2522windows%2B7%2522%26hl%3Den" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://retrolympia.de/fora/index.php%3Fpage%3DThread%26postID%3D310&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Pizza%2BSyndicate%2522%2B%2522windows%2B7%2522%26hl%3Den</a>
 which apparently gets it running on W7 32bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know about 64 bit, it doesn't say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to try it, it may be a good idea to <strong>back up</strong> your PC first, just in case. As I say I haven't tried it, just found via a search.
<em>Its just "belt and braces" stuff in case anything odd occurs, but it ensures you can easily get your PC back to as it is now, should you need to.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone else may be able to offer further advice from experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> you may get away with installing Directx9 from the MS download center onto your W7 as its supposed to be backwards compatible with DX8 etc and then install the game.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Apart from a last ditch hope - update your graphics card drivers to the latest supported drivers available from your PC manufacturers support site.

            Try installing the older version of Windows 10, version 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

    <title>Why does Windows 7 have trouble with 64G exFAT&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wayne_snyder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 7 have trouble with 64G exFAT&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 as trouble with all my (3) of my Sandisk 64G SDXC cards (exFAT format). Windows 7 asks "Do you want to scan and fix SDXC (I:)?" but I did this before and it ruins the format and I have to reformat it with SD Format to recover it. Then Windows doesn't
 like it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I "Continue without scanning" it sees the files and it can usually manipulate them (rename, move, delete, add new files, etc.). But this time it sees the files but it won't manipulate them. These are 2 brand new SD cards and one hasn't been inserted
 into the Android yet. In fact the Windows 7 computer put the files on the SD card but now it can't manipulate them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I always - without fail "eject" the card before removing it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Androids are happy with the cards as they are formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what's going on? And more importantly - How do I get Windows 7 to accept these 64G SDXC exFAT cards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

            <p>Hello Wayne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry for late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like file format has been corrupted. You might consider formatting the SD card using NTFS
</p>
<p>file system and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Make sure you back up the data before formatting the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer these articles for further information on formatting disks and flash drive:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Warning:<br />
Formatting erases any existing files on a flash drive. If you format a flash drive that has files on it, the files will be deleted.</p>

            <p>Retandeep,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I have tried formatting them in the past (This problem has been going on for a long time) and I forget the details right now but it didn't help. I'll try it again when I'm prepared to erase all the data.</p>
<p>But the cards work fine in my Androids. So, maybe the Androids cause the format to be incompatible with Windows?</p>
<p>I just tried Sandisk's fix quoted below but now my PC won't recognize 32 or 64 GB cards. It doesn't even see them installed so formatting them isn't an option. I backed up the registry but it only backed up the one line (I guess when I exported I had one
 line highlighted)</p>
<p>Do you have any idea how I put the lines back into the registry?</p>
<p>Here's the Sandisk instructions:</p>

    <title>Surface RT 8.1 update&#58; Slow, laggy, horrible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> misterfocus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT 8.1 update&#58; Slow, laggy, horrible</h2>
                    <p>Wow, I really expected this to be a great update. So many reviewers said the RT update made the machine snappier and the new features in the OS were great. I just installed and Oh mama, is it HORRIBLE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps barely launch. Hit the mail button and the app failed to launch several times before finally getting started.</li><li>"Smart search" should be renamed "predictive-typing-lags-so-slowly-that-you-will-make-10-typos-and-then-the-search-won't-execute-anyway Search." Beyond horrible. I'm stuck with a machine that, at this point, doesn't search AT ALL. And since this update
 removes the Bing Search app in favor of the charm-only search model, if it doesn't work, I'm suck opening a browser.</li><li>familiar gestures don't work anymore. This is a lesser issue, as eventually, you might get used to the new ones, but once you spend five minute swiping up from the bottom to get to all apps in tablet mode, and you only get the customize option, you'll be
 wondering why there wasn't a decent, forced tutorial on update.</li></ul>
<p>A restart hasn't solved the horrible slowness that this update has inflicted on my surface. I am going to probably roll back, as the machine is pretty much useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HORRIBLE experience, Microsoft. And I have been a surface defender since I bought mine on launch day last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Windows 8.1 RT</u></strong></p>
<p>Swipe from the right &gt; go to Update and Recovery &gt; Recovery &gt; "Get Started" Located underneath "Refresh your PC without affecting your files"</p>

</p>
<p>If that does not work then you probably will just need to reinstall windows. </p>

<p>I would also like to add that after updating my Surface RT is working as it should.</p>

            <p>Tried that. Seemed to help, but then the extremely laggy typing problem in the search box appeared again. I gave up trying to use that and went to set up my SD card and within five minutes, windows explorer crashed and restarted on me no fewer than five
 times.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This machine has always worked pretty much flawlessly for me since a year ago. This update is a disaster. Reverting the machine back to factory setting right now and going through all that hassle. Hopefully, that fixes my nice shiny brick.</p>

Probably going to be the lamest response, but have you made sure everything is updated? When you did the "restore to factory" was it good from the start? then it died after updates?<br />

            <p>It took a full "reset to factory setting" whatever that's officially called. I didn't do the "recycling" option which, I assume, must replace the empty drive spots with noise.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since my settings and app settings are synced between several win 8 machines, the intial login fixed most of the machine right back up, making the factory restore not nearly as big a pain as I thought it might have been.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After that, things seem to be stable. I also figured out that IE 11 may continuously crash if it gets a bad page/tab but shutting it down doesn't really shut it down. It tombstones and upon opening again, all the old tabs come back up. To get it to shut
 down really, you need to pause on the downward drag right near the bottom of the screen and wait a second or two for it to flip over to a blue e icon screen, which means it's flushed out all those other tabs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Seems to be working OK now. Also, upgraded my mom's RT machine this weekend and it doesn't seem to have experienced any of the issues that hit mine, so maybe I just got excellently lucky.</p>

            Since I downloaded the most recent updates on my Surface RT, there is a significant delay from when I type something in an email to when I see it on the screen. It only happens in emails. The lag is quite long. I did a system refresh and deleted everything
 and started from scratch, but when it came to the update (I wasn't sure which it was on), the lag came back as soon as I downloaded it. What can I do to fix this? It is such a big problem that I may have to get rid of this if it isn't fixed ASAP. I send a
 lot of emails each&nbsp; day for work, and I can't take an extra 15 minutes per email.

            I am having the same problem. This is so disheartening. I absolutely love the OS, this is the only issue I have had, but it is such a huge glaring one it is even hard to focus on my work, not that I can get any done.

<h2>            One of my machines cannot see the others &#40;discovery is on&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 machines on my LAN all running win 10, all 3 can connect to the internet fine.. all 3 are in the same work group and network discovery is turned on for all 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, i only see 2 of them in the network list, the 3rd shows itself in its network list but not the others. Even stranger my Asus router network map does not show the 3rd machine on the map either yet its connected to the internet via that router and
 able to surf just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the network name for the 2 working pcs is the same but the 3rd machine is named network4 and there does not seem to be a way to change that( don't know if that name even matters but thought i would mention it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So end result all 3 pcs can connect to the internet but 1 pc cannot connect to the other 2 for file sharing and when i run PSmedia server on that PC nothing else on the network can see it running. Thats actually how i became aware of it.. this pc used to
 be my streaming server for my ps3 now all of a sudden neither the ps3 nor any other computer on the network can see it.<br />
</p>
<p>Tried turning discovery off and on again, tried turning off firewall and AV .. no joy.</p>
Any thoughts?

            <p>Hello Watmo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common reasons why you can't see other computers on your network are that your computer is not connected to the network or that network discovery is disabled. But I can see that device is connected and the network discovery is turned on already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check by disconnecting that problematic computer from the work group&nbsp;and then reconfiguring it back to see if it makes any difference. Once you do this, ensure to reboot all three computers for the changes to take place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try to run the below troubleshooters on three computers,&nbsp;to see what it results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">* Press <strong>Windows Key</strong> then type ‘<strong>troubleshoot</strong>’ and hit Enter</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">* Select <strong>“View all” </strong>on the left panel and run “<strong>Internet connections</strong>” troubleshooter from the list. Also try to run
<strong>Network Adapter</strong> troubleshooter to see&nbsp;any issues with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">* Click Advanced, ensure to check <strong>Apply repairs automatically
</strong>and also select <strong>Run as administrator</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Click <strong>Next </strong>and finish the troubleshooting by following the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also ensure that all your computers are installed with latest and compatible Windows 10 network drivers. You can check for the latest drivers on device Manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know how it went.</span></p>

            <p>HI all, I wanted to share the solution. After running in circles trying to figure out what happened I retraced my cables and realized that recently i added a OOMA voip phone box to this LAN. The pc that was having the problem was daisy chained off the ooma..
 it seems that ooma must have put that pc in a separate VLAN or something as it could connect to the net just fine but was totally isolated from other pcs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pulled the ooma out and bam.. the pc showed up on the network. Little surprised by that as i have used Cisco and poly com voip phones in the past configured a similar way with no such issues so I had not even thought to check it.</p>

<h2>            Skyrim english but Kinect voice commands in french</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Recently I bought Skyrim on the Xbox marketplace (on demand). The game is in english. I realized after that the game was produced in different languages like french. So since I am a french canadian, I have some concerns.</p>
<p>First of all, because the game has a deep story and I don't want to miss a thing, I actually try to get the french version calling Microsoft. I am waiting for a reply by phone and/or e-mail. I talked to level 1 support guys twice. The first call was 3 days
 ago. I hope I'll be able to get a code to download the french version.</p>
<p>If I can't get french version, I will play with the english one. Not a big problem. I added subtitles to help me. However, I have a concern about the Kinect support. Everything is english in the game (of course) except one thing: Kinect voice recognition.
 This is in french! I understand that is because my Xbox Live account is set to french (console too but I think it uses the account setting. Right?). Because the game is in english, I have no idea what is some voice commands. I need to try to translate what
 I found in Help menu. By example, I can sort items by value but not by damage.</p>
<p>Then I have 4 choices (if I can't get a french version code from Microsoft):<br />
1. Found a complete french voice commands list on Internet (now I can only find the english one).<br />
2. Switch my whole Xbox experience to english just to solve it and be able to use Kinect fully in Skyrim. I don't really want it because other people use the console/my account (gold one) at home and are happy with french.<br />
3. Figure out if it's possible to force Kinect to use the english language just for Skyrim. I don't think it's possible.<br />
4. Forget Skyrim Kinect voice commands (at least for many commands).</p>
<p>Any help or comments on this?<br />
Thank you<br />
Jonathan</p>

<p>Not really sure about all that language barrier stuff. The game is supposed to available in English, German and French as per everything I've read about it. I know some folks from Germany that play it but not sure about all the Canadian folks. Fus Ro Dah
 is dragonspeak so there would not really be a translation for it in any other language. That's what I'm thinking. Maybe wrong but I would assume that dialects will hinder Kinect commands anyway. So try setting up your Kinect again until it recognizes your
 voice. Personally I tried mine and had all sorts of weird things happen so I turn it off for Skyrim. It would recognize Fus and that's all. I had to wave at it alot to do other things. The only thing it did real good was quick save. It had that down very nicely.
 So I guess I'm suggesting #4. Forget Skyrim Kinect commands.</p>

<p>Thanks Angelus for the reply. Yes Skyrim is available in many languages like english and french. However, I bought it in the marketplace as a game on demand (it was one of the past week deals, 20$ off). This way I got it in english even if my console and
 my Xbox Live account are both set to french. The guys at Microsoft says that the game is only available in english from the marketplace. At least in Canada if I understand well.</p>
<p>On my side, Kinect voice commands works very well (for commands I get translated). For instance, I can say "Trier par valeur" to sort items by value, which is nice. No way to do it using controller.</p>
<p>I agree about the dragon language...! ;)</p>
<p>Thanks again Angelus! ;)</p>
<p>Anyone else have the same concerns?</p>

<p>Sadly Microsoft does not have recontacted me to give me a potential french version download code. Well it's true that the on-demand game description states clearly that's in the english language. They said that usually they can do it but if the original
 game came from a download code too (by example, a code that come with a new console).</p>
<p>I like the game so I bought a hard copy of the french version! It was really hard to find in stores here! Wow! The big map that is included with it is superb! Now, I can use every Kinect voice commands because the help can really help me (translated in french).
 By the way, it's awesome because I can understand every little details of the storyline! ;)</p>
<p>Finally, earlier I talked about sorting items by damage using Kinect. I was mistaken. Of course it's not a valid command.</p>

    <title>Freezing Console &#47; System Update Corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clockking1986  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing Console &#47; System Update Corruption</h2>
                    
<p>I was randomly disconnected from XBox Live when on the dashboard earlier tonight. When I tried to reconnect it gave me an error, so I decided to play a game offline. The game worked fine for 5-10 minutes but then froze, so I had
 to manually turn off the console. When I turned it back on the console froze when it loaded the dashboard. I had to manually restart again and then got this message: "Some XBox 360 features are missing or corrupt. A system update is required to replace them."
 I allowed the console to restart and the update installed, but it froze again when connecting to Live upon restart. It told me I was signed in, connected to Live, and even told me how many friends were on before freezing. I disconnected from the Internet and
 turned on the console, and this time I was able to move around the menu a little before it froze when I tried to play the game again. I tried playing a downloaded arcade game upon restart and the screen froze when entering the Recent section of the dashboard
 before even accessing the game. I then removed all system updates from my drive and restarted. I can move around the dashboard now but sometimes it freezes randomly, and I haven't been able to play games. I tried several times to reinstall the update, and
 the loading bar always finishes indicating the update was complete, but it keeps freezing. I removed the hard drive and powered on the console and it also froze then (this was before I removed all system updates). The info on my HDD looks alright, nothing
 is missing there. I also cleared the system cache on the main drive. I'm not sure what to do now. Is this something that requires me to send the console in for repairs? I don't see any red lights indicating a system failure, and the HDD doesn't seem to be
 corrupted. I don't even remember installing an update prior to this problems occurrence. &nbsp;I restarted my console at least 25 times before giving up for the night. Please help me fix this if it is at all possible. Key things to remember:</p>
<p>1. The freezing doesn't always happen like clockwork. It ALWAYS freezes if I'm connecting to Live right after the dashboard loads all the images. When not connected to Live it tends to allow me access to the menus but then randomly freezes there as well.</p>
<p>2. It will occasionally give me the "Missing Or Corrupt Features" message and will have me reinstall the system update, but that doesn't fix anything. Sometimes after reinstalling the update I'll notice some graphical glitches, like small missing squares
 in the white background of the start up loading screen, etc. It seems to freeze the least when all system updates have been removed from the HDD. I tried installing the update from a USB drive instead of Live but that just creates an endless cycle of restarts
 and extracting.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Here is an update:</p>
<p>The last thing I attempted before going to sleep last night was transferring my save games to a USB drive and reformatting my XBox's HDD. I also returned my system to factory default. At the time it didn't seem to fix anything. When I woke up this morning
 I tried turning on my XBox 360 again but still experienced the freezing and the graphical glitches. I went to work and came home 8 hours later and tried again. This time I was able to get into the Live dashboard, and there weren't any graphical glitches. I
 also wasn't prompted to update again, so thats an improvement. I tested downloading an Arcade game (Scott Pilgrim) and that worked fine too! No freezing. I went to play it and I got as far as the beginning menu and it froze. It also froze a few times in the
 dashboard but not nearly as frequent as last night (last night I couldn't even play a game). At least I can maneuver around the dashboard now and get into system settings with a little more ease. What could be causing this? And why would it work better after
 not using it for the 8 hour period I was at work?</p>

<p>What does X1 support hold in store? hopefully by being truthful this thread will not get removed, I had my account hacked and my partner(mrs) account too on her tablet with no virus protection, yes my fault &nbsp;for not installing it. Many of you might of seen
 me posting before, I had a brilliant service to get my account back by having a code sent to my registered phone. All free! When it came to my mrs however £59 to unlock her address!!! What serious!!! &nbsp;am not going to cancel my pre order but this seems like
 a pay wall for a free email because of a security flaw they should of fixed, pls god don' let this be the future of what microsoft represents. Sorry guys for posting this on here but i am trying to set her up on my xbox so when my pre ordered xbox one comes
 through she will transfer her settings. naughty microsoft.</p>

<p>tbh I was venting my anger and kinda wishing some would agree with me before the thread got removed, but hoping it would not as my mrs account would be moving to X1 when mine did :) but £59 quid to get a hacked account back which should be free is a lot
 of money, considering games are less.</p>

<p>The forums are not a counseling service. </p>
<p>Also, if you are having an issue with your Liver service or the security of your account, you need to take that issue over to the appropriate section.
</p>
<p>And a side note, the only way for your Xbox Live account was tampered with, is if you voluntarily gave out your personal account information such as passwords, email addresses and any other pertinent information to someone else. You don't hack a Live account,
 you willing give out information that is supposed to be confidential. Your fault.

<p>Well correct about me posting here, sorry as I said in my 2nd post, its defo not your normal anti kinect thread, I thought it was relevant to this section as we all will be dealing with the same customer service which seems to be behind a pay wall, and I
 was setting up a seperate account for her, for when my pre ordered X1 arrives. for your info I did phone them and spent 20 mins on the phone only to be told it would cost &nbsp;£59 quid, and then hung up on. anyway sorry guys pls dont post and let the thread die
 I have already got other communications in the pipe line :)</p>

            <p>Hello Eeshwar for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the suggested settings for windows update trouble shooting but that did not solve the issue.</p>
<p>I still get the same error message as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then restarted in safe mode with networking, but when I go to settings/updates the update screen does not appear, only a black screen or it seems to go no where.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help further?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a link or download site that I could download the update KB2267602 and manually run an install?</p>

            <p>I suspect I may have found the cause of my issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had installed and running on my system, Norton Internet Security 2015 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just uninstalled it and as soon as I did Windows Defender started up on my desktop and I updated all of its definitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it is running and Windows Update shows me that all of my updates are installed and it found no new ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that Norton Security is not compatible with Windows 10, or that some how Windows Defender must be disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have a paid subscription to Norton Security, I'd appreciate any help given on how to DISABLE Windows Defender, so that I can again reinstall my Norton Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to completely uninstall Norton Security by using Norton Removal Tool by following the below link:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now try to install Norton on the computer and check, once you install Norton, Windows defender will automatically disabled on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. </p>

<h2>            &#34;No Internet, Secured&#34; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So about a year ago, my HP ALL IN ONE with Windows 10 blue screened. When I managed to get it back up and running, there was an issue with the wifi, it would connect to the router but not to the internet, it would connect but show message
<em>"No Internet, Secured"</em>. As I work in IT I have done a lot to try and trouble shoot this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Reset network adaptors</li><li>Installed Intel network drivers on another machine (with internet access) and tried installing via USB on HP All In One</li><li>uninstalled network drivers and restart to try and find updates.</li><li>Tried rolling back updates to an earlier update</li><li>Disabled/re enabled WiFi Adaptors&nbsp;</li><li>Reset TCP/IP Stack via CMD</li><li>Tried using mobile phone personal hotspot to rule out router problems (wouldn't connect to hot spot)</li><li>Tried to connect via Ethernet cable to rule out (wouldn't connect via ethernet)</li><li>Reset my PC</li><li>Installed Windows 10 Fresh Image file from Microsoft website and used a disc to install the media on PC.&nbsp;</li><li>Tried restoring the PC but no restore points available&nbsp;</li><li>Carried out several CMD actions including, ipconfig /release /renew, etc.</li><li>Disabled IPv6</li><li>Restarted DHCP Service</li></ul>
<p>I have a Sky Hub which works fine on all other device (laptops, phones, sky+, Amazon Fire TV). I can connect to internet via a different Laptop fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently using Windows 10 Home - Version 1709 - All previous updates have been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Workstation specs:</span></p>
<p><strong>Processor: </strong>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460T CPU @ 1.90GHz</p>
<p><strong>RAM: </strong>8.0GB</p>
<p><strong>Wireless adaptors: </strong>Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless AC 3160</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just about out of ideas. I have done some research and the only answers I am getting is to reset adaptors etc, which was the first thing I did. Please help as this is getting ridiculous now. I am yet to try throwing the device out the window, which
 I am very close to doing. I would like to avoid sending it to a professional as I have tried everything they will. Also considering this is my line of work, I have too much pride to send it elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            Maybe you need to replace the NIC with a new one that is certified compatible with Windows 10. But try downgrading and see if it works.

    <title>Computer turns on but Windows won&#39;t load - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer turns on but Windows won&#39;t load</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
I'm having MAJOR problems with my laptop which has lasted over 2 days now and I'm ready to throw it out of the window.</p>
<p>It started when Antimalware Doctor virus protector installed itself on the hard drive and caused all sorts of problems. I ran the Malwarebytes anti-malware software several times which didn't work. I'm getting messages froma Security suite that has been
 installed saying my computer is infected and various other scary looking pop ups. It also keeps loading up various sites on the internet such as viagra.com, ****.com and adult.com, even tho I've turned off the internet on my laptop. Nice! It keeps saying
 that something critical has happened and reloading my computer every few minutes. I managed to get in through Safe Mode and get rid of things but no luck on the normal profile.</p>
<p>I've tried various other ways of getting it solved, including going into Registry Editor and deleting from there. Not only has this still not worked, I've also managed to delete some folders and files from the wrong parts which I'm pretty sure has resulted
 in my library folders, such as documents, pictures, music and video, to be displayed as a white page and renamed as music.library - ms (from what I can remember) I can't access anything in these folders now. It seems for some reason that the laptop hasn't
 backed anything up either as the settings were turned off (I don't know why) and so I can't do system restore as it doesn't have anything to restore to.<br />
In regard to any internet settings, I've gone into the settings and it has the proxy settings ticked but with no actual settings. I've tried unchecking them but as soon as I exit the window it checks itself again.</p>
<p>The major problem is now that I can't even get it to load properly. It'll go onto the first load up screen then go black and I'm left with a white mouse icon (a larger one than normal, similar to the one in Safe mode) which can be moved around but the screens
 don't progress any further. When trying to load computer in the safe modes, it goes to the screen 'Loading Windows Files', loads maybe about 30 - 40 files and then stops at:<br />
<br />
Loaded: \Windows\system32\DRIVERS\CLASSPNP.sys<br />
<br />
It then asks me to wait and flashes up a blue screen really quickly with some writing on it but it's too quick to even see what the writing is, restarts itself and then says 'Windows Error Recovery'.</p>

<h2>            Stop Code&#58; Critical Process Died</h2>
                    <p>I have been having the issue of getting a Stop code that said 'Bad Pool Caller', and worked with DaveM yesterday. He looked at the minidump and determined it came from a software call Malwarebytes. I've removed that program and everything with it (I hope!).
</p>
<p>Now just got another Stop Code: Critical Process Died. Below is a link to the Minidump if that helps. Thanks for the help, Steve Price</p>

<br />
<br />Have you done some update to anything in your computer lately like driver update, application update.

            <p>I received this information from the manufacturers today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting install (Win 7 is notoriously bad at using Generic drivers instead of the manufacturer provided ones.<br />
<br />
The unable to communicate error is a common one, for Desktop PC's make sure the scanner is connected to a live rear USB port, front ports and hubs not supported, the number 1 cause of this error is another USB scanner or All in one Scanner/Printer also residing
 on the system, if you have these devices please turn them off, if they are DELL or LEXMARK brand they need to be disconnected from the USB port altogether, most other brands turning them off is sufficient.<br />
<br />
1. Turn off/disconnect conflicting devices, turn on PrimeFilm scanner, make sure scanner is connected to a live port on the back of the system, no front ports or hubs.<br />
<br />
2. Getting to the Device Manager (Start - Right click - Computer&nbsp; - Left click - Properties,&nbsp; then click on the Device Manager link on the upper left side of the page that opens.<br />
<br />
3. Device Manager will open, In this list do you see Other Devices, is there an Unknown Device or USB Scanner listed here, to verify it is the scanner turn it off, if the Unknown device disappears then we have the right item, turn the scanner back on, the Unknown
 will re-appear, double click on it then select the driver tab Update driver, Search the system automatically.<br />
<br />
4. It should have found the Single Frame Film Scanner, if you receive a warning about system security select “Install this driver Anyways” Once the scanner appears normal under Imaging Devices, close all open windows and try the scanner again.</p>

            <p>I am (finally) upgrading from XP to 7 and the original installation driver failed (PC version V1-15) but using David's text above the CyberView software can now "see" and drive the scanner. Problem now is that I get a Pfsloader MFC Application failure when
 the software is processing the image (source image is a Kodak 200 colour negative). Any thoughts please? Thanks. Nick</p>

 </blockquote> <p>It's not accurate at all you wastrel, I want to contact the enforcement team for being randomly banned but I am unable to due to the terrible customer service that comes with paying for Xbox Live Gold; the enforcement "team" (not real people, just a software that detects profanity and bans the culprit) has no way of being contacted AT ALL. I have been banned and left with the vaguest reason of "Partook in profanity, etc." I have since appealed but have received no further response at all - I wasn't expecting any, the customer service for Microsoft has always been awful. Is there not a REAL person I can speak to whom can speak English and is in a position which would allow them to enlighten me? My gamertag is Chabuddy Jamie .</p>
