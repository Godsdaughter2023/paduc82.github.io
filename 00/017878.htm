<h2>            Outlook.com on a Samsung Galaxy S4 Android phone</h2>
                    (When answering this question, PLEASE don't recommend I use Microsoft's Outlook.com app for Android. The latest version of that app changed the font size to something ten times smaller than tiny and the app is useless to me because of this.)<br />
<br />
I currently use an iPhone, but am about to switch to a Samsung Galaxy S4. Will I be able to use my Outlook.com (custom domain) email, contacts and calendar on Android's default email client, contacts, and calendar apps? Thanks for any help.<br />

            Hello, Larry. I have just set this up. It is a great way to centralize my stuff and access it anywhere.
<br />
<br />
I wanted my calendar, contacts, to-do items and of course email on my new S4 (I switched from iPhone too BTW) as well as my desktop. And I did not want to use a separate app as you have said.
<br />
<br />
The instructions from Michelle may be better than mine, but I am adding my own here in case hers do not work for you. They did not work for me. It took me some time to figure out the right settings.
<br />
<br />
Two things were "special" about my case: First, I have outlook.com set up with an email address that is not an outlook.com address. That adds complexity to the setup. Second: my outlook.com account comes from Windows live. That requires a special setting in
 the S4 account. <br />
<br />
Here are the steps I took: <br />
<br />
1. Set up Outlook.com account with full send and receive for your primary address. I found instructions for this elsewhere with a Bing search. The key was to make sure all of the email accounts and aliases in Outlook.com were set up for send and receive. In
 my case, that required the advanced setup screens in Outlook.com. <br />
<br />
In the S4:<br />
2. Menu button &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts (tab) &gt; Add account<br />
3. Microsoft Exchange ...<br />
4. Enter email address, password, then click "Manual setup"<br />
5. In "exchange Server Settings" screen:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email address:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; youremail@address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Domain\username:&nbsp;&nbsp; \youremail@address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- Start with backslash. No domain specified!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yourpassword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exchange server:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m.hotmail.com<br />
Above applies only if you created the account under Windows Live or Hotmail. If you signed up under Outlook.com, then use this instead:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exchange server:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m.outlook.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Secure ... (SSL):&nbsp; checked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use client certificate: I left this unchecked. Don't know what it is for<br />
6. Next<br />
If your account settings work, you will then be prompted for more information -- obvious stuff, so I will skip it here for brevity.
<br />
<br />
<br />

            Thanks so much, Dan. If I do go ahead and get the Galaxy S4 at least I'll have your advice for setting up the custom domain.&nbsp; However, since I posted this I went to the VZW store and looked at the Android email app and unfortunately, the (unchangeable)
 font size is too small on it as well.&nbsp; I have good vision, but I'm farsighted, so I can't read email in the app without putting on glasses.&nbsp; The guy at the VZW store said he couldn't count the number of people who've complained about the font size.&nbsp; Pinch-Zoom
 is not an option...it's a PITA :-)&nbsp; So, I may be sticking with my iPhone.<br />

            <p>Hi LarryMcJunkin, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your follow up question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you want to set up your custom domain account on Samsung Galaxy S4 using its native email app, please try leaving the Domain field blank as also provided on the link given by Michelle Ann D.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other queries, please post back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

            This is no help, if you try to leave the domain blank then the "next" button is grayed out because you HAVE to enter something. It doesn't let you leave domain blank. I don't get why no one seems to know how to fix this. I have tried for two weeks now
 to set up my email using the Samsung Galaxy email app. My work uses Microsoft Exchange and no matter how I configure the settings it will not allow me to add my work email. I get "authentication failed" for some ways that message boards to set it up and others
 cause a "unable to connect to server" message. I have paid for and downloaded three apps related to outlook, none of them work. Why don't I just ask our company's IT person? Well, my company has a ridiculous policy about "self-care" and receiving email on
 my personal phone when not at work somehow violates their ideals of what THEY think I should be doing when not in the office.

<h2>            IE9 Difference between deleting personal settings and deleting browsing history&#63;</h2>
                    Deleting personal settings under Reset seems to do more then deleting browsing history, what are the differences?<br />
<br />
I experienced a situation where I was having problems on a site where options weren't appearing in a drop down.&nbsp; I deleted everything that is on the Deleting Browsing History and that didn't fix the problem.&nbsp; I reset my settings without checking the "Delete
 personal settings" checkbox and that didn't fix the issue.&nbsp; Then, I reset my settings with checking the "Delete personal settings" checkbox and that fixed the issue.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

<h2>            Lumia 930&#58; good WiFi connection but no internet connection on Windows 10 Mobile 10.0.10586.218</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>My Lumia 930 with Windows 10 mobile is sometimes unable to connect to the internet until I reboot the device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So imagine this:</span></p>
<p><span>Your Windows 10 mobile phone will connect to WiFi networks and 9 out of 10 times all is good. You can use your WiFi connection for internet related content but then you grab your phone out of your pocket and when you woke it up from his sleep you will
 notice that you cannot get any information from the internet. Nothing... No mail, no websites, no app content that is served through the internet. Why? Because your phone tells you that your selected/connected WiFi network has no internet connection and you
 forbid your phone to switch to cellular data network when connected to WiFi. Strange you think. Your Surface has no problem what-so-ever getting content from the internet and is connected to the same WiFi network at the same time….</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So you switch your WiFi off and on to see if that will change things. Unfortunately your phone is still convinced that your WiFi network has no internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span>Next you go to another geographical place with an different WiFi network you have access too. Guess what, this WiFi network also has no internet connection.
</span></p>
<p><span>Finally you shut down your phone and turn it back on and all your problems are gone. Until by a random act of Windows magic your phone informs you again that the WiFi network(s) has no internet connection until you turn your phone off and on again.</span></p>
<p><span>Back to the factory settings you think! And after configuring your device all seems good. Until…. Your phone informs you again that your WiFi network has no internet connection while you are browsing the internet on the same WiFi network with your
 Surface tablet…. The agony!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So a bit more technical information. </span></p>
<p><span>Looking at the details of my WiFi networks on my phone when my issue arises, I see that the IP address of my phone is not an address I would expect. It’s 169.254.57.20 for all the networks I connect to. &nbsp;There are no phone updates available and the
 only thing that seems to work is turning my phone off and on again.</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone know how to eliminate this annoying behavior of my phone?</span></p>
<p />

            Hi, If you're still having the same problem, last May 11 we have released 10.0.10586.318 OS update that includes reliability, performance and stability improvements. Try installing the update as soon as it's available for your phone. To check for OS update,
 go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Phone update and tapping Check for updates. You may also try checking for system app updates. To check, go to Store &gt; Menu &gt; Downloads and updates and tap Check for updates. If the issue persists, you may use the Windows
 feedback app to report it. This will be the best way to get our development team's attention and to get it fixed.

            Hi, yesterday (11 Aug 2016) my Lumia 930 started this problem again. I have a new bright box 2 router. The problem is defiantly with the windows 10 as it doesn't happen on my wife's windows 8.1 phone. This happens every time i go out of WIFI range. The&nbsp;connection
 is restored as soon as i reboot the phone. This happens with every WIFI network i am logged in with. If its any help, when it had the fault, when i go to reboot the phone it takes an age to shut down. Lets hope this can be sorted out soon, as its pretty annoying.
 I had thought the last major w10 update had cured the problem, but sadly not.

<h2>            Check subform for value when parent form loses focus</h2>
                    I have a parent form which has a subform called Location History. When the parent form loses focus I would like to check the control&nbsp; Location on the Location History subform to ensure a value is present.

            You can use the before update event of the subform to ensure that any location history record must have a location before that record can be saved. The before update event has a cancel parameter, so your code simple checks for a null in the location control.
 If it finds a null for location, the set cancel to true to prevent user saving a location history without the location.<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Prompting to Purchase in Already Purchased Subscription - Locked threads</h2>
                    <p>Is it me, or have microsoft just taken to locking all the threads now, so no one, can reply to anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That doesn't seem to be the greatest strategy for finding or giving answers - maybe it's about time Microsoft started sorting these threads out and taking those down that aren't relevent anymore and giving proper access to those that are still current or
 recent or relevent, rather than just locking everyone out of everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it's me, but it seem to get more bloated and convoluted - Why are there no links to comunity within my microssoft accounts - why am I having to continuially login everytime I'm shifted to another page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone can post a link that explains just how you use the forums, how you find your previousl posts etc The whole set up right now is simply baffling -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I.e: I have a 365 subscription, yet everywhere I go within my accounts, my email, my apps etc I'm being offered a subscription package I already have - and microsoft don't have a cookie buried somewhere on my hard drive that verifies the apps I use daily???
 Of course they do - so why am I still being continually harrassed to take out a subscription I already have??</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE - I posted this a a discussion, but by the time I had been narrowed down by microsofts dropdown sub-topics, (more unhelpful and unnecessary screening) I was in the business section of irrelevance to my question. So what do I do? Post multiple times
 so all OFFICE users and ALL community users get to read it??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get a grip microsoft - if you don't want anyone to read or respond to posts close down the community and save us all the agony of trying to get our posts read!!!!</p>

            Hi Davey
<br />
<br />If you are being prompted to purchase an Office 365 after already purchasing one, this could be due to an existing trial version already installed on your computer.
<br />
<br />
<br />This is an issue we often see where personal copies you buy and try to install conflict with pre-bundled trials of Office 365. You need to remove the trial first, then install your copy.
<br />
<br />Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Proceed to install Office 365
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.
<br />
<br />As for the right forum for your question, please give me a few moments while a redirect it. Thank your patience.

<p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an all new subscription and downloads on a new computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am of the opinion MSN are completely baffled and mixed up by their own product offering - even they can't tell the difference. I have Office across my devices and yet when I'm using the program it suggests I download the app, when I go to the app it says
 use the program - but that I can unlock features with a subscription etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to my account, its the wrong account because my account and my 365 account are different, but the same login, but different, (don't ask me why) just like the forums, and outlook mail- and none of them can talk or communicate with each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but if I cancelled my subscription they'd be on top of everything in seconds and all my access would be blocked across all devices and through all accounts - so it's not that they can't sort it out, they won't. and so on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole thing is a shambles from top to bottom</p>

    <title>New rows inserted in block no longer keeping formulas - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New rows inserted in block no longer keeping formulas</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a document that has been in use for over a year, its a rather complex document and so many of the cells are locked for users. However, it is an on going tracking document so users are allowed to insert rows into the log. The rows are inserted above
 an end line row (which contains the same formulas as the rest of the block). For the past year inserting rows into the document above this line has resulted in the new rows keeping the same formulas as above and blow, however recently this has stopped happening.
 I found this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/317a30bd-f476-4dd9-a160-b150e0169e4a">
previous thread</a>&nbsp;which also states the new row should have the formulas automatically. Does anyone know why this is no longer working or how to revert to this prior setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Office 365 Home on PCs with generic logons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lylewalker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Home on PCs with generic logons</h2>
                    <p>Our household has three computers, currently each with a generic user logon to Windows 10 (or Windows 7). Each of us can use any of the PC without our "own" logon ID. All personal files are saved on a household NAS server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to install the trial of 365, and signed up for a Microsoft Account as asked, that PC's User suddenly changed to my name, and the existing generic User was deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to subscribe to Office 365 Home for the three PC without each person having to login to each PC with a personalized Microsoft ID?
</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply Palcouk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the first point, though I wasn't planning to use the OneDrive feature at this time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the second point, that wasn't how it happened for me.&nbsp; I wasn't given the option to keep the current Winlogin (called "Diamond") but the Winlogin became my name (as defined in creating a Microsoft ident).
</p>
<p>It took me a system restore to get rid of the login name and then I had to re-establish login "Diamond".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? </p>
<p>Should I download the Office 365 install file first, and manually run it, instead of clicking on the web install link?</p>
<p>

            <p>Having received no further replies, I must conclude that using Office 365 requires one to be signed in to Windows with the same individual identifying ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not how we share use of the home laptop, so I am going to buy a Office Home and Business license instead.</p>

            <p>Any win logon can be separate from any MS Office 365 Home ID - it is in the systems here and this did not change when 365 was installed on a number of systems.</p>
<p>One issue to be faced is whether all these users on an individual PC, if they are all using the same win login, is whether the users need to keep there office docs private to the individual, and of course if using MS Outlook whether each user has their own
 private mail address, which with a shared win log in would mean using separate OL Profiles

<p>Thanks you for the confirmation, I will believe you, but I went with a separate 2016 Home and Business licence, and will keep the other older household PCs on Office 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must have originally used the wizard incorrectly. As I said in the first email, the installation clobbered the original logon ID and created "my name" login in its place. &nbsp;Without having detailed instructions I am not inclined to trust this installer again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The household members keep their files separately on shares on the NAS server, and yes only one person will make use of the Outlook application on this laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I had exactly the same problem when I was setting up my new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a local Windows account set for win login, no email account.&nbsp; Then I installed Office 2016 and without any warning it converted my Windows login to an email account based one.&nbsp; Very annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to eventually restore Windows to a local login, and the same for Office. So now when I start the computer, I do need an email account to log in, and neither do my Office applications.&nbsp; Sorry, I didn't document the (painful) process I went through.</p>

<p>I presume in the second paragraph you meant to say "..I do NOT need to an email account.."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry that it was a painful process, perhaps Microsoft&nbsp;should allow an option in the download and setup instead of presuming that everyone wants to login with a Microsoft ID on their PC.&nbsp; As I said,&nbsp;my solution was to install Office 2016 Home and Business
 instead of Office 365, and&nbsp;this does not demand a personal Microsoft ID take over the PC's logon.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 822 Windows 8 phone not being recognized by Windows 7 PC</h2>
                    <p>I have synced this phone to this PC many times before. Suddenly the PC never recognizes that the phone is plugged in. Does not even appear in Windows Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone is charging through the usb cable, so I know it is making connection. I have tried
 a different usb cable and no change. Plugged the phone into a different Windows 7 PC (at work) and it recognized the phone is plugged in and transferred pictures. I have tried restarting the PC and no difference. The only thing I can think of that changed
 is that I was asked to update the Windows Phone app on the PC. Nice "update" if it broke what was previously working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. I need to update my music on the phone, and this is the PC I sync music from.</p>

    <title>Is it possible to find and recover a Word for Android document&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> renniep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to find and recover a Word for Android document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is a copy of a question I posted on another forum, and got no answers. Hoping for better luck here.
</p>
<p>https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/176738/is-it-possible-to-find-and-recover-a-word-for-android-document</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Iconia B1-A71 which I bought about a year ago, if I remember right. It has Microsoft Word for Android pre-installed. In my naivety I assumed it was a free no-strings-attached app.<br />
<br />
Today I was taking a train trip, 2 hours each way, and I thought I'd try using it to work on a fairly large Word document. I sent it to myself via email. Clicking on the .docx attachment started the Word app. It went though an initialization process, but I
 am very sure that it did not warn me that by using the app I would have to sign up for a Microsoft account and provide permission for Microsoft to access my contacts.<br />
<br />
I spent about three hours working on the document during the trip.<br />
<br />
When I got home I tried to "share" it by sending it to myself again. What I got was the original unmodified document. Then I tried to "Save as" on the device, and the app crashed or went into a loop, spinning the circular arrow and saying "Working on it". After
 4-5 minutes I killed the app.<br />
<br />
Now when I start the Word app it demands that I sign up for a free account, and share my contacts with Microsoft. This I refuse to do on principle.<br />
<br />
Where I come from this kind of thing is called "bait and switch".<br />
<br />
So my question is, is there any way I can find and recover the edited .docx file using File Manager or something (I have tried to find the edited document but can only find the original one), or do I accept that Microsoft has cheated me out of three hours of
 my time?</p>

<p>Hi Rennie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your issue regarding Microsoft Word. Basically you need to sign up or create and have an account with Microsoft for you to continue the service. Because we need Microsoft Word to recover the file. Right now the main concern is if Microsoft application
 will continue the current service that you had before or will give you another service app for Microsoft Word one's you sign up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response.</p>

            Thanks for your reply, but you have missed the point I made that I refuse to give Microsoft (or other companies) access to my contacts list. So when any app says it wants that permission I always decline. I can not imagine any technical need for that permission,
 and so I assume Microsoft wants that permission for marketing purposes. <br />
<br />
And I'd like to emphasize again that it is unethical that Microsoft Word for Android can go through an initialization process without warning the user up-front which permissions it will require when restarted, and thus lure a user into spending / wasting a
 lot of time and then saying, "sorry sucker, your work is lost if you don't go along with our new demands."

<h2>            Can not connect to a mobile phone in Serbia from Skype to go on my phone.</h2>
                    <p>As the subject line says, since I added credit to my Skype to go&nbsp;account I can't connect to a mobile phone in Serbia. I was never able to send text messages via Skype To Go on my phone to a mobile phone in Serbia, but I accepted that thinking "well at least
 calling works" now that sucks too. I am really annoyed by this. What is the point of "Skype TO GO" if I have to be running home to my laptop pressed over time difference and whatnot every time&nbsp;I want to reach my oved ones.&nbsp; Also- both calling and sending texts
 on my laptop work alright. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any leads would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 does not open excel .exe files created in previous versions</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues with Excel 2016 trying to open some excel .exe files that were created in older versions of excel. &nbsp; I am running Windows 10. &nbsp;The files begin to open, I can see the file for approximately 3 seconds, and then it closes with no error messages.
 &nbsp; </p>
<p>Others in my organization are running Windows 10 but have earlier versions of Excel which allow the programs to open so I assume this is an excel 2016 issue. &nbsp;Is there a setting in Excel I need to change to have these files open up properly? &nbsp;We have tried
 changing most settings with the same result. &nbsp;Thanks</p>

    <title>Browse button in MS Access 2016 not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesprq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Browse button in MS Access 2016 not working</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing problems with the Browse button in MS Access 2016. The button no longer brings up the file selection window - it does nothing. There are several places in Access that provide&nbsp;the browse button functionality, none of them seem to work (see
 images below). I have attempted a full repair of Office 2016 and this did not resolve the problem. The browse functionality worked until recently. Curiously, when I use the browse button in the Open option, I get an error message saying "Microsoft does not
 support </p>
<p>opening HTML pages" (see image below). &nbsp;There are no active or inactive add-ins. I am running Windows 10 - 64 bit. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you CAN open the WFE outside of Access, then I'd have to suspect you have a corrupt installation of Office. You've already tried a Repair of that installation, so you may need a full uninstall-reinstall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>WFE opens outside of Access correctly. I have also checked Excel, PowerPoint and Word: the browse buttons in these apps works correctly. Before posting this issue, the office repair actually failed and I performed an uninstall and a full reinstall. Windows
 and Office are up to date as far as I can tell.&nbsp;The problem has not been fixed. The fact that the browse button in Access shows it is trying to open&nbsp;html pages&nbsp;might point to a resolution to this problem (see image in initial post). I first noticed this problem
 when I was trying to use the VBA code to open the windows file explorer:&nbsp;Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything other suggestions?</p>

            <p>If the other Office products work for the Browse button, then you're (unfortunately) left with an issue with your Access application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you did the uninstall/reinstall, how did you uninstall? If you use the Add/Remove Programs applet, then you may not have gone "deep" enough in the uninstall, and may need to do it manually. See the "Uninstall Manually" section at this link:</p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the instructions outlined in the link you provided (For Office 2016). In step 2, there were 2 tasks that were not found (the last 2 in the list). In Step 3, there were 2 processes that were not found: OfficeC2RClient.exe and Setpup*.exe.
 In Step 5, I needed to reboot 3 times to completely eliminate all the office files. In step 6, there was no key in Office Key in HKEY_LOCAL_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office. I rebooted after the full uninstall and then installed Office 2016. I performed a reboot
 after the installation of Office and the same problem is still present. I performed the above install and reinstall twice with no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still getting the "Microsoft Access does not support opening HTML files" error message when I use the browse button or the Documents folder (see image). As mentioned in an earlier post, I need to get this working so I can use&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">the
 VBA code to open the windows file explorer:&nbsp;Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker) from within an Access application. Should I consider moving back to Office 2013?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In addition, I have found that the Link table manager does not open the window file explorer when you select always prompt for new location.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Anything other suggestions?</p>

Quite honestly, I don't know. When I tried to upgrade my Win7 system to Win10 I ran into a ton of issues (quite a few of them involving Office). I tried to work around them, but it got to the point where I felt like I'd be wasting time if I forged ahead. My
 machine was getting long in the tooth anyway, so I opted to build a new machine and install Win10 as a new install. That cured my issues, of course.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and suggestions. I did attempt a Windows 10 Repair to no avail. So I bit the bullet on Saturday and reinstalled Windows 10 and all the apps I had on the machine and this seems to have resolved the issue (5-6 hours to reinstall Windows
 and all my apps).</p>
<p>

~At best outlook is a cheap imitation of what MSN has to offer. Not only do the options provided through outlook operate differently, and at a much lower quality standard, but they are also not as interchangeable as most of their advocates would have you believe.
 In my opinion they should have fashioned outlook to only include those things advantageous to the 'upgrading process' from the old Hotmail system, while keeping everything else instead of pulling the plug entirely on the old to intro a big new comprised of
 things that both 'work' and&nbsp;'don't work' all the while unable to efficiently communicate with its 'big sister' apps (that BTW comes with a cost). As example: the sig on outlook does not appear as you would have it on MSN, also special characters do not readily
 appear at all. Again, the junk guard on outlook only has 2 options: the very lowest (standard) and the extreme (exclusive) either one puts the managing of the emails into a cocked hat. In my experience the 'strong' setting is the most accommodating level supplied.&nbsp;Having
 that which you purchase at a guaranteed performance, only to have it fail in particular elements with the assurance of expedient repair to find that the 'repair' is lasting for a much longer period than should be acceptable (months on end), should very much
 warrant a re-evaluation of the system in whole. Especially seeing that both, outlook and MSN, have undergone many changes/updates themselves. I chose MSN because it was, in my opinion, the more operable, simpler, ascertainable, and even better looking than
 all the others. Now I know nothing is perfect, especially when it comes to technology and all, but I've been noticing for some time that this has become a lot less perfect than I'm willing to accept. Everyone who even comes close to an understanding of the
 system/issue should all come together and get the bloomin' ball rolling! (Please, don't give me that tired cliche of 'we're going as fast as we can' or 'we're doing the best we can' because in truth- that's what I'm afraid of!)

    <title>Problem with Silverlight since Internet Explorer 11 Installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davederrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Silverlight since Internet Explorer 11 Installed</h2>
                    <p>I use Silverlight particularly for reading maps etc on the Ordnance Survey Site. PC uses Windows 7 64 bit OS with WSP 1. When Internet Explorer 11 was installed a couple of months ago I had to add the Ordnance Survey to the IE 11 Compatability List.&nbsp;Also
 every time I now try to load up the Ordnance Survey site, the screen goes black and a User Account Control Window comes up asking if I want to all the following programme to make changes to this computer; the following programme named as being Silverlight.
 It doesn't matter whether I click "yes" or "no" the result is the same. That is, the&nbsp;Ordnance Survey&nbsp;site immediately loads and I can see the maps and do I all want with them. By the way, I checked with Microsoft Silverlight site which confirms I have the
 latest version of Silverlight installed. How can I stop the User Account Control Window appearing. Any help gratefully received. Thanks, Dave.</p>

I have an 6280. When I type in text manually I get the text on the screen that the word is saved so I do not have to do it myself. I want the opposite. I want to be asked if I want to save the word but that is not possible.

<p>I do have an Office E4 Enterprise Lic. and documentation seems to indicate that I can configure a handset for skype to skype calls with the E4 Lic.</p>
<p>The phone has been updated to latest Software and has the option to configure Lync enabled however I seem to be missing teh Server name which is nowhere in my account profile or settings.</p>

<p>Hi Derrick,</p>
<p>To identify if the issue is related to the settings on VVX 500 handset, please confirm the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;For “the option to configure the phone within Skype for Business Online seems to be missing”, can you provide more details? Some screenshots would be appreciated.<br />
2.&nbsp;For “documentation seems to indicate that I can configure a handset for Skype to Skype calls with the E4 license”, can you provide the documentation (the link of it) here for analysis?<br />
3.&nbsp;About “I seem to be missing tech Server name”, do you mean it pops up asking for the tech sever name when configuring Skype for Business with the handset? You may also upload a screenshot about it so that we can have a better understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>To upload a screenshot: Click “Use rich formatting”&gt; “Insert Media”.</p>
<p>You may refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788944.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>hi derrick,</p>
<p>thanks for the detailed information.<br />
based on your description, i understand you want to find the server address on the vvx 500 handset. since we are not familiar with the settings in the device and
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788944.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the document</a>&nbsp;mentioned as screenshot shows below, to avoid any misunderstanding, we would suggest you turn to each vendor's website for expert help as screenshot shows below:<br />

<p>Hi Derrick,</p>
<p>As we said before, we are not familiar with the settings while configuring the VVX 500 Handset. We don’t know whether the server address refers to Skype for Business online server address. If so, you can try “sipdir.online.lync.com:443” and check the result.
 It is used for both the internal and external server addresses while manually signing in to Skype for Business.</p>
<p>In addition, based on my experience, the user can set “Special Interop” to be “Auto” if the DNS records of Skype for Business are added correctly. Via this step, the address will be set automatically. If it is possible, you can try it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have done much research and found no Office 365 official document/blog regarding this.
</p>
<p>Given the situation, we suggest you contact the handset vendor’s official website for further help if the above methods can’t meet your requirement. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

            As suggested, would copy this PST file to a location on your hard drive outside of a system level folder (something other than Documents or Program Files) and reboot your system to ensure that all file locks on this file are eliminated.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, don't have a system handy using the Office 365 web apps (which is assumed to be the case in this instance) so not sure if that has different impact from using the full Office 2013 desktop client. Hopefully someone else may have some more
 direct/relevant experience in that scenario.</div>

            <p>Very late to the party but I had exactly the same problem trying to import an unprotected PST onto a different machine. (Office 2007).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution for my version is straightforward: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find outlook.exe. Right click and "Run as administrator".&nbsp; You can then import the PST file with no problem. Works for Outlook 2007.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I figured it out by myself after the Microsoft "help" person hung up on me when I asked her to spell a word I could not understand!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to "this pc" I used the icon on the bottom of the computer screen (looks like a bunch of file folders with something blue in front of them.) This will show you your different devices and drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>click on the icon for your back up hard drive to open it and show files on it. (may need to right click on this icon to get to properties to make sure your devise had not somehow got labeled "read only too)</p>
<p>
</p><p>click to select "backup"( from outlook 7 in my case), a .pst file. it will appear as if highlighted in blue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go up to the "home" tab (just right of the file tab) and click it to make a strip menu appear just below it. Select "copy to" and a drop down menu appears . I chose "documents"&nbsp; by clicking it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A box opened showing a green line that showed the progress of the computer copying the file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I went back to outlook&nbsp; clicked on file, then the export tab. then open and export, which makes a box appear. I clicked "import from another program or file and then next.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>New page appears select pst file and then click next which opens a new window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>select browse and find your backup.pst file in "documents" under "this pc" and double click it&nbsp; they should all appear.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was proud of myself, thus I posted this. I am 59 3/8 years old I am a professional artist and art instructor
<strong>and I solved</strong> a problem that 4 hours of searching help, forums, chatting with people who were and were not micro soft but tried to look like they were and talking to a help line lady who hung up on me (grrrr!!!!)! didn't. People stereotype artists
 and older women as technophobic so that triples my satisfaction in finding a solution myself, so there may be a big difference to you in some way I don't understand
<strong>BUT end results is I have what I need to run my business.</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>The other issue I had with your post is that you explicitly identified the help person being from Microsoft when in fact there was no certainty that was the case (and in fact, I would seriously doubt that to be the case). Am sure you'd be equally upset if
 someone accused you of something publicly that wasn't valid. These posts hang around for a long time for others to read.</p>

            <p>Same problem, but I could see the .pst file in C:\users\(me)\Documents\Outlook files</p>
<p>Go up one level to the Outlook files folder</p>
<p>Right click on Outlook files folder</p>
<p>Right&nbsp;click properties</p>
<p>Left click Security tab</p>
<p>Left click on yourself (mine says Home Users)</p>
<p>Make sure you have full control, if not click on Edit then check Full Control</p>
<p>Click on Apply</p>
<p>restart Outlook (not sure if necessary)</p>
<p>This worked for me after upgrading from Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10</p>

            Hi Carol
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Use the below formula
<br />
<br />=SUMPRODUCT((MONTH(A7:A28)=MONTH(TODAY()))*(YEAR(A7:A28)=YEAR(TODAY()))*(I7:I28)*(M7:M28&lt;&gt;"Yes"))
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>

<p>[Correcting some critical misunderstandings....]</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, alternatively for March 2019:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS(I7:I28, M7:M28, "&lt;&gt;yes", A7:A28, "&gt;=" &amp; DATE(2019,3,1), A7:A28, "&lt;=" &amp; DATE(2019,3,31))</p>
<p>
</p><p>For today's month:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS(I7:I28, M7:M28, "&lt;&gt;yes", A7:A28, "&gt;=" &amp; EOMONTH(TODAY(),-1)+1, A7:A28, "&lt;=" &amp; EOMONTH(TODAY(),0))</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>=SUMIFS(I7:I28, M7:M28, "&lt;&gt;yes", A7:A28, "&gt;" &amp; EOMONTH(TODAY(),-1), A7:A28, "&lt;=" &amp; EOMONTH(TODAY(),0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the second form (better, IMHO), be mindful of "&gt;" (greater than) v. "&gt;=" (greater or equal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>Nitpick....&nbsp; It is risky to call TODAY() multiple times.&nbsp; In the last "tick" (15.625 msec) before midnight, the result can be different values for TODAY(), resulting in inconsistencies among the several calculations.&nbsp; Arguably, extremely unlikely; but I've
 seen it affect users.&nbsp; Technically, better to enter =TODAY() into a single cell and to have multiple references to it.</p>

<h2>            Excel - drag without formatting</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Is there a way to drag the contents of a cell to be replicated in cells below, without formatting? The only options that I can see after I left-click on the cell and drag are:</p>
<p>- copy cells</p>
<p>- fill series</p>
<p>- fill formatting only</p>
<p>- fill without formatting</p>
<p>- flash fill</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't want to "fill without formatting", I want to "copy without formatting". There does not seem to be this option.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            On the basis of my experiment, Fill without Formatting is equivalent to Copy without Formatting.
<br />
<br />I put =A1+B1 in a cell and formatted it. When I do Fill without Formatting, formulas get copied and formatting is not copied.
<br />
<br />I also put a value 1 in a cell and repeated it with the same result.
<br />
<br />Could you please let me know what is the difference which you are finding between two?

            Hi - specifically I want to remove the "borders" formatting. I have a date in field #1 of a table. When I left-click and drag down, the numbers increase incrementally. If I select "copy cells" from the dropdown menu, then all the cells are filled with
 the original date however the borders remain. If I select "fill without formatting", the borders are removed, however the dates remain incremental.

            Thanks for clarification. The only way out is after copy cells is to remove formatting. (or Paste as values and apply date formatting)

<p>Hi - thank you so much for taking the time to assist, however I've now somehow managed to finally find a shortcut to this after much internet searching!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Select the range of cells into which you want to enter all the same values.</p>
<p>2. Type the value (in my case, a date)</p>
<p>3. Hit ctrl-enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the cells filled with the date, without extra borders inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
