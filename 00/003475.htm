    <title>How do I adjust the new task subject field height in Outlook 2013&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I adjust the new task subject field height in Outlook 2013&#63;</h2>
                    Whenever I compose a new task in Outlook 2013, the letters in the task subject cell/field have their bottoms cut off.&nbsp; For example, the letters gjp, etc are cut in half, and that makes the task subject difficult to read as you're tying it.&nbsp; Is there any
 way to adjust the height so the full letters are shown?&nbsp; I tried changing the row text sizes and that makes all tasks spread out but the task subject letters are still cut off when composing a new task.

<h2>            Sync all Office 365 company user details to iOS Contacts</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 365 tenant with about 150 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to add my account details into iOS and sync all the company users name, email and phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason this seems an incredible difficult task for what should be straight forward.</p>

NO REGISTRY KEY, AS FAR AS I HAVE FOUND. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>HOWEVER, THE INTERNET HAS PROVIDED A SOLUTION TO THIS VERY ANNOYING PROBLEM. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>IN EACH OFFICE PROGRAM THAT YOU USE, NAVIGATE THROUGH:</div>
<div><br />
<div>FILE -&gt; OPTIONS -&gt; CUSTOMIZE RIBBON</div>
<div><br />
<div>THERE, YOU WILL WANT TO SELECT "ALL TABS" UNDER THE "CUSTOMIZE THE RIBBON" COLUMN TO THE RIGHT. &nbsp;NOW YOU CAN MAKE CHANGES TO THE NAMES. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>SELECT EACH TAB AND PRESS THE "RENAME" BUTTON. &nbsp;</li><li>ADD A SPACE IN FRONT OF EACH NAME. &nbsp;</li><li>SAVE THE CHANGES. &nbsp;</li></ul>
<div>There, you're done. &nbsp;Finally, your UI isn't screaming at you anymore. &nbsp;Kinda nice, isn't it! &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Nokia 215 text with smileys</h2>
                    <p>I can only see punctuation marks for smileys instead of face pics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user guide says "To insert special characters, such as a smiley or symbol, select Options &gt; Insert options." But when I do this I get a list of punctuation marks &nbsp;eg. :-) &nbsp;rather than an emoji face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also when I receive a text message with a smiley from someone else it shows the punctuation marks rather than face pic as intended by the sender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I set my 215 to show emoji face symbols in SMS texts, and if so how? Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

            Is it so that the phone actually tranlates (unicode) emojis to (ascii) characters? I think that is a quite solid feature for a phone that doesn't have native emoji support. Do you know how many emojis it translates?

<h2>            VB&#58;  WITH selection of ROWS,  exclude hidden rows,  not&#58;  .visible</h2>
                    <p>hi,&nbsp; i came up with a way to select the header, that is pretty automated.&nbsp; not sure if used all the best methods but the next step is to exclude hidden rows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i do not think the .visible option will be desireable ?&nbsp; as i do not want to exclude hidden columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do i exclude hidden rows from a header selection?&nbsp; i am using:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RANGE("A1" &amp; ":" &amp; Cells(ActiveWindow.SplitRow, RANGE("A1").Column).address(0, 0), Cells(1, Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft)).Select&nbsp;&nbsp; 'YES!!&nbsp; now exclude hidden rows<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>took awhile to get that :)&nbsp; wasn't pretty..</p>
<p>i found 1 example, not sure if applies:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (NOTE:&nbsp; so this might be simpler than thought? / just part of another if then added to loop vb below.&nbsp; was originally thinking had to be part of range line above;&nbsp; but..&nbsp; do not see a reference to "i" )</p>
<p>
</p><pre>For i = 2 To 20 
    If Not Rows(i).Hidden 
      <span>'do stuff</span>
      <span>'do stuff</span>
    End If 
End With </pre>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----------</p>
<p>
</p><p>i will be using as part of other vb,&nbsp; so dimming or setting ok?&nbsp; will be running a loop on selected cells..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sub xLOOP()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim s, c As RANGE&nbsp;&nbsp; '(selection, cell)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set s = Selection&nbsp;&nbsp; 'YES<br />

            Hello vinay1986, what kind of reset did you do *#7370# or the three finger salute method? Once i had to do the three finger salute method and the updates were available again when i checked it using the software update option in the phone itself.

Who knows. Maybe MSE removed critical files as false positives. Maybe there was an infection that was somehow resolved but caused all these "lost things" that now need repair and David is using MSE. Is it truly crucial to know when fixing the problem and helping
 David is the important part rather than quizzing him on his reason for posting here? Maybe he doesn't even have MSE but still had an infection that instructions in this forum helped him resolve in part (except for this remaining aspect). If it is MSE, I do
 appreciate how knowing why he thinks it pertains might help identify the problem and suggest alternatives - but I believe helping with the problem presented takes priority and that the answer to this question (if needed) will be revealed at some point in the
 effort to deal with the posted problem (quite likely the next reply if the suggestions identified below don't do the trick and we actually do need more information to proceed).&nbsp; If the point is to find a reason to move it elsewhere (as opposed to answering
 it), that will soon become clear and I'm sure a Mod will do so if found&nbsp;to be appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect a typo in the error code and am assuming you meant 0xc004D301 instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out the following to see if it helps: <a href="http://www.laptopgpsworld.com/3768-error-0xc004d301-microsoft-streets-trips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.laptopgpsworld.com/3768-error-0xc004d301-microsoft-streets-trips</a>. There are a couple of suggestions, but the best is possibly the last which includes a link to get you to support where a patch to fix this problem apparently exists and resolves
 the problem once installed. I believe that will do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps. If not, what caused you to lose all these "things"? Was it an infection or a corrupted hard drive or did you do a re-installation of the OS or do you have no clue at all? Are you certain you are not currently infected and, if so, what
 leads you to believe that? And I suppose answering PA Bear's question becomes truly important at this point as well - so please include that in your reply along with your version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

If the OP follows my instructions, then the problem may be resolved and the answer moot.&nbsp; If it isn't resolved, then I too have reinforced your request in the part directed to him - so we'll get it in the next reply as you wanted unless there's no longer a
 problem and then maybe we will or won't get any reply at all.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often answer questions here that don't pertain to MSE without first asking how it pertains before doing so (in fact, I've seen less than 6 responders - and that's probably a gross exaggeration as I suspect it's more like 2-3 - and&nbsp;would welcome evidence
 suggesting it is far wider spread as that would suggest I need to see a doctor about my memory since I've read EVERY post here since late February - ever ask that as the first and only question at least in this forum and, if a question is too vague to find
 an answer without questions - and that does happen, then it seems that far more is typically needed besides just that and most who do ask questions to clarify the problem generally target those which will help&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;potential solutions and rarely do I see
 that question&nbsp;included even then though 4 or 5 which are related and useful are often included which, by being answered, will actually answer this one without needing to specifically ask it directly)&nbsp;- I'll be happy to provide dozens of examples of hundreds
 or more&nbsp;occurrences&nbsp;including many by both of us and our Moderator and Microsoft personnel (but not in this thread).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many times have you yourself provided links to Hotmail/MSN or how to handle SPAM calls or emails or answers to IE questions you know by heart and know don't pertain to MSE but do so because you can, because you know it will help and provide that help
 faster, without first needing to ask this even though you didn't know the answer in those cases either before providing a recommendation, referral, or answer?&nbsp; And if the referral it to another site in Answers as opposed to somewhere where a move isn't possible,
 you'll often still answer (if you can) rather than simply post a referral to the proper place to post (to which&nbsp;it'll probably be moved anyway). &nbsp;I don't see where this situation differs to any great extent.&nbsp; I see it more as speculation that it does not pertain
 and thus a way to avoid answering or finding a place to refer it rather&nbsp;than valuable information that&nbsp;is on it's own a&nbsp;pre-requisite&nbsp;to answering the OP's question given, as in the previously mentioned situations, we quite probably know enough to provide
 a valid recommendation (or at least I think I did though I admit it's no guarantee but an educated guess based on experience that I sincerly think will work - &nbsp;and that's sometimes true even when the pertinence is obvious).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't mean&nbsp;to speculate on the reasons why it may or may not pertain (though I did mention some that I acknowledge as unsubstantiated possibilities and that the OP can no doubt provide a more clear answer) but that&nbsp;is actually of little concern to me
 at this point&nbsp;- I was meaning merely to question why we need to delay providing a potential solution while awaiting that piece of information (though I&nbsp;would understand if many pertinent questions were asked and, if what I imagine would be needed was all included
 in the course of doing so, strongly believe the answer to this would become obvious and not need to be asked).&nbsp; I have no problems with BOTH offering the possible solution AND asking questions if the solution doesn't work to save time - but just asking this
 one&nbsp;question (which seems insufficient without many others if you can't identify a solution based on what is provided)&nbsp;when there's a link that addresses this exact question seems like an even better opportunity to save time and potentially resolve the problem.&nbsp;
 And again, we do this frequently without knowing how MSE pertains (or even being&nbsp;virtually certain&nbsp;beyond speculation&nbsp;that it doesn't).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this adequately&nbsp;explain my rationale and is it OK with you?&nbsp; If not, let's continue elsewhere and not in this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take care (and please don't take this personally as I'm questioning the concept and&nbsp;not you&nbsp;- and as you once said to me elsewhere&nbsp;"no offense intended").</p>

<h2>            Workaround for Connected POP Account issues.</h2>
                    <p><span>Please follow the steps below to fix issues with your POP account. If the steps below do not resolve your issue, please reach out to Outlook community for more support.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Update your POP account settings. </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Got to </span><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/connections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/connections</span></a></li><li><span>Sign in with your Microsoft account. </span></li><li><span>You should be able to see the status of the account as “Update failed”.<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 27pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55868fb2-6b0f-4bae-a96d-281c9ed3807f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55868fb2-6b0f-4bae-a96d-281c9ed3807f" /></a><br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the account and go to “Edit connected accounts” page by either double clicking on the account or clicking on the pencil icon.<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 27pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23c809b2-18a2-4136-90f3-453ba244dd2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23c809b2-18a2-4136-90f3-453ba244dd2f" /></a><br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Update the password of the account and save the settings. </span></li><li><span>Please wait for some time for account status to turn from “pending update” to “Up to date”</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Only necessary if Step 1 did not resolve your issue.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In some cases, updating the password (using steps above) might not work and status of the message would show “pending update” or show “update failed”. Sometimes major mail providers block the connection on POP and requires the users to explicitly enable
 it on their accounts via mail provider settings. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For Gmail POP account follow steps available at </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en</span></a></p>
<p><span>For Yahoo POP account follow the steps available at </span><a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/SLN27791.html?impressions=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/SLN27791.html?impressions=true</span></a></p>
<p><span>For all other email providers, please contact them for steps on how to get unblocked.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3:&nbsp; If Steps 1 and 2 did not resolve the issue you will need to remove your POP account and reconfigure it as IMAP connection.
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above steps are not helping and your email server supports getting emails through IMAP. You should consider switching to use IMAP instead. IMAP provide lots of advantages over using POP. IMAP provides ability to sync changes to all of the folders
 and not just inbox. The changes are synced across all of your devices. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To remove the failing POP account, select the account and remove the same by clicking on ‘trash’ icon.
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b5ebfe6-50fc-4c98-97a2-f43b59f4c8f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b5ebfe6-50fc-4c98-97a2-f43b59f4c8f0" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><br />
Once the account is removed, try adding it again. Remember to select “Create a new folder for imported email, with subfolders like in the account you connect” .</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the steps but the vast majority of us with POP Email problems is because the new Outlook.com cannot connect to a large number of POP servers like GoDaddy, Zoho, and Network Solutions. &nbsp;So maybe you as a moderator can push this along because it's
 been a problem since the release and they just "archived" my 3 month long support request without solving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I have confirmed that everyone else in the world can work with the GoDaddy POP based email servers except the Outlook.com team. &nbsp;Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook Desktop 2010, the Old Outlook (Live, Hotmail), and even a simple VB6 app I pulled down from
 Plant Source Code I think it as I compiled up in a few minutes and was downloading my messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the update and bad news for everyone as of 10/14/2016 who get the error message when trying to add a connected account in Outlook.com that reads "The POP server doesn't support features needed to download email". &nbsp;Also for users who their accounts
 just never update because you added a connected account and Outlook.com configured it as an IMAP account instead of a POP one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is from the Microsoft Global Escalation Services support tech I've been working with for months.<br />
</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>
 We are currently in work to implement the fix and there is no ETA for same.</span></p>
<p>
<p>
 you have any other questions or concerns.</span></p>
<p>
<p>
 Your feedback will help us improve the Microsoft Support experience. Thank you.</span></p>
<p>
<p>
</p><p>Now even worse is that they are archiving the service request even though it is not resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What he told me over the phone is that it's both a problem on GoDaddy's end and on Microsoft's. &nbsp;They are saying that GoDaddy does not support the full POP RFC Specifications so they are working to implement a workaround. &nbsp;But once it is implemented it gets
 pushed out in multiple "Forests" so my guess is 6 months after the first implementation all users might get it by how long it has taken to migrate all the existing users over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how come everyone else including Microsoft's own Desktop Outlook 2010 can do it? &nbsp;Because I'll be honest here in that the Outlook.com team is horrible to say the least. &nbsp;With the number of bugs I've come across and them not being able to resolves something
 the rest of the world and Microsoft themselves has been able to do for decades proves how incompetent this team is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For them to blame even part of it on GoDaddy is ridiculous. &nbsp;For Microsoft's Outlook.com lead programmer to not contact GoDaddy with the specifications of what they need supported to make Microsoft's (and only Microsoft's) products work with it goes to show
 how little they actually care about their Outlook.com product. &nbsp;Let alone all of the other email systems it is also not working with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way to keep long term users on your ecosystem. &nbsp;How I wish I was programming for Apple users instead of Windows users these days.</p>

<h3> joadams7jr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Archieve emails 2016</h2>
                    We need to archieve email folders to free up space on outlook as we have been told that is why we have problems with the running of it sometimes. We have some project email folders which we are not currently using but we may need access to in the future.
 What is the best way to archieve and how can it be done?

            <p>That’s only for Online Archiving, with the servers that support it.<br />If you just want to take the data off the server, you can simply copy messages to the On My Computer section of Outlook.<br />For long time storage outside of Outlook, and assuming there are little chances you’ll need to get back to the emails, you can export to a .olm archive. If you need anything back, you’ll need to reimport the archive. This is not live storage like a PST in Windows.<br />You could drag messages and folders to the desktop to create an mbox (that you could them import in a number of other software)<br />For anything else, I’d use a third party solution. There are a number of apps out there that can do it. I usually use EagleFiler which does a very good jobs at sucking out the emails, though there are many many other options out there.

Modify the formatting of the paragraph in the Footnote Text style to remove the space before/after the paragraph.

<br />
Select the number of levels you wish to show in your TOC under “Show levels”.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the Index and Tables window, put check marks in all three boxes:<br />
- Show page numbers<br />
- Right align page numbers<br />
- Use hyperlinks instead of page numbers<br />
<br />
Tab Leader: Select “………”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Select OK.<br />

<br />
Step 6: Click OK to close the Modify Style window.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Step 7:&nbsp; Repeat Steps 3 - 6 for each TOC level.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Page Numbering Alignment in TOC</strong><br />
<br />
Step 1: Highlight the entire TOC, go to Format | Tabs. Tabs window displays. Select one at a time the Alignment: Left button, Tab Stops field should be empty. Leader: None. Default stops: 0”. Do this again, this time selecting Alignment: Right. Click OK. Close

    <title>Outlook 2013 Disappearing IMAP folders, lost mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgrharry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 Disappearing IMAP folders, lost mail</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Have a client that is using Outlook 2013 with a GoDaddy hosted IMAP email account. This was recently setup and they created a number of new folders by right clicking on the left side near Inbox and selecting New Folder. They then moved a number of very important
 emails into several of these folders. Within several minutes they started receiving popups in Outlook stating something along the lines of "IMAP server does not allow a top level folder created here" at which point the folders began to show up on the side
 with the tag (This computer only) indicating they were now local only folders. This wouldn't have been a problem if the emails could be copied back out of the folders and into the Inbox but after several minutes the folders all disappeared from the tree listing
 and were nowhere to be found, not in the trash and no longer on the server. Unfortunately the only other computer configured with OL2013 and this same IMAP account was turned on and synced the changes before it could be taken offline to export the missing
 emails. Spoke to GoDaddy tech support and had them roll the mailbox to two days prior but the emails are still not on the server.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I understand that OL2013 has made major changes to IMAP operations and now uses an OST file to store data. Any idea if there is a way to extract these disappeared "This computer only" folders from the OST file?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced something like this?&nbsp; I know OL2013 is buggy but this is ridiculous.<br />

            This is not helpful at all.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I understand that OL2013 uses an OST file to store IMAP and local data but your suggestion to export the folders is of no help since as I described in my original post they have disappeared.&nbsp; This appears to be a serious bug in Outlook 2013.
<br />
<br />
For the future I was able to create a new folder via webmail which then showed up in Outlooks IMAP folder list and I can then create subfolders within that folder that do not automatically self destruct.&nbsp; That's fine for the future but I still need to recover
 the lost emails if possible. <br />

            You should have exported those particular folders as PST file, as of now there is no ways to restore the emails.<br />

            The folders were created and then disappeared (without Outlook being closed) within a span for 3-5 minutes.&nbsp; Had they stayed in place I certainly would have exported them but it wasn't immediately evident what was happening and there was no logical reason
 to assume that Outlook would behave the way it did.&nbsp; I have read the article you link to, it has no bearing on this particular issue.<br />
<br />
Not trying to start a flame war here but releasing buggy and half baked software like Office 2013 will cause MS to bleed even more customers to Gmail &amp; Google Apps, Apple, or open source alternatives like LibreOffice and Thunderbird.&nbsp; In a time when more and
 more customers are abandoning Exchange due to the dominance of Android and iOS phones (which both offer Exchange-like email, contact, and calendar syncing) you would think Microsoft might have made a serious effort to improve it's support for open standards
 like IMAP.&nbsp; Instead they seem to have executed a poorly thought out and glitchy redesign of Outlook as a whole and it's IMAP support in particular.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Another bug I've encountered is that there appears to be no way to turn off IMAP server notifications in Outlook and yet it will allow you to request illegal folder deletions from the IMAP server.&nbsp; For example GoDaddy's IMAP server has a special folder named
 Send Later or something along those lines.&nbsp; Outlook will allow you to delete this folder but it will then be recreated by the server and Outlook will proceed to bombard you will popups every few minutes stating "Your IMAP server wants to alert you to the following:
 cannot remove system folder."&nbsp; (Other's have noted this bug as well, see this discussion: http://support.godaddy.com/groups/email/forum/topic/outlook-2013-errorimap-server-cannot-remove-system-folder/)&nbsp; The only solution to this is to remove and recreate your
 Outlook profile and redownload all your mail.<br />

 BTW...I am NOT going to backup my .pst file after each and every e-mail is moved to a folder...that's just ridiculous.&nbsp; I should be able to trust that the software will save what&nbsp;I want saved, am I wrong?</p>

 of the folders that were there.&nbsp; After about an hour everything disappeared!&nbsp; Occasionally I got an error message while working in outlook saying "your IMAP server wants to alert you to the following folders cannot be created in a the system folder."&nbsp; Though
 not as technical as some of the users above, I'm used to working in Outlook and creating and working with folders.&nbsp; I ran all windows updates, and any security patches should have been picked up. &nbsp;I had Geek Squad working with this issue for many hours of
 remote access.&nbsp; They could not recover any of the email or folders.&nbsp; They still can't tell me how to fix to prevent future issues.&nbsp; I tried creating some test folders today, and still get that system error.&nbsp; They said maybe the godaddy server is the issue,
 with some kind of server settings, or it's a Microsoft Outlook 2013 issue.&nbsp; It's very frustrating and as of yet have no fix!&nbsp; I'm with the user above-no time to back up every email.</p>

            Same thing happened with me. I had several important mails stored on those folders. How can MS simply&nbsp;get away with this blunder. I noticed another issue. I am taking File History backup (Window 10). When I tried to recover .ost from backup hard disk&nbsp;
 then I am shocked to see that File History do not include AppData folder into backup.&nbsp;Is there any way to recover those folders.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi CherryDog,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information. Also please provide some information to narrow down the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Let us know how did the error show up. Is it by Sync Error logs, Non-delivery Report or etc. Please provide a screenshot to understand the scenario.</p>
<p>2.) If this is an NDR, check if there are large attachments on the mail and try to lessen the size of the attachment. You can refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3146087/error-when-you-use-outlook-for-mac-to-send-a-large-email-message-through-exchange-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> since you use an exchange server.</p>
<p>3.) Please send us the troubleshooting logs with the following steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. In Outlook, go to "Tool"&gt; “Sync Errors” &gt; Gear Icon &gt; “Turn on logging”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Restart and say "Leave Logging on" and <strong>reproduce the issue</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. From Finder, under Go menu&gt; Go to Folder ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Outlook/Data/Library/Logs&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.

    <title>Lumia 920 strange problem with APN settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jshaw1976  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920 strange problem with APN settings</h2>
                    <p>I recently did a factory reset in an attempt to recover wireless charging (apparently hardware issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the reset all my settings were working fine -- settings I entered myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reset everything seemed to be functioning as normal, except for MMS.</p>
<p>I looked up the correct settings (https://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB424489&amp;cv=820) and went into "Access Point" and added new APN settings.</p>
<p>I was quickly able to enter MMS info and pics began working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the internet APN settings include a proxy port (80), but no proxy address.</p>
<p>The Access Point app won't save the APN settings w/o something in the proxy address line if there is something in the proxy port line.</p>
<p>I was able to make it work by removing the proxy port, but I don't know what, if any consequences there are in doing that.</p>

            <p>Jim and all, I think I found the culprit and I did a new smiley face entry as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having text cursor issue where text and curser do not line up horizontally.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only happens when the page is larger than the screen and sliders appear side and bottom that allow you to move the page around so you can see everything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the sliders appear they take image space and cause the page to resize smaller and shifted to the right slightly in the viewing window. &nbsp;However, the ruler above does not adjust and the page is actually no longer in alignment with the ruler.
 &nbsp;What must be happening is the cursor remains aligned with the ruler but the character image is not. &nbsp;The cursor is still adjusting itself to the variables of character spacing and not to the physical display of said text. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the text resizes but the cursor remains locked to the original dimensions and to the ruler at the top which does not changes to match the smaller document image.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not template specific. &nbsp;It happens with every and all templates including the standard ones. &nbsp;Look closely at this screen shot.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f35febf-f35f-43ae-b5ee-351331e0dbb3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is specific to my Retina iMac. &nbsp;Please fix, it is a royal pain.</p>

    <title>Excel 2010 vs 2007 - complex INDIRECT use and data validation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian gilmore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 vs 2007 - complex INDIRECT use and data validation</h2>
                    I'm doing a complex function in data validation using indirect. It worked in Excel 2007 but when the file is opened it Excel 2010 there is an error about "unreadable content". If the user chooses to recover the contents, the repairs listed are:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Removed Feature: Data validation from /xl/worksheets/sheet2.xml part</div>
<div>Removed Feature: Conditional formatting from /xl/worksheets/sheet2.xml part"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not concerned with the conditional formatting, but after the repair, my data validation functions are removed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is a rough structure of what I'm doing using data validation/indirect:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>User has to make series of selections - selection1 is primary, selection2 depends on selection1, selection3 depends on selection2. Each row is a different choice for selection1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the example given below, selection1 is in cell A1, selection2 is in cell A2, selection3 is in cell A3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Users makes selection 1 from a plain vanilla data validation list, example is "X1, Y1, Z1"</div>
<div>Based on selection1 choice, selection2 drop down is populated with "X1_A, X1_B, X1_C", "Y1_A, Y1_B, Y1_C" or "Z1_A, Z1_B, Z1_C". These exist as lists on a seperate sheet.</div>
<div>Based on selection2 choice, selection3 drop down is populated with "Yes, No" or "NA". These exist as a list on a seperate page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As mentioned, selection 1 is a plain vanilla data validation list.</div>
<div>Selection2 data validation formula is "=INDIRECT(VLOOKUP(A1,Selection2_List_Table,2,0)):INDIRECT(VLOOKUP(A1,Selection2_List_Table,3,0))</div>
<div>Selection3 data validation formula is "=INDIRECT(VLOOKUP(A2,Compiler_Table,2,0)):INDIRECT(VLOOKUP(A2,Compiler_Table,3,0))"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know if there is an acceptable way to build these data validations in Excel 2010 using Indirect, that would also work in Excel 2007? I have a split user base and I can't guarantee any particular user will have the same version of Excel if I
 pick just one.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't replace the INDIRECTs with named ranges, because the selections could be different in every row.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The one work around I can think of is to use a set of cells in each row to build the lists for selection2, selection3 and then have the data validation just point to those cells per row, but this breaks the flexibility of being able to update or expand
 the tables easily. Also, in the real spreadsheet there are actually selection 3-12, all dependent in the same way of selection2.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            i have the same problems if i'm using an .xls file in the compatibility mode. I have no problem at all with .xlsx files.
<br />
<br />
But in my eyes the data validation in 2010 is less stable than it used to be in 2007. I have sheets which are working properly in 2007 and 2003 (.xls) and now in 2010 they suddenly generate a warning when saving in compatibility mode.
<br />

    <title>SendObject Method Doesn&#39;t Work in MS Access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jtowne  say:</h3>
<h2>            SendObject Method Doesn&#39;t Work in MS Access 2010</h2>
                    I've developed several databases in Access 2000 (Office 2000 on a Windows 2000 machine) that allow the user to send e-mails from within Access using the DoCmd.SendObject method. We had to install Office 2000 SR-3 to get it to work, but it works great.
 Our e-mail program is Lotus Notes 8.5.X.<br />
My agency is "Upgrading" to Windows 7 (Office 2010 and MS Access version 14), and, with Lotus Notes 8.5.1 properly installed and profiled, we get the following error message(s).<br />
"There is no email program associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control Panel."<br />
<br />
Does Microsoft know about this, and, if so, what's being done?<br />
Anybody got a fix or work-around?

<p>Installing Office with Outlook will change the default email client. In the registry editor, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail and change the (Default) value from "Microsoft Outlook" back to "Lotus Notes". This will tell Windows to use Notes
 as the default email client instead of Outlook.</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t switch hotmail accounts, they&#39;ve disappeared</h2>
                    Since last night I can't switch Hotmail accounts, they've disappeared. I used to be able to switch them by clicking on my name in the right corner. I can't log in to them separately either as they were made a long time ago (I think like aliases, but there
 was an option to switch between them). Now I can't access them.

            Same here! But it's Microsoft messing around again with things that used to work perfectly well and now changing them (eg no-one liking Outlook anymore because it's too slow, everyone wants Hotmail back!). They sent out a warning a few weeks ago saying
 that in future we'd have to log out of one account and then log into another. I've just experienced the same thing for the first time and what a pain it is. They think we've got nothing better to do with our time but play around with hotmail. They treat us
 like children - saying it's all about security - well isn't it up to us to decide how secure we want to make our accounts? The vast majority of us are just normal folk trying to access our day-to-day emails, not dealing with national security issues! It's
 all so much easier with gmail - I've now opened up 2 accounts between which I can flick just like it used to be with hotmail, no, sorry, Outlook !!<br />

            I'm quite aware of that and pointed it out in my reply above. That doesn't get away from the fact that Microsoft is just making life so much harder for everyone. I've just signed out of one account and it took me ages to get into my other. Why can't you
 just treat us like adults and let us decide how much security we want on our accounts rather than acting like "Big Brother". As I said above, gmail is so much easier.<br />

It will make you an iso for the current public build.&nbsp; You can right click the .iso file and mount.. then run the setup to do an inplace update.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe make a system image for backup before so, then if something goes haywire.. easy to get back to where you
 were.<br />
<br />
If you have a 3rd party Anti-Virus you might consider uninstalling it before upgrading, same with any google products which sometimes have issues with installs -&nbsp; install them back afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporarily Unplug any non essential usb/firewire/printer/etc&nbsp;
 before the upgrade is wise.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I dual booted until last July, then upgraded all to RTM.</p>
<p>If you have a few extra dollars go to eBay and get yourself a cheap Lenovo ThinkPad R500 laptop and Windows 7 or 8.</p>
<p>I got one of mine for $36 and Windows 7 for $39.&nbsp; Had to upgrade to,SP1 and then to Windows 10 but it is one of my test laptops now.&nbsp; I did upgrade the Drive to SSD but I did not have to.&nbsp; This way I started off dual booting but since I
</p>
<p>had a little extra I got 6 laptops. Besides those that i already had&nbsp; two crashed due to hardware failing I am testing on three and have 2 on retail. This is besides my desktop which is running 10586.420</p>
<p>The most expensive on e was $209 but it came with Windows 7 and it had a camera and a decent sized hard drive which I replaced with a 500 GB SSD and it is now running Windows 10 retail on the Release Preview ring.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your time with trying to help Lawrence, its not about the money of getting a new PC - I would have paid lot more than cost of new PC just to have the lifetime of documents, profile settings, apps data as all my business &amp; personal documents are
 installed under the Windows10 profile which now cant be booted up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any other suggestions please let me know, trying to boot up by hitting F8 just brings the boot sequence but does not allow to boot WIN10 in Safe Mode or anything</p>

<p>I have the office home and student 2007 version, but for some resaon excel files won't open and i get an error message that says it's not a valid Win 32 application. I have tried to repair the file but it didn't help. I also don't want to uninstall the whole
 program with the fear of losing my existing files and using up my only remaning install (3/3).</p>
<p>I can open all files through the desktop icon ( excel 2007) but not by double clicking the shortcuts on my desktop?</p>

    <title>Excel XP - Character Sheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manilas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel XP - Character Sheet</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>
I am making a Dungeons and Dragon Character sheet Template and I would like to know if there is a way for excel to auto calculate this:<br />
<br />
In D&amp;D, there is a statistic we call Base Attack Bonus. This makes that a character can have multiple attacks. This stat is modified by strength modifier (or dexterity for ranged attacks) and other modifiers such as magical weapons.<br />
<br />
So, let's say that we have these stats<br />
Cell I16: Base Attack Bonus: 12 / 7 / 2<br />
Cell K16: Strength Modifier: 3<br />
Cell L16: Magical Weapon: 2<br />
<br />
How can I make excel automatically calculate these stats so that in my Total Attack Bonus cell, it would look like this: 17 / 12 / 7 (add strength and magical weapon bonus to each Base attack Bonus).</div>
</div>
<div>
----------------</div>
<div>
Specifications: Someone on Yahoo answer gave me this answer and it didn't work for me.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Your code should probably look something like:<br />
<br />
=Sum(base1+strmod+magicmod+featmod) &amp; '/' &amp; Sum(base2+strmod+magicmod+featmod) &amp; '/' &amp; Sum(base3+strmod+magicmod+featmod)<br />
<br />
The &amp; tells Excel that theses are separated items that it will display together, and the ' ' marks forces excel to display the character instead of treating it like a division sign.<br />
<br />
In short instead of making your base attack bonus a single piece of text (12/7/2) instead make it three separate numbers 12, 7, and 2. Then you can add and subtract freely and force excel to display the results the way you want.
</div>
<div>
---------------</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
So, my cells look like this</div>
<div>
I16 &nbsp;12,7,2 (if I try doing it the way I want [12/7/2], it changes those numbers to a date **** lol)</div>
<div>
K16: 4</div>
<div>
L16: 3</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
And P16 should be the summary of those 3 cells above and should like this: 19,14,9 (or 19/14/9 if it wouldn't change it to a date).</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
So, if I made some sense and get what I want to do, can anyone help me.</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/353a4413-b755-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5" title="MesbahJavid">MesbahJavid</a></p>
<p>I have a similar issue with retrieving archived emails bar the fact that my previously "Archived" emails have gone missing and I have lost all previous emails, including numerous folders specific to the information I am trying to keep saved.&nbsp; I use Office
 Home 365 and Outlook 2016 (or 365, not sure).</p>
<p>The last MS update has now set my "Auto Archive" back to the default and away from where I have it linked in to my personal "OneDrive".&nbsp; I know where the files are, but Outlook will not allow me to retrieve the files...&nbsp; This has not been the case for several
 years, hence you may appreciate the importance of "Retrieving" the important emails.</p>
<p>Can the files be retrieved via the server??&nbsp; No idea, sorry</p>
<p>Any advice please??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

<p>You shouldn't use an outlook data file that is stored in OneDrive - it wont sync to onedrive as long a its opened in outlook and if its huge and you shut down windows before its synced, the pst can be corrupted. You can copy the pst into onedrive for backup,
 just onyt open it in outlook - move it out of onedrive if you need to open it.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>is there an archive pst in OneDrive? Search your entire drive for *.pst files.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you&nbsp;<span>Diane,</span></p>
<p><span>I have searched but files must have been corrupted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Does "Auto Archive" save the file structure as well??&nbsp; Example; If I have made another folder and saved emails into said folder, will the folder be archived along with the contents??</span></p>
<p>My mistake with the saving to OneDrive.&nbsp; I wondered why it was taking so long to sync!!!&nbsp; I have changed settings now to an external hard drive that is then backed up in OneDrive.</p>

<p><span>Yes, it recreates the folder structure in the pst. But the autoarchive setting should be whatever is default. so the mail in it may or may not be archived on each run.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Since SP2 Outlook 2011 refuses to download full messages when they - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Since SP2 Outlook 2011 refuses to download full messages when they have a big &#40;5Mb&#43;&#41; attachment</h2>
                    Since SP2 for Outlook 2011 (Mac) we have the following problem on all our workstations (Lion and Snow Leopard):
<div>- When a mail has an attachment of about 5Mb or more, Outlook only partly downloads the message from the (Exchange SBS 2008) server. On top of the message there is a bar that tells 'This message has party been downloaded' And all attachments stay gray
 and can't be opened or previewed.</div>
<div>- There is a button in that bar 'Download full message' available, but it doesn't help. After a spinning indicator the message is still not downloaded</div>
<div>- Forwarding the message results in a send without attachments</div>
<div>- Deleting the message isn't possible, Outlook freezes with a spinning beach-ball cursor</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Solutions tried (without result):</div>
<div>- recreate mail-account</div>
<div>- delete mail database</div>
<div>- complete reinstallation of Office 2011 (after deleting all preferences, library-files and so on</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With Apple mail, in OWA and on the iPhone the same mails work perfectly, so it seems save to suppose the problem is not server sided.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hopefully someone has a way around, or this bug can be fixed somehow.</div>

            A restart of the server (in preparation of an Exchange update) appeared to solve the problem. I can't explain, but I'm glad it works again now.

            If you have the option to download using Outlook 14.1.4, this would help confirm it's Outlook Service Pack 2 (SP2) 14.2.1 as the culprit.<br />
<br />
Are you on Exchange 2007? Is it fully updated? We've seen a few odd issues with Outlook Service Pack 2 (SP2) 14.2.1 and Exchange 2007. It's possible both Outlook and Exchange 2007 will need to be patched to remedy.<br />
