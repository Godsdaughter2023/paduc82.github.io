<h2>            B doop sound on my laptop</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a new Dell Inspiron 5570 with Windows 10 and there is a constant, yet sporadic, sound that sometimes is once, twice or 3 times in a row. I assumed it was a notification but I have turned all notifications off in settings and control panel.
 I currently have nothing up but this page and it's going off as I type. Somebody PLEASE tell me how to find this and turn it off.</p>

            Hello Tracy,<br />
<br />
The sound that you're hearing when pressing a letter on your keyboard is a part of
<em>Filter Keys</em>. <em>Filter Keys</em> is a Windows feature that programs the keyboard to ignore repeated keystrokes to make typing easier for users. To turn
<em>Filter Keys</em> off, we recommend that you visit this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/how-do-i-turn-off-keyboard-sounds/859c376b-3e5e-4ae9-8f6a-b7be80d4aafe">

    <title>Samsung Easy Settings blocking Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Samsung Easy Settings blocking Windows Update</h2>
                    I have a Samsung Notebook 300E. I installed windows 10 some months ago, and it disabled Samsung Easy Settings (but did not tell me to remove it). All has been OK, but now, I cannot install the Anniversary Update because Windows Update says I must remove
 Easy Settings, but when I try to uninstall I get the message "This app has been blocked for your protection". What do I do now?

            <p>Well I seem to have solved this issue! (No thanks to Freddrick Pal.) As I said in my post of October 7, I had consulted</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/samsung-settings-for-windows-81/0fa8f361-8fa6-4f0a-a74c-a9292da124c7</p>
<p>and it was the suggestions given there by AKAStormSeeker on July 31 3015 that were the key. Basically, he worked out how to install Easy Settings, and I extended this to Uninstalling. So he deserves the kudos.</p>
<p>How to solve it:</p>
<p>In the situation where Windows 10 says that you need to Uninstall Samsung Easy Settings, but won't let you do so.</p>
<p>Try to Uninstall Easy Settings from Settings in the Start Menu. You will get an error message of the form</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>User Account Control</em><br />
<em>This app has been blocked for your protection</em><br />
<em>An administrator has blocked you from running this app. For more information, contact the administrator.</em><br />
<em>Program name: setup.exe</em><br />
<em>Publisher: Not trusted</em><br />
<em>File origin: Hard drive on this computer</em><br />
<em>Program location: "c:\Program Files (x86)\InstallShieldInstallation Information\{17283B95-21A8-4996-97DA-547A4D2B66F\setup.exe -runfromtemp -I0x0409 -removeonly</em></p>
<p>where I assume that the 'Program location' may differ in details. Note down the Program location (I don't think you can Copy it.) and use File Explorer to go to the directory specified. Following the advice from AKAStormSeeker, copy setup.exe in
 that directory, rename the copy to something useful, download the File Unsigner, and unsign the copy of setup.exe. You then need to run your (renamed and unsigned) copy of setup.exe with the switches as given in the error message. I did this by putting it
 into the upper textbox in File Explorer (for further details and methods see http://superuser.com/questions/747684/how-can-i-run-an-application-with-arguments-from-windows-explorer). And it worked: Easy Settings was uninstalled, and subsequently the Windows
 10 Anniversary Update has installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is of help to others. Can I stress that you need to get the details from your own error message, and not copy mine.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Update for Windows 7 not working.</h2>
                    My Windows Update says that I need to run an update.&nbsp; When I hit the update button, Windows Update runs for a few seconds then I get the message: "restart&nbsp;your computer to install important updates, windows can't update important files and services while
 the systems is using them."&nbsp; After I restart, no updates have been installed.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are the steps they suggested:</p>
<p>This issue can be caused by the following factors:</p>
<p>1. Some third-party programs affect.</p>
<p>2. Corrupted Windows Update Temporary folders.</p>
<p>3. <b>System file is corrupted.</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In order to narrow down the cause of this issue and resolve it, pl<span>ə</span>ase refer to the following steps. After finishing
<span>ə</span>ach step, pl<span>ə</span>ase check the result again on the Windows Update website.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Some third party programs can affect the Windows Update service. If you are running any third party applications such as Spyblocker, Internet or web accelerators (programs designed to boost the speed of the Internet
 connection), security or anti-virus programs (Norton, McAfee, etc.), I recommend we temporarily disable or shut them down and then try accessing Windows Update later Pl<span>ə</span>ase understand that we are disabling these programs
 only for the purpose of troubleshooting and we can re-enable these programs after we finish troubleshooting.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Clean Boot&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This method will help us determine if this issue is caused by a loading program or service. Pl<span>ə</span>ase perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Click the "Start" Button, type " <b><i>msconfig </i>
</b>" in the s<span>ə</span>arch bar and press Enter.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Pl<span>ə</span>ase click the Continue if the "User Account Control" window pops up.</p>
<p>2. Click the "Services" tab, check the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box and click "Disable All" (if it is not gray).</p>
<p>3. Click the "Startup" tab, click "Disable All" and click "OK".
</p>
<p>Then, restart the computer. When the "System Configuration Utility" window app<span>ə</span>ars, pl<span>ə</span>ase check the "Don't show this message or launch the System"</p>
<p>4. Test if we can update the system in Clean Boot.</p>
<p>Note 1: Temporarily disabling the Startup Group only prevents the startup programs from loading at startup. This shouldn't affect the system or other programs. We may still manually run these programs later.</p>
<p>Note 2: We can check on Normal Startup in the General tab to roll back to Normal Mode after we get this issue resolved.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, pl<span>ə</span>ase continue to try Step 2.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Rename the Windows Update Softwaredistribution folder</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This problem may occur if the Windows Update, Software distribution folder has been corrupted. We can refer to the following steps to rename this folder. Pl<span>ə</span>ase note that the folder will be
 re-cr<span>ə</span>ated the next time we visit the Windows Update site.</p>
<p>1. Close all the open windows. </p>
<p>2. Click the "Start" Button, click "All programs", and click "Accessories".
</p>
<p>3. Right-click "Command Prompt" and click "Run as administrator".</p>
<p>4. In "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type in "
<b><i>net stop WuAuServ </i></b>" (without the quotes) and press Enter.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Pl<span>ə</span>ase look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully stopped before we try to rename the folder.
</p>
<p>5. Click the "Start" Button, in the "Start S<span>ə</span>arch" box, type in "
<b><i>%windir% </i></b>" (without the quotes) and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. In the opened folder, look for the folder named "SoftwareDistribution".</p>
<p>7. Right-click on the folder, select "Rename" and type "
<b><i>Sdold </i></b>" (without the quotes) to rename this folder.</p>
<p>8. Still in "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type the command "
<b><i>net start WuAuServ </i></b>" (without the quotes) in the opened window to restart the Windows Updates service.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Pl<span>ə</span>ase look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully started.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If the issue is resolved and you can successfully download and install updates, you can safely delete the SoftwareDistribution.old directory to recover disk space.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Run Reset Windows Update Tool and System Update Readiness Tool</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Pl<span>ə</span>ase download and run Reset Windows Update Tool "Microsoft Fixit 50202" from the link below:
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a>&gt;&gt;

2. Pl<span>ə</span>ase download and run System Update Readiness Tool from the link below according to the System Type:

 Since that time,i have not been able to read any downloaded Email attachment or script. All i get now is symbol's with a few word's interdesperced. Can someone help me with this issue ? Thanks

    <title>What is the location of every Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. jenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the location of every Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2010 Express file in Windows 7 Professional 64 bit&#63;</h2>
                    I tried to install a game, but it wouldn't work. I later discovered it's because I uninstalled C++ 2010. I tried to re-install it, but it refuses to install, because VC 9.0 Runtime (x86) won't install. The log claims, "A higher version of Visual Studio
 is already installed." I think it's detecting program files left over from the uninstall. I've deleted some of them, but I'm still getting this message. I'm assuming I've missed some of them. Could someone please posts the locations of all the files that are
 part of this program so I can re-install it?

            <p>The problem is there are NO C++ programs listed in Add or Remove programs. Also, it does create files in more then one location, not just program files. I found one C++ 2010 file in one of my app data files. If runtime really is detecting a "leftover" program
 file, then I need to find and delete it. That's why i asked this question. I already know how to uninstall programs, That's what caused my problem. I need to know where ALL C++ files are located to make sure there is nothing for runtime to detect.<br />

    <title>No netlogon and no local admin account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennisjonesfnb  say:</h3>
<h2>            No netlogon and no local admin account</h2>
                    <p>Short version: I have a laptop that I can't log on to with a local administrator account and the netlogon service is stopped, so I have no way to log on using active directory credentials (domain admin), start the netlogon or update the machine.&nbsp; What can
 I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Longer version:&nbsp; A coworker in IT was trying to update an app on the laptop and was having problems, he decided that the fix was to run msconfig and restart the machine in diagnostic mode.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we do not know the password for the one local admin
 account on the machine (we thought we did) and since diagnostic mode disables the netlogon service we can't use our domain admin credentials either.&nbsp; The
<em>only</em> account we can log on to does not have admin rights. so starting netlogon or resetting the admin password are met with "access denied" messages.&nbsp; Of course we don't have a recovery disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Safe mode; Safe mode with networking; Last Known Good; Directory Services Restore Mode; and Repair your computer.&nbsp; All run into Access Denied errors.&nbsp; I've tried doing cmd - run as admin - net user administrator /active: yes and received Access
 Denied.&nbsp; Of course, every time I try to log on using network credentials (I'm a Domain Admin) it tells me that netlogon isn't running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run out of ideas.&nbsp; Help!</p>

<p>Your predicament is easily avoided by having a couple of local admin accounts with standardised passwords right throughout the organisation. It's what we implemented years ago and it has saved us on countless occasions.</p>

<p>If your disk is encrypted then you need to find a way to decrypt it when launching Repair Mode. Ignore drive X: - it is a virtual drive that exists only in Repair Mode. It disappears immediately when rebooting.</p>

<h2>            svchost 100&#37; Windows Update causing it</h2>
                    Starting my own post regarding my issue after following the similar post <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-windows_update/automatic-updates-and-svchost-100-cpu/0715db9f-01e0-484f-87ea-10eff88a3e2d">
here</a>.<br />
<br />
I have a Panasonic Toughbook running Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, Version 2002, Service Pack 3. I'm using the Microsoft Security Essentials for Antivirus. This toughbook gets used for work.
<br />
<br />
Noticed the last few times I've turned it on, that it has crawled and been unusable. Today I spent some time with it and noticed svchost.exe process was taking up 99% of the CPU. I narrowed it down to the Automatic Updates service that's causing it and I've
 also been unable to get updates through Windows Update with the green progress bar just going back and forth never ending.<br />
<br />
First, in Windows Task Manager I selected View, Select Columns and&nbsp; checked the PID (Process Identifier). This showed me which instance of svchost was using all the cpu, PID 1060 (though this PID is probably different on different machines)<br />
<br />
Second, I opened a command prompt and ran:&nbsp; tasklist /svc<br />
<br />
In the list, I looked at services were using PID 1060 and then disabled them one at a time through services.msc<br />
<br />
Disabling the Automatic Updates service immediately fixed the svchost using up all the cpu.
<br />
<br />
Rechecking the tasklist /svc shows that the wuauserv (Automatic Update service) was the only service missing from PID 1060 to fix the svchost problem.<br />

            I think I've found the solution for the time being. I was led to it from a <a href="http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1176387-xp-windows-automatic-updates-svchostexe-100-cpu-ms-did-something/page-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
The solution was to install the latest Cumulative Security Update for IE8 (KB2879017). You can find&nbsp; and download it at

<h2>            Problems with mail &#38; weather app on windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have an asus transformer book T100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had windows 10, but after the creators update I experienced big problems with wifi connections and I decided to go back to windows 8.1, whose interface, by the way, I like more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did a fresh windows 8.1 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now two problems:</p>
<p>First is with the mail app. I use a gmail account, and I can't move messages to different folders. (this used to work before).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is with the default weather app (MSN weather perhaps). It constantly sais it needs update, but no update is available in windows store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help resolving these two problems would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Yavor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is likely to occur if the updates that were made aren't compatible with the device or there's a need to change in your settings. To isolate your concern, we'd like to know if you're using an
<strong>MSN Premium Account</strong>? If yes, we suggest that you contact our <strong>
MSN Support Team</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/msn/explorer-tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. This is to help you out further on the Mail App and the Weather App issues.<br />

<p>Hi Yavor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that you're experiencing these issues due to an out-of-date Windows 8.1 OS. We'd like to learn more about your concern so that we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions for you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Since you performed a fresh install, have you already applied all the available Windows updates for the system? To check, open<strong> PC Settings &gt; Update &amp; Recovery &gt; Windows&nbsp; Update &gt; Check Now</strong>.
<br />
</li><li>Do you get any error messages when trying to move emails to a different folder in the Mail app? If yes, please post a screenshot.</li><li>Does the update prompt appear immediately after opening the Weather app? Post a screenshot of this as well so we could study it further.</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far? </li></ul>

<p>Hello, Yolvi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pc is fully updated, auto updates are on, and they are regularly installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get any error message in the mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the weather app, the update prompt appears at different times, sometimes just a second after launch, sometimes after half a minute. If I click on update, it takes me to the store, where no update is available. When I go back to the weather app, the message
 is gone, but it reappears after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't post a screenshot at the moment, I will after I get home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting I have only tried uninstalling &amp; reinstalling both apps - didn't make any difference.</p>

<p>We appreciate the information you've provided. What method are you using when you try to move emails to a different folder? Do you just drag and drop the email, or do you use the Move option? Does this happen when you try to move emails to a certain folder,
 or does it happen for all folders? Have you tried creating or adding a new email account to test if it will work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the MSN Weather app, which version is currently on your computer? To check, click
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong>. You could also try this workaround:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the <strong>Update Available </strong>prompt appears, click <strong>Update</strong>. This will launch the Windows Store app.</li><li>Immediately press <strong>ALT + TAB</strong> on your keyboard and switch back to the MSN Weather app.
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if this workaround helps you with the MSN Weather app. </p>

<p>Hello, Yolvi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mail app doesn't work with both drag&amp;drob and move command. It doesn't work for any folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only two accounts I've tested the app is one gmail and one Microsoft account (I didn't have any mail in the microsoft account to do any testing). But as I mentioned before, I've added &amp; removed them several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The version of the MSN Weather app is 3.0.4.336.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've already written, the suggested workaround for the weather app doesn't work - the update request reappears quickly again.</p>

<h2>            July 2018 Update, Now Xbox Crashes with External Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>Last night I downloaded the July 2018 Xbox One Update. Now, when I turn on my Xbox One, it almost immediately crashes. After troubleshooting for about an hour and a half, I've determined that its my external hard drive (WD My Book 4TB) that&nbsp;is causing the Xbox to shut down. I've had this hard drive plugged into my console for&nbsp; over 2 years with no previous issue. It worked fine last night after I downloaded the update. I turned the console off when I was finished with it last night. Now when I go to turn it on today, it crashes unless I unplug the external hard drive. It works fine without the hard drive plugged in, except I have no games because they are all saved to the hard drive. As soon as I plug the hard drive in, crash.&nbsp;I'd really hate to have to replace the hard drive and re-download all of my games, I would probably choose to just move on from Xbox if that was the case. Does anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp;Is this something that could potentially be addressed i

            <p>I'm having a pretty similar issue since the update. My xbox will start with the external plugged in but won't actually play any games from it. Occasionally I'll make it to a loading screen but then the console just crashes like yours. I've spent two hours with customer support and done three full factory resets now and they are saying it's my console but it was working fine until the update. So I'm glad to see you've posted this and I'm not the only person having this problem</p>

<h2>            AMD Switchable Graphics not Working after Upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, so after upgrading to windows 10 I ran into this annoying problem...</p>
<p>switchable graphics doesn't appear in the context menu or the catalyst control center...</p>
<p>I installed drivers from windows update (not working)</p>
<p>also installed drivers from amd's official website (no good either)</p>
<p>and the device manager identifies the GPU as AMD 7400M Series</p>
<p>and more over, I'm stuck with the intel GPU and can't use AMD in almost everything !!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Specefications:</p>

            <p>Same error with me. just&nbsp;disappeared the fuction of switchable graphics, and intel HD Graphics is the one activated.<br />
<br />
PC SPECS:<br />
HP Pavilion DV6-6060ep<br />
Intel Core i7 2630QM 2.00GHZ<br />
6GB RAM</p>
<p>DUAL GPU:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AMD Radeon HD 6770M 1GB (Now appears on CCC 6700M)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Intel Graphics HD 3000<br />
<br />
Please microsoft....need to launch a fix for that. I think windows update made the update with diferent drivers (one update for amd and another to intel) but that's is wrong for switchable graphics.......needs to be a update all-in-one, that update both graphics
 driver.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 invincible Phantom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bintheredunthat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 invincible Phantom</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">HP Pavillion purchased with Win 8. Upgraded to Win 10. Ran fine for a while. Then about 1.5 weeks ago I tried to log on and was confronted by the Phantom wanting a username and password. I tried everything I could from wringing
 out the The Company websites and the rest of the internet and concluded that resetting or whatever it's called, and downloading Win 10 AGAIN that my problems would be over. They seemed to be when I got a series of encouraging blue screen messages saying that
 all was well. I was able to do a hold-down-the-shift-key restart from the screen. My account showed up, I logged in, then turned away to look at the instructions I&nbsp; had called up on my
<strong>iMac</strong>&nbsp; screen. Mistake. I looked back and there was the Phantom again, but this time, there was only an accessibility icon and not a shut down icon. I turned off the computer and haven't even tried to use it since. No viable (or understandable)
 answers from anywhere. </p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">BTW I have a Toshiba laptop that was totally beaten down and zombified by a go-back attempt from Win 10.&nbsp; I see Linux in my future, or maybe a roll back to pencil and paper.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px">That seemed to be the answer, but I am unable to do anything with that computer. Why is that? That's because I can't log into Windows. So, I went to the website on my trusty and loyal Mac thinking that perhaps the folks who run that
 third party commercial site whose link you provided might have foreseen that sort of situation. Apparently not.&nbsp; Also, I don't understand why Microsoft can't provide a solution to a problem with its own software. Unfortunately, like Doktor Frankenstein, it
 appears to be unable to control its own monster. And we all know how well that worked out. Thanks for your effort.</p>

            This is my third attempt to get an answer on this. After the uninvited Widows10 upgrade (from 8.1) my HP notebook worked fine. After a week or so all user account login functions vanished to be replaced by "Other User" with blank name and password, neither
 of which would accept anything. I followed the advice of someone(?) someplace (?) and restarted while holding down several keys. I got my log in capability back then was distracted for a short time and the power saver engaged. The Phantom returned and won't
 let me log in. Worse, there is no longer any way to turn off the computer save the on/off button. There is now only an accessibility button where the off/sleep/hibernate/restart thing used to be. I was advised to download an ISO file and that would solve my
 problem. Might have, except that it will only download to the target computer. Things just keep getting worse with every attempted solution. What do I do now?

</p><blockquote>This is my third attempt to get an answer on this. After the uninvited Widows10 upgrade (from 8.1) my HP notebook worked fine. After a week or so all user account login functions vanished to be replaced by "Other User" with
 blank name and password, neither of which would accept anything. I followed the advice of someone(?) someplace (?) and restarted while holding down several keys. I got my log in capability back then was distracted for a short time and the power saver engaged.
 The Phantom returned and won't let me log in. Worse, there is no longer any way to turn off the computer save the on/off button. There is now only an accessibility button where the off/sleep/hibernate/restart thing used to be. I was advised to download an
 ISO file and that would solve my problem. Might have, except that it will only download to the target computer. Things just keep getting worse with every attempted solution. What do I do now?

<p>
I have since answered my own question. I wasted Win 10 and went back to Win 8.1. I do not particularly like Win 8.1, but at least it works for me. I 'm thinking about Win 7, but the hassles are probably not worth it. Moving over to Linux is also a possibility.
 Sorry to say, I have <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span></strong> received a satisfactory answer other than my own. Meh.</p>

    <title>King of Fighters XIII&#58; DLC not working after purchase - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> universalwolf21  say:</h3>
<h2>            King of Fighters XIII&#58; DLC not working after purchase</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having this problem with the DLC for King of Fighters XIII (NA version, btw)</p>

<p>These are the pieces of DLC that I purchased:</p>

<p>400 MSP: Iori of Flames (DLC is working)</p>
<p>80 MSP: Billy/Saiki Unlock Code (DLC is NOT working)</p>

<p>For some odd reason, only Iori is working properly. I have turned the system on and off a few times, I've deleted and redownloaded both DLCs, but the unlock code refuses to work.</p>

<p>I know that on the char select screen of KOFXIII, Billy and Saiki are on the sides of Ash (Hes directly in the middle of the char select) but until the two characters are unlocked, they are replaced with question marks. When the unlock code is purchased,
 those question marks are to disappear, and the characters are to be there. Sadly, this is not happening. I would unlock them myself through normal gameplay, but no matter what I do neither will show when they are supposed to (and trust me, I've followed each
 direction to the letter....even gone beyond the requirements a few times.)</p>

<p>So, my main issue is, one DLC works, the other doesn't. They were both paid for by the same account, on the same day, within a few minutes of one another. So I'm honestly not sure what is keeping the unlock code from working properly.</p>

<p>If anything could be done to help me, I would GLADLY appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
<p>UniversalWolf21&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>In [update driver software] menu,</p>
<p>click [Browse my computer for driver software]</p>
<p>http://screencast.com/t/P3dPvqGt<br />
<br />
And then click [Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to re-install driver, in the number of order.</p>
<p>http://screencast.com/t/fWOfyIrsd</p>
<p>(I did it in the order of #1 -&gt; #2 -&gt; #1 -&gt; #2)</p>
<p>In my process of first #2 : it showed a warning message. And after that mic was working, but sound is very weak.</p>
<p>But, when I re-install them again (the last two steps above), it sounds well and also microphone works well.<br />

    <title>Taskmgr.exe Registry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mintyyf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskmgr.exe Registry</h2>
                    <p>I'm not entirely sure if there's a problem, but if someone could possibly give me insight, it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a randsomeware virus last year and basically went through **** and for the first time in my life decided I was actually going to pay for a antivirus program. I hadn't backed up my stuff (I know I know.. that's awful.. I learned my lesson!) so reformatting
 at the time was not an option. The only program that was of any help was spyhunter 4. Pretty much saved my life, so I did end up buying it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyways at the beginning I kept Taskmgr.exe in the registry scan as something called a 'Antivirus blocking Rule'. I ended up switching to Process Explorer for a while but I honestly just really am all for 'What I use to use'. It kept coming up in scan's, and
 no amount of googling was helping to make me feel secure that something wasn't actually amiss. I ended up emailing the Spyhunter staff and was told it was a false positive and could put it in the exclusion list and didn't need to worry about it. Unfortunately,
 that somehow didn't really cut it for me. It finally stopped coming up in my scans, and hasn't been an issue.. Until today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its honestly just nagging me, and I'm not actually having any problems with Task manager at all, but in my paranoia and googling I happened across an answer that mentioned there shouldn't actually be a registry value for Taskmgr.exe. And I do have one..
 and more googling didn't tell me if there should or shouldn't be one. Anyways, maybe I can let this go if someone could just clear this up for me. Here's the location of the registry key. Basically says (Default) &nbsp; &nbsp; REG_SZ &nbsp; &nbsp; (value not set).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\taskmgr.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can tell, the actual location of the Taskmgr.exe, size, permissions, etc is all fine. Just the registry key that apparently shouldn't be there?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time. Have an awesome day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*Edit: I should probably add in, I do have Malwarebytes as well. I generally do a biweekly scan with Malwarebytes, Spyhunter and them Hitman Pro. Nothing else is detecting it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I agree with you that taskmgr.exe entry should be there in the location which you have mentioned in the registry entry. However, if its entry is showing in the registry then there might be a chance that this entry is being added by you or if it is being
 added by some application/software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything is working fine and there is no issue then you may leave it. As incorrect changing entries in registry might affect your computer badly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:
</strong>Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></span></p>

    <title>windows 10 not showing uploaded photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clarachough  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 not showing uploaded photos</h2>
                    <p>This is the first time I have tried to upload photos from my camera (USB port)since I downloaded Windows 10 a couple of days ago.. With windows 7, all ly newly imported pictures &nbsp;appeared in Windows Live Pictures, and I can locate them using the "find" tab
 by date.&nbsp;Today's date and pictures are not there at all. When the import apparently finishes there is no "click here to see new pictures " message flashed as before with Windows 7.</p>
<p>I can't locate them at all. I tried clicking on the photos icon on the new start menu, and there are all my previous photos, but not today's. I found the USB port upload place, with even the name of my camera FZ 1000 and I clicked on upload and it says it's
 looking for new pictures but nothing has happened. </p>
<p>Any ideas ?</p>
<p>Thanks guy!</p>
