<h2>            How can I see if my email has SMTP Authentication on&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My emails are going to recipients Spam boxes. I was told I need to check if my SMTP Authentication is turned on. I have tried to follow peoples directions that say to go to tools, I cant even find that. I am not able to access
 my Hotmail account through Outlook directly, I have to go through my web browser to get to Outlook. And from there, there is not the normal bar at the top with File, Home&nbsp;etc. When I try to add my email to Outlook 2013 that is on my computer, it can not find
 my email. My husband has a Hotmail email as well, and will add his email address to Outlook, not sure why mine won't. Anyways, how can I find out if the box is checked for SMTP Authentication?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I followed the directions to add the account. </p>
<p>The message I get is:</p>
<p>An encrypted connection to your email server is not available. Click Next to attempt using an unencrypted connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I hit next, it still can't pull it up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did successfully add our Comcast account that was provided to us. But, that is not the account I use. I am trying to add my Hotmail account.

<h2>            Hotmail &#39;move to&#39; dropdown menu jumps back to top in IE 9</h2>
                    I am helping my father with a problem. When he has an e-mail open and wants to save it in another folder he clicks on 'Move to' and the drop down menu appears showing his various folders. When he tries to choose a folder, it will jump back to the top making
 it impossible to select the folder he's trying to select. He's using IE9, his OS is Vista, and this problem just started occurring 3 days ago. I would appreciate any help in finding a solution! Thanks!!<br />

<h2>            Windows Phone 10 is not recognized by Windows 10 Build 1511</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've tried searching forums for this, and maybe there's an answer, but the references are all to the "technical preview" of Windows 10. I believe I'm in a production build, Build 1511, for both my desktop and my Lumia 950.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plug in my Lumia 950, and Windows only sees a "USB Composite Device" and has the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"USB device not recognized. The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device is fine, it connects to multiple computers with Windows 7, including this computer before I upgraded to Windows 10. I am very close to going back to Windows 7 already. Anyway, does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do seem to have media player, and tried to download the Windows Phone USB driver, but Windows 10 did not recognize that as valid.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

            <p>I tried this when suggested, and none of it worked. I don't have an SD card in my phone currently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my laptop recently too, but this is a work laptop so it uses Windows 10 Enterprise. The phone connects perfectly fine to that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried multiple ancillary USB ports on my desktop. Today I finally tried the USB 2.0 ports at the back, rather than the USB 3.0 ports that I've always used. This works! But now it's slow USB 2.0. Microsoft clearly has some bugs to work out. I should
 note my USB 3.0 backup drive works just fine on the USB 3.0 ports that no longer work on my phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is still very sad.</p>

 read-only under the restricted usage set-up.</p>

<p>My play 360 when powered up, pressing the connect button goes red instead of blue and bleeps. Which means I can not pair it to any devices.</p>

<p>Hi ghamw,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can this is your first post so let me welcome you to the Nokia discussion forums and thank you for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to your issue what devices are you trying to pair with the Play 360?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you click on this <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/play-360/user-guides?ccf_name=nokia-md-50w/guide/GUID-3D82E57A-D42D-4CB6-AAA0-603775803CBA_FILE001.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LINK</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;Its a guide on the Nokia 360 play and how to pair the speaker with your device. Have look at this and hopefully it will help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have attached a link below on how to pair your Nokia phones with a Bluetooth device. It is a general guide but quite useful if you are having difficultly pairing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/search?qt=how%20to%20pair%20bluetooth&amp;cat=support&amp;fullcontent=true&amp;cnt=1&amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/support/search?qt=how%20to%20pair%20bluetooth&amp;cat=support&amp;fullcontent=true&amp;cnt=1&amp;page=2</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if any of this helps or if you are still experiencing issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>I had sucessfully paired it before, this is something the unit developed, I am assuming it is faulty.</p>

<p>It makes no difference if the 3.5mm jack is connected or the power lead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Works when use 3.5mm audio connection just not via bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            This happened to mine recently. It is caused by a dirty connector on the aux in socket. Essentially the fault, whereby the speaker beeps and flashes orange is the same as when a cable is connected to the aux in.<br />
<br />
Open the unit up by peeling off the rubber pad on the base, then removing four screws. Next remove the bass horn. Then remove the plastic cover over the aux in and charging sockets. Then remove the last two screws holding the pcb on and remove the pcb. If you
 plug a cable into aux in you'll see the contacts open. It is those contacts that are dirty, if current can't flow the unit always perceives a cable is plugged in, even though it isn't. You need a nail file or mild abrasive to clean those contacts. Test before
 re assembly.<br />
<br />
I reckon mine developed the fault after I'd left a cable plugged in for a while leaving the contacts open for a long time.

<h2>            MS Project Outlining - Expand Collapse only a select portion of the project</h2>
                    <p>I have a project with say 4 levels of outlining and THOUSANDS of lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have, for example A to Z the following structure.</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>A.1</p>
<p>A.1.1; and</p>
<p>A.1.1.1</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>B.1</p>
<p>B.1.1; and</p>
<p>B.1.1.1</p>

<p>C</p>
<p>C.1</p>
<p>C.1.1; and</p>
<p>C.1.1.1</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Z</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How do I expand/collapse ONLY B so that I see, for example:</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>B.1</p>
<p>B.1.1; and</p>
<p>B.1.1.1</p>


<p>C</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Z</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I realize that I can click each level to open or close, but that (with thousands of lines) would take way too much time.&nbsp; I would think I could just select the collapsed "B" row and expand it but when I try that MS Project then expands A, B, C all the
 way to Z.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>MSProjectHelp,</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm a little confused by your last paragraph. You say clicking each level will open (expand?) or close (collapse?) it but then you also say that if you do that all levels expand or collapse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as some automated way of selectively expanding or collapsing various levels in Project, no, there is no shortcut other than using the little + or - icon next to the summary level. To automate the process, you would need to write some VBA code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; And that is the issue.&nbsp; I may only want to expand one summary line item and its items to reveal (in this example) its 4 levels of outline.&nbsp; But any time I click (whether I've selected the sheet or just one summary line item) the expand button (whether
 all subtasks or any level) then MS Project applies the expand command to the entire project and not just one summary line item.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the excel world, you can hide, for example, on a sheet rows 5-10, rows 20-50, rows 111-234, etc by following the following procedure; selecting the rows, right click and then "hide".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To unhide the rows you would then follow the following proceedure: say you want to unhide rows 5-10.&nbsp; You can select rows 4-11 (with 5-10 hidden), right click and then "unhide".&nbsp; Only rows 5-10 will unhide NOT 20-50, 111-234, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this were MS Project, me trying to unhide only rows 5-10 would cause ALL hidden lines in the sheet to "unhide"<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Does that help explain the issue?&nbsp; I just want to be able to expand one summary item at a time without having to press the little icons next to each summary level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot image there is not any way (using the menus) to accomplish this? All expand vs. Selectively expand?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, is there a VBA code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>MSProjectHelp,</p>
<p>Understand Project is not Excel so don't expect it to have the same features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Project there is no "hide" rows feature, other than to create a filter that will hide task rows that are excluded by the filter. That may be an option you can use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an identifiable sequence of criteria for expanding/collapsing the outline then yes, a macro can be created to do that in automated fashion. However, if the expanding and collapsing is "random", (i.e. doesn't really follow any pattern and is instead
 determined by the needs at the moment), then VBA won't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly is your end goal? What determines the expanding and collapsing? If we understood that, maybe we could find something that would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for reference, what version of Project are you using? Is it fully updated with the latest public update?</p>

<p>MSProjectHelp,</p>
<p>If your expanding and collapsing is indeed random then your only option is to manually expand/collapse via the expand/collapse icons. The ribbon commands operate solely on outline level (i.e. "all" tasks at the selected outline level).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For random criteria VBA will be of no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again I have to ask, what is your end goal? You say you have thousands of lines in your file structure so why do you need/want to expand/collapse selected summaries? It's hard to believe you are doing it at random without any pattern such as tasks under
 a particular WBS, description (category), cost, date range, or other custom criteria. Given a definable criteria, I can help, but if not then you're stuck with manual clicking.</p>

<p>Only Motorola can sell you a license to install Windows Mobile. So you will need to contact Motorola and ask them about pricing.</p>

<h2>            How do I append text to the email body</h2>
                    Here goes,<br />
<br />
All I have to do is to add a formatted text (red color) at the beginning of the email body and forward to a particular email address.<br />
<br />
I'm stuck in the first part. What I have achieved so far that I have to keep the email open in edit mode. Only then my code adds the formatted text and save the email. Can I achieve this just by keeping the email in active selection? neither do I wish to open
 the mail in edit or read mode in a separate window.<br />

I just got into macro programming yesterday, so please be patient. But I do have programming background. Any suggestions how I can achieve the first of my problem.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 chokes on emails with large attachments from Outlook.com account via IMAP</h2>
                    <p>A while ago&nbsp;I noticed that Outlook 2013 choked when trying to download emails with large attachments (&gt; 7-8 MB). In fact I had to log into Outlook.com via browser and delete the offending email to get it to continue processing anything at all....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, I am using IMAP, but this is because when I use exchange activesync I get contacts duplicated (or triplicated or more), plus email not syncing in it's entirety,&nbsp;and I just decided to live without it. So far IMAP has been working more or less OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For a test I created a new email account, and in Outlook 2013&nbsp;connected direct to my domain/mail provider (rather than sucking it through Outlook.com). This worked fine, so it is not a limitation (or issue)&nbsp;of Outlook 2013 as far as I can tell. However,
 I don't see that it is an issue with Outlook.com either as I can view, and download the attachment (manually) fine from the web interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally posted this in the Outlook 2013 community and got redirected here. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

 them so they do not get changed accidentally ie. without my making a conscious intent to do so.</p>

<p>Hi SYD001,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Generally, when you click Save as, there will be a dialog box for you to change the file name and the save location. By reading your post, you mentioned "</span><span>the
 file name never changes and the new file is never created</span><span>", do you mean the new file isn't created even you change the file name and save location?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, we'd like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Since when did you realize the Save as feature stop working?</p>
<p>2. Please follow the steps below to try the safe mode and check the result:</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1) </span><span>Start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2) </span><span>Release the Shift key when you see the login window.
</span></p>
<p>3. Would you please provide the Word version to us? You can check it in Word &gt; About Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

    <title>Configuring JavaMail to send mail to O365 Exchange Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenmckain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Configuring JavaMail to send mail to O365 Exchange Service</h2>
                    <p>I have an application I wrote in JavaSpring that uses the JavaMail API to send an email. I would like it to use my Office 365 Exchange service instead of my localhost sendmail service on linux. This will avoid any spoofing issues downstream. It is unclear
 to me, however, how to set up this handshake. I need advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I know so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my application-context file I create a bean for JavaMail:</p>
<p>&lt;bean id="mailSender" class="org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSenderImpl"&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;property name="host" value="localhost"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;property name="port" value="25"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;property name="javaMailProperties"&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;props&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;prop key="mail.smtp.auth"&gt;false&lt;/prop&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;!--<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;prop key="mail.debug"&gt;true&lt;/prop&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/props&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/property&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/bean&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will change&nbsp;&lt;property name="host" value="localhost"/&gt; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;property name="host" value="my.exchange.service.domain"/&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else I need to configure, though:</p>
<p>What must I configure in exchange to receive these requests? (i.e. How do I handshake with my O365 Exchange service?) I saw something about Mail Flow in O365 Exchange and Connections, but I don't see any means of setting up authentications for such services.
 Do I need to create an new special account with username and password and use that via the application instead?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I need to setup anything on the linux server on which my java application is running? (hostname, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any experts or online documentation I can consult would be extremely useful to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Stephen.</p>

<h3> amyb621  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 keeps hanging on send&#47;receive&#47;synchronizing folders</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new machine on which I had installed Windows 7 and bought Microsoft Office 2016.&nbsp; Within that suite, I have a single email account (IMAP/SMTP)for which I use Outlook 2016.&nbsp; Since a windows&nbsp;update last week, Outlook keeps getting hung on send/receive
 folders/synchronizing folders.&nbsp; I can only send and receive emails by closing the program altogether and then restarting Outlook, at which time the folders successfully send/receive that one time.&nbsp; I have tried every "fix it" I could find online.&nbsp; I "upgraded"
 from Windows 7 to 10 to see if that might help.&nbsp; It didn't.&nbsp; I deleted the email account from Outlook and set it up anew.&nbsp; Still same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;My email works fine when I access it directly (as opposed to through Outlook 2016).&nbsp;&nbsp;Any ideas on what&nbsp;I can do
 to fix this? I'm tempted to chunk Office&nbsp;2016 and go back to my 2010, or at least Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Amy,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, I got to know that Outlook used to work fine until the Windows update last week, right? In this situation, please make sure you’ve installed the latest Windows and Office Updates at first. If the issue persists, I’d like to narrow
 down the issue with the following details:<br />
1. The detailed version of the Outlook client. (In FILE&gt; Office Account&gt; Update Options.)<br />
2. If you configure another personal account like an Outlook.com account in the Outlook client, does the issue persist?<br />
3. Start Outlook in safe mode to check the issue. For your reference: In Windows 7, choose
<strong>Start</strong>, and in the <strong>Search programs and files </strong>box, type
<em>Outlook /safe</em>, and then press Enter.<br />
4. Although you’ve tried deleting the email account and setting it up again, we would still recommend you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new profile</a> and configure your account in it as the old one might be corrupt.
<br />
<br />
You can also find more troubleshooting steps in the following articles:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2652320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Outlook not responding" error or Outlook freezes when you open a file or send mail</a><br />

<br />
Let me know if anything is unclear.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <p>Thanks for trying to help. Alas, it's still screwed up. &nbsp;"Synchronizing folders" remains stuck. &nbsp;Yes, I've checked for updates every day of this disaster of an experience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Product Info -- Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016. My updates download &amp; install automatically, but as noted above, I've been updating daily in hopes that Microsoft issues a fix for this problem. Office Updates: "Version: 16.0.1010.2033"</p>
<p>2. I configured a second account in Outlook client, creating a new email with @outlook.com extension (costing me a ton more time, and having to give my info to yet another provider, declining a large number of Microsoft solicitations and "free offers" --
 thanks, but no thanks -- and certainly resulting me enduring additional solicitations and associated nonsense) and the synchronization folder is hanging for the new email account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Safe mode does not prevent the synchronized folders hang. &nbsp;I've tried that multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I created a new profile and opened email through this new profile. &nbsp;Same problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have literally wasted hours and hours on this problem, which still exists. &nbsp;I cannot begin to articulate my frustration with Microsoft. &nbsp;I have been a customer for many years, despite the burden of weekly updates (or, "fupdates", as I call them), which
 often screw up something with my computer. &nbsp;I have spent a lot of money on Microsoft products. &nbsp;This time, contrary to previous versions, I can say without hesitation that Office 2016 has caused me more problems than it has solved. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Amy,<br />
<br />
Based on your updates, I manage to determine that the affected Outlook 2016 client is downloaded from Microsoft Office Home and Business subscription.
<br />
<br />
Since you had posted to the "Office 365 for business" category, I am going to move this thread to Office &gt;Office 365 Home, Personal and University&gt; Microsoft Office Outlook category for proper handling.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <p>As mentioned above, the Product Version is 16.0.7070.2033 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook email (which I do not use -- I only set it up per the instructions of the other person above who was trying to help me -- see above, please) is Microsoft Exchange. &nbsp;My work email address, which is the one having all the problems in Outlook 2016,
 is not an outlook.com address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to logon to the Outlook email via web browser (https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/mail/inbox), I don't see any messages, even the test ones I sent yesterday and today. &nbsp;When I try to send an email from that email account via Web browser,
 it gives me an error message. &nbsp;When I send an email to the outlook address from my non-outlook email address, the message appears in the outlook email inbox in my Outlook app email inbox, but the Outlook inbox via web browser is still empty. &nbsp;Same with when
 I send an email from my outlook email address to my outlook email address, from the Outlook app (and not via web browser outlook), the email shows up only in the Outlook app inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have an older machine that is running outlook 2010. &nbsp;When I turned it on after updates, it too is hanging on syncrhonized folders. &nbsp;Makes me think even more this is an updates problem now that I have the same issue on two different machines running
 two different versions of outlook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both systems are now sending and receiving messages, but the synchronized folders remain hung. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The link https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/mail/inbox is for an Outlook.com mail account.</p>
<p>And if you cannot send a mail via that web interface it has nothing to do with MS outlook, or your win version.</p>
<p>Win Key+X&gt;Control Panel (View by large icons)&gt;Mail applet (32bit) double click, in the resulting window&gt;Show Profiles, add a new profile, with prompt for profile selected, then Email Accounts, add your IMAP mail account in the auto set page, and test the
 account, assuming OK, finish the process then start Outlook under this new Profile, does it sync?</p>

            <p>I've had the very same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An update came through nearly 6 months ago that caused this problem and it is still not fixed, which to be frank is fairly poor on behalf of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've switched my email client to Mozilla Thunderbird now because of the problem, but it's cost me hours and hours of time. We literally have hundreds of clients that we principally communicate with via email, and so I've had to re-create the address book
 in Mozilla, and I'm still transferring those emails months later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that we have to pay such a large price for a product you would think that Microsoft would resolve this issue within days, not weeks or in our case months!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's had a severe detrimental impact on our business.</p>

            <p>I have used Outlook for over 10 years to manage my email accounts. &nbsp;I have also had to deal with this same problem of Outlook freezing on send-receive for 10 years. &nbsp; I have opened multiple cases with Microsoft as an MSDN member on this problem, and explored
 varous solutions in detail. &nbsp;All "solutions" offered by Microsoft have been just work-rounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working in Windows 10 pro, anniversary version with Outlook 2016, and with Windows 7 enterprise and Outlook 2013. &nbsp;I have made this problem more manageable by disabling all automatic send-receive, and I use manual send-receive so I can control when
 the problem occurs when I have time to manage it.</p>

</p><p>I am not using an exchange account, but my configuration probably stresses out Outlook more than most. &nbsp;From the late 1990's to &nbsp;the present the number of different email addresses I manage with outlook has varried from about 30 to about 70. &nbsp;Until 2007
 or 2010 (I forget) version I had so many email accounts that Outlook was unable to display them all in the send-receive list because the capacity was not that great - at least that problem seems mostly solved. &nbsp;All my email accounts are pop3 accounts, and
 cover the full gamut of email providers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem used to be much worse; the solution to a send-receive freeze that worked before Outlook 2010 was to delete Outlook configuration files and restart. &nbsp;At least now the solution is just to delete the Outlook process and restart Outlook 2016. &nbsp;Same
 solution worked for me in Outlook 2013 and I think in Outlook 2010 - although that was a long time ago and I've forgotten when it was no longer necessary to delete and recreate configuration files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience has been that Outlook send-receive will be working in send-receive mode and will process correctly 10-30 email accounts, then freeze. &nbsp;The freeze appears to correspond with some communication problem Outlook is having with one of the email
 accounts. &nbsp;Sometimes an error is generated, but sometimes not. &nbsp;A distinguishing feature of this problem that corresponds exactly is that Outlook process is STILL RUNNING even when I cancel the send-receive process and then exit Outlook. &nbsp;But after I cancel
 the Outlook process in task-manager, Outlook (2013 and) 2016 will start up just fine (In the past before Outlook 2007 or 2010 Outlook would sometimes try to repair the pst file on startup, but that problem doesn't happen anymore).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The interesting thing is that after I restart Outlook 2016 (or 2013) and rerun send-receive the problem may recur but it will usually freeze at a different email account each time. &nbsp;If the freeze is on a particular same email account each time, then logging
 in directly in a browser to that account and fixing it will almost always fix the problem (for example when Microsoft updates Outlook.com and turns off POP3, then if I re-enable it the problem is fixed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I manage multiple email accounts, it is clear that Outlook is working fine and the problem is always communication with a particular email account. &nbsp;It seems to me that in these situations the Outlook process gets locked in to managing that communication
 and even trying to cancel send-receive and exiting Outlook does not disengage Outlook from the lock-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am open to comments and suggestions, but I have basically given up on this. &nbsp;IMO there are some programming/design errors in Outlook that are causing this problem, and I don't believe it has anything to do with settings or add-ins.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Finally i solved my problem today. but i don't know whether apply to your case. I deleted my IMAP email and change to POP setting. The reason here is when i import the PST file into my outlook, it will concurrently retrieve the email to the web mail and
 caused the webmail memory burst for IMAP. So today i tried to set up POP for my outlook and import the PST, so that my webmail wouldnt retrive the PST email which i imported. Now everything is
<span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>syncs smoothly&nbsp;</span></span></span> and my webmail wouldn't burst cause it wouldn't retrive the mail i imported. But the disadvantage is the webmail and outlook
 wouldnt sync together for POP setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
MAP and POP are two different protocols. There are many differences between these two. The main difference is that IMAP(Internet Messaged Access Protocol) always syncs with mail server so that any changes you make in your mail client (Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird)
 will instantly appear on your webmail inbox.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, in POP(Post Office Protocol), your mail client account and mail server are not synced. It means whatever changes you make to your email account in the mail client will not be transferred to the webmail inbox.</p>
<p>
In simple terms, if you are using IMAP and mark a mail as read, it gets marked as read in your web based inbox too (because the changes are happening on the server). However, this won’t be the case if you are using POP, because the mails are downloaded to your
 PC and the changes won’t reflect on the server.</p>

            First, you do not have fields on a form, you have controls which may or may not be bound to a field in a table. This is an subtle but important distinction. You also don't have records in a form. A form display a set of records. So you need to look at
 the source of the form and do your counts that. Check the DCount function.

<h2>            Conference room mailboxes showing up under Contacts but not under resources</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>I have a question on Exchange Hybrid. I have run a AAD connect in my environment (Exchange 2010 ) and all the users got synchronized from on-premises to the cloud but the problem is that even my conference room mailboxes are not showing up under neither
 in the resources in Exchange Admin Center in 0365 nor in the meeting rooms in 0365 admin center but they are showing up under the contacts. If this is the case it would be very difficult for me to assign licenses to the users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have configured Hybrid Configuration Wizard with Exchange 2010 Environment.</p>
<p>Resolution to this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi sakethlinga,</p>
<p>It is an expected behavior that: in Exchange hybrid environment, on-premise room mailboxes appear as mail users in Exchange Online.</p>
<p>You can refer to the KB article above to let online users add on-premises rooms to meeting requests.</p>
<p>Moreover, about “<em>If this is the case it would be very difficult for me to assign licenses to the users</em>” you mentioned, we do not need to assign a license to the room mailbox user.</p>
<p>Anything unclear, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi sakethlinga,</p>
<p>Thanks for update.</p>
<p>I just checked this in my hybrid lab. For the room mailbox moved from on-premise Exchange to Exchange Online, by default, it will show up under both
<strong>Active Users</strong> and <strong>MEETING ROOMS</strong>, in Office 365 admin center. We cannot change this behavior.</p>
<p>Can you see the room mailbox under <strong>MEETING ROOMS</strong>? If yes, it indicates that there is no issue for the configurations.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>They are showing up under the <strong>MEETING ROOMS </strong>but not under Active Users. If this is the case this is &nbsp;unacceptable as we will likely have several resource mailboxes on-premise that should still show under resources and not contacts.</p>

<p>Hi Saketh,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update. I am confused about one point.</p>
<p>In the previous reply, you said that the migrated room mailbox shows up under Active Users:</p>
<p><em>“After migrating the room mailbox to the cloud it indeed worked. Now the room mailbox is showing up under the resources but however
<strong>it still shows up under the active users as well under 0365 admin center</strong>.”</em></p>
<p>But now you said they are not under Active Uses:</p>
<p>“<em>They are showing up under the MEETING ROOMS but <strong>not under Active Users</strong></em>”</p>
<p>Which one is the situation?</p>
<p>I’d like to summarize the default behavior:</p>
<p>1. When room mailbox is in on-premise Exchange, it shows up in <strong>Active Users</strong> (Office 365 Admin Center),
<strong>contacts</strong> (Exchange Admin Center)</p>
<p>2. When the room mailbox is migrated to Office 365, it shows up under <strong>
Active Users</strong>, <strong>MEETING ROOMS</strong> (Office 365 admin center), <strong>
resources</strong> (Exchange Admin Center).</p>
<p>We cannot change this default behavior.</p>
<p>Anything unclear, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>Young,</p>
<p>Sorry about that. Let me rephrase the question again. They are showing up under the MEETING ROOMS and even under the ACTIVE USERS. Anyway I got my answer that I was looking for. Thanks for the help young. But are there any changes coming for this &nbsp;behavior
 in the future?</p>

<p>Upon researching, there is no official news about the change in the future. I recommend you submit feedback at this site:

<h2>            Build 10041 multi-monitor setup problems w&#47; display zoom on monitor 2</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been facing the following problem w/ Windows 10 build 10041: I have a dual monitor setup on a GTX 770 - one of them, a 16:10 19" 1440x900 which is working fine, and the other a 4:3 17" 1280x1024 which, by unknows reasons, keeps zoomed as 150%, no matter
 what I do. When I try to change zoom level to 100%, it asks me to sign out, but nothing changes even if I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could I do to solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geforce drivers are up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi Marcelo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem might be caused due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display drivers compatibility.</li><li>Display drivers corrupt.</li></ul>
<p>Please follow the below suggestion and check if it helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open device manager from the desktop.</li><li>Expand display adapter and right click on NVidia and uninstall it.</li><li>This will uninstall the current driver installed on the computer.</li><li>Now reboot the computer and check if it helps.</li></ul>
<p>By doing this Windows will load default drivers for the graphics card, if you still have any issues visit the graphics card manufacturer website and download the driver for Windows 8.1, and then install he drivers using compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, for further assistance please reply.</p>

    <title>What is the best method to autorun macros&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acolwknt  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the best method to autorun macros&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi my final aim automatically produce word documents based on a template and selections of boilerplate text by&nbsp;a userform.</p>
<p>So far I created a user form to select content which looks like.</p>
<p>'subs for userform controls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'CODE&nbsp; e.g.<br />
Private Sub HD_STB_Click()<br />
If HD_STB.Value = True Then<br />
HiDe_STB = True<br />
Else: HiDe_STB = False<br />
End If<br />
End Sub<br />
'end of subs for userform controls<br />
'Userform<br />
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()<br />
&nbsp;' a lot of code<br />
end sub<br />
'end of 'Userform</p>
<p>This works if I select the userform in the VBA editor and select run</p>
<p>Then I added a autorun macro to the template's&nbsp; "This Document" object, e.g.<br />
Private Sub Document_New()<br />
MsgBox "test autorun"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>This runs when I make a new document based on the template</p>
<p>What I carn't do is get the userforms to auto run? so far I have tried pasting the user forms subs code after the Document_New sub, using GoTo and Call "sub userform"&nbsp;, "Userform" and various variariations on&nbsp;&nbsp;Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() name to no
 advail.</p>
<p>Am I close or is my approach flawed?</p>
<p>Can I call macros in another module? Do they have to be included in the This Document code&nbsp;to be called or can I nest them in the Document_New code?</p>
<p>Help please.</p>

<p>You do not really need to declare the userform a an object, although of course you can do so.</p>
<p>Sub Document_New()</p>
<p>Userform1.Show</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>"automatically" displays the userform&nbsp;when a new document is created from the template, without requiring a declaration of a userform object.</p>
<p>Sub Document_Open()</p>
<p>Userform1.Show</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>would display the userform automatically whenever the document is opened, without the use of a userform object.&nbsp; Note that if the Document_Open code is in the template, then that ONLY fires if the template file is opened...not the created document.&nbsp; If you
 want the document to fire it, then the procedure must be in the document ThisDocument module.</p>

<p>Yes. Win 7 … 64-bit</p>
<ol>
<li>Good question!&nbsp; I sent my original HP recovery DVD’s with my laptop to the repair tech company for repairs due to a failure message about the hard drive.&nbsp; I purchased them at the time I custom ordered this build from HP but never had to open the sleeves
 prior to do any install’s.&nbsp; When I came home w/the laptop &amp; booted up, 1<sup>st</sup> thing I noticed is the sign in screen has a Dell Logo right above the sign in.&nbsp; I called the company about this &amp; he said he already had a Win 7 Pro DVD or CD which ever
 they are so he just went a head &amp; used the one he usually uses.&nbsp; I don’t understand why &amp; he promised it wouldn’t make any difference!&nbsp; He said the drivers for my system HP vs the Dell are all installed correctly either way!</li><li>Vipre Internet Security 2016 Software Version 9.0.1.4 definition version 58574.&nbsp; SOFTWARE IS UP TO DATE.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a lifetime subscription for 8 PC’s.&nbsp; It does have spyware/malware protection within the Vipre we were told at time of purchase from QVC.&nbsp; The
 PC Tech’s must of installed the Malwarebytes Malware Freeware&nbsp; on the laptop, although I do maintain a PAID VERSION of this app for 3 PC’s which I renewed in April 2017 but did not install input the key code in this laptop yet.&nbsp; The FREE versions do not run
 live or auto.&nbsp; The paid subscriptions are only for 1 year.</li><li>I did have McAfee 2yrs ago for approx. 7 yrs. (PAID versions) on this laptop but it was on the old hard drive which has been removed.&nbsp; I almost believe originally HP built the system with a (60-day or 3-mth) free version of Norton’s.&nbsp; I never used it, only
 McAfee but NOTHING other than VIPRE.</li><li>I did do the Removal Tools for both Norton &amp; McAfee on the other HDD; NOT since I had this repair or problem.</li><li>NOT KB4019264</li><li>I wasn’t sure if Java was installed so I did a search in system/C drive &amp; I DID SEE FILES Java version 8 update 131 was there, but the extensions did NOT look seem to be an application. I don’t know exactly what the extension design was but looked as though
 they were related to something I synced. &nbsp;I then went to start, programs &amp; I DID NOT find Java listed in the programs.&nbsp; I tried opening the link you posted on IE to TEST but it told me the link didn’t work no longer available something to that affect.&nbsp; It
 wasn’t the crashing I been getting.&nbsp; I HOPE I DID ‘’NOT’’ MESS UP because I did NOT read the (2) at the end of your posting until the very end!!! But I had already typed in Java &amp; installed Java. IF I DID PLEASE ADVISE ME WHAT ACTION TO TAKE TO REMOVE ALL
 PARTS.&nbsp; I always pay attention to security on my PC’s &amp; don’t open anything without scanning &amp; don’t want to leave myself vulnerable!!!!!!! I show the version with update 131 listed in programs, but don’t actually see a place to uninstall the JAVA program
 in add/remove programs just the extension.&nbsp; Unless that will uninstall the entire program (weird though). &nbsp;Start, programs, Java doesn’t have a uninstall either.&nbsp; Again please advise if I DID THE WRONG THING by installing.</li><li>I did NOT have Adobe Flash Player installed, but I did install the v25.0.0.171.</li><li>A.) IE 11 installed 5/13/2017</li></ol>
<p>B.) FIREFOX also DOES NOT appear to be installed but on a search of C:/drive find files listed w/Firefox none look to be installed on this HDD but maybe from synced bookmarks from my iPhone I don’t understand
 it all.&nbsp; The files are small (938KB or less than 20KB) &amp; 90% appear to be linked to my antivirus or Malwarebytes. &nbsp;&nbsp;I did NOT INSTALL anything on my laptop with this NEW HDD except my antivirus Vipre, Microsoft Silverlight, &nbsp;HP printer &amp; all the updates/components
 to it, iTunes, iCloud, ATT Support Plus Maintenance Tool, (AMD Gaming Evolved, Plays TV, came when I updated the Video Card)</p>
<p>NO OTHER BROWERS OR OTHER SOFTWARE INSTALLED, just updates.</p>
<ol>
<li>NO REGISTRY CLEANERS OR TUNE UP CCLEANER.</li></ol>
<p>*NOTE* ATT Support Plus Maintenance Tool may be just this because it does clear cookies &amp; it does check DLL &amp; such &amp; did find problems with things it didn’t fix which I would have to run again to type the
 finds.&nbsp; I DO KNOW THAT UNDER DEVICES &amp; PRINTERS there IS AN EXCLAMATION WITHIN A YELLOW TRIANGLE over my laptop.&nbsp; I have no idea what is going on with that or if it’s a related to my home network!&nbsp; I DID RENAME MY LAPTOP when I got it back so it might be related
 to that!&nbsp; I don’t remember what the Tech Company had but it was HP computer (or similar) &amp; I have 2 other desktops that are HP so I did NOT want a home network problem.&nbsp; I may have caused one!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I TRULY DO APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE TO HELP ME WITH THIS SITUATION!&nbsp; GOD BLESS YOU</p>

<p>A questionable policy at best, IMHO. A violation of the Windows license at worst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Can you give me an idea as to the amount&nbsp;you were charged for the repairs (including the new HDD)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The computer was&nbsp;returned to your possession on or shortly after 13 May 2017, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In Windows Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\</strong><em><strong>VIPRE</strong> &lt;=this folder</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Select PROPERTIES: What's the CREATED date displayed on the resulting GENERAL tab?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Not really any of my business but did you purchase the HP computer (or any other computers) on QVC or HSN?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. You told me that KB4019264 is not listed in <strong>Installed Updates</strong>. Is KB4019263 and/or KB4018271 listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong>(<em>not </em><strong><em>Update History</em></strong>) and if so, when (exact date) was the update(s) installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. In IE11, execute keyboard shortcut <strong>ALT+T+A</strong> to open <strong>
Manage Add-ons</strong> interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. Is (VIPRE) <strong>Search Guard</strong> and/or <strong>Social Watch</strong> add-on(s)&nbsp;listed and if so, is the add-on(s)&nbsp;enabled (turned on)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISCUSSION: Most HP computers come with a Norton free-trial preinstalled. Similarly, most Dell computers come with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. If the tech used a Dell disk to install Windows 7 on the new HDD, chances are a McAfee free-trial was also&nbsp;installed.
 Doesn't matter if you never used it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact: Over the years we've come to learn&nbsp;that sometimes it's too late for the McAfee and/or Norton removal tools to "come to the rescue." This may be another one of those times.</p>

<p><span><span>I truly agree my original OS DVD’s should have been used, AND I VOICED THIS to the owner when I handed it over.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Had I known that he would have NOT used my paid copies of Windows I would of never had dealt with these guys either. Unfortunately, the fellow my family used for 15 yrs. retired &amp; I reached out to many people for referral’s but no one had
 any.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>So my laptop sat there for nearly 1 year not working.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I was left to using my iPad but on Good Friday a child dropped it &amp; left me with a cracked screen.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I brought my iPad Air that morning to these guys &amp; spoke with them at length &amp; they had a lot of business coming &amp; going all praising them.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When I returned to pick up my iPad &amp; dropped my laptop to be repaired again!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I had installed the Windows 10 PRO update last year &amp; had nothing but problems with it which Microsoft worked had attempted to repair with me over 40 hours with no avail.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So they instructed me to roll back to Win 7 Pro, but that didn’t work either after another 25 or more hours of troubleshooting with tech support on the phone.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So I finally paid a different local company (over 20 yrs.in business) to do the repair. I asked him to use my DVD’s and do a complete reformat &amp; clean install of my original Windows 7 Pro also.
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>When they contacted me a day later saying they were done already I was shocked!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>He claimed it was thousands of viruses/malware.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I said you’re kidding, how that can be I’ve barely been online for nearly 18 months &lt;removed&gt; &amp; if I did go online it was just to update my security software &amp; windows &amp; shut it down!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I add a new iPad I was using to read email &amp; another desktop.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> bad news he told me was he still had Windows 10 Pro!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When I got the laptop home, it wouldn’t connect &amp; I had error message after error message!
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I shut down &amp; brought it back the next morning.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>He called me &amp; said it looks like the HDD might need to be replaced.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I was firm that I wanted it matched with the same model/size/brand that HP built my PC with to prevent any future problems.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Almost 2 weeks go by &amp; I never heard from him &amp; now I am being told horror stories about the owner that was working on my laptop.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I’m like geez why didn’t anybody tell me this before.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I had already paid him $200, so I was invested now!! So my friend drove me there to see if it was ready.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>He said yes, it was working fine, &amp; he had it running for a day or 2 with no issues.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Awesome I said, I had to pay another $100 on top of the $200 I paid before for a total of $300.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Get it home, boot it up, again it will not connect to the internet. I called them &amp; now they think I’m a little nuts &amp; not being nice to me.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Regardless, they need to make this good &amp; fix my equipment so I go drop it off again. He screamed at me &amp; told me to not show up without calling him.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>He does not have time to deal with me without an appointment &amp; need to go there @ 8:00 in the morning before his tech goes on runs to business accounts he has.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>He runs the shop for drop offs &amp; sells used PC equipment I was informed which twist his moods badly!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I asked him about the HDD size, brand etc., &amp; this is when I discovered he put a 500GB instead of the 750 GB WD. HDD I had.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I said you knew I requested you to match my equipment.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Why would you put in what you wanted?</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span><span>He got extremely angry; he had 1 customer in there &amp; insulted me in front of the man. He looked like a fool.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>But nevertheless, I had to get my PC fixed, so 2 days later his tech called me to come drop off the laptop.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>He wanted to set it up just in case I was doing something wrong again stating it was working fine over there.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When gets here I’m told they put my old HDD back into the laptop then he boots up here &amp; has the same problems I’ve been having.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So he starts troubleshooting &amp; ended up staying here 2 hours &amp; couldn’t fix it. So, he says look back up ALL YOUR OWN STUFF….EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO SAVE….and call me when you’re done.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I said well, what about the HDD I paid for, where is it?</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>He says oh I have it &amp; I’ll keep it safe as a backup in case something gets lost you will have it for later.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I voiced how I didn’t’ feel comfortable with him keeping all my info &amp; then bringing it home.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>He said don’t worry; I have a 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> business repairing video game machines &amp; pool tables at home with a big storage building with thousands of small parts which I never misplace or lose.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It is very safe with me &amp; I will return it back after I wipe &amp; reload your laptop.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I said “so you’ll don’t ever do format &amp; clean install’s?</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Mine laptop never had a clean install?</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span><span>No, we don’t usually ever have to do this.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span><span>He told me being you just had another back surgery take your time &amp; back up everything you want on that new portable HD you wanted us to back up your laptop to then call me to come get it &amp; I will do a clean install at my home.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When I finished &amp; called him on his cell/&amp;/texted he NEVER RESPONDED.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So I had to call the shop, but he stated he has NO IDEA what I am talking about and he doesn’t have any HDD for me!!!!</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I relived the exact conversation to him, still he lied.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I called again, but NO ONE CALLS ME BACK!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I was screwed!</span></span></p>

<p>Still my browser Google Chrome does work with NO Problems!</p>
<div>
<p>I just can NOT understand what has happened, but this is what my problem was when I had updated OS to Windows 10 Pro. But this is a new HDD and the tech company didn't use my original CD's purchased when I ordered my laptop from HP with my OS and drivers.
 &nbsp;I spoke to them and I insist on them to reformat and do a clean install with my CD! &nbsp;So this is agreed with no problems! &nbsp;I will ask a driver to bring the laptop to them for repair!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you sooooo much for all your hard work! &nbsp;If I still have the same problems! &nbsp;I just think I will have to pass this PC down to my family for they like Google. &nbsp;I will have to wait and buy me another laptop are just invest in an iPad PRO! &nbsp;</p>
