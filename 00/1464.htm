<p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the sleep mode is not working can be due to Windows updates that changed your Power settings. To replicate and isolate your concern, let's create a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">test account</a></strong>. It will help us verify if it's an account profile is corrupted or the if there
 are any bugs. After creating a new account, switch accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we'd like to know if you're an Insider. Can you tell us your Windows version and OS Build number? To know, type
<strong>WINVER</strong> in the Cortana search bar and press Enter. The information will appear in a separate window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the sleep feature is still experiencing issues.</p>

<h2>            How to undo marking an email address as a Phishing Scam</h2>
                    <p>Since the migration to Outlook, I have accidentally marked 3 different senders as a Phishing Scam. &nbsp;Now, none of those 3 senders can get mail into my Inbox and it is creating problems. &nbsp;I have tried to create Rules to move them from "Unwanted" to my Inbox,
 I have added them to my "Safe Senders" and my "Safe Mailing Lists" and I have even made them Contacts of mine, but no matter what I try I cannot receive E-mail from them.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you may be able to provide,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you recover the deleted emails that were marked as Phishing scam and move them to your inbox. Check the link below:
<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restore-deleted-email-messages-in-Outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com</strong></a><br />
<br />
Then ask the senders you accidentally reported as Phishing scam to send you a new email to check if it will go through.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

    <title>E-72 Keeps Disconnecting Calls - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E-72 Keeps Disconnecting Calls</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone else have a problem with your E-72 disconnecting a call right in the middle of your conversation.&nbsp; Almost every day at least 2 to 3 times (and sometimes more) and regardless of how strong my incoming signal is, my E-72 just drops the call.&nbsp; My
 wife has her E-61i and we can&nbsp; be on separate calls in the same location and mine drops my call while hers does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I can't believe Nokia has released such a&nbsp;piece of junk as this phone.&nbsp; IT IS CLEARLY NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to take it back but now I hear that Nokia has closed their store in Chicago where I bought it.</p>

<p>I had the same problem , regardless of network signal strenght....and "solved" by setting on UMTS network only, but.yes, is a serious bug to me. Anyway, to me &nbsp;it's a kind of issue connected to a particular unfavourable combination SIM/Operator. In fact
 in an italiam forum I read of another nokia E72 user with the same problem and, guess, the same operator...(TIM)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;tried also getting a new SIM from my operator, but no result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the first days I had the phones, those who called me often got the&nbsp;"unreachable customer" message when instead I had the set on and strong signal...</p>
<p>I knew of the call by the&nbsp; sms "xxxx tried to contact you "... and of course had to called them back&nbsp;..</p>
<p>Now this problem seems to&nbsp;have&nbsp;disappeared..&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks Puasho.&nbsp; I will try changing the network setting to UMTS from Dual Mode.&nbsp; If that does not work, I will get some string and tie put two cans at each end.&nbsp; It will probably give me better coverage than the E72 :smileyvery-happy:

<p>...ok, I hope works for you too. In actual fact, one looses the GSM coverage (that in rural places sometimes is the only avaliable) and , furthermore, the GSM has better penetration indoor.....&nbsp;Sometimes it could happen one doesn't get coverage as UMTS channels
 are all ssigned (or the coverage is weack) and the phone can't switch to GSM to find stronger signal/avaliable channel, &nbsp;but it's a fairly remote event.</p>
<p>I had in minor frequency the same issue with my prevoius E61i, and apparently the bug was fixed after a pair (!!) of software update.</p>
<p>Keep us&nbsp;informed :))</p>

<h2>            12 years worth of emails from Hotmail LOST when account was moved over to OUTLOOK.</h2>
                    <p>12 years worth on my email account (REMOVED PII).com have been lost when my account was moved over to Outlook.</p>
<p>How can you simply remove all my emails and folders from my account , containing all my personal emails from family members (no longer with us) , and overseas friends.</p>
<p>I have tried your 'recover lost emails' , and frankly that wiki is a waste of time. &nbsp;I suspect you are very much aware of the issue the swap over has caused and the lost of very important emails for people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore please answer the following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. On what date did you delete my 1,000 emails from (REMOVED PII) in the swap over from Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;What notification was sent, and when , to advise me of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Why were they deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Please reinstate all these emails that we saved and stored on my hotmail account.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi rhettb,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let me assist you with your concern about your lost emails.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how frustrating it is for you to be having this kind of issue with your emails. Based on our investigation, out system showed that there has been an account inactivity that occurred earlier this year. This has resulted to the deletion of your
 emails. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please be informed that <span>If you haven't logged in to your account in Outlook.com for more than 365 days, emails will be lost due to inactivity in account even before you renamed the account. This also means there is no option to recover the emails because
 it has already been purged from the system and servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very important that you should access your Outlook.com account from time to time to prevent this kind of issue from happening again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>1.So in summary, it doesn't specify that you will remove all emails after 365 days of inactivity.</p>
<p>It simply says 'for a long time'. &nbsp; &nbsp;Whereas Randall above says it's after 365 days.</p>

<p>I've already used the Microsoft Support</p>
<p>Did I live chat with a gentleman who promised me he would look into it and restore emails and that I will receive an email to my inbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;within 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was 3 weeks ago. &nbsp; Heard nothing.</p>
<p>Hence, I have come onto here to voice my dissatisfaction</p>

            <p>Exactly the same has happened to me, 2003 is when I opened the account, and everything has gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say its due to "not logging in with a web browser", but the whole point is people nowadays use their mobile phones, which your service accepts, and not necessarily web browsers. Do you know how many accounts I have opened with this email address over
 the past 11-12 years for you to now delete all the data for? And the amount of personal messages I may have accrued for you simply delete?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like you to restore everything, 11 years of history just washed away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And your right, a "long time" is not a specified time period, and technically, I never signed out, my phone pushes my emails hundreds of times every day, I would advise you to change these policies because if your service is not recognizing requests from
 mobile phone applications as signing on, you are going to have a lot of angry customers when they find out their data has been eradicated and purged from your system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Anyway, my point is was there an update to the mail app? Under About it says my version is 17.4217.42251.0&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi. We are having this exact issue as well. However, the above fix doesn't work either. We are having an added issue that any office application doesn't stay signed in. Any guidance on how to resolve this?</p>

<p>1. Yes, confirmed. </p>
<p>2. This happens with a number of users on a number of different PC's. We are using the latest Office 2016 version and I've reinstalled.</p>
<p>3. See above</p>
<p>4. We are using Windows 10 with the latest updates and Groove.exe is 16.0.6868.2062</p>
<p>5. Unfortunately, this issue is intermittent and I don't have any screenshots on hand.</p>

<p>2. exit the onedrive for business sync client and all other office apps.</p>
<p>3. open an office desktop app such as word &gt; file &gt; account &gt; under user information, sign out all you existing accounts &gt; exit word.</p>
<p>4. go to control panel &gt; user accounts &gt; credential manager &gt; windows credentials &gt; under generic credentials, remove all your office 365 credentials.</p>

<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I have tried deleting that folder as well (it was apart of the original instructions, which I said I had tried before).</p>
<p>One issue that I did notice that I'm not sure is relevant is that Word/Excel etc doesn't seem to stay signed in. The user will sign in when they open word, then the next time they open it, it won't be signed in. Any advice?</p>

<p>Hi PFGStewart,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>From your description, you couldn't sign into OneDrive for Business successfully when you sync SharePoint Online libraries and you could sign into other Office applications, so the issue about keeping signed in may be not related
 to the OneDrive for Business sync issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this situation, let's focus on the OneDrive for Business sync issue in this thread. To make this post more clear to response the one specific question, we'd suggest you

<p>For the OneDrive for Business sync issue, I'd like to collect your tenant info and related logs for further investigation. You may provide the info via the

<br />
<br />Hello HardyJohn1
<br />
<br />What exactly do you mean by "Windows Hello ID" and more specifically ".......which my computer doesn't have"?
<br />
<br />If you are referring to an MS Account, that is a mandatory requirement for using the Office 365 Home subscription in order to activate the account. Every Office 365 subscription requires an MS Account.
<br />
<br />As for Windows itself, you can set it to work with a "local account'
<br />
<br />Switch your Windows 10 device to a local account

<p>When I bought my computer,&nbsp; Windows 10 and the Hello feature ( where you can sign in with your face) was not available. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason,&nbsp; it asks you to sign with Windows Hello pin,&nbsp; yet this is not enabled on my computer ( and I would have to buy a&nbsp;
 new one to get this).&nbsp; I have a Microsoft account ( I just changed my email address). &nbsp;&nbsp; It is an exchange account. &nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that this may be my solution. I will do this tomorrow and see if this works.</p>

<br />When I bought my computer,  Windows 10 and the Hello feature ( where you can sign in with your face) was not available.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />My apologies - been so long since I've used the Windows facial recognition feature  - completely forgot about it especially since you posted the question in the Office 365 forum and never encountered Outlook asking for a "Hello ID".
<br />
<br />The first time Outlook is started, it would (should) be asking for an email address/password which in your case would be the Exchange email account. From there - everything gets automatically configured
<br />
<br />In case it's relevant/of interest - place to set your compture's login settings for Windows Hello (facial, fingerprint, password, PIN) would be found by going to
<br />
<br />Windows  --&gt; Settings --&gt; Accounts --&gt; Sign-In Options

<br />I have several systems with differing capabilities - not all of which support facial recognition so the answer to your question si" No you don't need to set it up - just need to configure your system for the sign-In Options available. I don't bother with facial rec on any of my systems anymore. For sake of consistency, I just have them all set up to accept a PIN. None of them are set up to use a local account.

<p>The simple answer is that you cannot install unsigned SIS files to the N8. They have to be signed (usually) by the author of the app. It used to be the case that the end user was able to acquire their own signing certificate, but it seems the door has been
 closed to that avenue now and for good reason too. Most people only used the self signing of unsigned apps in order to install pirated software. That's a shame, because it means the end user can't use that service for legitimate means.</p>

    <title>N91 Firmware Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hpteenagewizkid  say:</h3>
<h2>            N91 Firmware Upgrade</h2>
                    Hello. I know this has been covered on here before, but I've looked over the net to see if that would offer some advice, but its only served to confuse me further.<br />
<br />
I recently bought an N91, and now want to upgrade it to the latest firmware. The Nokia Updater shows that there are no updates available, but I did see some updates on another website. The one I saw was the RM-43_APAC_10.03 and I was wondering if this was the
 latest version? Or is there a later one and if so can i download it?<br />
<br />
I am partially sighted, and would have quite a few problems getting to a Nokia centre, so if I can do this at home all the better. Plus, me being rather tech-hyper, it'd be wonderful to be able to do it myself.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for all of your help. I really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Hussein.

            Where did you find this update? I would *not* try to update from un-official sources unless you are willing to risk your device. Updater FAQ says that other models will be available later and I would personally asume that N91 is probably one of the first
 models to follow. Who knows, maybe it's available in few weeks/days? It's good to follow this discussion and also keep on trying to update every 2 weeks or so - one day you will just have positive surprise and updated N91!

            Thanks for your reply. I got the update from the dogtoe site, he has an ftp with firmware updates for about 10+ models, the N91 amongst them. Could be that it's not for the UK though - as I said to a friend this afternoon, the last thing I want is to have
 a newly upgraded phone with dollar signs floating all over the place (no offence to our US friends, lol).<br />
<br />
Will continue to check the updater, new firmware for the N91 apparently was released by Nokia on 17 August, but the Updater shows no firmware available, so might re-install it to double check its not a fault on my end.<br />
<br />
Would be grateful if anyone in the know could give some heads up on this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
<br />
Hussein.

            Personally I would never use cracked service tools available from internet to "fix" my phone. Who knows what the tool will do. One thing that will happen for sure is that using any dogtoe tools *will* invalidate your warranty! FAQ says that all Nseries
 devices will be supported by the official Nokia Software Updater so I guess as soon as they can Nokia will make also N91 SW available.

            Thanks for the reply. I didn't realise those tools were cracked - thought they were freeware and just released to allow people to upgrade their phones themselves. but now I see your point.
<br />
<br />
Just hope Nokia release the N91 stuff soon - I want to be able to play with my baby before Uni starts and I end up with no time for it :(

            Hi Hussein<br />
<br />
As the other users have said updating your phone from a non official source can invalidate your warranty. The only way to get an official software update for this handset at this time is to take the phone to a Nokia service point. We'd also advise keeping an
 eye on this page <a href="http://nokia.co.uk/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nokia.co.uk/softwareupdate</a> which is the only place to download official Nokia updates.<br />
<br />

            Hey there !<br />
I have also joined the league i.e. my N91 is also on te list of phones that need a upgrade. :-(<br />
<br />
first of all, i have N91-1 (India),<br />
but in INDIA, first N91-1 were available, but nowadays N91-5 (without wifi and 3G) is available.<br />
<br />
so my question is,<br />
1. will this software update (when it becomes available) deactivate my wifi and 3G functionality 'coz i have N91-1.<br />
and <br />
2. will this software update remove all my contacts, calender etc....<br />
<br />
3. if i sync my N91-1 with my PC ,will all the contacts merge with the outlook contacts, 'coz i hv O2 xda IIs (whose contacts are in sync with outlook)<br />
<br />
and i don't want those (O2) contacts or calender to mix up with my N91-1's ,when i sync it with my PC.<br />
<br />
or does Nokia PC-suite sync and keeps all the data in a different directory of it.<br />
<br />
can somebody find a solution to all these queries !!!

be patient. The software available in the NSU right now will change with time. The application will be able to detect what type of phone you have and give you the firmware for that model that you have.<br />

            Hi !<br />
<br />
My 91 hangs up more than 5 times a day, sometimes even more than that.<br />
<br />
so will some one (Nokia personnel) tell me, that when is this N91 software update going to be available on the software update website !<br />
<br />
'coz i don't want to send my phone to a 2 week trip to the nokia service centre,<br />
<br />
or is there any other alternative.<br />
and one thing more, when we do a complete backup of the N91 using latest Nokia pc-suite, are all the things like messages, notes, calender, contacts etc.. covered in that.<br />
so that after a possible software upgrade, and restoring that backup file, my phone will have all the things in that verycondition, in which it was before !<br />
<br />
<br />
and also karim could you give a complete reply from now on, 'coz in ur reply to my earlier post, u just asked me to be patient. and you didn't answered all the others question mentioned !!!

            Hi Karim,<br />
<br />
I'll hold on, much as I'm tempted not to, and wait for the N91 firmware to be released. Was reading some forums earlier that said it should be out in a couple of days? Is there any truth to this?<br />
<br />
Also thinking of getting an N70, as the fact that the N91 uses Symbian 60 3rd Edition is causing problems, as a lot of software hasn't been upgraded to work on this platform, and it doesn't appear to be backwards compatible with the standard S60 (or at least
 my speech applications are not working so i assume this is the case).<br />
<br />
Cheers again. Keeping my eyes peeled to the updater.<br />
<br />
Hussein.

<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing a flaw with login.microsoft.com on safari I-Phone SE version. There seem to be 2 privacy&amp;cookie messages at the bottem and top of the screen. The bottom message obscures the login button, so i can’t login. The only way to login on
 microsoft for me, is to use google, because there seems to not be a top message. Why is this? Is this essential, Microsoft? Do i seriously have to use google instead, or did something go wrong making the safari version? I think there should be only one privacy&amp;cookie
 message in one browser. And most deffinately no message on a login button, so Microsoft, if you can, please for the love of god fix this issue. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>After 'repairing' Office 2013 Home &amp; Business in Control Panel, I am in a perpetual loop trying to authenticate. Keep getting a message box saying that the product is not registered to my e-mail account - most likely because it was originally installed by
 a former employee. Although I have a product key, I am continually forced into online verification. I'm reluctant to un-install, as the product key card says it is to set up Office for 'the first time'. How can I sort this?<br />

            <p>Hi Austin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Outlook Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to activate the product using the Microsoft Account it has to be the one which was associated initially while redeeming the product key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case if you’re not sure about the Microsoft Account which was registered with the product, check if you have an option to activate using product key in the ‘Activation window’.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the ‘Activation window’ &gt; Click on the option ‘Enter product key’ below the box to enter email address and enter the product key and try to activate. Check if that allows you to complete the activation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further queries, reply and we would be happy to assist.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I really wish there was a viable option to Office right now because neither I or anyone else i know would ever use it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a week chatting and going back and forth with support and they finally sent me here. It doesn't look like this is a good option to get it fixed either :(</p>

            <p>Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to post on this. There is some comfort in knowing that I'm not alone with this particular problem - although the lack of progress from Microsoft, although expected, is disappointing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, as the IT Manager at Key-Tech, I have already started moves towards Libre Office (http://www.libreoffice.org) as our 'standard' office solution. We're a small organisation, but will struggle with the restrictions imposed with Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply and sorry for the delay in response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I proceed to assist, I need few details about the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From where did you purchase Office 2013 Home and Business suite?</p>
<p>2. How was it installed previously on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Did you redeemed the product key then registered with the Microsoft Account before installing on the computer?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had purchased the product key card of Office 2013 then you need to redeem it by registering with the Microsoft Account as explained in the section “I bought from a retailer (DVD not included)” in the link given below.</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/support/find-your-product-key-for-office-2013-HA102830243.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/support/find-your-product-key-for-office-2013-HA102830243.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So provide us the detailed information about the product purchase and the installation process which will help us to analyze and assist you in better way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

            <p>Hi Nayana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original purchase was made by my predecessor within the company (Key-Tech); I have only worked here for 4 months. I believe that the Office 2013 Home and Business suite product key was purchased from a local retailer of PC World (in Kirkcaldy, Fife,
 Scotland).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I was not present, I cannot say with absolute certainty how the software was installed on this particular computer; however, I recently installed Office 2013 Home and Business on 2 other computers (for another new member of staff and on a replacement
 PC for another) which I had purchased online from 'Coastal Software' (2 copies, one purchased on 19th September and one on 13th October) - I would expect that the installation process would have been the same. Also, the instructions within the box that I have
 with the product key are the same as the instructions I received by e-mail from 'Coastal Software - specifically, go to www.office.com/setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what sequence my predecessor may have followed, nor what e-mail account was used when he registered the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to re-activate the Office 2013 Home and Business software on the pc I am now using, which was 'new' when initially setup by my predecessor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
        </p>

            <p>So ... fair to assume that this is now an official 'dead end' so far as using the software that was originally purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do, however, have a further question to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we decide to invest in more Microsoft Office products, it would be prudent to at least understand the best way to manage this - specifically relating to a business environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise or offer any information about a suitable process for 'the business' to retain ownership, or at least a means of working access, of the software it is buying?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example. If said business currently has 2 x Office 2013 Home &amp; Business installed on 2 PCs and needs/desires to purchase another 2 x Office Home &amp; Business for installation on another 2 PCs. How is this best managed, in terms of the ''registration" on a
 Microsoft account? Can they be registered on the same Microsoft Account used for one of the first 2 purchases? Or, is it necessary for a new Microsoft Account to be used/created for each PC that is have the Office 2013 Home &amp; Business software installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be very desirable not to lose the use of software if the original employee (user) leaves the business but the PC with the Office 2013 Home &amp; Business software does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This effectively has happened after an update was actioned through the 'Control Panel / Programs and Features' on an existing PC.</p>

    <title>New Outlook.com sync issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New Outlook.com sync issues</h2>
                    <p>Love the new look and workings of the new Outlook.com ,but syncing has slowed to an unbearable speed when syncing&nbsp;w9th &nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>Syncing actions from the devices to Outlook.com web is almost instantaneous, but when you perform a function on the Outlook.com web on laptop the devices don't show changes for 10 to 20 minutes and sometimes only after other push emails come in and clear
 out the changes. Mark mail read on laptop Outlook.com web and iPhone apps&nbsp;don't show read for many minutes, Mark read on one of the iPhone apps and Outlook.com web syncs instantly.&nbsp;I'm using Outlook.com App on IOS and also the Apple mail App and they both
 respond the same way. One note also, the iPhone apps don't sync read between apps either. Again the long delay for one IOS app to sync to the other when read on the other app.</p>
<p>These issues were not the case before the update of Outlook.com that happened a few days ago.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>2. When you read mail on the outlook.com web it takes 10 to 20 minutes to sync to iPhone apps. Outlook and apple mail. If you read the mail on iphone apps sync is instantaneous on outlook.com web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This became an issue with the new outlook.com rollout last week.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Adding to what I've said.</p>
<p>It is a syncing slow issue, but only with PUSH.</p>
<p>If I open up the app it syncs, it's just slow to push mail sync changes ie: read mail.</p>
<p>Again this was not an issue before the new outlook.com rollout, sync push was almost instantaneous for read mail.</p>

            <p>The problem still persists nothing has changed. Push sync of read mail is instant when read on iOS outlook.com app but when read on the new outlook.com web it takes up to 20 minutes to sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All up to date,removed accts reinstalled etc etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>this issue since the new outlook.com went live. Syncing was instant both ways with old version.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> farey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access query calculate no of days ahead of date field</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create a reminder query which tell user something happens in this no.of days. For example, in a hotel, guests check-in date and check out date. I want get records of &nbsp;guests who checks-out in 3 days, 2 days, today. Meaning query should pull
 records of guests who check-out in today, tomorrow or day after tomorrow. Maybe it can be called something like "No.OfDaysBeforecheckout". It would also be nice if i can display this on form like "Today" "Tomorrow" or "Day after tomorrow" Instead of 1 day
 or 2 days or 3 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any help how i can generate it!</p>

            <p>Thanks Scot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it also possible to do this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bcoz i did this on query:&nbsp;NoDays: [DV]-Date() as new field so it gets me No.of days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering what is the best way i can display this on form like "Today" "Tomorrow" or "Day after tomorrow" Instead of 1 day or 2 days or 3 days. Maybe using a label or textbox</p>
<p />

            <p>Thank you Scott. I will check on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I think I need to keep all records of past also. I am so confused on this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if want keep guest who to checkout today/tomorrow/and day after tomorrow plus guests&nbsp;who checked out in the past what could I do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will set a criteria on query under field "Gueststatus" value "checkedout". What I basically need is, when user is informed of these guests, user need to update "gueststatus" and unless user updates it, I want keep these records on my reminder report!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Appreciate your coop.</p>

            You will need separate queries. Maybe then use a Union query.

    <title>Restore a windows 10 backup on a new phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claude_01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore a windows 10 backup on a new phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I've just upgraded to a Lumia 550 from a Lumia 535 which was running an insider programme version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>I'm in the setup process on my new phone and it's asking me if I want to restore a recent backup from my previous phone. I want to do that but my new phone doesn't have an SD card yet and I was using lots of the storage on my old phone, so I'm worried that
 the restore might fail because I don't have enough storage. Is there some way I can find out or do I just have to try it and see. And if it fails will I be able to re-try once I've added an SD card in my new phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            To answer your last question: You cannot re-try while using the phone, restoring a backup works only while in the setup process.

<h2>            Nokia 1650-Contacts NOT displayed in alphabetic order.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I got this Nokia 1650 before few days. I have few contacts as follow:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malibu Ameet</p>
<p>Malibu Abhinav</p>
<p>Malibu Dhirendra</p>
<p>and&nbsp;more of 10-15 "Malibu" contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>other group is as follow:</p>
<p>CSC Vinod</p>
<p>CSC Mayur</p>
<p>and&nbsp;more of &nbsp;5-10 "CSC" contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now my phone book is not showing these contacts in alphabetic order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it shows as follow:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malibu Dhirendra</p>
<p>Malibu Ameet</p>
<p>Malibu Abhinav</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same type of unusal order of display is happening with CSC contacts too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I inserted my SIM in different handset but same model 1650 and again phone book display was NOT in alphabetic order there too. But if same SIM is inserted in other phone model then it displays the phone book in proper alphabetic order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted Nokia service twice and they were unable to help me out with this. They just updted my phone software to 5.80 but not solved the problem. This is happening with all Nokia 1650 handsets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked about space in between 2 words in my contacts and found no discripancy in that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can be the solution for this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, Let me tell you that I dont have a 1650, so I dont know if your phone has the foll. feature. Anyway, try this out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to add a new contact, If your phone has an option to enter first name and last name, then enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First name as :Ameet &amp;&nbsp;last name as:&nbsp;Malibu&nbsp;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly for everyone..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it should work fine and the extra advantage is that even if you search for a name, then all contacts whose first name or last name starting with that name will be displayed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#999999">Mark me a kudos if this helped</font></p>

            Thanks for reply vipin. This is a basic phone. It doesn't have last name first name fields. It just got one files called "Name". Sorry but your solution is not applicable here.

<h2>            SharePoint Alerts are not working</h2>
                    
<p>SharePoint is no longer sending Alerts from lists today.&nbsp; Last night I received a daily alert from a list, but today all alerts are not working.&nbsp; I have deleted the alerts and rebuilt them.&nbsp; Tried a test list on a new site with a ALL CHANGE INSTANT alert.&nbsp;
 Still nothing,&nbsp; I have not found anything online that points me to a fix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi thad,</p>
<p>could you try the following steps to narrow down the issue?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;could you try enter another e-mail address directly to see if you can receive the alerts?<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d60d128a-baa5-4d35-b302-6690bf6a83a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd60d128a-baa5-4d35-b302-6690bf6a83a7" /></a><br />
2.&nbsp;can you receive other emails sent to the email account normally?<br />
3.&nbsp;do you receive the notification after setting up a new alert?<br />
4.&nbsp;does the issue happen to your onedrive for business?<br />
5.&nbsp;do other users in your organization encounter the same issue?</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
eric yang</p>
