    <title>can I switch skype account for office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank-s1  say:</h3>
<h2>            can I switch skype account for office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am asking this question because I have not purchased a subscription yet and do not know how the My Account interface works. The preview edition I am using does not have the feature. I do need clarification before buying because in case there's later not
 much room for changes I want to use the correct MS account for signing up for the subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My QUESTIONs: </p>
<p>After I will have purchased a subscription ...</p>
<p>1) ... can I assign ANY Skype account or must that be the one which is already connected to my Office Sign-in Microsoft address (=Office sign-in address is the one I will use to purchase Office365) ?</p>
<p>2) ... once I activated Skype and have connected a Skype account, ... WILL I BE ABLE to switch the 60-min bonus / per month to another SKYPE account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following questions are with regard to the connected Skydrive account:</p>
<p>After I will have purchased a subscription </p>
<p>1) ... can I choose which Skydrive account shall receive the 20meg bonus storage OR MUST it be the Office sign-in account (=the account I used when I purchase office 365?</p>
<p>2) ... can the associated skydrive account being switched later? (...I certainly do understand that in that case the 20 meg would be stripped off the initial skydrive and assigned to the later chosen one)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Frank</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no, sorry, your response sounds to me like you just read keywords in my post and quickly typed an boilerplate response.
</p>
<p>My post is OFFICE related, specifically because the Skype 60-min activation happens in My Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For you and anyone who has already the 1-year office365 subscription it would just take a second to look at your account IF there is the possibility to make later changes to the SKYPE name and for the second question I had, to the Skydrive&nbsp;setting (==meaning
 change the&nbsp;skydrive account that gets the 20 megs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, please just take a look at your own account (if you have one).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Frank&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I found on the Skype pages that the Skype account can be unlinked and re-linked.</p>

            <p>You can change the Skype account used for Office 365 by first deactivating your Skype minutes from this page: https://stores.office.com/deactivateskype.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, you can go to Office.com/MyAccount and re-activate your Skype minutes using a different Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for OneDrive, that uses the same account as your Office 365 subscription (your Microsoft account). So you can't assign the 1 TB OneDrive storage to a different account. However, if you have Office 365 Home, you can share your subscription with other users
 (i.e. with other Microsoft accounts). Those other Microsoft accounts will then also have their own 1 TB OneDrive storage.</p>

<h2>            Exchange 2010 quota exceeded false error</h2>
                    I have Exchange 2010 and a client with Outlook 2010, there was a mistake in setting up her Outlook on her new computer where her .pst was added in to her inbox instead of adding it as a data file. Therefor she has now exceeded her mailbox quota. I have
 since increased her mailbox limit to 20gb AND removed the pst. It is still saying she is over her limit. Is there a way to make outlook check with the server for the new limit? What can I do here?

            Exchange always holds the space cached for 30 days. The quota will decrease after that time. If you check your exchange database, the diskspace will be exact same before and after the removal of the PST.

<p>Hi all, I looked for an answer and didn't find it. Granted I didn't understand 80% of what I read.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. I am working with an Excell timesheet for my stocker. I have all the formulas figured out to get the hours correct, but I want one that will calculate the total hours worked into dollars earned. Also what this cell should be formatted
 as?</p>
<p>This is the data I have G28(the total hours worked Formatted as Time), Times the pay rate in B4(formated as General).</p>
<p>The number I get is a 1.94???? not sure how to translate that into $$$$$$</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

                    I have a student subscription through my school and I downloaded the software about 2 years ago, but recently I've been wanting to work on Publisher and I realized that I don't have it. Is Publisher supposed to come with a student subscription or do I
 have to get that separately?

<p>Hi Megan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can understand your willing to have Publisher working on Mac. However, just like Cliff mentioned, Publisher is only available for Windows. Besides, some other apps such as Access/Visio/Project are also only available for Windows.
</p>
<p>The good news is there are two workarounds to help you use them when you have a Mac.
</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Use Windows visual machine on your Mac.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the workarounds above can help you any.</span></p>

            <p>PowerPoint does not show as an option, so I go through the Browse to the PowerPoint program and click on it. However, it still will not show as a selection. As I mentioned above, the description for a .pptx file in the "Set Association" shows up as PPTX
 File and not as a "Microsoft PowerPoint File. Very strange!</p>

            Ok doke, yep you shouldn't have any difficulties opening them from within powerpoint. Rather than doing it from default programs try this way instead...
<div><br />
<div>Create a PPTX file with PowerPoint, save, and close it. Now right click the file and select Open With and Choose Default Program. See if PowerPoint is listed otherwise browse to it....</div>
<div><br />
<div>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\PowerPnt</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure "Always use selected program.." is ticked and click OK.</div>

            Just tried that. It saves it as a pptx file and then the same thing happens as described above. I wonder if it is a Windows 7 issue by not allowing .pptx files to show as PowerPoint and instead as PPTX Files. It just doesn't seem to want to make that association.

            So in "Set association" where it says pptx file.It will&nbsp; be described as a "pptx file" if it's not associated with PowerPoint or a program that recognises this file type.but does anything show in the Current Default column?<br />

            Good point. In the "Current Default" I have "Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer". A year ago I was running a conference and people had to bring me their presentations on a stick and I ran them from my laptop. I was using Office 2003 at the time so could
 not run the participants pptx files. I went to the MS web site and downloaded 2003-2007 viewer and used the "Set Associations" to associate pptx files with the VIEWER application. Now that I have Office 2010 I cannot seem to get the "Set Associations" to allow
 me to even have PowerPoint 2010 as one of my options to associate pptx files too.

<p>It is not, unfortunately.&nbsp; That reset path doesn't even take - you select Powerpnt.exe and then the dialog closes, but nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Seems like a registry setting...seems like an issue that MSFT would have patched, as it's clearly a bug in the software.&nbsp; But so far I have been unsuccessful in finding a single success story around fixing the PPTX file association problem.&nbsp; Just have to
 open PPT first and then navigate to the file...how Kludgey </p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft community and We will be glad to assist you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, you want to move the Office installation files to another drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 2013, if installed as Click-to-Run version will be installed on Windows drive by default. Moving the installed files is not advised as the installation files are linked with the files present
 on the default drive (c:\ drive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove all traces of Office 2013 on both the drives. You may run the fixit from this article to remove all traces of Office 2013:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></a></p>
<p>If the fixit does not remove the installation files from d:\ drive, you may have to manually remove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to install Office 2013 on a different drive, download the integratedoffice.exe file for Office 2013 and you may choose the location to install on D:\ drive. However the associated files
 will be present in C:\ drive only as those files will be associated with Windows and need a platform to work normally. These supporting files/folders cannot be moved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful. If you need further assistance, reply and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div><br />
<div>MS: Why did it install on my C drive? &nbsp;It took such a long time to download on my slow home connection and install and now you telling us we have to run a "fixit" module to uninstall it? &nbsp;Where is the integratedoffice.exe file?</div>
<div><br />
<div>MS: Why not just give us the option in the first place for those of us who use HUP?</div>
<div><br />
<div>MS: Or at the very least, look at our HD and see Office 2010 is on another drive and ask us at that point. &nbsp;It appears you tried to make the installer smarter than usual but in fact, made it dumber.</div>

            <p>No, I don't have a solution.&nbsp; I've increased the size of my C: and installed it there, but I'm not happy about this.&nbsp; I guess that Microsoft's attitude is that they know best so we'll just have to live with it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just glad I got it through HUP so I didn't pay the full retail price or I'd be absolutely livid.</p>

            It appears you can download the trial version as an alternative and put in the HUP key to activate the product.&nbsp; Nice!&nbsp; Still this is a shameful experience that we have to do all that and pull our hairs out.&nbsp; Nice one King of OS.<br />

Remember, just enter YOUR product key code that you got from the HUP purchase.&nbsp; Everything should check out ok after that.

            <p>That whole integratedodffice.exe thing seems to be a red herring. I'm told by support, who put me on and apparently tried it, that it does the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft did 2 really silly things with Office 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) They removed the ability to specify the drive that the bulk of Office get's installed to. I talked to someone at Microsoft support who said there have been a lot of complaints about this and that Microsoft was working on it. I take that with a grain of
 salt. In other words, I'll believe it when I see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) There is no ability to pick which components of Office you want to install. It just installs everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what ever happened to that idea of Express (think click to run) &nbsp;vs Custom/Advanced install we've all gotten used to over the last decade? Come on Microsoft, get your act together. Windows 8 and Office 2013 seem to show a pattern of removing choice and
 imposing Microsoft's will. Listen to you customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On to the topic of using the evaluation copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start with it forces you to uninstall any 32 bit office products in order to install the 64 bit eval. The HUP x64 installer did not care. Thankfully, I have physical media to reinstall my 2010 pro if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The eval installer does indeed allow for both items I listed above. You get to choice the product features and the install location. After installing, I started Word and clicked the link to enter a license key below the big Activate button and put in my
 HUP key. Big saver, I was about to return my Office 2013.</p>

            <p>Yes, I'm fairly certain I took Henry's advice and it worked for me too, because it's now installed on my D: drive - I say fairly certain because it was quite a while ago and my memory ain't what it used to be.&nbsp; Anyway, I've achieved what I wanted to do in
 the first place, so I'm happy enough now.</p>

<p><span>Since your subscription is Office 365 E3 Enterprise, it is not feasible to install to Office 2010/2007 version, as downgrade rights are not possible with Office 365 ProPlus licenses.</span></p>

            First let's be sure you are in the right forum. This is Office for Mac. If you are in Office for Mac, can you post a screen shot showing the problem.<br />
<br />
Command-Shift-3 takes the entire screen<br />
Command-Shift-4 takes a portion of the screen. &lt;--use this one<br />
<br />
You can also use Grab in Applications to take a screen shot.<br />
<br />
Post the screenshot link using a service like ImageShack, Flickr, PhotoBucket. You cannot post images directly to this forum.&nbsp;

</p><p>Do you happen to have Dell monitors and are running the Dell Display Manager?&nbsp; It's tied into that application.&nbsp; Go into the settings and you can see different applications have different display types.&nbsp; I haven't figured out how to turn of the feature that
 causes it to display the type.</p>

<p>Im still getting use to this Windows Mobile thing.&nbsp; when my phone is sitting idol with no programs running, it will still at random light up like something happened when nothing is happening.&nbsp; Ive even turned the phone off and back on and having
 done nothing to it after it turns on and it will still light up at random times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its been doing this ever since I bought it new.&nbsp; What do I look for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, is there a recycle bin somewhere?</p>

            I had this issue once where my device would light at 4am even though there was no application in the Running Program list. So I went to check each application installed on my device and found that it was the backup software. Since yours is a random behaviour,
 check the applications. Maybe there is one trying to update itself. Just a thought.

<p>Mine does that when it's checking for email (I have several accounts that I have set to check for mail at certain intervals). I've noticed that when I had turned off the 'auto-check' feature, that the issue went away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As already stated, there could be a couple of programs that may cause this issue (depending on what you have installed on your ppc). I don't think there is anything wrong with your unit, it's just coming out of a sleep mode to do some work

You can use a program like RegShot to compare which registry settings were changed going from "don't warn" to "warn." On my Win7 laptop, this was the key that changed:</p>
<p>HKU\S-1-5-21-3033527107-2169795926-1853295567-1000\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WarnonZoneCrossing: 0x00000001</p>
<p>0x00000001=warn , 0x00000000=don't warn</p>
<p>You can download RegShot from here: <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/download965.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.majorgeeks.com/download965.html</a><br />
It's very simple to use.</p>
<p>There is another setting under the Security tabs and in each of the zones. Highlight each, click Custom Level..., scroll down to the Miscellaneous section and find "Display mixed content." If it's set to Prompt, you'll get a similar message about "Do you
 want to display both secure and non-secure data."</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Mac - Migrate from old Mac without over-writing new</h2>
                    <p>Dear all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! Sorry, this is a bit long and messy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Migration from old Mac to new has only sort-of worked...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a veteran Mac user but don't spend much time "under the hood" of Office 2016, so this has me stumped. I'm using Office 365</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before installing my new iMac I did the following</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Copied my <em>username</em>/Library files to an external drive</li><li>Exported .olm file including all options&nbsp;</li><li>Made a hardcopy note of server/account logons etc</li><li>Backed up / duplicated various support files for other apps</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>When I setup the new Mac </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>used Apple's built-in migration tool to transfer whatever (didn't include Office, but must confess didn't check&nbsp;<em>username</em>/Library&nbsp;</li><li>finished the hardware setup (various external drives, server connection etc)</li><li>Logged into 365 and downloaded /installed Office&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>... at which point I thought: "Must import the .olm files before doing any new setup..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .olm file has not brought over a couple of hundred mails which were carefully filed / categorised in On My Computer files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging by file size, they DO appear to be in my duplicate Group Containers folder, albeit as two separate folders, Main Profile and Profile 1 (dates of both correspond to dates when I was doing system upgrades / rebuilds on the old Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I simply copy those folders to my new&nbsp;<em>username</em>/Library, I fear it will overwrite this week's new messages and those that came over with the .olm file (essentially last week's "live" inboxes etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? I don't want to lose all the old emails – some of them are business info / projects / audit etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken in Caen</p>

<p>Hello Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean that after importing the OLM files, the emails didn’t appear in the new Outlook for Mac client? Generally, we suggest customers export and import OLM files to move the data from an old Outlook for Mac client to a new Outlook for Mac, instead
 of pasting the Mail Profile directly. If you copy and paste the profile folders, this week’s new emails in the new Mac will be over-written. If you import the OLM files, the old emails will show a separate list in under On My Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your situation, you have didn’t choose the correct Outlook for Mac profile, please
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-or-identities-in-Outlook-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
refer to this link</a> and switch between Main Profile and Profile 1 to see if the emails show in one of the 2 profiles.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have check the 2 profiles, I suggest you <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-email-messages-contacts-and-other-items-into-outlook-2016-for-mac-6cc48404-a65c-4b8c-a12a-95a905249414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
re-import the OLM files</a> to see if the old emails will show now. Before you import the OLM files, I suggest you both export the data to OLM files in the old Mac and the new Mac to prevent data loss.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the emails still don’t show in the On My Computer folder, please use the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517?auth=1">

<p>When migrating to a new computer, I don't typically use the .olm route.</p>
<p>I use the migration assistant to import the Mac user account, which copies over the identity from the old Mac.</p>
<p>Just so you know, the identity is located in&nbsp;~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile. When importing the account, the migration assistant also copies over the content of the ~/Library folder so it (in theory)
 works just fine, but since you didn't select that folder when you migrated, obviously, the data didn't carry over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, there shouldn't be anything wrong with going through a .olm. The only problem with the .olm is that to doesn't take over account settings, rules, etc. Just the data itself.</p>
<p>Now that you have some data in the identity, copying over the&nbsp;~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile folder is indeed problematic if the emails are in the On My Computer section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you, I'd try two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export to the .olm again on the old Mac (making sure you have enough hard drive space for that). Maybe something went wrong the first time around, or you had forgotten to select something.</li><li>Do it the other way around: export to a .olm from the new Mac, archive the&nbsp;~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile identity, then copy over the identity from the old Mac and then re-import whatever new data
 you have in the .olm.</li></ol>

<p>You can drag and drop messages to the Finder to create a .eml file. These can be edited in a text editor.</p>
<p>Now… That remains tedious. Personally, I use an archiving app for this sort of things. There are many out there, but my own choice was
<a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">EagleFiler</a> which is fast, efficient and versatile.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro-office.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DEVONThink For Office</a> is great too, but more expensive (though it can be used for a LOT of things).</p>

<p>Hello Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply because I was off-duty before. Thanks for the sharing @Cortig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding to “the import delivered only the current Inboxes”, do you mean that only the emails in the Inbox of the 2 accounts have been imported to the new Mac?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About this “they don't seem to retain plain-language names”, can you please capture a screenshot and make an example for better understanding?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under this circumstance, my suggestion is that:</p>
<p>1 . Please <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-items-to-an-archive-file-in-outlook-for-mac-281a62bf-cc42-46b1-9ad5-6bda80ca3106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
export the OLM files</a> in the old mac again.</p>
<p>2 . In the new Mac, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-profiles-or-identities-in-outlook-for-mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new profile</a> and set it as default. Don’t delete the old profile to prevent data loss. Then restart Outlook for Mac using the new profile.</p>
<p>3 . <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-email-messages-contacts-and-other-items-into-outlook-2016-for-mac-6cc48404-a65c-4b8c-a12a-95a905249414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Import the OLM files</a> again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please monitor if there is any error message during the exporting and importing. If you encountered some error message, please capture a screenshot and upload it for further check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At last, I want to confirm that the issue now is that: you have exported and imported the OLM files, but after the import, only the emails in the Inbox shows. The sent emails are missing under
<strong>On My Computer</strong>. What about other newly created folders? And in the new Mac, you have set up your email account, and used for a while, so you need to import the old emails without overwriting the new emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience and cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>Thanks, Rick</p>
<p>
</p><p>I no longer have the old files within a copy of Outlook. They were on my old iMac which had various problems. Hence the decision to buy the new iMac 27 on which I want to use my email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the advice of Apple tech support I backed up the internal disk and then re-formatted it for a clean MacOS install. This can now be used to manage the network backup (for which the data will be stored on&nbsp; 2x5Tb + 2x3Tb USB external drives).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I have a "Group Containeers" folder in the backup, which contains the Profile. The attached screen grab gives a sample ≠ but I do of course have the complete folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... shall I now go to my new Outlook app and proceed as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Export olm file containing the current messages</li><li>Delete those messages</li><li>Restart Outlook and "clean up" so that it looks like a new installation <br />
– OR indeed perform a new install</li><li>Close Outlook</li><li>Copy the backup Group Containers folders to my <em>username</em>/library folder</li><li>Relaunch Outlook</li><li>Check that it is using the imported Profile – tidy up as necessary</li><li>Import the olm file and then manually copy messages from it to the "live" locations, eg Inbox, Sent etc</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Does that sound the way to go? Is there a less laborious route?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

<p>Hello Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don’t need to delete any messages or perform a new install. Based on my test, if I import the same olm file to one profile in Outlook for Mac, it will automatically identify it as “xxx OLM” and “xxx OLM 1”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my suggestion is:</p>
<p>1 . In the new Outlook for Mac, export the data to OLM files for backup.</p>
<p>2 . <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-profiles-or-identities-in-outlook-for-mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a new profile and set it as default</a>. Reopen Outlook for Mac client and Import the OLM file from the old Outlook for Mac again.</p>
<p>3 . Check if all the emails are shown now. If not, please let me know which part of the emails don’t show in the new Outlook for Mac client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If some parts of the emails still don’t show, it may because something went wrong when exporting OLM files in the old Outlook for Mac client. I suggest you

<p>I take it&nbsp;she installed it?</p>
<p>I would suggest first extracting the OEM product key, just in case anything goes wrong. You can use&nbsp; one of these tools to extract the product key from the registry. Take a look in your Program Files folder and see if there are multiple copies of Word, Excel
 and Powerpoint installed in different folders. Probably not, since a default installation was done.</p>
<p>It would probably be a good idea to also make an image copy backup before doing any uninstalls.</p>
<p>Then Uninstal the Office Pro. Since there is an overlap in programs there is a chance that it might take out all or part of your&nbsp;OEM installation too. Then you would have to re-install Home and Business. But I suspect you might have a problem activating
 installation files downloaded from MS. You might have to go back to the vendor for the installation file.</p>

            <p>First, please establish that the computer actually came with an OEM installation of Office Home &amp; Business (H&amp;B) 2010.</p>
<p>Background:&nbsp; Most computers from major manufacturers are coming with the Office 2010 Single Image installed, which when first started by the initial user, can be activated as (1) the free Office 2010 Starter Edition, (2) a Trial of Office Home and Student
 2010 or Office Professional 2010, or (3) in conjunction with the purchase of traditional packaged discs or a product key card, one of the following:&nbsp; Office H&amp;S 2010, Office H&amp;B 2010, or Office Professional 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If she cannot look on her invoice from the computer manufacturer and see a substantial extra charge for an OEM installation of Office H&amp;B 2010, then it's almost a certainty that the computer does not have an OEM license but came with the Office 2010 Single
 Image that has been activated as a Trial of Office Professional 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTOH, if she can see that extra cost for an OEM license for Office H&amp;B 2010 on her invoice, then what has happened is that the computer manufacturer has installed her Office H&amp;B 2010 license but when activating such, she did not uncheck the box that when
 checked also installs Trials of the differential programs that make up Office Professional 2010.&nbsp; So in addition to the programs that make up Office H&amp;B (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook), which should be now be activated as perpetually OEM licensed
 product, her computer will have Trial installations of Access and Publisher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can verify my hypothesis by opening W, X, PP, ON, and OL and they should not have Trial in the title bar; if you open A and P you should see Trial in the titlebar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She can uninstall the Trial and revert back to her OEM licensed H&amp;B by opening Word and clicking on File&gt;Help, and looking for the "Licensing Operations" button to uninstall "Office Professional 2010", which will uninstall the differential programs and leave
 her Office H&amp;B 2010 intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Reference: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/convert-a-trial-version-of-an-office-2010-suite-or-program-to-a-full-retail-version-HA101886436.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above article states&nbsp;that Office 2010 is capable of converting a&nbsp;Trial of a specific edition of Office 2010 to&nbsp;being perpetually licensed if the Office edition is to stay the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also implies (to me) that if you want to convert a Trial of one edition to a perptual license of another edition, that is not direclty &nbsp;possible.&nbsp; If my understanding is true, then in your case, where you have Professional activated as a Trial, but you
 purchased H&amp;B, you will not be able to directly convert the Trial of Professional to a perpetual H&amp;B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Working with Office 2010 and my customers, I have not yet had occasion to try to convert a Trial of one edition to a perpetual of another so I can't say from experience whether that can be done or not.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when it comes time to do so, you will uninstall Office 2010 Professional from the Programs applet of Control Panel, restart, then use your traditional packaged discs and the included product key for Office H&amp;B 2010 to do a fresh installation of Office
 H&amp;B 2010 onto your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that uninstalling Office is not programmed to affect your documents, data, email, contacts, etc in any way, as these are store elsewhere (in your User profile).&nbsp; And note that after installing Office H&amp;B 2010, it should immediately see all of your existing
 docs, data, email contacts and etc (you may have to re-enter your email account passwords).&nbsp; Having written that, I would also like to note that it's always a good idea to back up important docs, data and email (a) on a regular basis and (b) whenever making
 a big change to your computer, such as installing or reinstalling Office.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure what you mean because English doesn't appear to be your first language. However, all addresses ending in @msn.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com, and @outlook.com are Outlook.com addresses. You can use any address ending in those domains to
 log into Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what you're asking about two-step verification. I use it all the time and know how it works quite well. If you want to configure an account on a phone so that it accesses an Outlook.com mailbox which has two-step verification enabled, it may
 or may not be able to ask you for a code. It depends on the app you're using to access the mailbox. In some cases, instead of a code, you'll need to supply an app password instead of your regular password. See the article&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">App
 passwords and two-step verification</a>&nbsp;for a description of the process.</p>

<p>Please allow me more words on these : </p>
<p>
</p><p>Example for link of posting here : </p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oadmincenter-oother/hotmail-two-step-verify-code-unable-received-again/9446c1bd-6edc-43e9-acb7-ff107d231ad5?messageId=b12c7a60-ecb9-4d51-8fd3-852d58c65b28</p>

<p>it has independent profile share one @hotmail.com account although&nbsp;, similar as if &nbsp;the hosts such as msn, outlook, live etc., of which had never been made any profile to and open any account in these domains except ,&nbsp; the only insisted one that of @Hotmail.com
 for me.&nbsp; At time in the one password passed through to a never registered domain account mentioned ahead left ones , it truly shocked me as no account , no profile written to over there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no program or assistance to&nbsp;find &nbsp;out whether these domains above &nbsp;are been created to access in Two Step Verify where when the request to be sent to Microsoft server , in case&nbsp;some &nbsp;programed online interjected , so on... cases , have me put into
 concerns on related the case No Verify &nbsp;Codes received these few months , and ever verified codes during years unable to be searched existing from the messages , which all been unexpected lost when the supplier want them, these older messages... who think
 those are only clues they can find to help them in the end server , check if the message transferred the codes to , then they can forward to me .&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Microsoft claimed yesterday on phone , they are having the code various with time and reach company , so at the moment there is no way to get the verify code, almost equals to there is no anyway to give the supplier any workaround to do nothing .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Furthermore, the txt by phone Two Step Verify approach enter simply last four digits , not full phone number, this is weakness to track phone to domain account corresponding to receive the code another uncertainness .
</p>

<p>Really does depend on what you mainly use your phone for, there are other makes(I don't use them , but believe they exist) E series probably best for communications talk, txt and e-mail, N series more media based web, video apps etc. If photo's are your
 thing I would look at N86 , gets good results, but best advice is talk to users and a bit of independent research.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mobiletechreview.com/Nokia.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mobiletechreview.com/Nokia.htm</a></p>
<p>and also try googling 'the phone show' very informative and Steve Lichfield knows his stuff.</p>
<p>But depending on your personal preferances you may find a much cheaper phone may fulfill all your requirements .</p>

            I bought the n86 3 weeks ago after doing some research - i couldn't find a better Nokia. However the few additional features may not be enough for you, i know i get bored with any phone after about 6 months. The only other Nokia to tempt me was the N900
 but i wasn't brave enough.

<p>QWERTY and a good net browser would be great. i have read a lot of bugs on the N900 but since its a new release i can understand that. so now it will be down to N97mini or E72.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the advantage of N97mini is a wider screen over E72 but i don't know what are the problems on the N97mini if it is still all the same as its older brother the N97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i would like to but this week because its new year and i would like to start by having a new, bug less (a perfect phone is still a dream) and useful phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may have a problem that opening the Excel Spreadsheet locks the table for Access accessing the linked table. &nbsp; Try changing the Access method in Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Access , go to Tools --&gt; Options --&gt; Advanced --&gt; Default Open Mode</span></p>
<p><span>2) Close excel, close access.</span></p>

<p>If you really did&nbsp;Link to the Excel range (instead of importing it), then modified data in an existing row&nbsp;in Excel should show up on an open form or datasheet&nbsp;within the<em>Refresh Interval</em> (Tools&nbsp;- Options - Advanced).&nbsp; If you added new rows to the
 Excel range, then you have to Requery the form or datasheet to see the new revords.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;you open a table/query/form/report <em>after</em> the Excel data was changed and the new or changed data does not show up, then&nbsp;you imported a copy of&nbsp;the data.&nbsp; In this case, delete the imported Access table and use Get External Data - Link Tables

            You can't on the Mac. Excel takes that information from the system settings. Quit Excel. Make sure the Language and region settings are correct and then start Excel. If they are correct and you still need different values for Excel, I'm afraid that it
 can't be done on the Mac.<br />

<h2>            Word .docx recovery</h2>
                    Word 2016 running on Windows 10.&nbsp; Was working with a password-protected document and tried to save it.&nbsp; Word offered my the choice to convert it to a more secure .xml file format.&nbsp; When I declined to do so, Word crashed.&nbsp; When it restarted, the autorecovery
 option was weird (all of my data was deleted inside the document) and it was in some kind of weird liverecovery format.&nbsp; So I closed all that out and restarted Word, but now I cannot open my file because it claims the document format doesn't match the document
 extension (.docx).&nbsp; How can I recovery any data from my very important file?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span><span>To sort this out, please provide the following information:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this the first time the user experience the issue? If so, were there any changes made prior to this?</li><li>Does the issue persist using a different Office applications?</li><li>What is the build and version of Excel that you're using? To check , please click this

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest observing if you're also experiencing the similar behavior when editing and saving using a different Excel file. Through this, we can identify if the problem was file specific or was with Excel application.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Backup Automation One Drive for  Business</h2>
                    
<p>I am admin manager</p>
<p>CURRENT SET UP:</p>
<p>I have 4 locations. each with their own user and own One Drive for Business. ODFB&nbsp;</p>
<p>All their ODFB are shared with my admin login. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CURRRENT PROBLEM</p>
<p>Recently, &nbsp;one of the users DELETED FILES on his own local ODFB &nbsp;- &nbsp;I restored from the ODFB RECYCLE but I had to login under that SPECIFIC USER . &nbsp;I thought for sure the USER ODFB that was always sharing to my ADMINISTRATION, &nbsp;would be protected even if
 a specific user decided to DELETE FILES from either their desktop, ODFB or ODFB recycle bin</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I see a DATA Integrity problem here!</p>

<p>I also notice &nbsp;this new &nbsp;ODFB Interface and I see that you can go back to CLASSIC? &nbsp;</p>

<p>thank you community in advance</p>

<p>i am the Admin maanger of my organization. &nbsp;I have 4 locations.</p>
<p>I get it ! &nbsp; &nbsp;SHAREPOINT lets you create a SECURE COMPANY SITE. &nbsp; &nbsp;I also thought SHAREPOINT was just Microsoft forever creating confusion through mulitple brands that seem to do the same thing .... &nbsp;but not.... &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I assumed SHAREPOINT was the "back bone" of ONE DRIVE FOR BUSINESS &nbsp; and that anything done on ODFB would be backed up to sharepoint . &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think my assumption is now wrong &nbsp;as users DELETED FILES FORM THEIR ODFB folders and I as the ADMIN can't firng the &nbsp;darn files!</p>
<p>I need explanation &nbsp;I am just trying to keep this simple but keep data integrity for my organaization.</p>

<p>You are not too late to discover this. You are right SharePoint is the backbone, whatever you call it. Onedrive for business is just a document library on a user's personal site. Best practice is that Onedrive for Business is kept for personal files, some
 large organization disabled Onedrive for business for their users.</p>
<p>In SharePoint you can create team site for team collaboration. This is where administrator comes into picture in terms of access control and data integrity.</p>
<p>SharePoint is an open platform, you can use it whatever you can think of, but to do it right, follow the best practice.</p>

<p>SivaKumar is correct</p>
<p>Also, to answer your question or statement about the deleted files, you are correct. Only the end user that owns the OneDrive for Business has access to his "MySite". His "MySite" is where the OneDrive for Business is stored.</p>
<p>So, if the user deleted files in his OneDrive for Business, then you need to tell the End user to go and get them our of the trash as they are the only ones that have access to them.
</p>
<p>The End user will just go back to the Document Library where the files were located, click on the Gear on top right, go to "Site Contents". On the Site Contents page, they will see the link for "Recycle Bin" on the right hand side (kinda up to the top. Anyways
 the end user can check the box next to the files and click "Restore". It will then restore those files.</p>
<p>Now, if you are a Global Admin, you can grant yourself permissions to the end users ODFB site. All you need to do is Go to the SharePoint Admin Center, then User Profiles, find the end user, then use the dropdown to "Manage Site collection &nbsp;Admin". There,
 you can add yourself as an Admin on there site. </p>
<p>Now you can just browse by URL to the users Site and see everything just as they do.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
