<h2>            Teams&#58; Ownerships</h2>
                    <p>Hi team,</p>
<p>Excuse the pun, but I was trying to remove a member from one of my teams; the member is now an ex colleague but as there is 'no owner' to this team, I was unable to remove the member.</p>
<p>Who has permissions to delete members?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the staff member that originally created some of the teams I am in has since left; how do I remove such people or add new members?</p>
<p>Are permissions with the creator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

    <title>N8 Auto-Restarts &#47; Auto-Reboots &#47; Crash-Reboot Randomly During - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ezralimm---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 Auto-Restarts &#47; Auto-Reboots &#47; Crash-Reboot  Randomly During Active Use. More often with Maps.</h2>
                    
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Phone Details: N8-00@RM596 /
<strong>059D597 </strong>/ PR1.1 v13.16</em><br />
<br />
When I first received the phone and uploaded maps via OviSuite, Maps would cause the phone to reboot within 30 seconds of use. Within a day, I also had the phone crash and reboot twice when typing an SMS. So I performed a soft reset (*#7780#) after syncing
 my contacts to Ovi Suite. Perhaps the mass memory somehow got corrupted, so I formatted it via the file manager just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Re-downloaded maps (stored on mass mem previously) and tried Maps. This time it was more stable, and I got to a point where the GPS could lock and function properly. Maps still crashed and rebooted the phone occasionally, and I had the phone crash and reboot
 when browsing some photos.</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Soft Reset (*#7780#) + Mass Memory Format</strong><br />
Did Not Solve Auto-Reboot Problem</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence I did a hard reset (*#7370#) that also cleaned out the mass memory and whatever changes has been made to C:. I finally made a short 30min trip using Maps and it worked without auto-rebooting the phone. But the phone still wasn’t stable. It would hang
 up when using the camera especially and auto-reboot.</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Hard Reset (*#7370#)</strong><br />
Did Not Solve Auto-Reboot Problem</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone worked fine for a day, but then started crashing/rebooting again… seemingly at random. By this time, I have installed Opera Mobile and Whatsapp. I don’t think they could be causing the problem as I have friends with N8’s using these two well known
 programs without complications. Opera crashed and rebooted the phone twice – seemingly at random.<br />
<br />
Ok, so maybe C: somehow got corrupted… Taking it to the next level, I held down VolDown+Camera+Menu and then Power until the menu light illuminated. The phone was now completely factory restored with a fresh C: partition.</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Deep Factory Reset “Three Finger Salute”</strong><br />
Did Not Solve The Problem<br />
Wiped out Store and Maps (!!)</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p><br />
I thought I solved my phone’s problem, but after manually transferring some music to the phone’s SD memory card, the music player crashed on me. I only transferred mp3’s with legal industry standard IDv3 tags (even the coverflow album covers displayed flawlessly).
 I have had one crash while typing an SMS after the Three Finger Salute. So the problem has still not been solved.<br />
<br />
And now Maps (a critical app for me) and Store were gone. I tried reinstalling but it just would not. A bit of googling suggested Qt framework files were missing, and trying to find/install Qt Mobility for Symbian was a nightmare. There were problems getting
 developer Qt apps signed etc. Anyway, after a lot of effort I just gave up. Maps and Store would not install! And I still had a buggy phone that seemed to enjoy crashing/rebooting on me. Damn it. I’ve spent about 10 hours on this phone so far. What a nightmare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><em>I took it one step further and flashed it to PR1.2, using methods that are unapproved by the moderators of this forum - and thus this has been redacted from the forum post.
</em><em>Nothing fancy. Any highschool tech geek could probably do the same in half an hour with nothing more than the power of the internets.</em></font><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><em>--- <strong><font>Apologies to the 4-5 people who replied to the thread that was deleted by mods.</font></strong></em></p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p>***<strong>REDACTED</strong>***</p>
<p>Update to PR1.2 Did Not Solve The Problem<br />
But thankfully restored maps and store.</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PR1.2 v14.002 update did improve stability somewhat...initially. But the phone still cannot last two days without randomly restarting during active use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia is known for making reliable phones, and my previous two 6-series phones have been an absolute joy to use. Is this a Symbian^3 problem or is it a problem with my specific device?<br />
<br />
I see a number of possibilities:<br />
1) I have a genuinely defective device. Im thinking along the lines of faulty mass memory - camera use (default to mass mem) and maps (stored in mass mem) tend to cause auto-reboots.<br />
2) Symbian^3 OS issues. It is well known that Symbian^3 PR1.0-1.2 has a buggy network stack - that explains GPS issues causing the phone to restart every time.<br />
<br />
A quick check of my IMEI shows that my phone is still under warranty by nokia. Should I make the trip to the Nokia Care Center to have it checked out? I think i've done just about everything a consumer could do to rule out software problems.<br />
<br />
And of course: <strong>Has Anyone Had A Similar Problem?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Nokia careline was very friendly and helpful and arranged free insured Austpost delivery to the Elizabeth St center. Big kudos to nokia australia. Hope issue gets resolved soon. Will update on details.</p>

<p>now this is interesting... i got my nice shiny new paperweight *cough* N8 about a month ago, had it one day and it continously restarted... off to nokia repair.... two weeks later, i got it back... sort of worked, ish, for about a week, then the restarts
 happened again, this time instead of replacing the board, they replaced the whole phone...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>fantastic i thought (it was a buy from fbay), and proceeded with my shiny new phone to try and use it.....&nbsp;&nbsp; -_-&nbsp;&nbsp; that failed miserably too... now a brand new phone is nearly unusable because some incompetent idiot cant get it right... this can't be a hardware
 issue again surely? it will have been effectively 3 phones i've been through... am i really that unlucky???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as a side note, i just tried turning it on again (so new it's not even got the plastic covers off) and it turned on, i opened maps and did its first time thingy, and then restarted again... any ideas anyone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: i followed a very similar process to the original poster, but stopped short of the three finger salute</p>

            apologies for double post, but after a wander round the phone shops, they all seem to be running pr1.0 and i saw one running pr1.1, more to the point, all of them could not acess update services or get maps from ovi. maybe this is something to do with
 the firmware? my one is running pr1.2 and it refuses to run. what is everyone elses versions that work or don't work?

    <title>Filtered table shows unwanted rows in Excel 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kr.k.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Filtered table shows unwanted rows in Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a disturbing problem with&nbsp;how filters work in&nbsp;my data table. It seems that after I include a =SUBTOTAL function column in the table, the filters won't work&nbsp;properly anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a simple sheet&nbsp;with a table.&nbsp;I have a column named "Hobby".&nbsp;This column&nbsp;applies a dropdown list&nbsp;data validation (and gets data from column named "Hobby validation"). I also have a column named "Budget cumulated", where I use the =SUBTOTAL function.</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;filter the&nbsp;table by "Hobby"&nbsp;I get unwanted rows (i.e. unselected Hobbies)&nbsp;in the filtered table. After playing with the filter (selecting all, i.e. deleting the filter condition then filtering again etc...) the unwanted rows/data in the filtered view&nbsp;are
 getting more and more numerous. After playing with the filter for&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times, eventually I&nbsp;get hidden rows in the unfiltered view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any hints how&nbsp;to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pic 1: Initial table; selected cell shows how I used the =SUBTOTAL function (it's in Hungarian but it should not bother)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Pic 2: filtered view with unwanted rows - column is filtered by 'Computers'; rows with 'Music' shouldn't appear</p>

            <p>Hey GoNopro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem with the activation until I used the old phone activation method.&nbsp; Using a command prompt, type in "slui 4".&nbsp; Choose your country and click "Next".&nbsp; Call the 800 number and read off all those wonderful ID numbers to the rep and they'll give
 you the activation Id.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Worked for me!</p>

<p>The green Windows Store is gone, so you can only use the white icon. As for the other apps: you can either reinstall them from the new store or try the following:</p>
<p>1. Open command prompt as Admin and type&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>powershell</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Wait until the powershell is loaded, then copy and paste the following command:</p>

<p>This resolved the issue for me. </p>

</p><p>For those of you who, like me, are wary of just running PowerShell commands from the web willy-nilly:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This script uses the Get-AppxPackage cmdlet&nbsp;to get all the installed app packages in the system (for all users). It then pipes the installation directory of the apps (via the InstallLocation property) to a ForEach loop. The loop runs the Add-AppxPackage
 cmdlet for all the listed app packages, registering them from the local files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially it reinstalls all loaded Universal apps.</p>

            <p>Hello philisateronpi:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having downloading apps to your phone.&nbsp; I would like to confirm a few things so we know the best path to suggest you take for this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mention you cannot download any games.&nbsp; Do you receive the same error when trying to download applications?&nbsp; Some apps you may want to try installing are SkyDrive, Facebook and Skype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to the games you have attempted to download.&nbsp; Does this happen with free and paid games?&nbsp; Are you getting this issue when trying to download Xbox Live games only or all games on the marketplace?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do have an issue downloading any and all applications and games due to this being a child account, there are a couple things you can look into.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try updating the online safety and privacy settings for your account.&nbsp; This can be done by signing into
<a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> with the email address listed as Windows Live on your phone, tap settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; it should be listed here.&nbsp; Once signed in, click on MY ACCOUNT &gt; Privacy and online settings.&nbsp; Once you are on this
 page, make sure the account is listed as an adult here and review all settings for accessing the marketplace and for the phone specifically.&nbsp; To make these updates, you should be prompted to sign in with the parental account.&nbsp; When you do this, you may be
 asked to agree to the terms of use.&nbsp; If you are, please do so.</li><li>If you have access to a Xbox console, try the steps in this article to view the parental email currently associated with your account,
<p><font color="#000000"><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/forgot-microsoft-account#b675f88be17c44a9b60eff839c15f5ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/forgot-microsoft-account#b675f88be17c44a9b60eff839c15f5ad</a>.&nbsp;
</font></p>
</li><li>
<p>This account may be able to be promoted to an adult account via the Xbox.&nbsp; If this was created when under 18 and has since hit a date of birth of 18 that can be done by following the steps here,

            Have you ever logged in using the @hotmail.com address? If so, when was the last time? You must log in at least once per year in order to keep the account active. Failure to log in means the account gets closed and the mailbox contents permanently deleted.

<h2>            How to split the page vertically in MS Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I would like to view the far end column details in a table on the page in Landscape Orientation, while comparing the document with another one, which I do by viewing it side by side. So when the two documents are open, it would be good if there was something
 like freeze panes or split window.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You can only split a Word window horizontally, not vertically.</p>
<p>You can open a second window on a document by clicking New Window on the View tab of the ribbon. You can then arrange the two windows the way you want.</p>

 I don't even get the emails so I wouldn't even know what to block. &nbsp;I used to receive them; it has been a number of months now that I just don't get them. &nbsp;Now, if I want to sign up on a website, I have to use a totally different account. &nbsp;And here's the kicker,
 I've done just that, signed up on another email address, received the confirmation email, then gone back to my MSN account and added that email address to my safe senders and then tried again to sign up with my MSN email - it still doesn't work. &nbsp;Something
 on the Microsoft side is preventing these emails from getting through. &nbsp;I have reported this a number of times but support just keeps saying it's me and it goes no further. &nbsp;Anyone else

            <p>Interesting answer. &nbsp;And completely contradictory to the one I received when I chatted with a Microsoft agent a few weeks ago about the same issue. &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Support said they can't see anything that is being
 blocked on my account and that I needed to contact the sender of the email addresses. &nbsp;I was told to give the website owners a certain link that they could go to to fill out a form that would let them then not have their emails be considered spam. &nbsp;I actually
 did do this for a few of the sites that were being blocked and it helped for a few days and then they went back to being blocked again for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And yes, I can receive emails from myself. &nbsp;Funny how the there are so many conflicting 'fixes' from Microsoft yet no one really has the correct answer. &nbsp;Or bothers to look into it more. &nbsp;And just for
 the record, I'm not email illiterate; there is something wrong on the Microsoft side.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can find the link that I was supposed to give to the blocked senders if it would be helpful. &nbsp;I have the transcript of the conversation.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We agree with Microsoft chat agents, they do have a way to check if there's anything blocked on a specific account. If they are blocked and they sent you an email, it should go directly to your junk/spam folder. It would be best to submit a feedback to
<strong>Outlook.com</strong> by checking this <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I completely agree with Brian Tillman above - the emails are blocked at the Microsoft level. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have submitted feedback multiple times - never hear anything, nor has the issue been resolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Telling a company I am not getting their confirmation email isn't really helpful either - it's not their job to figure out my IT issues plus the confirmation emails come from a separate company. &nbsp;I'm not going to track down some business and ask them to
 fill out a form that they can then submit to Microsoft to prove they aren't spammers. &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp; And yet the same same email from "SAMANTHA" who can help me clear my student loans with a bogus email address that is about 150 characters long and different
 everyday without fail gets through at least once a day but a legit email can't. &nbsp;I guess I'll never get a decent answer or resolution. &nbsp;Every time I report this problem I get a different answer depending on the tech. &nbsp;Best I can do is come here and hopefully
 confirm that there are others having the same issues. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to block multiple phone numbers with a number range&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Call centers often reserve a whole range of numbers. For example +41 615 08 xx where xx goes from 00 to 99. How can I block the whole range?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Being more specific: I know how to enter single numbers into the blocklist manually, but how do I define a whole range? Is there some syntax like the following?</p>
<p>+41 615 08 **</p>
<p>+41 615 08 00 -&nbsp;+41 615 08 99</p>
<p>Which one works?</p>

    <title>Filtering subform in Tab Control - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Filtering subform in Tab Control</h2>
                    <p>I have a tab control [tabCtl17] with 4 pages (Name / Page Index):</p>
<p>- Details [0]</p>
<p>- Monthly Activity [1]</p>
<p>- Increased Activity [2]</p>
<p>- Yearly Activity [3]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each page has a subform.&nbsp; I want to be able to filter the subform based on the tab. For example, if I click the Yearly Activity tab, I want to&nbsp;filter the [Yearly Activity Subform] control [rptYear] by the current year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the onClick event of the [Yearly Activity] page using:</p>
<p>SetFilter</p>
<p>Where = [rptYear] = Year(Date())</p>
<p>ControlName = [Yearly Activity Subform]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn't do anything :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

            1.&nbsp; In the page of the tab control which contains the yearly subreport add an unbound text box, txtYear, above or below the subform as preferred.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; For the subform's RecordSource, instead of using the Year function to restrict the result set use a parameter which references the text box in the parent form:<br />
<br />
WHERE rptYear = Forms![YourParentFormName]!txtYear<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; In the parent form's Load event procedure set the value of the text box to the current year with:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.txtYear = Year(VBA.Date)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.[Monthly Activity Subform].Form.Requery<br />
<br />
Note that Monthly Activity Subform must be the name of the subform control, i.e. the control which houses the subform, not the name of the underlying form object, unless both have the same name.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Requery the subform in the AfterUpdate event procedure of the txtYear control with:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.[Monthly Activity Subform].Form.Requery<br />
<br />
When the parent form loads the subform will be restricted to the current year.&nbsp; When a user changes the value in the txtYear text box it will be requeried to the year entered in the text box.&nbsp; No further code is needed to filter the subform.<br />
<br />
You can do similarly on other pages of the tab control to allow the user to change the rows returned in a subform, e.g for a monthly subform you'd have text controls for the year (named something other than txtYear of course) and month, and these would be referenced
 in the subform's RecordSource:<br />
<br />
WHERE rptYear = Forms![YourParentFormName]!txtYear_2 <br />
AND rptMonth = Forms![YourParentFormName]!txtMonth<br />
<br />

<p>The primary phone field exists in the Outlook contact record.&nbsp; It is a field that is specific to that contact name.&nbsp; When you create new contact at the same company, Outlook creates a duplicate record and deletes the contact name, title, email and primary
 phone while retaining other contact info such as company address and website URL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have found is the primary phone field (as well as several other Outlook phone fields) does not exist in Windows Mobile.&nbsp; This seems a bit silly given that products are from Microsoft.</p>

            Yes indeed. Only the fields you have on your device will sync with Outlook. Other fields in Outlook won't sync to your device. Same if you create a customized field in Outlook on the computer.

                    I'm running a 64 bit computer, Windows 7, Microsoft Home and Student.&nbsp; I have a Brother MFC 7340 all in one printer.&nbsp; Printer is printing everything perfectly, except envelopes.&nbsp; It won't print an envelope.&nbsp; It takes the envelope, just won't print on it.&nbsp;
 Printer prints letters, labels, etc...everything but an envelope.&nbsp; Help!

<p><span>If the issue still persists then change the default printer on your computer to XPS Document Writer and then check if you are able to print

<p><span>To know how to change the default printer on Windows 7, refer to the link below:</span></p>

<p><span>If the issue is fixed using the default printer as XPS Document Writer then try to install the latest printer driver for the problem printer.
 To install the latest printer driver, you may contact the printer manufacturer for help.</span></p>

<p>Hi Laura,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failure to sign in to a purchased app using a different device can be caused by either an account sync error or app settings related issues. To effectively assist you with your concern, we'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the other device that you're using to sign in to the application?</li><li>Are you able to use the app on another device prior to your concern?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages when signing in?</li><li>Are you able to sign in to the app using your <strong><em>Windows</em></strong> device? If yes, which
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> build version is running on your device?<br />
<em><strong>Note:</strong> Type <strong>winver</strong> in the search box and press
<strong>Enter</strong> to help you identify.</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please ensure that you're using the associated <strong><em>Microsoft</em></strong> account where you made the purchase when you sign in to the app using another device. If you're using another
<em><strong>Windows 10</strong></em> PC when signing in, you can check the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028195/microsoft-account-sign-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to sign in your

            Hi akyahmed<br />
<br />
Not familiar with N73 but other "N" series using PC Suite. When you connect USB connectivity cable, it will want confirmation of mode on phone so try pressing top left key above the green call one to "select" and see if establishes connection.<br />
<br />
I am assuming that PC Suite mode will be top of the available mode options, but in this I might be corrected.

            <p>Hello thomasstranger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I read through your description and I am not sure if this issue is related to Windowsphone or Groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that the error codes you receive are relating to Windows 10 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to contact the Windows support for this issue first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have provided the link for you below.</p>

    <title>Default Outlook reminder overridden when receiving meeting requests - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave hock &#40;dhock&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Outlook reminder overridden when receiving meeting requests from certain people</h2>
                    I have my default reminder set to 9 hours, so that I can easily see all the meetings I have that day when I start work. There are at least two people, however, from whom I receive meeting requests that override my preference and only give me the standard
 15-minute notice. Has this happened to anyone else? I find this very frustrating, especially when the reminder pops up behind my active window, which causes me to have very little notice or even be late for the meeting.

Hi Dave,<br />
<br />
By design the incoming appointments will override the default reminder time set via Options. As a workaround, you may have to manually change the reminder per event.<br />
<br />
Although, when appointments (meeting requests) are received in Outlook, the reminder is by default set to 15 minutes, and there is no option to change this default. However, it is possible to change the default using a simple Outlook macro.<br />
<br />

If you want you can submit your feedback. Let me know you need feedback link.<br />

Hope this may help you.<br />
