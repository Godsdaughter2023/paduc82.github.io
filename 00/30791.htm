<h2>            Surface Dock Video Issues</h2>
                    <p>I'm posting this just in case it saves someone else three hours of anguished troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I split my time between a home in the US and the UK. In the US have a Surface Dock for my Surface Book, with two identical Dell P2414H monitors. This has worked perfectly for a year or so. I was away for a month, during which time we had a power cut, and
 when I came back, only one monitor would work. It could be <em><strong>either </strong>
</em>monitor, plugged in to <em><strong>either </strong></em>DisplayPort port - but not two at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what happened, sometimes the Book and Dock sort of forget about each other after many weeks, but that usually resets OK after I remove power from the Dock for 30 seconds, and on this occasion the power outage may not have helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>resetting the Dock</li><li>removing power from the Dock adapter itself</li><li>restarting the Book, many times </li><li>removing power from both monitors&nbsp;</li><li>getting one monitor working and plugging the other one in&nbsp;</li><li>clearing the Book display cache with the Microsoft tool:&nbsp;http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/5/5/8554763F-DBF9-41B3-9F12-605FA0A99183/surface%20dock%20registry.zip - I'd never heard of that one before</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing worked. In the end the thing that cleared it and got it all working again, was clearing the display cache again,
<em><strong>while the Surface Book was still attached to the Dock.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone one day...</p>

<h2>            Just where IS this great BF community I keep hearing about&#63;..no mikes&#43;no teamwork&#61; COD on way too big maps</h2>
                    
<p>seriously, BF is supposed to be the SERIOUS gamers FPS..or at least that's what I hear anytime someone wants to compare the most pop shooters out there.&nbsp; Hey man COD is fun but if ya wanna REAL combat shooter play BF..no little kids..real combat tactics,
 etc, etc.&nbsp; Thankfully, the no little kids part is true..but every game I've jumped into has 1 maybe 2 guys w/ mikes&nbsp;at the most (even on team chat).&nbsp; Granted I try to play w/ friends as much as possible and when I do it's a fun game..but those nights when
 they aren't on playing BF w/ no communication makes for a FRUSTRATING evening.&nbsp; BF IS a better game than COD..but you can't play it lone wolf..like you can w/ COD.&nbsp; The game is good..it's the community that'll sink this game.&nbsp; I dunno maybe they're all in
 private parties w/ their buds..still sux.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">In addition to the Party Chat thing (above), a very important part of playing with Communication is a little more subtle (at first).
<br />
<br />
You don't necessarily need a Mic or to actually speak with Team Mates via a Mic. BF Games have a neat little Feature known as the Back Button. It yells out Enemy Locations (Spots with the orange triangle) and other important needs (Attack there, Defend here,
 I need Ammo, I need Health, I can fix that fo you and so on).<br />
<br />
Using the Back Button even with randoms and no Mic, I have had very successful Games just by using it and working with your Squad/ Team.</span>

<h2>            Windows 10 Class action</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyone out there that knows how to initiate a class action suit against MICROSOFT for defrauding the public into upgrading to Windows 10, when it turns out that 7 is much better. My open letter &nbsp;complaint follows. PS...If it ain't broke don't fix
 it!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For months Microsoft has been inundating me with notices to upgrade my computer to Windows 10. I ignored these messages until one day a notice came informing me that I was scheduled for an upgrade. I called the Tech support
 at Microsoft and told them I wasn’t interested in an upgrade and would like the notices to cease.&nbsp; The Tech canceled the scheduled upgrade, and removed the notices. He told me that if I changed my mind, I would be able to upgrade later on, and if I wasn’t
 satisfied with the upgrade I would have 30 days to revert back to Windows 7. On May 4, I decided to upgrade, since I was told I had 30 days as a tryout. By upgrading I lost some files and programs that I had in Windows 7. When I attempted to find and download
 some of those same programs I found that they weren’t available. I then attempted to transfer files from another computer with the
<strong>Easy Transfer File</strong> only to find that <strong>Easy Transfer </strong>
is no longer available on Windows 10. When I decided I wanted to revert back to Windows 7 I called Microsoft Tech support and was told that I could do that through my computer. After numerous attempts I called Microsoft again, and told them that I can’t get
 Window 7 back. The Technician tried, through remote access, to help me revert back to 7, but his attempts were unsuccessful. He suggested that since the unit was made by Hewlett-Packard that they should be able to help, since they own the rights for that version
 of Windows. Hewlett-Packard was even less helpful that Microsoft. When I explained my problem to HP customer service they wanted me to pay $100 to have a Tech diagnose my problem. I attempted to explain to her that my problem was that I wanted to revert back
 to Windows 7, and Microsoft said HP would be the one to do that. She refused to put me through to a Tech and insisted that $100 fee was required. I don’t know if that fee included the installation of 7, or if that’s just a diagnostic fee. I wasn’t about to
 pay a fee for them to tell me they can’t help. I was told that by Microsoft. When I contacted Microsoft again and told them that HP wouldn’t help, this new MS representative told me that he didn’t understand why I was told &nbsp;I could revert back to 7 because
 that doesn’t exist anymore. Microsoft promoted a product with the assertion that if you didn’t like it you can get back the old program. They forgot to mention that the old program isn’t available. Microsoft used deception, misrepresentation, and made fraudulent
 promises in order to promote a new product. My complaint is against both Microsoft for deception, and questionable business practices, and HP for not willing to help right a wrong caused by their supplier; unless you pay them to look into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Instead of providing a real customer service and help solve problems that they have created, they tell you to ask the community for answers. If Microsoft created a problem and avoid helping solve that problem by asking you to ask
 the community, how is that going to help? All that accomplishes is that it connects a group of people that can commiserate together and have no real answers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            There are more than one <em>billion</em> Windows installations worldwide.&nbsp; If only 1/10 of 1 percent of those users tried to get help from Microsoft on the same day, it would amount to
<em>one million</em> callers.&nbsp; What would you suggest as a solution for handling that kind of traffic?&nbsp; There are very many people who have received solutions to their problems here.&nbsp; Most of them are ones who, rather than just ranting and complaining, clearly
 explained their issues in the proper forum and category.&nbsp; Unlike you. <br />

    <title>Windows 10 log in on new computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laurin79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 log in on new computer</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new Lenovo desktop that already has Windows 10 installed. &nbsp;I went through the set up process, but skipped the create a microsoft account portion. &nbsp;When I try to log into Windows it says that the password is incorrect. &nbsp;I tried restarting
 the computer and used the same password and it allowed me to log in. &nbsp;I tried to then create microsoft account in case this happens again and it asks your for your current password. &nbsp;When I put in my password that I just used to log in it says that the password
 is incorrect. &nbsp;I know the password is correct because I just used it to log on to Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am scared to turn off or restart my computer now because I have no idea if I will be able to log back in or not. &nbsp;I can't reload Windows because I don't have the program since it came automatically with my computer. &nbsp;I can't restore it to a previous point
 because I have only had it for 5 days and I am still in the process of setting it up so no restore point was made. &nbsp;This is really frustrating when it is a new computer. &nbsp;Has anyone else had this problem? &nbsp;Please help!!</p>

<h3> mav912  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change visual effects on new Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have tried everything I could imagine. Been through the options but nothing is helping. Every program I open and every webpage is all white. The lines separating everything are barely there to not at all. There's no shadows or colors defining the barriers
 and makes everything look mushed. In the picture, there are no lines separating the text box from anything else. This does not sit well with my OCD and I can't work with it like this. Please any help would be great!
<br />
P.S. I've tried all the display settings I could find. Am I missing something??!?</p>

            You (or anyone reading this) might try the Windows "Snipping Tool". Just press the Windows Buttton and type in "Snipping Tool" and you'll see that Windows has an own program which helps you to create Fullscreen, automated or manual window sized printscreens,
 so you can copy, edit (e.g. with a red circle or arrow) and save the image as GIF, PNG or JPG. I love this little feature, it's simple and works perfectly.

<h2>            Unable to turn .NET framework with error&#58; 800F081F on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Trying to enable .Net 3.5 in add/remove features and receiving error 800F081F.&nbsp; Computer was a preinstalled Dell image - OptiPlex 7020.&nbsp; We were having problems with an application and the vendor suggested removing .Net and reinstalling it via add/remove
 features.&nbsp; Removal was successful, but reinstall failed.&nbsp; We do not have&nbsp;recovery disk at this time, but have ordered it from Dell.&nbsp; We have already tried the /scanhealth and /restorehealth options with no success.&nbsp; The error states there is an internet connection
 issue, yet I am connected to the machine remotely so the internet is fine.&nbsp; Is there an offline .Net 3.5 installer for Win 10 that I can download and install?</p>

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<h2>            power setting grayed out where one can toggle it on and off. It is set on &#34;on&#34; but is grayed out.</h2>
                    <p>i was online and all of a sudden the screen went black. I was not down to the end of the battery. when i hit the keyboard, the screen lit up but I noticed the battery icon was missing in the taskbar. I was able to get that back by going into the taskmanager,
 clicking on Explorer and then restart. The battery icon reappeared in the taskbar but the power setting is as I have described above in the subject line. It says on but it grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it had been like that for some time or is related to what I have described above. I have not gone to the device manager yet to disable and restart the two options under battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to see if anyone here thinks these are related and other ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean my battery is going bad by any chance. It is almost two years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh btw, the low battery circle that is supposed to show over the battery icon stopped coming on months ago. I took the computer off battery saver but i never use the laptop til it is completely out of juice on the battery. but i used to have a functioning
 low battery indicator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's a few questions. Thanks for your help.</p>

    <title>Why does the sound on my HP Envy 23 suddenly turn off but it is not on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisareed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does the sound on my HP Envy 23 suddenly turn off but it is not on the mute setting&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased a touch smart Envy 23 from Costco less than two months ago and I have been having troubles with the sound since I got it. I have been troubleshooting the problem every time it happens and it says no error is found. Its getting really annoying.
 Perhaps I just need to contact tech support? It really would be an inconvenience to have to make a return. Curious if anyone has had the same problem and if you solved it.

            You might have performed a custom install.
<br />
<br />If these are Microsoft Store apps, do the following:
<br />
<br />Launch Microsoft Store on the Taskbar
<br />
<br />Click the ellipsis in the top right corner of the screen (...)
<br />	Click My Library
<br />	Scroll through the list then click the app if its listed there, then click the download button.
<br />
<br />Repeat the same steps for other apps.
<br />
<br />	If doesn't help, let us know and we can explore more options.

    <title>Adjust Lifecam Cinema webcam while using it from other software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jongbor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adjust Lifecam Cinema webcam while using it from other software</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I installed Lifecam Cinema on my Windows XP computer. It works fine and I can adjust the brightness using the configuration panel on the accompanying software (Microsoft LifeCam).</p>
<p>However, what I actually need is to adjust brightness while the camera is being used by my own program. After my program opens the camera, I can open Microsoft LifeCam but it doesn't detect the camera (since it's being used by my program) so it won't allow
 me to open the config panel.</p>
<p>So, what can I do in order to adjust the brightness in this case? Any alternative software/methods that will allow me to configure the camera?</p>
<p>By the way, it doesn't matter that I set the brightness to a desired value in Microsoft LifeCam, when I open it from my program, the brightness settings will be different altogether.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>try this. open your program with the camera. then look at the lower right corner of the task bar.</p>
<p>you are supposed to see an icon which when double clicked should open the camera's preferences.</p>

                    <p>I logged in to my children's account to redeem a $50 Xbox/Windows Gift Card each, but the credit was added to my account (Parent) Account. I have gone through all the help suggestions including, but not limited to... Reaching out to XBox Live, but because
 the gift cards were already redeemed, sent back to Microsoft. Digital Gift Giving does not allow me to purchase digital gift card using gift credits.&nbsp; I tried to call but need to go through all the steps I already went through before I get to a live person,
 and pressing 0 started the menu over again.</p>
<p>I now have a $100 credit in my parent account which I will never need, and 0 credits in children's account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. There is no category for Microsoft Account Help or Gift Card Help when trying to submit this question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hiya Deb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before placing any items on an account, always make sure the correct profile is signed in. Unfortunately, using currency is not something that can be used to buy Gifts. (Not everything can be gifted)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although, I recommend to set your profile as the "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Home Console</a>". This will allow the profile to share the games you purchase with other profiles on the
 same console. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>This may not help for you for now but for the future (and for anyone else searching this problem)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your kids get an Xbox gift card and you want to put the money on their child (family) account, DO NOT follow the directions on the back of the card. That will end up putting the money on your "parent" account and you can not transfer it to your child's
 account later. Here's what you have to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Go to your Xbox and log into your child's account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Navigate to the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Select the option to Redeem a Code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Scratch off the code on the card and enter it VIA THE XBOX LOGGED INTO YOUR CHILD'S ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Boom! Easy and your child can probably do it faster and easier than you. Well, mine can anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also got like $200 in my parent account which I guess will get used for Xbox Gold for the foreseeable future and had to buy more Xbox cash to "fund" my child's account - until I figured this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps a lot of people cuz it's a real bummer that we can't just move the Xbox cash from our parent to child accounts. I mean, it's still like the same "family" account. Right? Well, anyway, Happy Holidays everyone!</p>

            You had to sign in to your child's account instead of signing with your account and redeem. To be sure you can always redeem it via website as it will let you sign in only with single account at the moment.&nbsp;

<p>I understand your frustration, as a friend of mine had a similar problem, when I gifted a couple two Game Pass codes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The husband redeemed a code on his account via his smartphone, then signed out of his account, and signed in with his wife's account. But maybe there were leftover session cookies or whatever, even though I saw him sign in with his wives account, the second
 Game Pass was still added to his own account instead of his wives account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for the future, I'd recommend to open up a new PRIVATE or INCOGNITO window (depending how your browser names the private browsing feature, where it doesn't store any web traces), and signing into your children's accounts, or doing it on the console and
 making sure that the kid's account is shown in the upper left corner, when you press the Guide button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on the code redemption screen, take extra care to note the email that is shown before you confirm redeeming the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to get you a workaround for your problem:<br />
While you do have the money on your account, you can still buy certain games as gifts for your kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if a child wants a certain game, you can go to that game on your parent account, and then choose the option to buy this game as a gift for your kids with the money that is on your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be aware however, that some consumables for free to play titles (like V-Bucks in Fortnite, or Platinum in Warframe or similar in-game currencies) might not be able to be gifted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After buying the game as a gift, the child will then get a Xbox Live message with a redemption code that they can then redeem to get the game you gifted.&nbsp;</p>

            If the gift card was going to be used for games, you could "gift" whatever game to your child's account.

            Hi Shimul,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with error "</span></span>you need direct3d with feature level 9_3" when opening Facebook app<span><span>.
 I will certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>I like to inform you that Windows 10 support DirectX12. However, for DirectX12 to work, even&nbsp;the hardware such as&nbsp;the Graphic card or Display Adapter must also support DirectX12 on your Computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In case the Graphic card supports DirectX9.3, then you may try updating the Display/Graphic drivers and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><div>1. Press (Windows key + X key) and click on “Device Manager”.</div>
<div>2. Expand “Display adaptor”.</div>
<div>
<p>3. Right click on the display adaptor driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Also in case updating driver doesn't work, then go to the manufacturer's website to download the latest version of the driver. Then, uninstall the current version and install the latest version. Make sure to restart the Computer when uninstallation is done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us know the results. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<h2>            My computer used to have Windows Ink, but now it&#39;s not there.</h2>
                    I recently bought a pen for my computer that I planned to use with Windows Ink. A few weeks ago, I could find the options for Windows Ink in my settings under devices, but now when I look, the option for it isn't there. I still have the short cut for it
 on the task bar, but there is no way for me to access the options. I have a Dell Inspiron 17 7000 series.
