<h2>            How was this done&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One&nbsp;things that irritates me about MS Word is trying to figure out what someone else has done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a client that has provided me with document format specs (a PDF, not a Word Template)&nbsp;in which the lvl 1 Header looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CHAPTER 1.0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the TOC appears this way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try as I might, I am unable to keep "CHAPTER" from showing up in the TOC while keeping it in the lvl 1 Header.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can manually remove the "CHAPTER" from the TOC, but that only lasts until the TOC is updated, then it is back.&nbsp; I need a better solution.&nbsp;
 Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            taskbar thumbnails arrangement error</h2>
                    <p>The thumbnails arrange well if there are less than 10 windows, and it will change to show a list instead of thumbnails if there are more than 13 windows. But when there are 10, 11 or 12 windows it will arrange improperly. I don't know if it is only for me

<p>
</p><p>I was able to&nbsp; download new drivers and install them like you said. and now its giving me the error code 0x800705b4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That particular error means that the driver is timing out during installation. Windows normally gives 5 minutes for a driver to install, which should be more than enough time. For some reason certain recent drivers are taking longer than expected to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can't get to Toshiba's support site to get a hold of the correct drivers right now. Did you try installing those drivers using Compatibility Mode?</p>
<p>

<p>Now you use <strong>OneNote for Windows 10</strong>.</p>
<p>In this version of OneNote Internet links (HTTP....) still work, but links to local files result in this misleading message. The reason behind is that the UWP framework used by this&nbsp;new OneNote doesn't allow local links outside the app's own storage path.

<h2>            SharePoint TeamSite vs Exchange Group</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>For a team I need to create a collaboration workspace and I'm not sure if should go for SharePoint TeamSite or an Exchange Group.</p>
<p>Is there a good comparison of the two?</p>
<p>I like the Exchange Group feature because off the shared mailbox (much better than the Site Mailbox feature&nbsp;of SharePoint) but I like the additional apps of SharePoint (e.g. MeetSweet).
</p>
<p>Are there any plans to extend Exchange Groups with Apps Support or to integrate a SharePoint TeamSite with Exchange Groups?
</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi PhilippeCRSL,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no such plans currently. Thanks for your understanding. In this case, we recommend you use Exchange group and SharePoint TeamSite at the same time in which way all your requirements can be met.</p>
<p>In addition, please feel free to post a new thread in our forum if you encounter further problems using the features above. We are always here to assist you.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Try to login through another Windows profile. If there is some corruption in profile which is causing this problem, this would correct.
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />5. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start Outlook. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />6. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:
<br />Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration' &gt; Click Ok and restart Excel.

<p>We have run into the same issue, We have tried uninstalling and re-installing office, upgrading to the latest version, using multiple profiles, and uninstalling the latest microsoft updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to have stemmed from the April 2018 microsoft patches which seemed to have made changes to several DLLs, including KERNELBASED and HMPALERT, which seem to crash our publisher, excel and winzip applications.</p>

<h2>            Autosaving for office in OneDrive doesn&#39;t work anymore</h2>
                    I had lots of word files within OneDrive folder but outside OneDrive/documents. Autosaving worked exellently until recent update. Now the only option to to turn autosaving on is to move all files to documents folder which would be a total mess. How to
 deal with it? Is it possible to roll back to previous version?

            Hi, 3zuckerbrins
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />Try resetting the OneDrive sync app on each computer and make sure that you are sign into the same account in each app. 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard. 
<br />
<br />Then copy and paste this text into the Run window that appears and press Enter:
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />That will reset OneDrive
<br />After a couple of minutes, the OneDrive cloud icon should show in the system tray.
<br />
<br />If it doesn’t start, open Start, find OneDrive and start it
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>

</p><p>Server related and account specific issues are the usual cause why log in errors are occurring. We know that your account is very important to you. For us to provide an accurate solution, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using an Outlook app or Outlook.com when you're trying to log in to your account?</li><li>If you are using an Outlook app, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">what build and version

<h2>            Deleted email messages showing in inbox&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm new to Outlook. I'm using Outlook 2010. Instead of deleted messages moving to the deleted folder they remain, with a line through, in my inbox. I probably did something to cause this because when&nbsp; I deleted messages previously they went to the
 deleted folder. I don't know what I did or how to fix. Haven't been able to find anything about this in help.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diane's response also goes for 2003 IMAP accounts.&nbsp; The best you can do is hide them until they are purged. Here's how to hide them&nbsp;in case you aren't sure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select <i>View &gt; Arrange By &gt; Current View &gt; Hide Messages Marked for Deletion</i>.</p>

<br />
No, outlook 2007's support for imap doesn't have this feature and you can't add it.

<h2>            N8 Music Player updating problems</h2>
                    
<p>I cant seem to find any answers concerning my issues so hopefully someone can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see the music on my phone and the music on my computer in Ovi Suite when my phone is connected to the computer. I cant update the album covers on my phone through OviSuite but can update covers for albums stored on my computer. The problem I have is
 that I want to sync the computer and phone albums, but there is no function for this. This means I need to copy all my albums from my phone to the computer. I can do that but the problem I have is there is no way I know of to check for duplicates etc. I know
 there are some, and with 2000 ish tracks fishing them out will be a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a good way to sync the music tracks between the N8 and the music on my mobile, allowing me to update album covers, and not end up with a load of duplicates.</p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you tried the app named CoverUp that is available in the Nokia Store on your device? i used that for updating all my album covers on my phone, and it does an excellent job.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Ive not tried that, didnt even know about it. I'm installing it now cheers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other issue I have is that I have music on my computer I want on my phone, and I want to back up the music from my phone onto the computer. I can simply copy all the music on my computer to the phone, and vice versa, but I'm worried I will end up with
 a ton of duplicates and end up having to manually search for them all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HDD space is at a premium for me. Is there any way to sync the music libraries of the computer and phone. There is no sync function via ovi suite and I know the stated reasons why from Nokia. Only thing I can think to do is copy all my phones music to the
 computers Music folder and hope it pops up with a message if it spots duplicates, then hope that would spot all duplicates. Any advice would be appreciated before I go ahead, Ive not done this before with my phone so dont know what behaviour to expect.</p>

<p>Well I knew this could potentially be problematic, but its worse than I imagined. For some reason all the files form my phone have copied onto the computer into folders for each individual track, labelled by artist, then inside that folder is another folder
 labelled according to the album it was from, then inside that is the track. Ive got 3000 folders to sort through now and I'm not happy. Ive got to reorganise all the tracks back into their original albums, then find all the duplicates and remove them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make things worse, all the music is filed differently in the music folder, in ove suite, and in WMP, so there is no easy way to sort through any of it. Total nightmare. Between this and the constant problems wiht the phone memory filling up, Nokias software
 department are really poor at their jobs. Ive only ever owned Nokia phones, and the N8 is a fantastic piece of hardware, but Ive had just about enough of this handset now and am seriously considering ending my 15 years with Nokia run. Replacing this handset
 will be expensive, and I just dont want to pay out all that money and end up with issues that plague this handset.</p>

<p>Well I am at my wits end. The memory full issue is back with a vengence. All my music and photos and videos are off my phone and I have over 20Gb of free space available but the phones memory is completely full and I cant remove anything off it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my music library is totally fubar, the software has no solutions, a full restore from a backup only resulted in more space being filled on the phones internal memory and now its completely full. I have nothing stored on my phone but its basically now
 unusable, so I am going to have to do a 3rd full hard wipe and reset within a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phones software is a total mess and Nokia support can only best be explained as completey zero, its like the company doesnt actually exist online. Now I dont know what I should do, this handset needs replacing due to all the bugs (in a 4 year old phone
 ffs) in the software, but I am really thinking Nokia should give up making phones at this point. This is a total joke!!!</p>

<p>Sounds like it's time for a "sping clean" if your browser cache's are empty, you don't have a lot of email&nbsp;and haven't installed any app's on "C".</p>
<p>Make sure you have a full battery and firm USB connection.</p>
<p>Back up any data you haven't all ready taken off.</p>
<p>Make a note of all the apps you want to put back.</p>
<p>Make a note of your access points.</p>
<p>Take the "Delete Data and Restore" option.</p>
<p>Re-install the Firmware using Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>Put back the Apps you want, make sure the Store/Instalation settings are to install on "E" (Mass) memory.</p>
<p>You can Google "Factory Fresh N8" there are more detailed instructions about.</p>
<p>Not sure how you sort out your music files.</p>
<p>BTW we are talking the N8 aren't we? It came out Late 2010 so only 2 and a half years old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also CoverUp is in the Store, I just looked.</p>

            I have had 12GB on my N8 on an external 32GB microSD card, and just copied it onto there using Windows Explorer, then Refreshed the music library. Then ran the CoverUp app using WiFi, and bingo, all album cover worked out for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the bad news. According to comment in December 28, 2012 here: <a href="http://teknologsapps.wordpress.com/coverup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://teknologsapps.wordpress.com/coverup/</a> the developer has stated that the app no longer works because of an API change with Amazon, so he pulled it from the Nokia Store. not sure if there will be any more updates as Symbian is now in maintenance mode
 as a platform, and app development for it is starting to die down.

<p>I did the spring cleanon the day of my previous post. Removed all music and pictures, and most of the apps. Put a few apps back on and thats it. Kept my email and message inbox empty on a daily basis, and havent put anything else on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the day, I had about 40mb of memory left on C drive, today I'm down to under 10mb again and getting the low memory issues again. Ive not even obother putting anythign on it and have over 20Gb of available space on it, but I still get the memory full problem.
 Its been barely a couple weeks and my phone is now crashing and giving me system error dialogue boxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is so frustrating. Im not even using the phone for music and pictures now in an attempt to just make it work, but it just doesnt. All I really use it for it browsing the web, but trying to keep the history clear doesnt even seem to be helping much.
 Drives me mad. Nokia suite says my memory is running low and click to fix it, I do and it says there is nothign available to delete. Nokia really messed up with this on this phone.</p>

<h3> hunerkurd  say:</h3>
<h2>            its time to add the kurdish language for the Nokia phones in Iraq</h2>
                    
<p>The products in kurdish language are growing up and Samsung began to add kurdish language to their phone and Samsung chocolate was full kurdish, and with kurdish keyboard (arabic alphabet).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are a kurdish gruop called Kurdmails Network, we translate (localization) any products as free and we have done some works like (Smartftp (dot) com) both website and program are in kurdish. Messenger Live, PowerISO, and we are working with NOD32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are asking to make kurdish language for nokia phones, in Kurdish (arabic alphabet)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After president and parliment elections was finished and the new constitution of Kurdistan region is officialy ready, they will not allow any phones to be imported into Kurdistan region without the Kurdish language is included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they banned the product wich doesn't include the kurdish language, there will be best for Samsung, because they will grow up there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more about Kurdistan region, please visit KRG official website (www.krg,org)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope we can get an answer to first make kurdish language for Nokia phones and in secound we can do the keyboard too with help of Unikurd codecs.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm using Chrome and Outlook Mail on a MAC and for some reason, this morning all my emails I try to send to different recipients go into Drafts and they are not sent. Nor can I re-send the emails when in Drafts. I can however, delete the emails then go to
 Deleted Items and permanently delete the unsent emails. I still receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When clicking each email in Drafts, the message is the same:</p>
<p>"Something went wrong and we haven't been able to send your message yet"</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to automatically set the Word 2007 display option "Print Background colors and images", using Windows AD Group Policy.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the correct Office Group Policy ADM template and loaded it successfully.&nbsp; The option to set this does not exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Word 2007 Options, under Display and Printing Options you have&nbsp;6 main setting available:</p>
<p>1: Print drawings created in Word</p>
<p>2: Print background colors and images</p>
<p>3: Print document properties</p>
<p>4: Print hidden text</p>
<p>5: Update fields before printing</p>
<p>6: Update linked dat before printing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Group Policy with the Office 2007 Template loaded</p>
<p>Under User Config - Admin templates - MS Office Word 2007 - Word Option - Display&nbsp;I get the following</p>
<p>1: Print Document Properties</p>
<p>2: Print Drawings Created in Word</p>
<p>3: Update fields before printing</p>
<p>4: Update linked data before printing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Print background colors and images" and "Print hidden text" are not there.</p>
<p>I need to set "Print background colors and images" automatically for all users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone come accross this problem before</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have been working with computer when I was seven or eight years old using a VIC 20.&nbsp; I don't see a problem with someone younger....they just need to be more descriptive than saying "it does not work."&nbsp; Most old guys don't want to ask twenty question
 or end up explaining every single detail like&nbsp; "your hands hurt because you are not using the right hand positions."&nbsp; The solution it was to take a typing class in High School.&nbsp; My daughter learn to type in middle school.

            In the USA, those under the age of 18 (as mentioned above, the "legal" age of adulthood) cannot legally enter into a contract. Therefore, since the program requires you to "sign" and agree to a legally binding contract, you must capable of doing so - hence
 the age requirement.

<p>Bottom Line Up Front - Get over it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As others have already tried nicely to explain to you - It has everything to do with age, and in most cases maturity.&nbsp; You have neither, and ranting on this site about it will not change the fact of you not being old enough to enter into a legal and binding
 contract with Microsoft.&nbsp; You cannot change the laws of the United States on this or any other forum, so you will just have to live with it, and when you are old enough, and wise enough to understand these ramifications, you too will be able to enter into
 legal and binding contracts.&nbsp; .</p>

<p>Please&nbsp;tell me&nbsp;this. I am kind of naïve, maybe. School kids in the USA under the age of 18 use computers, Microsoft Surface and mobile devices with operating systems. To use them one has to install, so hopes Microsoft, Windows operating systems. To install
 them, if I recall correctly, one has to agree to a license agreement. Are you saying that all these underage children are illegally using their computers because they were not old enough to sign the license? I think, the grown-ups who come up with this nonsense
 are more childish than the young people who have the desire to participate in something useful rather than linger in the streets and do drugs.

 them from the cost of replacing one of these not so cheap devices.&nbsp; Having said this,&nbsp;most, if not all persons under the age of 18 in the United States do not have an income allowing for the purchase of computers and such.&nbsp; The "End User License Agreement

 if not all persons purchasing the devices with the money they have earned from a pay check they pay taxes from is the ultimate responsible party for all software licenses being accepted for use on the computer.&nbsp; Microsoft cannot take a child to court, unless
 the child has been deemed by a court to be considered of legal independence and legally considered an adult in every aspect of the term. This means the person is considered to be able to take care of themselves by keeping a roof over their head, paying their
 bills, working for a living vice going to school to learn how to work somewhere besides a fast food restaurant when they are of legal age, and all that goes with being a legal adult.&nbsp; The fact that a child is able to access a computer since the age of 8 tells
 me that the child is from a home that has at least a modest enough income to afford things like computers for their children to use.&nbsp; The parents of these children are held responsible for the actions their children take on line as well as off line, and when
 the children violate laws, their parents end up having to go to court with/for them.&nbsp; This is again why a person must be able to enter into a "binding" legal contract with Microsoft for this or any other program sold or issued by same.&nbsp; This is true of any

<p>Hi there Sam-Wise,</p>
<p>my comment was not meant to offend but to support a young person who felt slighted and felt&nbsp;not treated with due respect as every person deserves to be treated no matter what his or her age or financial condition. The wording in his initial discussion indicated
 that he was not from this country.&nbsp;The tenor of your comments&nbsp;seems to indicate that Microsoft does not want to get help or suggestions from anyone who they cannot haul into court. I am sure that is not so. Do you honestly think that if a young person (under
 18) walks into&nbsp;Walmart or Best Buy and&nbsp;pays for a new computer&nbsp;with Windows pre-loaded, that a clerk will ask if he or she is 18 and inform&nbsp;prior to the purchase that the computer as sold and priced&nbsp;is useless unless he or she is 18? Just for you I read through
 the Windows 8 Microsoft Software License Agreement and there is no age restriction in it. If I am the&nbsp;first licensed user, I am permitted to transfer the software and the license to another user, provided the new user agrees to the terms of the agreement.
 Nothing is said in it about age. I don't believe Microsoft would want to enforce an age restriction&nbsp;on the sale of computers preloaded with a Windows OS. Apple, of course, might&nbsp;love that. &nbsp;And finally, don't be too harsh or disrespectful toward the&nbsp;more than&nbsp;three
 million people in the USA working in the fast food industry. Many if not most have a&nbsp;family and are part of our society.</p>

 them in an order (alphabetical) that is not useful to my users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this feature is available in MS Word for Windows, and, if that's the case:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Can I open my template on a Windows machine, change the list of Recommended styles there, and then bring the template back over to my Mac? If I do this in a template and save the template, will that list of Recommended styles be
 listed as desired when any user, regardless of platform, opens the template to start work on a document?</p>

<p>There is no editor for recommended styles on the Mac version. However, editing the list in Windows will also work when you open the template or document in Word for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MVP Rich Michaels has programmed a free Add-in that runs in Word for Mac. Search for "AuthorTec Manage Styles", then download and install it. This is the simplest solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also possible, though rather technical, to edit the document XML to display only the recommended styles. Here's my article on how to do this:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brandwares.com/bestpractices/2015/12/xml-hacking-managing-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XML

I am having difficulty inserting one MS Word document into another. &nbsp;I have written a number of separate MS Word documents, and I want to insert each into one large document. &nbsp;I clicked on Insert &gt; Text, and selected the file I wanted to insert. &nbsp;However, when
 I completed the process, the inserted file appeared in a different font. &nbsp;I want to be sure that the font remains the same as shown in the original document, and that none of the formatting is changed. &nbsp;Can you help with this?</p>

<p>From your description, you're most likely dealing with at least one Style conflict... A Style with the same name exists in both documents, but is defined
<em>differently</em> in each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're lucky you may be successful with the easy method;</p>
<ol>
<li>In the source file, <strong>Select All</strong>, then <strong>Copy</strong></li><li>Position the insertion point the destination document, then click the ▼ [right edge] of the
<strong>Paste</strong> button &amp; select <strong>Keep Source Formatting</strong></li><li>Repeat for each additional file.</li></ol>
<p>Depending on a number of variables, though, that may not work out. If not you'll have to track down the duplicated Styles &amp; take more extensive steps to resolve the conflict.</p>

<h2>            Search Index has broken for my Office 365 Pro Plus 2016 8201.2102</h2>
                    <p>My search function has all but broke in Outlook 2016. &nbsp;I've never had a problem with it in 20 years. &nbsp;However, recently, i cannot search for emails, calendar items, contacts. &nbsp;When I try, I receive the message "searching" forever sometimes, or "we couldn't
 find the person you're looking for." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deselecting ost from search index, checking properties of ost file, making sure the ost file can be searched by index, then re-selecting ost in search index. &nbsp;This works for a while, sometimes, but then brakes, usually on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is tremendous, this problem is unbelievable. &nbsp;This is a huge hurt to our teams ability to function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why you are getting this issue about the Search feature in Outlook. In some cases, this has something to do with using an outdated version of Office, or a corrupted file on the system file. To isolate the issue, we recommend that you
 check for any <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updates to your Office</a></strong> to make sure that it's updated.<br />
<br />
If you still encounter the same problem after updating your Office, we would advise that you

 feature to function properly.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>I have done both of those multiple times. &nbsp;This problem currently affects 3 computers, and all at the same time. &nbsp;I am under the impression the problem has come due to a recent update in the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebuilt indexes as well. &nbsp;Nothing is working.</p>

            Thank you for the update. Just to give you an idea that there are known issues occur after updating their Office product, which specifically affect Outlook. The issue with searching in Outlook has been fixed and the solution is provided thru an update.
 You may refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-known-issues-in-the-June-2017-security-updates-3f6dbffd-8505-492d-b19f-b3b89369ed9b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> as a reference to know the update
 you need to install in your computer to apply the fix.<br />
<br />

<p>This would have been great if it worked. &nbsp;I have the current update. &nbsp;MS Office 365 Business Build 8229.2073. &nbsp;The problem is that every time I shut down MS Outlook Desktop, the ost file unchecks itself for the property "allow this file to have contents
 indexed in addition to file properties" &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only workaround is:</p>
<p>&gt;to go to indexing options, </p>
<p>&gt;uncheck the ost file,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;close outlook desktp</p>
<p>&gt;right click ost file</p>
<p>&gt;click properties</p>
<p>&gt;click advanced</p>
<p>&gt;recheck&nbsp;"allow this file to have contents indexed in addition to file properties"</p>
<p>&gt;reopen ms outlook</p>
<p>&gt;indexing options</p>
<p>&gt;reselect the ost file</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this sometimes a few times a day to get my search working. &nbsp;Basically, everytime I close outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise further, or come out with a better fix!</p>

                    I should begin by clarifying - this occurs beginning within the last week - Word 2013 ONLY.&nbsp; Checked Excel, Outlook, yada, yada.&nbsp; The working display (even without a document open) has stretched itself approx. six to twelve points wider than the screen.&nbsp;
 This problem is exclusive to Word (also checked ALL my other programs).&nbsp; What am I not seeing here? (pun intended)?<br />

            I assume this is a Normal window rather than a Maximized one. Drag the title bar until you can see one side of the window on the screen and then drag that side until the window fits on the screen. Quit Word. When you restart, the window should be the size
 you left it.

<p>
</p><p>Yeah I know what you mean about some URL's.</p>
<p>That one is the link to a SkiDrive / OneDrive (or whatever microsoft is calling it now) folder (part of Hotmail).&nbsp; I have set it the give small URL's as it make my emails less full.<br />
<br />
Here is the long version of that URL.<br />

<p>

PS.&nbsp; I ony did this has I looked around google and there are many people explaining how to do this, but no (simple to understand) examples, so I though I would put one up.&nbsp; A freind of mind asked about this over on the Access Forum which is why I made this
 small very basic sample.</p>

<h2>            I have an issue with opening a link on the computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Trouble opening link</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to open a document from a link that was sent in an email but I keep getting message box that states "Resource INPUTBASE not found". What does that mean and what can I do to get this document - I just get a black page.</p>
                </div>

            <p>The email service is gmail.</p>
<p>Doc came from Accesa Labs, not a personal contact.</p>
<p>I don't know what file type the doc is - I have to open a link first to access the doc. Link ends with ccb70.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
