<h2>            Design Lab Controller broke and none of the links work</h2>
                    <p>Ive been trying to get support for my broken controller for the last hour and a half but the posses to do so it pretty bad and the stupid bots you use are about as helpful as a pile of dirt so I guess here will work, I just recently made a design labs controller
 and just after 4 months the RB button is completely broken and I cant find out if I have a warranty or can even replace it because none of the register device links work. The one I did find said it was out of warranty which I think is crap because when I bought
 my xbox 1 back in December of 2014 the controller I got with that worked flawlessly until December 2018 so I decided to make one and with all the options I did it ended up being 100 dollars and its annoying me how the&nbsp;RB button broke after just 4 months and
 a 60 dollar standard controller lasted 4 years and I cant get a replacement easily for something that I spent $100 on so if someone could help me id appreciate it

            I believe Design Lab controllers are sold through the Microsoft Store itself. You can contact them
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/28808/microsoft-store-contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
via options on this page</a> to see if you can get support from the store directly.

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps for both games finally appeared, and I installed them and the game WORDAMENT, also. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest problem with these games is that once installed, when I shutdown my computer the games won't open and load. &nbsp;They start to open and then disappear from the screen. &nbsp;I then have to uninstall &amp; reinstall each game every day. &nbsp;This started happening
 after my upgrade from Win 8 to Win 8.1. &nbsp;Taptiles was another game that had the same problem but for some mysterious reason Taptiles now works fine. &nbsp;I made no changes and Taptiles loaded after a reinstall about 3 months ago and has remained working without
 having to unistall &amp; reinstall it each day. &nbsp;Now I ask why did that occur with Taptiles and not with Microsoft Solitaire Collection, Mahjong, and Wordament. &nbsp;All the other Xbox games work just fine, and I've never had a problem with any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been to the Xbox forums and plenty of people had the exact same issue. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it never was resolved. &nbsp;Xbox concluded it was a Microsoft problem. &nbsp;Oh, so helpful! &nbsp;I've been ever so patient dealing with this uninstall &amp; reinstall process daily
 for the last couple of years at least. &nbsp;It's a sheer nuisance and can't understand why Microsoft can't seem to offer a solution to those of us who encounter these problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm tech savvy to a certain point and also know not to attempt screwing around with things that I am not knowledgeable about. &nbsp;I'd so love a solution to this problem. &nbsp;I think I've been patient long enough. &nbsp;My apps are all up to date and there is no syncing
 problem. &nbsp;My security program has them set to "ALLOW", so that shouldn't be an issue. &nbsp;I did try the trouble shooter for apps quite some time ago &amp; nothing was found. &nbsp;So, here I am still uninstalling &amp; reinstalling these apps daily. &nbsp;So, you can appreciate
 the frustration when going to the Store and not even being able to find them, too. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so finally Microsoft must've fixed the Store because after a bit, the apps were back in the listings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your response and sorry for the delay in replying. &nbsp;I really enjoy those games and would love for them to work properly. &nbsp;Thank you for your support.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi again, John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the app troubleshooter again, and now it came up with a problem. &nbsp;It stated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem found: &nbsp;Service registration ia missing or corrupt &nbsp; NOT FIXED &amp; it has a red circle with an X next to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then goes on to state under the detection information: &nbsp;The requested service has already been started. &nbsp;More help is available by typing &nbsp;NET HELPPMSG2182</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so now what? &nbsp;Where do I type the NET thingy? &nbsp;Good grief, the information is so limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to think someone working for Microsoft has the ability to help those of us who are dealing with the problems with their creations. &nbsp;Wishful thinking on my part, I believe.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read the article and performed the search.&nbsp; It came back saying:&nbsp; Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; Details are included in the
</p>
<p>CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log</p>
<p>For example&nbsp; C:\Windows|Logs\CBS\CBS.log&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it goes on to say:&nbsp; Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, I went to the Details of System&nbsp;File Checker, right-clicked on command prompt, run as administrator and typed in:&nbsp; findstr/c:"[SR]" %windir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log&gt;"%userprofile%\Desktop\sfc details.txt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing happened after entering this.&nbsp; Needless to say, I'm lost with this.&nbsp; It's beyond my scope of computer knowledge.&nbsp; Think I'll just have to continue dealing with the ongoing problem of uninstall &amp; reinstall those 2 apps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your feedback and taking the time to help me resolve this.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>DirectX not working after Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kitlaw23  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectX not working after Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My DirectX is not working after my Windows 10 automatically updated without my consent. (My display card is GTX 960)<br />
I have no way to repair it without reinstalling the whole operating system.</p>
<p>Now some of the games cannot be launched, and basically all error messages are related to the DX C++ library.</p>
<p>e.g. for different games,</p>
<p>1) DXFAIL : The specified device interface or feature level is not supported on this system.<br />
2) Failed to initialize draw system : main.cpp (312)</p>
<p>3) Failed to initialize Direct3D11:0x00000009</p>
<p>
</p><p>and some of them are error-free as caught by try-catch I guess: they show a transparent layer in full-screen mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I repair it without reinstalling the OS and thousands of software?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Aileen,</span></p>
<p>The problem actually preceded starting from early May, and I have reinstalled Windows 10 today since it has been too long that I cannot find any answer from any pipeline. I cannot say the problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
However, I still want to jot down what I have tried for your reference.<br />
<br />
I tried the following chronologically (and some repeated); and for sure none of them work:<br />
1) DX repair tool provided by Microsoft<br />
<br />
2) DX repair tool provided by 3rd party<br />
<br />
3) reinstall DX with older installers (both 9 and 11, and with lots of *.cab files from 2005)<br />
* note that the games also included these installers with them and I noticed that I still need to install them on Win10 for executing these games<br />
<br />
4) install the newest NVIDIA driver (released in June)<br />
<br />
5) remove the NVIDIA driver<br />
* then, the games can run but with extremely bad FPS, maybe 2 FPS I'm not sure.</p>
<p>* note that CPU is AMD APU 7850K</p>
<p><br />
6) install older NVIDIA driver (released before May)<br />
<br />
7) Remove VS C++ Redistributable 2017 (comes with VS2017) and replace with older version of 2015<br />
<br />
8) reinstall VS C++ Redistributable 2013<br />
<br />
9) disable XBOX drv (and found that it was not enabled initially)<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
Additional info:<br />
CUDA is installed<br />
Unity is installed, seems it uses GL and works fine<br />
The same machine can run all programs, and starting from a point of time, all DX related (required) games do not work.<br />
<br />
Now the same GPU card is running the games with the newest driver (June), so NVIDIA is innocent.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Hacked Help - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Hacked Help</h2>
                    Operating System : Win 7 Home Premium x64<br />
Dell XPS<br />
<br />
My parents got hacked today, and im rather lost on how to solve their issue. They received a call this morning from someone who 'works for microsoft' and that their computer has a virus, and well we all know how that scam goes, and for $250 they will fix it.<br />
<br />
Luckily my parents are smart enough to not pay someone, and I've told them in the past that no one from Microsoft will ever call you without you calling them first, but they unfortunately still got hit.<br />
<br />
The problem that it is doing now is that the system requires a password for windows to load (they previously did not have a password on the computer). This occurs after the windows loading screen, but before you would have the desktop load. This happens on
 normal boot and the various safe mode boots. I've taken their hard drive (as I have the ability to external scan it), and scrubbed it for any malware/spyware/virus's, but everything came up clean. It appears to be a simple system virus change that inserts
 a factitious login requirement to hamper access to the computer. There were only 2 files I could find that had anything changes (they had not used the computer this morning before receive the call, so by the Date Modified im able to see to an extent what has
 happened). <br />
<br />
Files modified :<br />
% \ Windows -&gt; ntbtlog , bootstat.dat, WindowsUpdate, epplauncher.mif, setupact<br />
% \ Program Files(x86) -&gt; Microsoft Security Center.<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be greatly appricated. Unfortunally I was at school when this happened to my parents and was unable to be there to do anything.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As you say,it is a scam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One important fact you are missing: As there is now a Password on their Computer, did your parents give themRemote Access, which it sounds like they did?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the best way out of the problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your parents are&nbsp;who knows if&nbsp;they have&nbsp;given them Remote Access.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And the only way that you willl know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, they ended up giving them remote access thru a program called Ammy (or something to that effect). I have told them to watch the bank accounts and all that jazz.<br />
<br />
So effectively the computer requires a wipe. I have one question about that. Does it require a clean wipe, or a recovery wipe. They have the Recovery disks, however, to be honest im not 100% sure how the recovery disks work in relation to a typical drive wipe.
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help on this by the way, it is most helpful.<br />

            <p>Recovery disks will wipe&nbsp;the Hard Drive clean and put the Computer back to Factory Settings (new condition).</p>
<p>It is basically a clean install, except you do it the Manufacturer's way and end up with all their junk software again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Data and 3rd Party programs that your parents installed will be lost.</p>
<p>So SAVE all Data before doing a Recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if going into SAFE MODE allows tham in without a Password to save the Data, photos, documents, etc.</p>

    <title>Hiding cursor in DVR recording - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wophie chang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hiding cursor in DVR recording</h2>
                    <p>I used to record drawings in Photoshop fine, but this new update came along and broke everything, so I need help:</p>
<p>Apart from crashing my drivers every 5 minutes (which fixed itself), it also told me there was nothing to record and/or my 980/skylake system somehow didn't meet the pc requirements (which also fixed itself after some temporary file deleting)<br />
</p>
<p>But the real problem here is, I used to record fine and it wouldn't record the brush or the cursor.</p>
<p>Now I can't hide the cursor because it records literally everything on screen.</p>
<p>Help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to update Digital Video Recording to its latest version from manufacturer website and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;this issue occurred after a new update, you may go with system restore to check if that helps.</p>
<p>

            Agree with you on that, not sure on the translation... when I typed it in Google the county of origin wasn't what had me chuckling :D . &nbsp;Re-Posted to the older thread on VLC's forum. &nbsp;Although if it's been wrong this long, I don't expect they'll fix the
 issue anytime soon.
<div><br />
<div>Since it is a media player, kind of makes me scared to know what type of content comes along with the install...</div>

<h2>            STOP&#58; c000021a &#123;Fatal System Error&#125; - winlogon.exe problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have a desktop running Windows XP Home Edition.&nbsp; It was recently attacked by malware (a bogus anti-virus software program called 'Antivira Solutions Pro') which prevented me from opening any programs or accessing websites.</p>
<p>Following advice, I ran the PC in Safe Mode on various occasions and unsuccessfully atttempted a System Restore (the only 'restore point' was after the malware had infested my PC).</p>
<p>Now, after I've logged in, it gets as far as showing the desktop but then displays an error message re: winlogon.exe and then switches to the Blue Screen of Death displaying the message:</p>
<p>STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}</p>
<p>This happens regardless of whether I'm in Safe Mode or normal login.&nbsp; I have tried 'Restore to Last Good Configuration' but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>I have all my files backed up so I'm not concerned about losing data but I want to avoid a full XP reinstallation if possible.</p>
<p>Any advice on how to repair this would be gratefully received.</p>

<h2>            Netflix Access Using Xbox Live Gold Account</h2>
                    
<p>Can someone tell me if I am wrong?....I just purchased a new Xbox 360 mainly to watch movies from online on my television. After I set the system up I go to and install the FREE Netflix app. I click on the Netflix icon then I am prompted to purchase access
 to the website via "Xbox Live Gold" account. Ok i give that i shot....I purchase the one month plan for $9.99 PLUS tax. Ok thats not too bad....ok now i go back to the Netflix app icon and enter Netflix! whooo hooo! Movies here i come......Oh wait...whats
 this?....Oh another charge? WOW now I am paying nearly $300 for the Xbox....$9.99 to microsoft for internet access (Xbox Live Gold Membership) and now Netflix wants $7.99 per month to use their site. What The F*%k is wrong with this picture? I got screwed
 by the richest man in the world. Thank you BILL GATES FOR *** MY CHILDREN. I purchased this for my children to watch movies on the tv but BILL GATES WANTS TO CHARGE ME TO ACCESS WHAT I HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR! You know what you can do BILL GATES? Go F*%k yourself
 you greedy pig.</p>

    <title>Preorder bonus for Skyrim - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick of troy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preorder bonus for Skyrim</h2>
                    
<p>Earlier in the week, Bethesda revealed it's official preorder bonus for The Elder Scrolls V, a "high-quality" map of Skyrim!&nbsp; after heaps of questions regarding it, they later confirmed that yes, the final product will include a paper map (as Morrowind and
 Oblivion did before it), and that this preorder bonus is made from a material similar to burlap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what do you think?&nbsp; Does this sway you towards a preorder, or are you still waiting for the announcement of the highly-prized Collector's Edition?</p>

<p>i couldn't be more swayed towards pre-ordering after the E3 demo, but i'm a bit uncertain about the map, i'd like to know how big it'll be and how much detail, like if it'll have all the caves and towns and various explorables or just the main cities and
 whatnot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm very much waiting for the collectors edition announcement before i actually pre-order or not. if the ce doesn't have enough bang for my buck, then i'll probably just pick up the regular edition at walmart or something on day 1.</p>

<h2>            Problem installing Win XP Virutal machine on Hyper-V on Win 8 Pro</h2>
                    I purchased Windows 8 Pro using a 64 bit setup. I want to install Win XP 32 bit as a virtual machine on Hyper-V.&nbsp; I had no problem setting up the virtual machine in the Manager but when I&nbsp; try to install XP this is what happensed: after I inserted the
 XP installation disk and hit the Connect command. The Virtual Machine desktop say &amp;quot;Connecting to XP Virtual Machine&amp;quot; (my virtual machine name) and just stuck there without showing the XP installation screen. Although in the Hyper-V Manager screen
 tells me that the virtual machine is running and a small thumbnail like image at the bottom of the Hyper-V Manager seems to show the XP installation screen. What is going on?

Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.<br />

As per the link given below, .nef file is not supported by Windows photo viewer. It can only view .jpg and .jpeg, .tif and .tiff, .png, .gif, .bmp and .dib, .wdp&nbsp; file types.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem might be&nbsp;a corrupted file in the Skype folder.&nbsp;Did you install&nbsp;any program/software recently? I suggest to make a
<strong>clean uninstall and reinstall </strong>of the Skype app. <strong>Here's how:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open your Applications folder and drag your copy of Skype to the trash.</li><li>Then open <strong>~/Library/Application Support </strong>* and drag the Skype folder to the trash. The
<strong>~</strong> sign represents your home folder. To find your home folder, open Finder and, from the menu bar, select
<strong>Go </strong>&gt; <strong>Home</strong>.</li><li>Quit Skype by selecting <strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Quit Skype</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>Important:</strong> If you’d like to keep your chat and call history, skip this step.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>~/Library/Preferences</strong> and drag <strong>com.skype.skype.plist</strong> to the trash.</li><li>Open Finder and search for “Skype” using the search feature in Mac OS X. Move all of the results returned to the trash.</li><li>Click <strong>Ctrl</strong> and the trash icon, and select <strong>Empty Trash</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download and install the latest version of Skype</a>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>*By default, the Library folder is hidden in Mac OS X v10.7 “Lion” and higher. To find your Library folder, open Finder and, from the menu bar, select
<strong>Go</strong>, press and hold the option key, and then select <strong>Library</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Share us the result!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Alongside that I checked out the stability of Windows' files (I use Windows XP SP3) and not a single problem was found, and if there was one the Instalation CD fixed that already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the thing in Safe Mode with Net Conectivity... a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled Skype following the normal procedures (C_Cleaner, deletion of Shared/Config XMLs, etc) then ran the reinstalled darn thing in Safe Mode... a waste, again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my understanding this seems to be a problem generated by Microsoft itself (or any group/company behind the main servers operation) since I can connect thru "Skype on the web" but not with the software. A fiew days ago the 7.36.0.105 version of Skype was
 unnable to "log in" it's users and the issue "fixed itself" about 2 hours after the complains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, I did everything possible to try to catch the problem and fix it, from what it is aviable from the Support to other procedures developed by the users in the course of the decade. There is nothing else I can do to achieve a solution, so
 if anyone right now has this problem, I would like to know the cause or the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: As far as I know this is NOT the first time this version presented problems with both login in the users and connecting itself to the main server (to think about it, EVERY version of Skpe had, has or will have the same problems), I checked up the train
 wreck of a past Skype has and the results point out that either problem "solved itself" or was fixed by some&nbsp; "magic missile spellcasting."</p>

            They're going to tell you it's because version 7 was disabled. Angry users are voicing their displeasure about that fact and demanding a return of a version of Skype Classic since version 8 is unsatisfactory on every level.<br />

<p>Dang, if that's the case then we are screwed. I do understand the "safety concerns" with the older versions but that doesn't mean that the end user shouldn't have full responsability/oportunity to use those versions. Unless there is a big security hole in
 Skype that could reach the servers and this is their way to "fix it" by using the Operative System as a shield of sorts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hell, even the web browsers still work despite the age and lack of support, imagine the Mozilla Fundation telling us that not a single version of Firefox bellow 60 will work anymore. :/</p>

            You and I are of one mind here, friend. We've been told multiple times that the reason for the forced update was a backend security flaw in Skype Classic and are almost unilaterally of the opinion that they should focus on fixing that so Skype Classic
 can remain active, as Skype 8 is not acceptable on any level.<br />
<br />
You can support that idea here if you wish:&nbsp;https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-welcome-to-skype-ideas/suggestions/36538813-update-the-back-end-of-skype-7-to-make-it-compatib<br />
<br />
Otherwise I suggest voicing your concern in one of the threads we have on the topic here (look for the ones with the most replies lately) or on Twitter, or writer a letter if you wish. The more voices we have explaining how important Skype Classic is now, the
 better.

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran the install system check for W10 and everything came back OK. Proceeded with W10 install, everything went OK. Laptop was up and running for at least a couple days perfectly fine. Now, every time I start my computer with in about 5 minutes of starting
 it and signing in all the way to my desktop, it shutsdown with a blue screen and says "sorry we've encountered a problem, restarting your computer now.) The error code it provides points to high CPU usage. &nbsp;If that's the case and my CPU wasn't stout enough
 for windows 10... Why did the checks come back as 100% OK?? Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jorge.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Blue Screen Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Prepare the BSOD crash report for analysis following these steps:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>First of all, thank you Greg and good evening.</p>
<p>I have a new problem, so I executed the BSOD troubleshooter and it show nothing, I was reading the instructions for the analysis when suddently a BSOD appeared, now it seems like I cannot get to the desktop now. When I start the pc, a screen appears, the
 screen shows a message that says “0xc000014c”. As I said before, thank you a lot for your answer.</p>

            Jorge -
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  Try Last Known Good Configuration and then Safe Mode with Networking.
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Remove any external devices including USB/E-SATA drives.<br />
If you have more than one internal hard drive disconnect the SATA cable to the second drive (the one your not installing Windows 7 to).<br />
<br />
If you still get the same error message, some people have reported defective DVD media and returned/received a replacement at the place they bought it from.<br />

<p>Thank you. I had no external devices. I was keeping it as simple as possible.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I removed the old Maxtor hard SATA drive (it seemed simpler) and fitted a Samsung Spinpoint.&nbsp;<br />
I only fitted it, didn't&nbsp;do anything else except changed the BIOS to boot from the DVD after the&nbsp;several failed attempts.<br />
There's only one hard drive.<br />
<br />
I bought DVD from Amazon UK months ago so I will have a problem getting a replacement.<br />
<br />
Should I have done something else when fitting the new hard drive? I think the BIOS&nbsp; is ok, but I'm&nbsp; not sure.<br />

            Only two&nbsp; things and a question come to mind:<br />
<br />
1) If it's an older PC then you may have on SATA-I support, the Maxtor may have worked fine but newer drives are SATA-II and as such will not work untill you jumper the drive to 'SATA-I' mode. Not all drive support the jumper option but chech Samsumg's web
 site for jumper information for you specific model number.<br />
<br />
2) Call Amazon support and ask, they may still be able to provide a solution.<br />
<br />
3) What version of Windows are you trying to install?<br />

    <title>Media Center Extender... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmservo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center Extender...</h2>
                    
<p>The HDMI pass through is kind of a joke, I could care less about that; I mean, most of us&nbsp; have home theater receivers, I don't want to HDMI pass through my Oppo, etc. through my reciever to get HD audio to then have it pass through the XBOX One again, kind
 of ridiculous.</p>

<p>BUT, like a lot of people, I use Windows Media Center extensively.. I keep 12 cable card tuners, my Windows 2012 Server with all of my recorded TV and archives.. and I am most concerned about keeping the Windows Media Center extender functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
 games/etc. are nice, but without WMC Extender capabilities, this is a pass for me... I'm hearing mixed thoughts on whether or not this function stays, but it's critical (IMHO).. with just a 500Gb HDD, there is no point in connecting the one with my Cablecard
 tuners (it couldn't record or manage anything) so the DVR function is the part people want...</p>

<p>I'm also in this same boat. I use Windows 8 Media Center with three tuners (and a tuning adapter) with four Xbox 360's. This is the only access I have to cable TV. I don't own/rent set top boxes. I've written a letter to Larry Hryb (Major Nelson). If I get
 any response, I'll post the information here. I sure hope they have extender support in the Xbox One. I don't have much interest in using it to watch live TV only.

<p>I agree. WMC is a must have feature. This is a phenomenal app that should not be abandoned. I run a dual tuner PCI card, as well as an HDhomerun off my antenna. I then have a HDhomerun Prime running off the cable. This gives me 7 tuners. When cable jacks
 my rates up, I can turn them off and run strictly off the antenna with about 40 channels. Then when they give me a new promo rate, I'll gladly sign back up for TV service. The best part is they don't have me hostage with their cable box. I'm not paying fees,
 and I don't have to worry about returning a box and losing all my recordings and settings when I do cancel. That will make it easy to do a short term cancellation to force Time Warner to provide a better rate.</p>

<p>I have received no response from Larry Hryb. But, I just read this article <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4352710/live-tv-on-the-xbox-one-microsoft-didnt-learn-from-google-tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I was really hoping Microsoft was going to enhance the media center experience, but it appears that they plan to just use the HDMI passthrough to overlay live TV onto the screen. Yuck!&nbsp;With so many people using cablecard technology (HDHomeRun, Ceton, etc)
 I don't understand why they&nbsp;didn't try to incorporate that into their plans.</p>
<p>While I would settle for using the Xbox One as a media center extender, I was really hoping that they would leverage their ownership of the media center platform to provide direct integration with the Xbox One's TV capabilities. The Xbox One could talk directly
 to the media center PC to control its tuners, schedule recordings, and display video streams. Instead it looks like all they're going to do is have Xbox One provide TV listings and act like a TV remote control.</p>

<p>@JeffRand, &nbsp;Your article is not about Window's Media Center. It's about The HDMI pass-through for TV box's with the guide overlay that is enabled with voice commands. &nbsp;Its not going to surprise me if they never allow third party devices to utilize HDMI as
 a controller input, &nbsp;that's why there have to be IR blasters. &nbsp;IR blasters in my experience work great.</p>

<p>I'm still hoping that the guide on the xbox one will be built to act as a "new media center extender." There's no reason that guide can't be the new extender.</p>

<p>This seems somewhat contradictory for MS to describe a vision for XB1 where the console blends into the background as my media hub. (Camouflaged by my other entertainment devices) &nbsp;If I have to plug my Xbox 360 into a HDMI pass-through, that simply won’t
 be the case. &nbsp;I don’t want to see my old Xbox sitting next to my new one just for the purpose of watching TV with my cable card. &nbsp;Frankly, that is the reason I got rid of my cable box. It was an unnecessary piece of equipment because I had an Xbox in the same
 room. &nbsp;One less device to look at and control. &nbsp;I know Microsoft thinks this is a step forward, and for most it is, I would presume. &nbsp;For those of us with an Xbox 360 in every room, taking advantage of parental controls, unlimited recording capability, and
 tapping into the Media Center experience, it will be a damn shame to sit in front of my TV constantly reminded, if MS would just add extender to the XB1, I could finally give my Grandma my old Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Oh well. </p>

            Hello PH0000001, I would suggest creating a Microsoft app password to use as your regular password to bypass any errors while signing in. A Microsoft app password is a 22 digit string of random characters that you can use as your regular password to bypass
 many errors. To create an app password sign in at&nbsp;https://account.microsoft.com/security and click on the more security settings link, from this next page you will first have to enable two-step verification before you can create your new app password.

<p>I'd love to give this a shot, I really would, but that involves them actually sending me a text so I can get the app to set up that two-step process... A text which I have been waiting on for over a day now.<br />
<br />
I love how reliable Microsoft's automated support system is... -_-<br />
</p>
<p>While I wait to see if I die of old age before their system works, any other ideas that I can try in the meantime?</p>

<p>The way I solved error 0x80070520 was restarting my router then restarting my PC, it seems the issue is most likely due to your router being unable to send/receive the packets for the Xbox App. I just went through 10 hrs of tech support with many different
 supports from Microsoft and they failed to fix the issue. After running into issues where even the Xbox App wouldn't load I decided to just restart my Router to see if it would change anything. Before the PC reboot: no change, after PC reboot: it worked like
 a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open up the Command Prompt<br />
</p>
<p>2) type ipconfig, you should see several numerical addresses along with what they correspond to. You want the default gateway as that is the address to access your modem/router</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) enter in the numerical address in whatever your preferred choice of browser, upon loading the page you may be asked for a username and password. Depending on the modem/router your usernames will most likely be: username or admin or a blank space. The
 password would be: Password or Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) once in your modem/router click through the tabs until you find an option to reset your modem/router, with some ISP's you can actually call them up and through the automated system reset your router and completely skip the first 3 steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) after your modem/router has fully reset, meaning you lost connection then regained full connectivity, restart your computer. The issue should now be fixed and you can game away.</p>

<p>Thanks for the new solution, but it didn't work.<br />
I'm starting to think that something's gone wrong with my account data on Microsoft's servers and this error code is a smokescreen...</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to keep us updated as to the situation. I do see that you've tried a whole bunch of troubleshooting to try to get everything back up and running but there are 2 recommendations that haven't yet been suggested and you may wish to attempt
 to see if it helps out. You may wish to attempt a clean boot of your system, then attempt to fix the app. I'm placing the links below with the instructions on how to do these steps and would love to hear the results.</p>

</p><p>I also found a couple of applicable posts from our Windows forums that may additionally helpful as well:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-win_xbox/error-code-0x80070520-when-signing-into-store/7e3d194d-2f10-417e-81b1-4cb61adba9b4">Error code 0x80070520 when signing into Store and/or
 XBox Live games</a></p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/error-code-0x80070020/b806c007-e711-426e-838c-67d7a76f029b">error code 0x80070020</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, you may wish to try deleting the Windows Store cache as that can cause the error code you're getting to pop up as well:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Press <strong>
Windows key</strong> or open <strong>
Windows Start</strong>, then type <strong>
wsreset&nbsp;</strong>in the search bar</li><li>
Right-click on&nbsp;<strong>wsreset.exe</strong>&nbsp;and
 select <strong>
Run as Administrator</strong></li><li>
This will clean the Windows Store cache. Make sure you don’t press anything while the command prompt is working.</li><li>
Windows Store will open when it’s been reset and you should restart your PC.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that these help you out a bit more!</p>
