<h2>            Windows Defender Is Slow To Complete A &#39;Quick Scan&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had been using a third party free anti-virus which seemed to perform well, I've noticed that Microsoft has seemingly made some improvements to their product. So today I decided to un-install the software I was using and turn on/use windows defender. At
 first it didn't even want to turn on, I was informed that "only a administrator can do that". I'm the ONLY person that uses this computer, so I am IN FACT the administrator. Once I got it turned on and updated the virus definitions, it took approx. 26 minutes
 to perform just a quick scan, my third party software NEVER took that long..has any other user had the same results ??</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the issue description, I understand that you have some query regarding Windows defender quick scan and its taking longer than usual. I will certainly answer your query.
</p>
<div><br />
The speed and ability to complete an anti-virus or anti-malware scan depends on a variety of factors.</div>
<div><br />
a.&nbsp;The program itself and how its scanning engine is designed to scan: using a signature database vs heuristic scanning or a combination of both<br />
b.&nbsp;Type of scan performed: Deep, Quick or Custom scanning.<br />
c.&nbsp;A computer's hard drive size.<br />
d.&nbsp;Disk size and used capacity (number of files that have to be scanned).<br />
e.&nbsp;Whether external drives are included in the scan.<br />
f.&nbsp;Competition for and utilization of system/CPU resources by the scanner.<br />
g.&nbsp;Other running processes and programs in the background.<br />
h.&nbsp;Whether the scanning engine stalls, hangs or freezes.<br />
Generally there are three types of scans offered by most anti-virus and anti-malware programs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
•&nbsp;<strong>Quick Scan </strong>only checks the areas of your computer most likely to contain malware...the most prevalent and common places where malware typically hides. The length of time for performing a Quick scan will vary but it generally takes about 15-30
 minutes so they can be performed daily.<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>Full Scan </strong>is much more comprehensive since it scans the entire hard drive (all folders/files) which can number in the thousands. The length of time for performing a Full scan will also vary but because it is so comprehensive, this type of
 scan can take several hours. Most Full Scans can be scheduled to run late at night when not using the computer so you can perform a weekly scan without having to monitor it.<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>Custom Scan </strong>allows the user to select any files and folders on the hard drive to be scanned.<br />
To speed up a scan, clean out temporary (junk) files first, temporarily disable any other real-time protection tools, close all open programs, perform a Quick Scan instead of a Full one and do not use the computer during the scan.</div>
<div><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></strong><br />
First, I would suggest you to refer to the kb article mentioned below and refer to the section “Turn Windows Defender real-time protection on or off “ and check if it helps.
<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-defender-help-protect-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-defender-help-protect-computer</span></a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>When you disable Antivirus:</strong><br />
Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2</span></strong><br />
I would suggest you to follow the steps to remove the temporary files.<br />
Step 1: Open Settings.<br />
Step 2: Access System.<br />
Step 3: Choose Storage and select This PC (or any hard drive).<br />
Step 4: Click Temporary files and recycle bin in the options.<br />
Step 5: Tap Delete temporary files and click Delete. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, I really thought by now that Windows Defender would perform in a more proficient manner..at least for now I'll be going back to the third party software I was using.</p>

            <p>Hi Kumar,</p>
<p>Thanks for your last reply..this morning I once again un-installed the third party security product I was using,</p>
<p>( 360 Total Security ). I once again decided to see if there had been any improvement's made to the 'Windows Defender ' product, I turned the product back on..download / installed the latest updates and started a 'quick scan'. As of this writing, it's already
 been 32 minute's..and it shows the progress bar @ about 2/3 's complete. To me anyway, I still don't see ANY improvement at all to the scan rate, Why does a 'quick scan' take so long, compared to the third party product I was using ??</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>
<p />

            <p>I wouldn't give up on Defender, as MSFT clearly hasn't abandoned it. Did you upgrade to the "anniversary" Win 10, ver. 1607, build 14393.10? It has improvements to Defender, even easily allowing an offline scan: "START, Settings, Update &amp; Security, Windows
 Defender, Scan Offline".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason a quick scan can take a long time is the number of files it must scan. What is the count for you during one of those long scans?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I like to see best...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad4dc876-e5a2-4bb2-b114-df583126e180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad4dc876-e5a2-4bb2-b114-df583126e180" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That took less than 2 minutes to complete. But I've had 5 minute scans as well, when - for some reason - Defender finds more files to scan - maybe 114,000 files. The offline scan is also a quick scan &amp; twice has found around 124,000 files to scan. It is
 quicker run offline, but does require a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe clear your browser history to possibly lessen the number of files scanned.</p>

            <p>Hi PCR Just PCR,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, at least for the moment I've given up on the built in windows defender, I'm currently trying out avast free anti virus. I chose the 'minimal' option of installation because I didn't need / want the added bloatware of the 'recommended'
 method of installation.</p>

            <p>OK. I used Avast! long ago &amp; McAfee too. But Defender is so well integrated into Windows that I'll never switch away. I've got a few peeves with it, but I'll never switch away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did BING "360 Total Security removal" to see whether there was a removal tool for it that would get bits/pieces its uninstall would not. There may be a folder left behind that you should delete. Do the BING. There may be a version of 360 that is itself
 a virus - but I decided you didn't have that one since you can uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If/when you decide to uninstall Avast!, go to its site for its removal tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many files did Defender count during a 20 minute Quick scan? That may be something to look into.</p>

            <p>Dear PCR Just PCR,</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for a reply..you asked "&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>How many files did Defender count during a 20 minute Quick scan? "..that's why I switched to Avast (at least&nbsp;temporarily).
 At least on my system..the one I'm typing this on, it's still fairly new..so there isn't a lot of 'junk' on it..also it's pretty fast. So when the 'quick scan' reached (as I remember) 38 minute's and counting, I decided that was enough and I switched.</span></span></span></p>

            OK. When all well, Defender is just fine. So, try again some day. Keep us informed. Good luck.

            <p>Hi PCR Just PCR,</p>
<p>I don't know if you ever check out 'real world' testing of anti-virus product's of not..but the testing site's I view still state that windows defender has improved somewhat..still lags behind other anti virus product's. Here are some site's:</p>
<p>https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-10/</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388652,00.asp</p>

<p>
</p><p>http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/best-free-antivirus-1321277</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the more information that a consumer can be provided with, the more rational a decision can then be made.</p>

            <p>I like the integration into the OS of Defender &amp; that MSFT continues to improve it. It updates frequently, &amp; I'm sure MSFT knows best which viruses, etc., to check for. I really like that it can easily be run offline now. And it passes all the tests at,
 catching them on the way in...</p>

            I've been in this same issue for a few days so far, outlook automatically places a #authRedirect=true on the url every few seconds, even if you turn it to false, stop refresh, or if it isn't even there, this happens in mozilla and chrome browsers.

<p>I've been having the same issue with the webpage app. I can reproduce it both on Edge (41.16299.15.0) and Firefox (58.0.2) on desktop, as well with Chrome (59.0.3071.125) in my Android phone.</p>
<br />
<p>And yes, I've tried cleaning caché/cookies and it didn't work. I can also open other office 365 apps (Word, OneNote, Powerpoint), but not Outlook Live and Calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, I've just tried with Internet Explorer (41.16299.15.0, default installation on Win10) and it seemed to work. Maybe it can be used as a temporary solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: After logging in with IE I tried again with Firefox and Edge and the reload loop stopped. Maybe it's an account level issue. I hope it works for everyone else.</p>

<p>Recently, once signed into outlook, the inbox page keeps on reloading by itself. Use Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, have the same issue. Log in with other computer, same issue. I am having the same problem on all the web
 browsers except for my phone.</p>

            i am having the exact same issue, however I was scrolling through the helpful tips you have given and its going through the process to fix the issues, but its been on step one for the past 2 days now. getting slightly irritated because I go to stautzenberger
 college and I have assignments due tomorrow, quite ridiculous I did all that on Friday and its still taking 2 days to resolve the issue. I now have to wait and do my assignments in class and am now behind...

<p>We have the same problem as above and the request for repair is in German as are other other information bubbles.</p>
<p>Accessing Apps &amp; Features there are 5 instance of MS office 365 as follows: de-de, en-us, fr-fr, it-it, nl-nl</p>
<p>What is the cause of this I did not install, is it ok to delete all but en-us?</p>
<p>I am using the first repair option in en-us mode and it has been running for a long while?</p>

<h2>            Step by Step guide to creating forms or surveys in EXCEL...or ACCESS...&#63;</h2>
                    How do I create FORMS (or surveys) in EXCEL&nbsp;to send out with links like can be done in GOOGLE DOCS?
<div>
<p>In Google Drive, if you create a spreadsheet, the FORM tab appears and you can easily make the spreasheet be an online form or survey that you easily send the link out to people to take.
</p>
<p>Or, you can create a form to use by&nbsp;&nbsp;clicking the word Create, then FORMS,&nbsp;it is so easy.</p>
<p><strong>It is perfect, EXCEPT that it is in Google</strong>. </p>
<p>I want to work with Office docs. I have MS Office 2007 on one computer and 2010 on another.
</p>
<p>How can&nbsp;I do the same thing/make and send links to forms and/or surveys from EXCEL/SKYDRIVE and store responses?
</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can offer,</p>

 activated and I receive emails and can send email. But my contacts don't sync, and that is where the initialization process gets stuck aswell. When I load my moms @live email it works like it should, it even syncs her contacts. I did notice when I access the
 main site from my blackberry browser, that our emails look different, it looks like mine got Updated. PLEASE HELP!!!! I've been struggling with this for 5 days and google has no more answers for me. Can someone pleas help. Thanks</p>

            Thank you for the response. I take it the default app is the basic email setup for blackberry? Then yes. As for the POP3, IMAP or Exchange Active Sync, I don't know how to check this. And what do you mean by migrated to Outlook.com? Sorry you only get
 questions back and little answer. My 'knowledge' of these things...well its not extensive...

<p>To turn them off:</p>
<p>Menu, Apps, My Apps, Notifications (it's in the list of Apps), Settings.</p>
<p>In the My Apps/Notifications/Settings you will have the option to Enable/Disable notifications for various installed Apps that you use (or may have set up originally and forgotten about).</p>

<p><br />
Is this Hotmail session being initiated from a Taskbar pinnned website button?&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case I will try a simulation of your symptom description using it.</p>
<p>So&nbsp;I just tried what you described and got a message:&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're about to throw away this message without sending it."&nbsp;&nbsp; The message window has an OK and Cancel button which would need to be clicked on in order to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if you aren't seeing that
 window I suspect it might explain your symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The UI would be hung until you responded to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can drag the message away to my other monitor and now it is hidden behind the window that I am typing in.&nbsp; Do you have or have you had multiple monitors?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Perhaps the message window can't be seen on that display&nbsp;and that is what is causing the confusion?&nbsp; And. even though the message window has not been responded to when I try to look at the state of the Hotmail window using the Taskbar Preview thumbnail only
 the Hotmail page is shown!</p>
<p>So, now I have finally replied OK to that message.and am now back in my Inbox.&nbsp; And right-click Reply is&nbsp; working.&nbsp; In fact, it is now working even better than it was originally because originally the Reply was in Plain text mode and now it is in Rich text&nbsp;
 mode, so the Reply window looks much more normal.</p>
<p>What else was wrong?...&nbsp; The To: button works.</p>
<p>I'd say make sure that you are seeing that message window when you are aborting your Reply.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an actual separate IE window.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see it using Task Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, perhaps you have a popup blocker that is suppressing it but leaving the message box
 in an unanswered state?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how I would try to simulate that...&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll try setting Popup Blocking to High (overridable by Alt+Shift Click).&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually have to type something in the Reply to get the message but I do get the message, so the IE popup
 blocker apparently isn't capable of suppressing this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any other popup blocker active which could be suppressing this message window?</p>
<p>Interestingly there are different messages depending on what I do to cause the Reply to be aborted.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if I try clicking on Options,&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the same message but it is issued in the IE window that is titled "Are you sure you want to leave this page?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
 E.g. it's as if IE thinks the web app does not have as much control over helping the user avoid loss of data in that case.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Need to reinstall my Office package</h2>
                    I recently did a factory restore on my HP laptop, and lost my Office Student package. I bought the package from Staples about 3 to 4 years ago, and I can not find my cd with the product key. &nbsp;Is there a way Microsoft can pull up any type of history that
 I had the software on my laptop and send me another product key without having to spend another load of money on the software?

<p>Short answer, no, if Office 2013 or 2016 the original install would be associated with an MS Account and you log on to that account to reinstall
<a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a></p>
<p>If Office 2010 or earlier you need, at the very least, the Office&nbsp; Key<br />

<p>If you are sure its in Outlook, close outlook and restart it using the /cleanrules switch - at start menu, run, type</p>

<p>There seems to be two problems happening concurrently: &nbsp;I clicked on the prompts that appeared at the top of a Word 2016 document to download updates for Microsoft Office. &nbsp;I finally did this today in an effort to resolve the problem in Word 2016 "There
 is not enough memory or disk space to up date the display." &nbsp; The Microsoft Office update path kept me in a loop where it appeared to be downloading. &nbsp; &nbsp;When attempting to download the Microsoft Office updates, a remark appeared that said something to the
 effect that I "may have a limit on how much data can accessed via the Internet, and I will be charged for any excess data. " &nbsp;The prompt to download the Microsoft Office updates then reappeared when I reopened Word. &nbsp;It appears the Microsoft updates ever really
 "took." &nbsp; Meanwhile, I am unable to update my document. &nbsp;It is 10 pages with Hebrew (from an older version of Davka) and English fonts---this has never been a problem before. &nbsp; &nbsp;Please help---I need to do this today.</p>

            I ended up using ccleaner to wipe all the non-essential files off of the hard drive, including using disk cleanup to cleanup all files and system files that weren't needed. After I had done that I went into the control panel and repaired the office suite
 online and not quick then the problem went away for me. &nbsp;Hope this helps.

    <title>How to mail merge multiple records into different text boxes on one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebecca_ag  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to mail merge multiple records into different text boxes on one page in Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    How do I mail merge multiple records into different text boxes on one page in Word 2010?
<br />
<br />
The intuitive option of using Next field doesn't work (only one record is applied to the text boxes) - and table based formatting can't be used instead of text boxes, as the text is rotated in various ways in different text boxes to align with embedded images.

This is probably not something that can be done with mail merge.&nbsp; It may be possible to create a VBA based application that can do it, but more information would be needed to make a final decision on that.</p>
<p>If you want to send me a copy of the document into which you are trying to merge the data (possibly with dummy information inserted manually so that it appears as desired) and a copy of the data source (once again with dummy data if desired), I will take
 a look and give you an opinion of the options that you may have for achieving your requirements.</p>

            One fairly simple approach that may work is as follows:
<div>&nbsp;a. suppose the field you want in your textboxes is called "myfield"</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. suppose you know you are going to process at most data source 3 records per output document</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. put all your NEXT fields outside the textboxes, e.g. do this at the top of the document</div>
<div>{ SET m1 { MERGEFIELD myfield } }{ NEXT }{ SET m2 { MERGEFIELD myfield } }{ NEXT }{ SET m3 { MERGEFIELD myfield } }</div>
<div><br />
<div>Use the fields { m1 } (or { REF m1 } etc.), { m2 }, { m3 } in your text boxes.</div>

            Podcast is an app rumoured to be in the 8.1 update, podcasts are audio programs, similar to radio but instead of music the presenters talk about different topics depending on the program, I'm sure that when the app is unveiled or released it will show
 you how to use it.

<h2>            Excel help for basketball player sorting</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in serious need of advice and assistance on a basketball skills workbook I've been working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to enter the players name, and enter in their scores 1-5 on the the certain skills assessments, and then have that data generate a list of players ascending from highest score to lowest score. &nbsp;I then need the scores and player names to
 fill onto separate sheets to automatically create teams that have a mix of strong players and weak players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried ranking the players and then having then manually moving them to the teams but this seems to be a big project and need any help that I can get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Taskbar functionality needs to be uniform on multi monitor setups</h2>
                    Just as the topic says. For years windows has only had one taskbar which was placed on your default monitor. you could always tell which one that was by looking for the taskbar. Now that we have taskbars on each monitor you can still see that the main
 taskbar is still on the main monitor. A taskbar should be the same no matter which monitor its on. It shold contain a tray and clock options etc.. The tray could also optionally only display icons from programs running on that monitor similar to the way taskbar
 buttons work now. Also when opening a program from the start menu on a monitor the program should open on that monitor and not the default one. Often times those with multiple monitor setups "work in a monitor". They dont want to leave that monitor when opening
 a support program to finish the current task. This is worst than just focus stealing as you have to move to another monitor and then bring the newly opened program down to the new monitor. counter intuitive and counter produc

            if within the actual document you added a page break then added enough text before the break to make it fall on next page. in that case you need to remove the page break and reformat, or close up the gap.<br />
<br />
if its at the end of the document, you typed enough returns to make it break to a new page.<br />
<br />
To fix go to standard menu and click on the ¶ symbol (button) that turns formatting characters visible.<br />
<br />
now scroll to the Blank Page.&nbsp; look for something similar to: –––––––––––page break––––––––––– , Highlight this item by double click on it,<br />
or click just before and drag across. Hit Delete. the break will disappear. You may have to adjust spacing of&nbsp; of the text&nbsp; when you removed the break.<br />
Also Section breaks may apply as well.<br />
<br />
For blank Page at the end. Turn on the ¶.<br />
<br />
scroll to end of document<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove any ¶ you see until you get to the end of text.<br />
That should remove any Blank pages.<br />

            <p>It's difficult to give specific advice without knowing what's responsible for the blank pages in the first place :-)</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that there really is no such thing as a 'blank page' in a Word document unless you're using Left/Right Section Breaks. Even then, the blank pages do not display on screen.</p>
<p>Every displayed page has content even if it's only an empty paragraph or some sort of Break inserted to alter the text flow. Turn on the non-printing characters (¶) in order to determine what that content is, then you should be able to rectify it. If not,
 reply here with a complete description of what is revealed in the document.</p>

<h2>            Don&#39;t show backstage</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running into an&nbsp;Office 2013&nbsp;issue where the "Don't show the backstage when opening or saving files" option simply does not work. I make sure that option is checked, but the Backstage still opens when I choose File -&gt; Save As or File -&gt; Open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tested this on several different computers. Every computer that I've tested is running Windows 8 (64-bit). Every computer is unable to bypass the Backstage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            The option's wording is somewhat misleading. If you click the File tab, the Backstage view will always appear, regardless of the option's setting. If you use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+O and Ctrl+S, the Open and Save dialogs appear instead when the option
 is checked.<br />

<h2>            Nokia&#39;s betrayal to premium loyal customers - absurd customer service cases and E72 issues</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I am here to express the indignation of a former-fan of Nokia, more appropriately a convict customer of this brand for more than 10 years. I bought an E-72 (an expensive model, high-end) less than 9 months ago (it means that it is under warranty), and the
 same showed serious defects since the beginning (bluetooth that does not work, freezing, reboot, unstable call connection, others).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was postponing to take the device to the Assistance since it was fulfilling my minimum needs and my level of forgiveness&nbsp; with my so loved Nokia brand for years. Recently my E72 fell down and damaged the screen. It continues to make and receive calls,
 what it means that only the SCREEN broke. That was a justifiable reason enough at last to take it to the Customer Care to repair the display (fully aware that broken displays are out of warranty, and I was expecting to pay for the fix);&nbsp; however, that was
 an opportunity to also fix the innumerable native defects&nbsp; (SUPPOSEDLY COVERED by the Warranty).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my deception, I was notified today that, due to "broken screen", my whole device was put "out of warranty" and NOTHING would be fixed. By the way, they did not evaluated the list of defects I wrote, when noticing first the damaged screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Brazilian Nokia Care OS Number 9801269 is a flaw, and the mediocre customer service from Nokia PLL MOEMA Customer Service Center, a horrible service for a premium customer who bought and advertised NOKIA in all corners of the world. I am disappointed
 with you. I was even expecting to receive a new device having so many defects at once, since I have this device less than 9 months having forgiven Nokia for months. I was needed to happen a bigger damage (screen) to motivate me to take it to the customer assistance
 center.</p>
<p>As a former-customer of NOKIA, I'd like to finish my last message lamenting this situation for all of you. I will share this with the public consumer press and magazines since I am feeling injured from the response of Nokia PLL MOEMA Center and the way they
 want to decide my case: "please take your broken device back in the same local, closed case". The magazines and press will deal with this Nokia case from now on.</p>

<p>dont be surprised if upper management is changing hands in the future and/or microsofit takes over nokia as a 51% share holder essentially owning the company and all of nokias symbian gets left in the dust and all operationg systems are switched to windows.....with
 no support.</p>

<h2>            MSE &#58; Event Log Error &#34;Microsoft Antimalware Real-Time Protection feature has encountered an error and failed&#34; Error Code&#58; 0x80004005</h2>
                    Running Windows 7 32-bit SP1 and Microsoft Antimalware and I'm seeing this error message in the EventLog since beginning of May.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>
Microsoft Antimalware Real-Time Protection feature has encountered an error and failed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feature: Behavior Monitoring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Code: 0x80004005<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error description: Unspecified error&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason: The filter driver requires an up-to-date engine in order to function. You must install the latest definition updates in order to enable real-time protection.</p>
<p>
Log Name: System<br />
Source: Microsoft Antimalware<br />
Event ID: 3002</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Appears to happen only during reboots, otherwise everything appears normal. &nbsp;Normal updates apply like I would expect.</p>
<p>
I had opened a ticket with the Microsoft Support Team and the answer I got was essentially there is a permission issue in the registry and MSE is 'corrupted'.</p>
<p>
Reinstall MSE, then if that doesn't correct the issue, reinstall windows. &nbsp;This seems extreme...</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Does anyone have any thoughts on the issue.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Ignore it.</p>
<p>Support is *wrong* on this issue.</p>
<p>There are some other discussions in the forum for this error -- some lengthy.</p>
<p>The consensus is that this is a spurious event logging where MSE is trying to contact Spynet before the network adapter or your network connection is available. It does not mean that there is a problem. Note that the Event Viewer is there to troubleshoot
 a problem, it often contains loads of noise, sometimes there because of bad programming practices.</p>

<h2>            Excel freezes, hangs sporadically</h2>
                    <p>Too often when I have more than a couple of Excel files open, and copy charts to a graphics package, Excel freezes. I have to close all the spreadsheets to get Excel back. It might be something to do with the screen graphics, because when I click on File
 in the top menu bar, I won't see anything except a blank page. No side menu or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else found this? Is it a bug or just my laptop? (Asus with Intel i7, 8Gb Ram, NVIDIA GeForce 840M and Intel HD, Windows 10 Pro)</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors.<br />
<br />
2. Repair the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Review following link - https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/manage/office-365-and-windows-10-problems-and-solutions<br />
<br />
6. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
7. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
8. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
9. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
10. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
11. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
12. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
13. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>Can&#39;t sync calendar over the air ... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bones22234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t sync calendar over the air ...</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Wasn't sure where to ask this Q, but this seems as good a spot as any. I have the T-Mobile Dash running Win Mobile 6, and in the office I use Outlook 2003 on XP. I have never used ActiveSync, but instead, I just sync over the air using T-Mobile's EDGE data
 network and point it at the URL for my company's OWA server/<br />
<br />
This works just fine for e-mail and contacts, but calendar is a bit quirky. Appointments that I accept in Outlook do not sync to my phone, but if I accept them on the phone, they do show up in Outlook. This is becomming obnoxious becuase I have missed meetings
 a couple of times now.<br />
<br />
I know that someone will reply here and tell me to, "go install ActiveSync ... etc." but why? The whole point of have a Win Mobile device that can sync up over the air is so that I don't have to be tethered to a laptop/desktop computer to get the latest information.
 On days that I travel, I am often away from my (Internet connected) comptuer for 5 - 7 hours at a time.<br />
<br />
Hints?<br />
<br />

            unless i'm wrong I know only two ways to sync: through Activesync on a pc or through Echange Activesync. Your Exchange server needs to be mobile enabled for that to happen. Now, since Contacts only are not synchronizing, you should raise the issue with
 your Exchange server administrator. Check the status on your device for any support code in activesync.

            Hi Linley,<br />
<br />
- Actually contacts are working just fine, it's the calendar that is not working.<br />
<br />
- Exchange server is mobile enabled with Exchange ActiveSync. <br />
<br />
- I am not sure what you mean by, "<span><span>Check the status on your device for any support code in activesync."<br />
