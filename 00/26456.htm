<h2>            Next Generation Sync Client &#40;OneDrive for Business&#41; does not finish syncing</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using Windows 10 Pro in combination with Office365 and have about 7 GB (14.000 files) on OneDrive for Business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After my first setup all files where synced fine but after a few days I noticed that the ODfB client does not finish to sync: it constantly says: syncing - 4 files remaining. A few days later.... "syncing - 10 files remaining" ...and so on. After more days
 I ended up having "94 files remaining" . I tried to stop and restart syncing, tried to "repair"....but nothing solved the situation. As I was not able to identify which files are not synced, I disconnected the ODfB, deleted all files online and set it up completely
 new (it took more the 48 hours to finish, although being on a fast line with more than 40 MBit/s upload).</p>
<p>After being in sync again, I never got the status message that it had finished syncing: I kept telling me "sync in progress" ...after a few days, I am back to the situation already described above: the number of files "remaining" is increasing slowly.</p>
<p>Note: ODfB still syncs several files when I add them locally or online but it just does not finish!</p>
<p>Please provide help without having to restart all over from syncing again for days, ending up in the exact same situation!</p>
<p>Thank you very much and best regards</p>

<p>Hi Florian,</p>
<p>Normally, this stuck syncing issue may be caused by some files are stuck syncing from the sync server.</p>
<p>These stuck synced files may be the limit characters or the normal ones. If they are the sync limit characters, just rename them and re-sync. If they are normal ones, we suggest moving them out from the cloud and wait for a while, then remove them in again
 to sync.</p>
<p>So, for your scenario, could you try the following suggestions?</p>
<p>1. Check the sync limit characters from the KB below to see if there are some files names or files types are not supported to sync.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202</a></p>
<p>2. Check if there are files with a red overlay in the synced folder. If so, remove them both from the cloud and local synced folder, then add them in to sync again. Note: please backup them before deleting them.</p>
<p>3. Check if there are some blank folders on the local synced folder even though there is a green overlay on them. If so, find out the files that are contained in them from the cloud, then remove them from the cloud and re-add them again to trigger sync.</p>
<p>4. Unlink and relink your account, and choose folders to sync to check the outcome.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick reply!</p>
<p>The problem is, I don't have any red/green overlays in the synced folders. No folder at all shows these overlay symbols.</p>
<p>Therefore, I just don't know which files are having problems. I don't even get sync problems reported.</p>
<p>If you let me know how, I could send you (on a private channel) a screenshot depicting this situation...</p>
<p>There seems to be something really broken. Any suggestion on how to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>I managed to get the overlays working by using this fix: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3079213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.microsoft.com/.../3079213</a></p>
<p>Based on the overlays, I identified 2 files to contain not allowed characters, which I renamed. After that I addressed all folders/files that claimed to be actively syncing although nothing happened after hours of waiting: I removed the files locally and
 online and re-added them via online upload through the browser. After a while I finally got the ODfB icon in the tray to say: everything is up to date! So I was happy.</p>
<p>The only problem remaining is that the ODfB process is constantly requiring &gt;30% CPU power and the fan of my laptop is blowing although everything is up-to-date.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestion &nbsp;on how to proceed?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance and best regards</p>
<p>Florian</p>

<p>Hi Florian,</p>
<p>Glad to hear that the OneDrive for Business library is now synced to your client.</p>
<p>Regarding “the ODfB process is constantly requiring &gt;30% CPU power”, the sync process may occupy some computer resources. However, the sync client will not be in sync process every second so it should not constantly take up that much CPU.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>

            You need to check the "monitored" folder for music.&nbsp; Go to settings/software/collection and see where the music is going.&nbsp; Zune Pass music is set to default to my music/Zune/Subscription folder.&nbsp; If you are using Windows 7 it will default to your Windows
 libraries but you can change that to manage the Zune folders separately. <br />

<h2>            Problem printing in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; My two printers have shrunk and wrongly centered Word 2013 documents.&nbsp; I am in the middle of printing a newsletter so am desperate.&nbsp; I rang Microsoft support, got transferred to a French answerphone, it rang off.&nbsp; I
 am not allowed to ring again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp; I have transferred my Word documents to my laptop Windows 7, attached the printers, and now am printing OK - but still need to know why Windows 8.1 is not printing corectly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Update 2:&nbsp; I converted word to a PDF, as suggested in one post, and it still prints small.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Eureka:&nbsp; I found hidden parameters in the printer profiles that had set paper size to letter.&nbsp; I have changed these to A4 and now everything is working OK.&nbsp; No problems any longer.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 &#47; Windows Phone 8 Tethering</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia 820 and I am a heavy user of the tether feature of the phone.&nbsp; I have recently upgraded to windows 8 on my machine and I am unable to connect the windows 8 machine to the windows phone 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The laptop connects to everything else ok, but fails to connect to the phone - this is a real pain for me as I spend quite a lot of time on the train and need the tether to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tether from the windows phone 8 to other devices seems to be ok as well.&nbsp; Works fine on my Mac Book Air with Mac OS running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason there is an issue with the windows 8 software connecting to the windows phone tether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It always says "limited access" and suggests that the default gateway wasn't contactable and need to be reset - could it be some complication with home group??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please someone help!</p>

            I fixed this by updateing (or downgrading) my wifi drivers. I downloaded the windows 8 broadcom driver listed on HP's website for my laptop, rather than use microsoft supplied windows 8 driver and it is all fixed.

    <title>Word 365 crashes on opening documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dandemon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 365 crashes on opening documents</h2>
                    <p>Hi community. &nbsp;I'm tearing my hair out with this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version of Word: 1708, build 8431.2153 click-to-run (Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus)</p>
<p>Version of Windows 10: Home, 64-bit, version 1709, build 16299.214</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening Word and clicking on a blank template nearly always results in a crash, with the dialog box telling me that Microsoft Word has stopped working. &nbsp;The event manager logs the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: WINWORD.EXE, version: 16.0.8431.2153, time stamp: 0x5a3e04c9</p>
<p>Faulting module name: igd10iumd32.dll, version: 10.18.15.4256, time stamp: 0x55a99c5c</p>
<p>Exception code: 0xc0000005</p>
<p>Fault offset: 0x0002e813</p>
<p>Faulting process id: 0x40c</p>
<p>Faulting application start time: 0x01d39e32ee1143f0</p>
<p>Faulting application path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE</p>
<p>Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\igd10iumd32.dll</p>
<p>Report Id: c8906d14-cb1a-xxxx-xxxx-e0d97bc3f314</p>
<p>Faulting package full name:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faulting package-relative application ID:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes no real difference if I open a blank template, a complex one, or a document saved locally or on a cloud service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following made no difference, so for heaven's sake please don't suggest them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Online repair of Office</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Uninstalling with the control panel and reinstalling</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Uninstalling with the office removal tool and reinstalling</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Manually deleting template and other Office remnants after options 2 and 3 above</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Disabling add-ins (no I don't have the epson ABY fine or whatever it's called!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the odd occasion Word seems to only 'nearly' crash - the screen flashes blank just after opening a document, and then it seems to recover. &nbsp;It's very flaky though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone assist with a response that isn't generic, please? &nbsp;You can assume I'm tech literate and that the PC is virus free and kept updated, with no junk or suspicious software on board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Outlook.com&#58; Mails not marked as &#34;Replied&#34; when sending - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook.com&#58; Mails not marked as &#34;Replied&#34; when sending from a non-outlook.com alias</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I have the following problem I'm asking your help with. I have an email account, which I'd like to keep, because I like the email address, plus this email address is being used all over the place, so changing away from it would be a real nightmare.
 But alas, I don't like its webmail interface, so I wish to conduct the emailing through my Outlook.com account. So I added this email address as an alias on Outlook.com, then I set up forwarding from the account to Outlook.com, and finally, I connected the
 account to Outlook.com as a send-only account, using the account's own SMTP server for sending. (This latter trick was necessary because of the infamous "on behalf of" issue: when sending a mail directly from Outlook.com with the non-outlook.com from-address,
 the recipient will see "&lt;outlook.com address&gt; on behalf of &lt;non-outlook.com address&gt;" as the sender, which is totally uncool.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is all good and well, except that I noticed that in this case, the replied emails don't get marked as "replied" (with the small backward arrow in the list view), neither do they get marked as "forwarded" when forwarded. There is no problem if the
 outlook.com address is used as the from-address (whether sent through Outlook.com or the proxy account), or if the mail was sent through Outlook.com (regardless of the from-address).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue? If yes, are there any plans to fix it? In the meantime, is there any work-around for it? Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply! No, it doesn't seem like a client-side issue - it behaves the same way whether I log in from Safari on a MacBook, or from Internet Explorer on a PC. (But once again, the problem only occurs if the reply is sent from a non-outlook.com
 email alias, using a non-Outlook.com SMTP server.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this further information will help resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            BTW, one more data point: the wrong behavior is observed whether my outlook.com email address or my preferred non-outlook.com email address is configured as the "primary alias" for the Outlook.com account - if the SMTP server belonging to my preferred
 address is used for sending, the replied/forwarded emails are not marked as "replied" or "forwarded". Thanks again!

    <title>Printed Blank Monthly-Style Calendar - Wrong months in header - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printed Blank Monthly-Style Calendar - Wrong months in header</h2>
                    I think this is a bug in Outlook, but maybe there's a workaround.<br />
When I print a Blank Calendar, Monthly Format, I get the calendar of the main month just fine; and up in the header area are two mini-calendars, which should be the prior month and the next month.&nbsp; (So, printing an "August" monthly calendar, the mini-calendars
 in the header would be July + September.)<br />
Since at least Outlook 2007, and now upgraded to 2010, the calendar prints the current month + next month in the header area.&nbsp; (So, printing an August monthly calendar, the mini-calendars at the top are August + September.)&nbsp; Naturally, I don't need to see August
 twice on the same page!&nbsp; I need July/Aug/Sept.<br />
If this is a bug, where can I log it to see if MS will ever address it?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Chris<br />

<h2>            Nokia Ovi Suite on Linux&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, just a thought, but why do I have to buy a 100+ EUR operating system just to connect my phone to my computer?</p>
<p>I mean, common on, I bought a C5 Nokia and now I have to spend almost the same amount of money to buy some software to connect it to my PC??? This is outrageous. I mean, yeah I can connect and use the basic features of it (send sms, check address book, move
 files), but what about the incredible Ovi suite?</p>
<p>Just annoyed.. Anyone else would like to see Ovi suite compatible with more OS'es (like Linux, Mac OS X etc.)?</p>

<p>To tell the truth, there are a lot of different Linux platforms that Nokia should support with the Ovi Suite...Fedora, Ubuntu, Suse, etc.</p>

<p>WOW, won't call Ovi Suite "incredible". It is slow and does not do what you want it to do.</p>

<p>Being a Nokia supporter and born in Finland I have given Nokia a chance to improve its phones and software. These are the facts: My oldest Nokia phone has the best phone signal, sound quality and battery life. The newest has the worst of everything. Battery
 made in China and lasts a day max. In order to uppdate software, you have to install Ovi Suite on a PC with Windows. So I have to fire up an old dinosaur with XP in order to update my phone. It took me over 6 hours of trying over and over again. First it would
 say "no internet connection", when connected with Ethernet directly to a cable modem. It then would say USB connection lost about 12 times until I gave up and tried again the next day. After many hours of starting, restarting and trying, I had the software
 updated, but when connecting the phone to Nokia's Ovi website, it would say that my phone is not compatible. Before the update it was compatible. Extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>I use Ubuntu on my computers and refuse to go back to Windows. Anyone with half a brain would use a Linux based OS if they only knew how great it is. I just can't believe the geeks in Finland don't provide a version of the Ovi Suite for Linux. There is certainly
 room for improvement. If anybody has been able to configure Ovi Suite under Wine, let me know. I tried without success.</p>

            We can think Nokia develop ovi suite with QT and have a great compatibility with lots of OS but no, they are as stupid as the other mobile phone builders. I have one N900 and only Linux on my PC and I can't update my software or use services which I am
 entitled with my phone, however Maemo is Linux based. Thanks Nokia you were powerfull but now you are more and more inefficient, I think the N900 is the last Nokia in my life if mentalities does not evolve.

what is this then http://help.outlook.com/en-au/140/cc875899.aspx<br />

That makes it pretty clear that outlook.com is provisioned for IMAP. <br />

I therefore assume that the reasons it is not made available have nothing to do with technology.and a very large amount to do with making people pay for non-crippled products, although I do see that IMAP is provided to the EDU space. Clever marketing that..<br />

            <p>This forum is dedicated to the new free webmail service akin to Hotmail. References in it to outlook.com should be taken as referring to that service and not to other subscription services using different servers on the same domain. I've said it before,
 but I'll say it again: with the introduction of this new service, Microsoft's nomenclatorial bamboozlement has reached new heights.</p>
<p>It's only three years ago that access was made available to free Hotmail accounts from any mail client via POP3. Before that, you either had to pay for it or use a Microsoft mail client. DeltaSync (when it works properly) is far superior to IMAP, and&nbsp;I can't
 remember having&nbsp;any major problems with it since I started using it six years ago.</p>

Microsoft is working to do their best to make the word Outlook synonymous with Email.&nbsp; The marketing guys probably think they are going to have people Outlook me instead of inbox me.<br />
<br />
What they have created is an unholy mess.&nbsp; The folks That ran Yahoo and HP into the ground must all have found a home at Microsoft and collaborated fiercely&nbsp; to innovate&nbsp; to create such a confusing unfriendly environment.<br />
<br />
It is a non homogeneous collection of vaguely related services which for some reason that could only be fathomed by a marketing expert.are being stuck under the same name.&nbsp; I came here looking for SMTP settings for a person who states they have an outlook.com
 address.<br />
<br />
I spent an hour on it, and all I have learned is that my leaving Microsoft and their products behind is still a good idea.<br />
<br />
Perhaps as a "Community Moderator" you could tell me, how do I tell what sort of "outlook.com" email address a person has to answer the simple question of What are my SMTP settings supposed to be.<br />
<br />
PS has anybody at Microsoft/Live heard that the default port for SMTP has not been 25 for Years and some Major US based ISPs block it?<br />

<p>If the email address is @outlook.com, it's just like any other Hotmail account @hotmail.*, @live.*, @msn.com, @windowslive.* and any number of other MS domains that use the Hotmail interface.<br />
<br />
You'll find the settings on this page: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/send-receive-email-from-mail-client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<blockquote>PS has anybody at Microsoft/Live heard that the default port for SMTP has not been 25 for Years and some Major US based ISPs block it?</blockquote>
<p><br />
It is still the default port, and there are no end of mail servers that support only 25. I spend a great deal of my time telnetting to mail servers around the world to find out what ports are supported.</p>
<p>Those ISPs that block port 25 for SMTP do so only for users who aren't their own customers, or sometimes for those who don't authenticate themselves to their own SMTP server. Port 587 is the standard port for authenticated SMTP, and 465 for authenticated
 SMTP through SSL.</p>

    <title>Issue syncing tracks from Windows Phone desktop app to my phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil.mc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue syncing tracks from Windows Phone desktop app to my phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi - hope someone can help with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest version of the Windows Phone App installed on my Windows 7 PC. I've used it successfully in the past to sync audio files across from Windows Media Player 12 to the phone (a Samsung Ativ S running Windows Phone 8.1). However, I'm now faced
 with an issue I can't overcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just ripped a talking book that I own from CD to MP3 (this sort of format shifting is now perfectly legal in the UK - though I'd best mention that!). It was a long book, and the 26 CDs created 492 separate MP3 tracks. I then spent some time tinkering
 with the media informaiton in WMP - renaming tracks, and generally making sure everything had the same bibliographic details. By the end of the process all 492 tracks sat in the same album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening the Windows Phone app on the desktop, this album is listed in the Artists list in the Music tab. I tick the album and click on sync, and the app quickly copies just 29 tracks from the desktop onto the phone and then says it has finished. I've rebooted
 the phone, made the app forget the phone and then reinstated it, and deleted and restored my entire media library in WMP... and the same thing just keeps happening. It always just copies the same 29 tracks... and they aren't even a continuous 29 tracks, they
 are taken from odd points throughout the book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using the sync feature in WMP 12 to sync the contents of this album to the phone. This does definitely copy all 492 tracks to the phone, but although it copies them to the Music folder on my SD card (which is my default location for all audio
 - and has worked perfectly well in the past) the actual phone itself doesn't seem to know that they're there and I can't play them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me either to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Get the Windows Phone app working properly and transfer this audio book; or</p>
<p>2) Suggest a way I can sync successfully using WMP 12 instead</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there a third way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

            <p>It is all about the metadata/mp3 tag of each track.</p>
<p>WMP will not tag correctly&nbsp;what it does not know.&nbsp; Just because&nbsp;WMP will show all tracks in the same album does not mean the tracks are numbered sequentially or grouped by CD.</p>
<p>On the phone, for tracks to be listed in an album all the tracks have the mp3 album tag match, exactly.&nbsp; For them to be listed in the correct play order the track number mp3 tag has to be sequentially correct.&nbsp; WMP will not do this tagging.&nbsp; Without this
 they will never show correctly on the phone.</p>
<p>Naturally all the artist mp3 tags should be the same. it would mean more if the track name was the same as the track number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you I would get the free CDex ripping program to rip each CD.&nbsp;A little learning curve on track naming. You can enter the tag you want on the first screen for artist, album and each track.</p>
<p>I would have all the artist name the same, probably the book name. Album name should probably be the CD number. Track number and name should be the same, maybe include the CD number in the track name. Don't try to put all 492 tracks in the same album.</p>
<p>CDex is free and has been one of the best rippers for years, had it on my XP machines. it won't mean much to you know but in options, settings, directories and files, a file name format of %2\%7 %1 - %4 will create file names&nbsp; with a track number with a
 leading 0 Artist - Track Name in a folder with the album name. All this is based on the info you put on the first screen.</p>
<p>All you want in settings, tags is ID3_V1 and ID3-V2.3. Set the bitrate in the encoder setting. Probably around 56 or 48 kbps for speech and will keep the tracks smaller.</p>
<p>Do the first and make sure it is OK before you start ripping all.</p>
<p>If you have questions when you start ripping I will help</p>

            <p>Thanks very much for the response. I will look into CDex when I get the chance - anything that is friendlier and more intuitive than WMP would be welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the problem I'm having... the thing is that I *have* gone through and corrected all the metadata. I've set WMP up so that it never tries to check on the internet for metadata details for tracks, so every CD I rip comes up as an "Unknown Album"
 with all tracks number sequentially, and the track names simply "Track 1", "Track 2" etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've then gone into the metadata and renumbered all the tracks by hand so they now count from 1-492. I've also renamed all the track names the same way. Then I've changed the Artist, Title, Genre and Date information for each ripped CD to exactly the same
 term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has the effect of the WMP bunching them all together as one album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to sync to the phone using the Windows App it only syncs 29 out of the 492 tracks. It's not like it syncs all 492 but only puts 29 in the right place, it just&nbsp;ignores 463 of the MP3s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done this successfully before with books stretched over six CDs. I just can't see where the problem is, as I can't see where I'm doing anything differently.</p>

            <p>Wow, that was a lot of work using WMP to change all the tags.</p>
<p>There may be a limit somewhere on the phone for track numbers, I don't know. There used to be a limit on the number of songs you could put in a playlist&nbsp;but I have not come across an album limit. By&nbsp;what I know what you have done should have worked.</p>
<p>I can only suggest you try CDex for a couple of the CD's. That would be easier for me than to use WMP.
</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, did the first CD have 29 tracks?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, that's another bizarre thing.</p>
<p>Each CD has about 18-19 tracks when ripped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 29 tracks it copies are the first few of CD 1, then some from CD 10, and then some from CD 26. But I've done this four times now, and it's always the *same* 29 tracks - so they're not being selected at random.</p>

            Use the SETTING WIZARD which is preinstalled on n73. If you don't have one, you can download the same from Nokia site. Also check whether the Access Point is defined properly.

            Go to the Settings Wizard and open the application. Select the operator option and the rest will be taken care of.<br />
<br />
By the word 'properly' I mean to check the Access Point name. Go to Tools, settings, connection, select packet data and give the correct Access point name. Ask your operator for this. (in my case it is "airtelgprs.com" (without quotes)Yours should be different.
 Is it clear now?

I've tried it all and it still isn't working.<br />
I noticed that the reception signal in the top left hand corner used to flash whenever I was sending an MMS. This isn't happening anymore though.

            Since it is relatively easy for someone to forge an unsecured digital certificate and place it in a malicious workbook, this method of avoiding macro security warnings may not be an acceptable solution. In the event that a decision is made to abandon this
 technique the installed digital certificates can be easily removed by opening the Internet Options dialog from either Internet Explorer or from the control panels and navigating to the Content tab. Click on Certificates. Find the certificates to be deleted
 (they should be in either the Trusted Root Certification Authorities or Other People section,) selecting them, and click the Remove command button. Click Done when finished.<br />
<br />
If true security is required then a secure digital certificate can be purchased from any of the many Certificate Authorities. See Microsoft's list of Certificate Authorities at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsecure/html/rootcertprog.asp.
 Certificates are purchased for periods of time and average $500 per year. GoDaddy offers code signing certificates for less that $200 per year.<br />

<p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a known issue that can happen when many successive duplicates are chained together on the same Sway.&nbsp; Have you ever considered using the template feature?&nbsp; To do so, you would create a new Sway from scratch, put the basic content in it that you want
 in every week, then, from the … menu, choose Save as Template.&nbsp; Then, each week, you'd just create a new Sway from that template which appears on your My Sways page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of this, in order to fix your current Sway, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open last week's Sway in one window</li><li>Create a new Sway and open it in the other window</li><li>In the original Sway, select all the cards at once</li><li>Press Ctrl+c to copy</li><li>In the new Sway, press Ctrl+v to paste</li><li>You will need to copy in the title card pieces separately and set the style/layout separately</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need any assistance with this.</p>
<p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The possible reasons why e-mails suddenly disappear.</span></strong><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Messages were manually deleted either due to accidental deletion or were moved or deleted due to your account filter settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Messages were deleted due to account compromise issues where a hacker might have gained access to your account and deleted the emails.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>You are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account.<br />
This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>The account was marked as “Inactive." Accounts become inactive if you don’t sign in via web browser at least once a year.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>If the feature Conversation Threading feature is turned on.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> If you use Sweep to schedule a cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>If you rename your</strong><strong> </strong><strong>account to @Outlook.com
</strong>a prompt would have asked you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account.</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong>Did you try to<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp; restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com?</a></strong>

    <title>Conditional formatting for currency in Excel for Mac 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richtr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional formatting for currency in Excel for Mac 2011</h2>
                    I am trying to apply conditional formatting so that the currency symbol in my spreadsheet changes automatically.
<div>I found some old tutorials on doing this kind of conditional formatting but it doesn't seem to work in Excel for Mac 2011. I am only allowed to change the color of the cell or the text and not apply a rule for currency.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It reads - "For Conditional Formatting you can set Font Style, Underline, Color, and Strikethrough"</div>
<div>Formatting a number is not an option and the tabs across the top of the pop-up boat are for Font, border, Fill only.</div>
<div>Any help is appreciated.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>Hello Pierre Dutoya,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting. Issue can be related with specific network. When you said “Microsoft 203 10 pc on XP3”, could you please provide more detailed description regarding this environment?
 Could you please provide a full screenshot of Office Product Information and its full version number for checking?
</p>
<p>About Outlook asking pass-code, please share a screenshot of that prompt with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b23c8e4-931c-49ef-a59d-b19168235980?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b23c8e4-931c-49ef-a59d-b19168235980?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, if convenient, you may change a different network to test it. Check your firewall and proxy settings (if any deployed) via this article:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges#exchange-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges#exchange-online</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also check Outlook updates via File-&gt;Office account-&gt;Update options-&gt;Update Now. And use SaRA tool to fix it:
<a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to switch to account online mode to see if issue follows: in Outlook-&gt;File-&gt;Account Settings-&gt;double-click one impacted account and untick the checkbox “Use Cached Exchange Mode”, then
 restart Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have no reason to update from office 2013 for our server and to pc above XP3 as i have a lot of other software who depend from XP3 and not proven to work on 7 or 10.</p>
<p>everything was working find until 10 days ago.</p>
<p>the problem is a random problem. yesterday outlook was working all day long until 5.25 pm when the request was " please enter you password. &nbsp; this morning outlook was not working , asking the password until 12.43 when suddenly the connection occur and update
 downloaded.</p>
<p>If it was a questions of updating the software, this will be simple.</p>
<p>But a lot of other users have he same problem with W7 an W10.</p>
<p>Why is alternatively working for couple hours and not working. I suspect an Offcice 365 connection problem , something have change in the Cloud Host ????</p>

<p>Hello Pierre Dutoya,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. Please be kindly noted that support for 2013 versions of Office 365 ProPlus and Office 365 Business clients ended on February 28, 2017, we suggest user upgrade to the 2016 version of
 Office 365 clients to get better customer experience: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3199744/support-for-the-2013-versions-of-office-365-proplus-ends-february-28-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3199744/support-for-the-2013-versions-of-office-365-proplus-ends-february-28-2</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your issue, since Password dialog prompting can be caused by different factors, if issue also exists in version 2016 on Windows 10 and Windows 7, to better know about your issue, may I know whether
 your organization environment is pure Office 365 online, is there any federation service deployed? Please run Office 365 SaRA tool to test this issue:
<a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/</a> , in SaRA, you may try “Outlook keeps asking for my password” and “Outlook keeps saying “Try to connect…” or “Disconnect””</p>

<h2>            Deleting a Contact</h2>
                    <p>Please can someone help with the ludicrous way in which contacts work with Microsoft whereby you cannot delete a contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an outlook.com account and also use Microsoft Outlook through Microsoft Home. I use both what is now outlook Mail (as was</p>
<p>&nbsp;outlook.com) and Microsoft Outlook to view my contacts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a contact name for myself which I tried to delete and then re added and now have myself as a contact with 14 additional links of myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I try to delete it just creates a new&nbsp;link. I even tried to create a new name for myself only for
 it to create yet another link. Why can you not delete a contract, it seems I have two levels of contact one for outlook and one for what was outlook.com what a total mess. I went into clean up contacts in outlook mail and it makes it even worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope someone out there can help.</p>

</p><p>I have myself, and now 4 other contacts which I had deleted and then set up again as new contacts but instead of just having the one contact, every few hours it comes up twice, showing as an additional linked contact. I them unlink the one without the contact
 photo and delete it. It then keeps reappearing as an additional link, I have now deleted the duplicates over 50 times only for them to keep reappearing. If I go to clean up contacts it is a total and utter shambles and mess so am leaving that mess well alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't you just delete a contact like in Google contacts which I fear I may have to do as this simply does not appear to be fit for purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Hi Reymichael</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good question, whilst I normally only use Internet Explorer my favourite browser by far, I have tried to sort in Edge which is a dreadful browser and Google Chrome and Firefox but all the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting in to contacts on outlook on the web is not any problem at all, it is the fact that there is no way to delete linked contacts. Whilst I do not do it now, if you go into Clean up contacts all this does is to create yet another link for the contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The major problem I think here is that there are 2 layers of contacts one being the old outlook.com contact which cannot have a contact photo and outlook contacts which do. I think there should only be 1 layer of&nbsp;contact and not 2 layers. I really hope that
 Microsoft sort out the contacts mess once and for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Good morning Reymichael</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your continued interest in the problem with contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through carefully this article and fully understand what it says but still the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give you an example of what the problem is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have a contact called Sue who shows up on Microsoft Home as part of Office 2016 with 2 entries one has a photo the other does not yet both have exactly the same information on each. Exactly the same information shows up on Outlook on the Web, my Tablet
 and on my Android Smartphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I look on Outlook on the Web it shows Sue with 2 links, I then unlink it and it then shows as 2 separate contacts for Sue one with a contact photo and the other not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I then delete the one without the photo which I do not want, and then sometimes after a few hours and other times a couple of days and it comes back again. I then delete it again and so it continues with the contact breeding like a rabbit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I have 7 current contacts with this problem where pretty much have to delete the duplicates on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you to understand a bit further my problem. Do I have to switch to Google Contacts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>I thought I would let you know that all the contacts I deleted again yesterday have all come back up again, so I have now deleted them all again. No doubt they will all reappear again. Is there seriously no way to delete contacts for good.</p>

<p>Good evening Reymichael</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I would try one more time to hope you can assist me with the outlook/outlook.com contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my last message to you, I have unlinked and deleted the contacts in question a further 6 times, but each time after some time they just reappear each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me as if it is the outlook.com contract which cannot be deleted and breeds like a rabbit, not the outlook contact but sadly there is no way of separating the two and being able to control them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest, who do I turn to for help, I do not want to be deleting contacts evbery day for the rest of my life it is so frustrating. When you first delete them, they delete but then after some hours just emerge again, with multiple links and it
 just keeps getting worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why oh why can you not delete contacts <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>permanently.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be so grateful for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

            <p>Don't know if it helps but I once and for all got the age old problem of contacts sorted. I was lucky enough to go through Microsoft Support&nbsp;and a lady there took control of my PC while I was watching and resolved the whole problem of contacts with Microsoft
 in less than a couple of minutes. Why oh why cannot they tell you this it is so simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Make sure you have an outlook pst file with all the contacts you want with all details there and exactly as you want it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Once you are happy you have this, go to Outlook and then delete all your contacts from your outlook.com e mail account.</p>
<p>3. Only once this has been done then go to outlook.com and select cleanup contacts, make sure no entries are unticked then go ahead and clean up contacts. You will see that all your contacts are gone. Then wait for 24 hours or so and go back to clean up
 contacts to see if it is still empty if not then clean up contacts again.</p>
<p>4. Finally copy across all the contacts you want from outlook pst and you will then find you have a totally clean set of contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this may help you and others, it is pathetic that Microsoft cannot publish this simple solution to all. On the other hand why cannot someone at Microsoft sort out contacts so you either create, edit or delete end of story. Over the years I have spent
 hours on this subject reading hundreds of fed up customers with a myriad of problems over contacts. I think Microsoft need to grow up and support their customers rather than looking for every opportunity to cream money off everyone.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            OneNote Mobile line&#47;character limit &#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.... </p>
<p>[First of all, OneNote rocks and is better (in many but not all ways) than Evernote.]</p>
<p>I'm using OneNote Mobile build 14.0.5421.3000 on Android 2.3.3.</p>
<p>I have a PC-based folder with 359 lines of text BUT&nbsp;on the mobile it ends at 148 lines, 8,845 characters (including space).</p>
<p>Is there a limit set ? How to get around this ?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Paul.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Elemantal. I can repro problem easily. I added a new page in a different section in the same notebook and had same character truncation (8900 chars). FWIW, in the page i mentionned before, there was some font formatting (bold, underline,
 color) and in this new page, there was no such formatting (in other words, formatting doesn't matter).</p>
<p>This tells me it is neither a phone, notebook, nor section&nbsp;issue.... and indeed must be an articifical character limit --- either by design or by bug.</p>
<p>Hmmm.... this is annoying. </p>
<p>Can MSFT chime in - Known bug ? Build issue ? Workaround ?</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you try upgrading to the most recent build? Does this still happen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this page have multiple boxes of text, or just one? Since OneNote on Android only shows text in one block, it's possible that it jumbled up some of your notes if they exist in multiple boxes in OneNote 2010. So, different boxes may appear out of order
 and there might be less whitespace. Are you sure you're missing content, or might it just be in the wrong place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the content is missing, does it crop at the end of a paragraph, or can it happen mid sentence?</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thanks Daniel. I assume generic Android builds are ok so if I were to ask Samsung, it about their customizations, it would be something they couldn't answer.</p>

<h2>            How can I catalogue emails into a timeline without using Journaling&#63;</h2>
                    I know the Journaling feature would probably work for this, but I am wanting to create a timeline record of the amount of time spent on Help Desk support emails that come into our Help Desk email account. I have been setup on Exchange to have full access
 permissions on the Help Desk inbox. Are there any solutions out there that will catalogue past and present emails into a readable chart or timeline?
