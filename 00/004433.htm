<h2>            Picture Styles Greyed Out</h2>
                    Why does the picture styles and filters options work on some photos in my presentation and not others? &nbsp;I have about 180 photos and on many of them, the picture styles and filters options are greyed out.

            Don't waste your time trying to get Skyfire to work...go ahead and uninstall it now....the developer of that software abandoned windows mobile a long time ago and the software hasn't worked for a long time.

<h2>            MS Office documents showing &#34;invisible&#34; fonts when opened in MS Office 2011 on Mac OSX 10.7.1 &#40;Lion&#41;.</h2>
                    I am having what is referred to as the "invisible font" problem. When I open an MS Word or Excel document, the text appears to be non-existent. Powerpoint presentations are about 1/2 and 1/2. I have yet to be able to open a single MS Office document in
 the 3 months I've had this new laptop, except for ones I created new in Office 2011. Details are below.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The "invisible font" problem is described here:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"<span>Upgrade from an older version of MS Office (at least V.x, 2004) and documents opened in MS Office 2011 may appear to be blank or empty.</span>" (See:&nbsp;http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110810001909244).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The solutions to the problem are listed as follows via the link above, but none of these solutions have solved this problem on my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"<span>Sometimes closing (not quitting the application) and re-opening the document allows you to see the content. The crux of the problem seems to be a problem with multiple copies of fonts.&nbsp;</span></div>
<br />
<span>Summary:</span>
<span>Summary:</span>
<ul>
<li>Use Font Book to resolve duplicate fonts.</li><li>Manually remove the older versions of duplicated font files from&nbsp;<em>~/Library/Fonts</em>.</li><li>Restart the Mac.<span>"</span></li></ul>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I purchased a MacBook Pro from Apple early in July of this year. I purchased a new copy, licensed, of MS Office 2011 and installed it on my new MacBook Pro. My MacBook Pro runs OSX 10.7.1 (Lion). Previously, my laptop was a 2007 MacBook. I am still able
 to open the documents on that laptop. It doesn't appear to be a data transfer/file corruption problem. It appears to be either an MS Office or Lion compatibility issue. I have even highlighted the entire document ("apple/butterfly key + A") to see if I can
 change the font color to "black", but the document isn't even reading / "seeing" that the font is there. The fonts used in the documents are standard ones that are available in office, such as Ariel, Tahoma, Times or Times New Roman, and Cambria. The documents
 range in size from 40 pages to 400 pages, but size doesn't seem to be the issue. The "invisible" font problem occurs on all MS Office documents, except ones that I create new in this version of MS Office 2011.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it matters, I did not migrate my applications when I migrated my data from my old laptop to my new laptop. I installed MS Office 2011 fresh; I did not install it over a previous version of MS Office. The problem applies equally to documents that are
 *.doc or *.docx. My 2007 MacBook laptop runs MS Office 2008.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone else had this problem, and &nbsp;how did you solve it? This problem is preventing me from completely switching over to my new laptop, which I would like to do ASAP.</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            What finally worked was to restore the Standard Fonts. I took several steps to get there, though, so in case they are all required I'll include them here.
<div><br />
<div>I followed each of these suggestions:</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-10389716-263.html?tag=mncol;title</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<li>
<p>
Run validations with Font Book</p>
<p>
Launch Font Book and press command-A to select all fonts. Then from the "File" menu select "Validate Fonts" and wait for the results in the font validation window. Keep in mind that even though you may find minor problems with your current fonts, its best to
 follow the saying "if it's not broken then don't fix it", and leave well-enough alone unless you're experiencing problems.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Clear the font cache</p>
<p>
In OS X, fonts are handled by the Apple Type Server process, which stores commonly used fonts in a cache for quick access. If there is corruption in this cache then you may experience a variety of troubles. To clear the cache, in pre-Leopard versions of OS
 X go to the /Macintosh HD/Library/Caches/ folder and remove the "com.apple.ATS" file. After doing this, restart the system.</p>
<p>
For OS X 10.5 and later, you cannot easily access the user and global font caches, but you can use Apple's "atsutil" terminal command to manage the ATS process. Open "Terminal" and enter the following commands to clear the user (or global) databases and restart
 the server:</p>
<p>
atsutil databases -removeUser<br />
atsutil server -shutdown<br />
atsutil server -ping</p>
<p>
<i>NOTE:
 Use "sudo atsutil databases -remove" instead of the first command to remove the database for all users.</i></p>
</li><li>
<p>
Avoid older font formats</p>
<p>
If you can, avoid ".dfont" and "Type 1 PostScript" fonts. This suggestion may depend on the requirements for various programs, but if you have an older font suite that you are thinking about installing, it may run into problems with newer programs so you might
 consider getting an updated version of the suite before installing. Granted you can always try, but there is the potential that older font formats can cause problems so we recommend you stick to the more modern ".ttf" and ".ttc" fonts.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Manually clear out duplicates</p>
<p>
Font Book has an option to "Resolve Duplicates" (available in the "Edit" menu), but this is limited in functionality and may not remove the specific font duplicate which you desire to remove. As such, the best approach to managing duplicate fonts is to do it
 manually (tedious, but effective if done correctly). In Font Book, you can use the "Show Font info" option (command-I) to see information about a selected font, and especially where the font is located on your system. Doing this for your duplicate fonts will
 allow you to select which one to remove, either by removing it from its font folder, or by right-clicking it and selecting "Disable".</p>
<span><span><br />
That still didn't appear to solve the problem. It improved it -- some fonts still rendered -- but others did not.</span></span></li></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I
 then went into FontBook and restored the Standard Fonts:</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Click
 "File" ==&gt; "Restore Standard Fonts".&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div>This displayed a note saying that all non-Standard Fonts would be placed in a folder called, "Disabled Fonts". The system places several fonts in there.
 I then moved that entire folder to trash. I restarted my Mac, and opened the problematic documents. All fonts are displaying just fine now. I am SO pleased.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you very much for your help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am seeing the Mac Forums that there are font issues with Lion, most related to Safari, some related to MS Office. I did not have Safari font problems,
 on MS Office font problems.</div>

            <p>That's a Message I have never run into.&nbsp;And I must admit I am a Font Hound. Probably one reason that Office 2016 takes so&nbsp;long to open up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you by any chance, using a Font Program other than Font Book to control your fonts? Some of those Font regulating programs and can cause issues with Excel (or any Office applications).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following &nbsp;see if helps. You can probably use a Font Utility like "Font Nuke" to clean Font Caches. But you can try quitting all applications and restarting the&nbsp;computer in Safe-Mode (Shift - S).&nbsp;After typing your&nbsp;password to finish (the&nbsp;password
 you use to install software) rebuilding and cleaning up, restart normally then try Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work then use "Font Book" to find and remove duplicate or defective fonts. Go to this site for Directions. Look for topic
<a href="http://www.phillipjones-cet.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FontBook Mountain&nbsp;Lion and Above</a>, follow directions.

            <p>There is a limit to the number of fonts that can exist within a given workbook. But that message shouldn't be triggered by entering a formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start troubleshooting by figuring out exactly which version of Excel you have. Go to the Excel menu and choose About Excel, and then reply with the version number. Also, knowing the version of Mac OS could be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm big on trying easy troubleshooting steps first. Restart your Mac and see if the problem goes away.</p>

<h2>            When I try to upload pictures to the Internet &#40;IE10&#41;, can&#39;t find pictures in &#34;My Pictures&#34; folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I have upgraded IE9 to IE10, now I can't upload photos to eBay.com and to&nbsp;some other places anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I try to find the photos stored on my computer (using IE10 &amp; eBay interface)&nbsp;that&nbsp;I want to upload to the&nbsp;Internet (eBay), the folder "My
 Pictures"&nbsp;is&nbsp;all blank. There's nothing to choose from, though the files (pictures)&nbsp;are all really there.&nbsp; When I try same procedure with Google Chrome, uploading of pictures to eBay and other places&nbsp;works fine. As a test I have also&nbsp;"run IE10 as a administrator",
 in this case I can access photos in "My Pictures" folder again.&nbsp;But this way is unpractical, as it requires&nbsp;administrator validation every time IE10 is run again. I have also upgraded Adobe Flash Player and Java to latest versions! Must be some solution for
 IE10&nbsp;besides "switching" browsers and "run IE10 as administrator?" Someone tell me, please, what shall I do? To go back to IE9 (restore poiint), reinstal IE10 or to do&nbsp;something else? Thank you!</p>

                    <p>I would like an app for all my Windows devices that displays the area code location when my phone rings.</p>
<p>As an abundance of caution I never answer the phone unless I know the name or number. Many times after the phone stops ringing I will look up the area code before deciding whether to ring back. Having the location displayed on my screen at the time of the
 call would help along with a caution symbol if the area code plus the rest of the number comes from known spam sites.</p>

            Hi Morse
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to delete your Skype account without also closing your Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />The best thing you can do is no longer sign into that account and use the available options of transferring your contacts and credits to the new account. 
<br />
<br />If you wish to continue:
<br />
<br />Before you close your Microsoft account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important relating to Skype behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to Skype.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />    Follow the steps in this article to verify that: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>
<br />
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.
<br />        Your Skype Credit balance has been used. Once your account is closed, you can't get it back. 
<br />        Active subscriptions have been cancelled so you donít continue to get charged. If you have Auto-recharge enabled and cancel your account without first cancelling your subscription, you will continue to be charged until your account has been permanently closed in 60 days. Learn how to disable Auto-recharge.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633</a>
<br />
<br />You can close your Microsoft account by following these steps:
<br />
<br />    Go to our Microsoft account closure page (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a>). You may be prompted to sign in or verify your password.
<br />    Make sure you are signed in to the Microsoft account you want to close and select Next. 
<br />    In the Select a reason drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account. 
<br />    Select Mark account for closure.
<br />    Your Microsoft account will be closed in 60 days. We wait 60 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone. You can change your mind any time during the 60 days, just sign in (<a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>) to cancel the closure. 
<br />
<br />Here steps for doing both:
<br />
<br />Transfer contacts:

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>I have a problem and your answer above helped me somewhat - thank you for taking the time to answer comprehensively. Much appreciated. Can I get your help, specifically with a similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have two Skype accounts (sign ins). One is free and one is costing us money. The one that costs us money is taking funds out yearly. We want to stop this. We don't need this anymore. I now can't close that account, as we still want everything else on
 our Microsoft account and you have explained above why I couldn't just close one of my Skype accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do. How do I stop the funds coming out if i can't shut this account down as it takes the funds from my Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your time.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Re-reading your question, I'm afraid I misunderstood it.</p>
<p>Maybe what you want is the following. A task is planned say July 12 to 16. The resource responsible tells you he started working on it July 15, and worked on till July 22 included. You enter Actual Work in the Usage views as reported.</p>
<p>I know most people will find this unbelievable, but I met with users who in this case still wanted Project to show July 12 and 16 as start and finish dates! "Don't confuse me with facts"! Well, if that is what you want, forget it. Reality beats the plan,
 Project will show July 15 and 22 as Start and Finish dates.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can "record" the planned dates by saving (setting) a baseline, and that one will not change and thus keep the dates originally planned.</p>
<p>Hoep this helps,</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Entering Actual Work does not change Start date.</p>
<p>Best way is to enter Actual Work data in a Usage View (Task Usage or Resource Usage)</p>
<p>You can show an Actual Work row by right-clicking in the right part or the view, check Actual Work.</p>

<h3> arthur le feuvre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded and installed the latest version of Skype after experiencing issues with my old version. When I installed and opened the new version, nothing was recognisable, there were no contacts and all of my old contact list had gone and I'm damned
 if I could find any of them.</p>
<p>What I have now is unusable - no contacts, just blurb telling me how good it will all be!</p>
<p>I have signed out/signed in etc, but no difference.</p>
<p>How do I get back my contacts list from the old version.&nbsp; I DO NOT want all my Facebook contacts - just the relatively short Skype list.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Microsoft is trying to be too clever by half - inflicting what they think is a better system and needlessly interconnecting everything when customers my not want it.</p>
<p>Please tell me how to get back my old list!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this stage all I can see is an option is to scrap Facebook and Skype and use other less complex offerings that are not so intrusive.</p>

<p>Hello Elaine, thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I have worked out what I did that resulted in this mess.</p>
<p>My old version of Skype, for some reason, decided not to work (no connection or similar).&nbsp; I tried a number of times to reconnect, all to no avail,&nbsp; I was constantly pointed to upgrade.&nbsp; So, in the end, I uninstalled the old version (that's where the contacts
 went I think) and downloaded this version.</p>
<p>For reasons that escape me, the new version "recognised" me, so I didn't have to sign in or anything.&nbsp; The major problem I have is with the look/feel.&nbsp; None of the options/task bars are the same, so I'll have to work out how to share screens etc.</p>
<p>I don't use Skype much, mostly for a limited number of consultancy businesses, so mostly I used it to show overseas clients how certain types of Australian landscapes looked etc.</p>
<p>My beef with a lot of software these days is it tries to do a lot more than I ask it to and sometimes gives me no options.</p>
<p>I'll work my way back into it again when although I'll have to get a guinea pig client to try things with.</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts - they are appreciated.</p>
<p>BTW, so far, nothing has asked me to sign in - I suspect when I upgraded to Windows 365 and had a bunch of sign ins, I am now automatically recognised on startup&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to you and others for replies.&nbsp; Art</p>

    <title>EOP Using Reply-To to validate sender address - Unable to add to Safe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            EOP Using Reply-To to validate sender address - Unable to add to Safe Sender List</h2>
                    
<p>EOP uses both the Sender Address and the Reply-To fields when checking to see if something is in a users Safe Sender list.&nbsp; We are seeing problems where certain mail systems will add a unique thumbprint to the address in the Reply-To field.&nbsp; Example:</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
prvs=9269898a4=*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>As the Reply-To field changes with each email received it is useless to add it to the safe sender list.&nbsp; Has anyone come up with a resolution that does not require adding the domain?&nbsp; In some cases adding the domain to the Spam Filter would be a large security
 risk and would open up a window for bulk mailers.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>An email safe sender list, or safe list for short, is a list of contacts who are considered safe senders and whose messages therefore do not need to be spam filtered by the service.</p>
<p>To better understand your requirement, I’d like to collect the information:<br />
1. What do you mean about “We are seeing problems where certain mail systems will add a unique thumbprint to the address in the Reply-To field”? Please send us a related mail header via private message.
<br />
To get the message header in OWA&nbsp;(<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>). please click “View message deatils” then copy and send the header to us via private message.</p>
<p>2. I have sent you a private message to collect the message header. Please click the link below to access it:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Poppy</p>

                    Will the Band 2 use a Mio based optical HRM? From various reviews Mio seems to be one of the only accurate optical HRMs when exercising. I've been holding out for a device exactly like the Band 2 assuming it's within 5% of actual heart rate. &nbsp;Otherwise
 Fenix 4 for me.... whenever that happens.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>To download and/or open PDF attachments, you can access Outlook on Microsoft Edge. Before you do so, make sure that you cleared the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10607/windows-10-view-delete-browser-history-microsoft-edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
cache and cookies of Edge</a> first. If it doesn't work, try downloading PDF Viewer.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought Microsoft Edge was only available on Windows 10 which I'm reluctant to change to as I hear of so many problems. I have tried opening Outlook.com in Firefox, Outlook and Chrome but I still can't view or download pdf attachments. I can save it to
 OneDrive but that's a long way round just to view it. I do have the latest Adobe pdf reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open the attachments on my iPad and phone so why not on a pc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other way is to open them offline on the Outlook app on the pc which syncs but again, I shouldn't need to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts? Many thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keith</p>

<p>Thanks John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought Microsoft Edge was only available on Windows 10 which I'm reluctant to change to as I hear of so many problems. I have tried opening Outlook.com in Firefox, Outlook and Chrome but I still can't view or download pdf attachments. I can save it to
 OneDrive but that's a long way round just to view it. I do have the latest Adobe pdf reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open the attachments on my iPad and phone so why not on a pc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other way is to open them offline on the Outlook app on the pc which syncs but again, I shouldn't need to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts? Many thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keith</p>

<p>I have a similar issue that seems to have started around the same time that Outlook.com was changed about 7-10 days ago.&nbsp; When I receive an email with a pdf attachment I get the following response
<em>HTTP 404 error That’s odd... Microsoft Edge can’t find this page.&nbsp; </em>I have Windows 10.</p>

            Also happening to me since more than month ago. Windows 7 and all Browsers!. Tried all "solutions", nothing, But then noticed it is only happending for MY Outlook email!!! My son's Outlook email works fine opening attachments etc on the SAME computer if
 this helps.... So I am convinced 100% it is profile related and not computer related. Hello Microsoft can you hear us all??? Is perhaps your servers capacity limited and you want us to go to GMail :)?

            <p>&nbsp;Geoff, I get the same error string when trying to print or download a PDF attachment. &nbsp; However,the curious thing is that I can open and print a PDF attachment if I use my iPad or android phone as I have them synced to my Outlook account. I can also do
 the same if I use the laptop based version of Outlook 2016 as provided when you sign up to Office 365 so it cannot be my profile nor is it an Adobe problem so it is something to do with the set up between the updated online version of Outlook and PC. Microsoft
 don't seem to be able to solve this so my alternative is to continue to use an Apple iPad or seek an alternative UK based mail and cloud storage package. At least I know they are reliable and have good online help desks. What does everyone else think? I just
 wish I could get someone from Microsoft to read about our problem and give an answer.</p>

<p>Hi Jason</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to submit my Sway report to my manager and couldn't wait any longer for a reply so I removed the image and re-uploaded it which resolved the issue. It does make me a little concerned that my Sway report may not be very stable, but I will keep checking
 in on it and let you know if the issue happens again.</p>

<p>I'm glad you got it working!&nbsp; I don't believe this was an issue with Sway, rather with how the image got cached by your browser.&nbsp; Removing and re-adding it would cause the image to have a new URL and thus, get cached differently.&nbsp; If it happens again, try
 clearing your browser cache and reloading the Sway.</p>

 The text changes all the time but the email address remains the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use outlook to collect two email accounts - one is POP3 mailbox in Australia (where I used to live).&nbsp; The other is IMAP account with PlusNet (which doesn't get much spam.)</p>

            Accounts in Outlook 2013/2016 each have their own junk mail settings. Open a message and open the Junk mail options on the message. This will show the settings for the selected account.  
<br />
<br />What are your default junk mail settings? 
<br />If you trust addresses in your contacts,  do you have a contact for yourself? If so, remove it - if a spammer spoofs the From address to be your own, it will be trusted.

                    <p>I use the Follow Up flags a lot to track my tasks. I think I've discovered in error in the way Outlook sets reminders on the "Next Week" flag. According to the documentation, it's supposed to set it for "Start time of the first work day of next week" (i.e.
 Monday morning).&nbsp; Instead, it's setting the reminder for the start time of the last work day of the week (i.e. Friday morning).&nbsp; Is anyone else seeing this error?&nbsp;&nbsp;Any idea if MS is aware of it?</p>

            It looks like a bug to me - if you configure outlook to set reminders by default on tasks with due dates, the reminder is set for the due date. If you disable that option and right click on the flag to choose Add reminder, the reminder is for the Start
 date. (I have a question in to the product group about it.)

<h2>            Can No Longer Send or Receive Emails Through Outlook.com After Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Looks like people have had similar issues recently, but I haven't seen an answer yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recent upgrade to Outlook.com, I stopped receiving emails through the service. I can't send, either...the messages just sit in my 'Drafts' folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that this is occurring with a GoDaddy POP account, which I've had as a connected account through Outlook.com for several years. I have another connected POP account through a different provider that seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade, the GoDaddy-based connected account kept showing an 'Update in Progress' message when I went in to check the settings. I deleted the account and started over, but when trying to add as a POP account again, I got this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'The POP server doesn't support features needed to download email'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this is ultimately a GoDaddy issue, but everything worked fine before the Outlook.com upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>I have a similar issue (topic at top of this page) where sent emails get stuck in the drafts folder. In my case it seems related to a 3rd party email-account set up to sent and receive in Outlook. Sending emails from that account does not work, though receiving
 email sent to that account does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you can try cleaning out your account and setting it up again to see if it solves anything, it is what I will try with my issue.</p>

</p><p>I did try removing the account and setting it up again. However, once I go to submit my final settings, I get the "...POP server doesn't support features..." message and can't complete the setup. And this is using the exact same server settings that were
 working prior to the upgrade.</p>

            <p>Looks like we'll have to wait months longer for GoDaddy POP accounts to work and it's not GoDaddy's fault even if Microsoft says it's both parties fault..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I have confirmed that everyone else in the world can work with the GoDaddy POP based email servers except the Outlook.com team. &nbsp;Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook Desktop 2010, the Old Outlook (Live, Hotmail), and even a simple VB6 app I pulled down from
 Plant Source Code I think it as I compiled up in a few minutes and was downloading my messages.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the update and bad news for everyone as of 10/14/2016 who get the error message when trying to add a connected account in Outlook.com that reads "The POP server doesn't support features needed to download email". &nbsp;Also for users who their accounts
 just never update because you added a connected account and Outlook.com configured it as an IMAP account instead of a POP one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is from the Microsoft Global Escalation Services support tech I've been working with for months.<br />

 We are currently in work to implement the fix and there is no ETA for same.</span></p>
<p>
<p>
 you have any other questions or concerns.</span></p>
<p>
<p>
 Your feedback will help us improve the Microsoft Support experience. Thank you.</span></p>
<p>
<p>
</p><p>Now even worse is that they are archiving the service request even though it is not resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What he told me over the phone is that it's both a problem on GoDaddy's end and on Microsoft's. &nbsp;They are saying that GoDaddy does not support the full POP RFC Specifications so they are working to implement a workaround. &nbsp;But once it is implemented it gets
 pushed out in multiple "Forests" so my guess is 6 months after the first implementation all users might get it by how long it has taken to migrate all the existing users over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how come everyone else including Microsoft's own Desktop Outlook 2010 can do it? &nbsp;Because I'll be honest here in that the Outlook.com team is horrible to say the least. &nbsp;With the number of bugs I've come across and them not being able to resolves something
 the rest of the world and Microsoft themselves has been able to do for decades proves how incompetent this team is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For them to blame even part of it on GoDaddy is ridiculous. &nbsp;For Microsoft's Outlook.com lead programmer to not contact GoDaddy with the specifications of what they need supported to make Microsoft's (and only Microsoft's) products work with it goes to show
 how little they actually care about their Outlook.com product. &nbsp;Let alone all of the other email systems it is also not working with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way to keep long term users on your ecosystem. &nbsp;How I wish I was programming for Apple users instead of Windows users these days.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook View--&#62;Columns   is grayed out on Mac 2016 Version</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there a reason why in&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Outlook View--&gt;Columns </strong>&nbsp; is grayed out on Mac 2016 Version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to be able to change the font size of the Conversation column just like you can change the font size in the messages column.</p>

</p><p>I am confused. &nbsp;What does "not feasible" mean? &nbsp;Does it mean that OS X is incapable of having different size fonts for different windows? &nbsp;I know that is not true, so &nbsp;does it mean that MSFT chooses not to do this?</p>

</p><p>Hi Robert,</p>

</p><p>Sorry, but you have not answered my question directly Robert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is black and white Robert. &nbsp;<span>“Does it mean that OS X is incapable of having different size fonts for different windows?” &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Is your answer, "Dave, Microsoft's API's allow for different fonts in different windows, whereas Apple's API's do not have this capability", OK, then that is a direct answer. &nbsp;But, when you ask me to request
 that feature then you are NOT saying that Apple has a limitation here, but rather MSFT has decided NOT to implement this feature for their Mac version that they do have their PC version.</p>

</p><p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your honest answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought these days were over with not being able to get a straight and honest answer from MSFT with their new move to open source, but these answers from MSFT prove I am wrong with that assumption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MSFT would simply just answer the question in an honest fashion and not play these word games, it would raise their reputation in the industry and save the people time as well as they would have our respect. Instead, they reply in a timely fashion, yet
 with vague answers, obviously hoping to wear out the person like me who is asking questions.</p>

<h3> celticknot56  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2016 software closes after opening... &#40;Word and Excel&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Last week my MSOffice worked fine. Yesterday when I tried opening Word and/or Excel, they immediately closed upon opening. After opening, I receive the error message stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're sorry, but Word has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Word will need to be closed as a result. Would you like us to repair now?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter which option I choose, the program shuts itself down. It has the same message on Excel when attempting to open it as well. I am on a Win10 system. Any ideas or known fixes? I'm desperate! I use both for work and school and need to fix it ASAP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This can be an issue with the Office application itself. To further identify the root cause of this issue, we need to perform some troubleshooting steps. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check if there is an available update for your Office. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Open any Office 2016 app, such as Word, and create a new document.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt;<strong> Account</strong> (or Office Account if you opened Outlook 2016).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Under <strong>Product Information</strong>, choose <strong>Update Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update Now.</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Close the <strong>"You're up to date!"</strong> window after Office is done checking for and installing updates.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
</p><p>2. Repair Office to refresh the application. Here's the <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for detailed steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please check if you will encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of the suggested steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
