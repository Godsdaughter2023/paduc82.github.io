<h2>            Cannot un-highlight some text in my document</h2>
                    
<p><span>I inherited a document that had some text highlight in yellow. This text happens to be in a table. I can select the text and change the color the highlight – that works,
 it will change to any color, but when I try to change the highlight to “none” it goes back to yellow. Ideas what might be wrong with this document? I can turn highlighting on/off in other areas of the document.

            Maybe what you think is highlighting is really background shading. When you apply other colors of highlighting, it just hides the background which is still there.<br />
<br />
Try selecting the text in question and going to Format &gt; Borders &amp; Shading &gt; Shading. Click the No Fill box above the color patches, and click OK.<br />

<h2>            OneNote for iPad - Section Tabs</h2>
                    <p>Does the most recent update of OneNote for iPad (16th May 2017) force users to use the section tabs on the left side of the screen? I was able to opt out of this feature following an update last year but now I can't seem to find the settings in the Accounts
 tab.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Yoga, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the infomation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use OneNote on a tablet and find the notebook, tabs and notes on the left reduce the available screen size without using the full screen option which then means I loose sight of my other tabs and notes. It's only a minor thing but I was happier with tabs
 on the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find OneNote an excellent tool and will continue to use it daily. I understand the reasoning regarding the changes it's just that this part of the update is not my preferred option or indeed now is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi Alfie,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Blocked senders</strong> are one of the usual reasons why you cannot receive an email from someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate what's causing it, we'll be needing additional information: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What error message did you/they receive?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of it?</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li><li>Are those senders able to send you emails before?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest checking this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-didn-t-receive-an-email-someone-sent-to-my-Outlook-com-account-d39e3341-8d79-4bf1-b3c7-ded602233642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>

            Did you update Office 2013 to Office 2016 or just install the free OneNote 2016? because in Onenote 2016 that comes with Office 2016 that feature is still there. OneNote 2016 free version instead does not offer any interoperability with other MS Office

            <p>It was the free version. But i figured out a work-around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem was that when I clicked the option to forward an email to OneNote, Outlook said I had to start OneNote for the first time. I was using OneNote all the time, but not the version Outlook recognized. My work around was to start OneNote 2010, which
 is part of the Office suite that my company uses. Once I did that one time, Outlook is sending the emails with one click, and they are showing up in the 2016 version. Voila!</p>

            <p>Hi Writchey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exclusion section in Settings is to prevent an overreaction by MSE to files that are confirmed to be "false positives" so it isn't necessary to constantly&nbsp;restore such&nbsp;things from quarantine.&nbsp; In truth, these are very rare.&nbsp; It should NOT be used as
 a method to decrease scanning time.&nbsp; Doing so defeats the whole purpose of MSE and the security it provides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only two things that can safely be excluded are in Settings / Advanced and are Archived files and Removable drives.&nbsp; Anything else is risky -&nbsp;and&nbsp;I personally&nbsp;have both checked anyway.&nbsp; Nothing else is truly safe to&nbsp;exclude.&nbsp; And there's no&nbsp;need to worry
 about disk wear - plenty of things occur that keep the disk busy besides just this - this is simply another task being performed.&nbsp; The proper approach is to determine the cause of the performance problem and address that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, if you are running Full Scans every time,&nbsp; perhaps you should consider a different mix with Quick Scans instead - which will occur much faster and cover most of where you are likely to be infected (running full scans maybe every few weeks or monthly
 or so and mostly doing the Quick Scans instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, in Scheduled scans there is an option to select the maximum CPU usage that MSE will use during scans.&nbsp; The lower the number, the less it will use and the more that will be available for other things (and vice-versa); however, the downside is that
 the less you use the longer they will take - so it's a tradeoff.&nbsp; I run scans while I'm working and find that a setting of 20% works for me without any noticeable slowdown in my system (as long as I'm reasonable and don't try to open 30 IE Windows at the same
 time or something similar).&nbsp; Yours may differ.&nbsp; I'd move in 10% steps until you find the best number for you.&nbsp; But this alone isn't going to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, let's see if we can improve the system's performance (and space) which will both help decrease the slowdown and reduce the time needed to scan (by removing as much extra stuff as possible so the amount that needs to be scan is reduced).&nbsp; This is similar
 to what you want to do, but instead of excluding files that may be risky, it will remove files that don't need to be on your system at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*********************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed in Vista or Windows 7 systems – and some can apply to XP as well but the reference articles and procedures will be different but you should be able to either figure out how to do what is suggested on XP
 or search Bing for an article which addresses that topic for XP or an equivalent program that works with XP (and it also suggests other things of value that you can consider or ignore - the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually -
 I'm just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do procrastinate I'm sad to admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse to
 delete my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over the limited amount of space recovered and speed gained given their small size)). Much of this should be part of normal maintenance,
 but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points - probably at least weekly as they don't necessarily improve speed, space or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases) not addressed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system. There are ways to handle this (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course
 the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at
 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB, more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more). If space
 is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive. Those are hardware answers (which cost money). We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely
 free - at least the options presented here - there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to download
 and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause). Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install
 to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise). Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
To improve your speed and space, do Disk Cleanup using: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a><span> in Vista or </span>
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disk Cleanup - Open and Use - Windows 7 Forums</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will
 harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files. If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then
 that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</a><span> in Vista or
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Optimize-Windows-7-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Optimize Windows 7 for better performance</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Do all of the options (or at the very least, consider
 them - many can help a great deal).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a> with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<strong><span>careful</span></strong> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Uncheck anything in the Registry section and in the Application Section, uncheck Microsoft Antimalware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all. This will. I recommend running it every month or two. It is TFC by Old
 Timer </span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop. When run,
 it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs. If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced. It's a trade-off. The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain -but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to
 save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them). Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html</a><span> in Vista or

<p><br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears. Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup. That will probably be the majority of items there - if
 not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient). This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup). When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary,
 I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster. Better still, download Autoruns
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you
<strong><span>can’t</span></strong> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which
<strong><span>MUST</span></strong> not be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system). If unsure, leave it alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources). Windows Defender is a good AS program. The free Microsoft Security Essentials
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well. If you're using MSE, you don't really
 need Defender and MSE will deactivate it when installed (but you would with many other AV programs - though some of them also deactivate Defender). I would also suggest downloading
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a> and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, and you've done all of the above and still have issues, then we'll look deeper into the problem but the answer is not to exclude files from being scanned but to find out why the system performance is being so noticeably affected
 and focus on correcting that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            Greetings miahw!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!<br />
<br />
Which way are you using to view your GMail, through Outlook (or another e-mail client), or by browser interface?&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using a browser, it sounds as if the initial problem might be a configuration issue that is still pointing you traffic to a proxy server.&nbsp;
 I am also presuming that you are intending on using your data plan to get your e-mail, and not your WiFi...<br />
<br />
Don't know if this will help, but go to&nbsp;<strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, under your Data Plan (mine says MEdia Net), click on the option Set Up my Proxy Server.&nbsp; Make sure the box next to "this network connects to the internet" is
<strong>checked</strong>, and that the box next to "This network uses a proxy..." is
<strong>unchecked</strong>.<br />
<br />
If you are using Outlook Mobile, you'll need to advise us so we can rethink the issue...

    <title>Hiding blank fields in Catalog Merge - Publisher 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mshak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hiding blank fields in Catalog Merge - Publisher 2010</h2>
                    <p>Some of my records do not have data in certain fields (ie. middle name, address line 2, etc.). I am trying to hide blank fields in a catalog merge in Publisher 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some searching and other users suggest looking for the option to not print lines that contain empty fields in the printer properties. In Publisher 2010, there is no such thing as "Printer Properties." When I click on the Print menu, the only choices
 I get are for page size, etc. but there is no checkbox to not print lines that contain empty fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to merge my catalog into a new document so I can edit individual records rather than printing it to a PDF document directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

                    <p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>Hello -&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to transfer my One Note files from my University account to my personal account because once I graduate they will delete and close everything.&nbsp; I have so many files that taking the time to export them as a pdf will take days (and it
 also won't export well since the pages are wider than standard letter size which would take even longer to reformat every page).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw on a recent forum here the suggestion below, but I do not understand how to open multiple One Drive accounts on One Note on Mac... is this possible? If not, what do I do?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hi Sbeu,</em>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Regarding you don't want to share notebooks, the only way we can migrate notebooks from one account to another on OneNote for Mac is to copy section by section from notebook stored in your OneDrive for Business to another one on your personal

<p>Hi Marisa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OneNote for Mac, try the followings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Add your personal OneDrive account to OneNote:</p>
<p>Click File menu&gt;New Notebook&gt;click<span style="font-weight: bold"> Open</span> &gt;
OneDrive </span>and then sign in your personal OneDrive account and password.</p>
<p>After your personal OneDrive opens, select the notebook you need and open it. You can also create a new notebook and save it to your personal OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.If the notebooks in your university account haven't been opened in OneNote, you can add your university account to OneNote with the same steps above. I suppose you may need to choose<span style="font-weight: bold">
 OneDrive for business</span> for your university account in <span style="font-weight: bold">
+Add a Place</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.When the 2 OneDrive account are added to OneNote, try the followings:</p>
<p>In your university notebook, select a section and right click on it, choose
</p>
<p>Copy section by section from notebook stored in your university account to one notebook stored in your personal OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

 each one and "refresh", which is a pain with lots of charts.

    <title>Nokia Lumia 1020 Camera App no longer works - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 1020 Camera App no longer works</h2>
                    From one day to the next, my Lumia camera app does not work. When I try to use the camera either from the side button or tapping the app on the menu, it says it is loading and then just sends me back to the home screen. I have been able to coax a picture
 or two out of it by holding the volume button and start button to turn it on but then it goes back to not opening the app. Love my camera and phone but this is very frustrating.

    <title>Import Yammer data to another network - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Import Yammer data to another network</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>We'd like to merge our two networks as we have two domains verified in our Office 365 subscription and we'd like to have a single collaboration platform for all our employees. We've found out that we won't be able to access our second network and its content
 after merge.</p>
<p>Because of that we'd like to:</p>
<p>First, export data ("Yammer Data Export packages and exports all messages, notes, files, topics, users, and groups. Data is be exported into a .zip file containing .csv files for messages and additional archives containing files and pages." - source:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Monitoring-your-Yammer-data-Yammer-admin-guide-8c4651fa-12c2-4ced-b4ea-2200c0a630ed?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Secondly, import the exported data into our first network.</p>
<p>Could you please tell me:</p>
<p>1. Is it feasible to import that .zip file containing .csv files for messages and additional archives containing files and pages to our first network?</p>
<p>2. What will happen with our users from the second network after the merge? Will they be moved to the first network?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jan</p>

<p>Hello Jan,</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing your concern to our attention. We know how important for you to know more about Yammer data and network migration. We are here to help.</p>
<p>Below are the answers to your questions.</p>
<p>1. We do not have an option to import data into a Yammer network. As indicated in the article, Yammer verified administrators can export data.</p>
<p>2. Upon merge completion, existing authorized users of&nbsp;the Merged Network/s will be moved into Primary Network.&nbsp;Current and future users of the Merged Network/s will be redirected into the Primary Network.&nbsp;All network data of the Merged Network/s other than
 User Profiles, (e.g. private messages, public group posts, private group posts, notes, uploaded files, uploaded photos, etc.), will be permanently inaccessible.
</p>
<p>We&nbsp;hope&nbsp;we have answered all your queries. If you have other concerns, please let us know.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<h2>            How do I  get rid of this hideous blue box that appears on any line I am editing in MS Word 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I suspect it may be something to do with editing online, to show which areas a person is working on, but since I am the only person allowed to see or edit the document, and have been the only person editing the document when this annoying box appears I'm
 not sure why it is there really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent the past hour trying to work this out, hardly something I want when I have deadlines to meet. Also excuse the spelling errors, did it in a rush and ms word online didn't pick them up.</p>

            <p>Thank you both for reporting this issue. We've been trying to reproduce this internally but so far have been unsuccessful. Can you answer the following questions to see if we can figure out why this is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What browser and operating system are you using?</li><li>Does this happen in all documents or only certain ones? </li><li>In documents where the box appears, is it always visible or only sometimes?</li><li>Does this happen if you start your browser in Incognito or In-Private mode?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully the answers will up us narrow down the problem. </p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t make calls with a subscription</h2>
                    <p>Skype sent me an email saying it had billed me for next quarter's subscription for unlimited calls to US. &nbsp;When I try to call a non-skype user, a message pops that says I have no credit and asks if I would like to add $4.99 in credit. &nbsp;(The subscription
 is for unlimited calls.) The only option is I don't want to add $4.99 in credit is to cancel. &nbsp;Thus, the call never gets made.</p>

            Hi Kevin, 
<br />
<br />I'd check out MalwareBytes. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/products/</a> - download the free home version (make sure you opt out of the free trial of their active anti virus while setting up) 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />

Watch out for ads on the sites that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />Download and install Malwarebytes and ADWCleaner and run them both. They are solid at cleaning up the OS and browsers. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            This is great HOWEVER my personal files are still showing up...does this mean they were moved over to this user? &nbsp;I don't want to delete them from one if they are going to be deleted from the other also. &nbsp; It seams when I open one or the other they seem
 to be synced to each other. &nbsp;I DO NOT WANT THEM TO BE. &nbsp;&nbsp;Please advise.&nbsp;

            <p>Yes I have logged into both accounts and BOTH accounts show the files that I closed as the same even though I only closed them in one account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the work account. &nbsp;found that my personal files were in the work account so I started to close them. &nbsp;I stopped because I wasn't sure I should be closing them. &nbsp;I then opened the personal account. &nbsp;THE SAME FILES WERE CLOSED IN THE PERSONAL ACCOUNT.
 &nbsp;I know I am typing in caps but I need you to understand what I am dealing with.</p>

Here is a screen shot: &nbsp;the Notebook: Personal is supposed to be part of my personal OneNote not the work one, which is what I am singed in on. &nbsp;The other two notebooks are okay.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15a20cec-32fb-4128-be99-70e854c2a9d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15a20cec-32fb-4128-be99-70e854c2a9d0" /></a>

            <p>I think there is a simple explanation. Logging in with an account doesn't <strong>
open</strong> any notebook.</p>
<p>Logging out doesn't <strong>close</strong> any notebook, because an open notebook is cached locally.</p>
<p>So logging in/out doesn't change the displayed notebooks.</p>
