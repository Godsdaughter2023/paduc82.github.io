    <title>Play and charge kit loud buzzing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caveman122  say:</h3>
<h2>            Play and charge kit loud buzzing</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought the play and charge kit because I don't really want to keep buying batteries until a wired controller is released. I am now unsure on if I'll even use it, because when I'm using my headset and have it plugged in it makes a horrible buzzing
 noise that everyone can hear. Plus it's unbearably loud, to the point where it is nearly louder than my voice through the mic.</p>
<p>I know the 360 play and charge had a buzzing problem but it was nowhere near as bad as this, plus my mate has one with the same headset as me and when he uses his there is no noise at all. I am thinking it is my controller since I don't have a normal Xbox
 One controller I have the Forza edition, but that's just me looking for excuses I think.</p>
<p>I just don't understand how I have an extremely loud buzzing sound through my headset when my mate has nothing and it infuriates me because the main reason I bought it was because there was no buzz.</p>
<p>If it's any help my headset is the Turtle Beach PX22.</p>
<p>All help is much appreciated, thank you.</p>

<p>The solution Turtle Beach offered for the same problem on 360 is: <a href="http://support.turtlebeach.com/entry/830517565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
charge the controller when you're not using the headset. [Clicky]</a></p>
<p>My advice, since you said you're waiting on a wired controller, is to just invest in a
<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=long+micro+usb+cable&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=X71ZVqu-JcnqUseWBA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
long, cheap, micro-USB cable</a>, and play wired, with no batteries and just the standard cover on the controller. S'lighter and feels nice. =)</p>

<p>I will continue to charge the controller while not talking to anyone but I find it weird that my mate has no problem with the play and charge at all. Might have to try and get a normal controller and see if that is the problem. Hopefully they release a wired
 controller soon.</p>

<p>Sounds like a plan. Always good to have a backup and spare at any rate. Before you do though, it just occured to me, have you tried

updating the firmware of your Xbox One controller? [Clicky]</a></p>

                    <p>Dear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck in the use of paint 3D for a simple reason: I can't find where to get the size of a 3D shape ?</p>
<p>From my researches, no topic has been opened on this.</p>
<p>It is the minimum to know how big is a shape (l*L*h), in pixel or centimeters ? How do we manage this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without this functionality, paint 3D can't be used for any modeling purpose.</p>
<p>

            I was excited to try this. At first look, it looked great. Spent like an hour trying to figure out how to measure. And looks like you can't. It seems like a simple thing that it should have. Useless to me with out it.&nbsp;

<p>M. Satan posted this question in November 2017. It's now May 2018.&nbsp;<br />
This is one of the most obvious design errors I can think of.&nbsp;<br />
This is computer software which digitally produces an image displayed in pixels - the data is inherently part of the software. How can it not be shown to the user?
</p>
<p>What sort of design and development process allowed such an obvious feature to be hidden from the user?&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did MS ignore the user feedback that much inevitably have pointed out this mistake?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds crazy !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You take time to developp a new soft, you push it on one of your biggest updates and market it even on TV (it has been shown on TV ads for MS products) but you don't put most basic and usefull functionnality in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a school guy learning code: get into a project of designing such a soft and try explain to your teacher why you did not put this functionnality on it. Just think about it. It will never work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, we discussed it in here, on a microsoft forum, I am not sure they think the same way.</p>

            3D Painter and Printer are nice tools and can be very useful, but I agree without the ability to determine the size of an object it is not good for working with objects you need to print. I had an object I wanted to print only to find out it would not
 fit on a 6x6x6 platform. What a waste.

            It's incredible this isn't there. I was blaming myself for not being able to find a control for something so obvious and having to google it. What happened to their usability labs? Would they not have people actually use the beta version and observe them?
 It had to be a conscious decision to not include this feature when they were deciding on the design. That by no means excuses them!

<p>I don't know why I'm surprised that there's no way of measuring using standard units of measure. Honestly, Microsoft has some really great software ideas. The problem is that they fail when it comes to the acutal&nbsp;implementation and functionality. It's an
 inherent flaw in all their software. When I actually go to use it, things seem great until you get to a critical function that it doesn't have that makes the whole thing useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think the feedback hub is a direct line to the trash. I don't feel like Microsoft reads any of it.</p>

<p>This topic is older than a year and really should be old news.</p>
<p>It's simple basic knowledge that there's a real need for measuring shapes.</p>
<p>The next step from the drawing pad is the printer - the 3D printer.</p>
<p>Lack of interface makes this otherwise great project a potential load of junked time, effort and developers' skills.</p>
<p>The marginal effort to fix the absence of measures, would put this app back on the front line, instead of a junk heap.</p>
<p>The architects and engineers involved with this topic haven't taken any of the above topics to heart.</p>
<p>Maybe - I'm not optimistic about this - maybe, if Microsoft takes into account the amount of negative energy fumed up, it would do the simple thing - either trash this, or numerate this.</p>

    <title>WLAN Autoconfig won&#39;t start - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WLAN Autoconfig won&#39;t start</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
My wireless stopped working suddenly. And I've troubleshot it down to the WLAN Autoconfig service. That service is set to run automatically on startup, but is not. When I try to start it I get error code 0xC00CE505.<br />
<br />
Yes, I rebooted my computer.<br />
Yes, the wireless is 'on.'<br />
Yes, I checked to see if my cable modem, wireless router, and wireless network adaptor were all working properly.<br />
Yes, the cable modem and wireless router are both working for other devices.<br />
Yes, the router works when I'm connected to it via an ethernet cable.<br />
Yes, I checked to see if there was an updated driver.<br />
No, the current driver was the most up to date.<br />
Yes, I uninstalled and reinstalled the wireless network adaptor.<br />
Yes, all the other services that WLAN Autoconfig depends on are running.<br />
<br />
I can't find anywhere this error code is associated with WLAN Autoconfig failing to start.<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Richard<br />

            Hi Richard,<br />
<br />
You may try this:<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a
 problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry</a>&nbsp;
 ) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows)<br />
<br />
1. Click start-&gt;Type in <strong>regedit</strong> in the search bar and hit enter.<br />
2. Navigate to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE / SYSTEM / CurrentControlSet / Services / Ndisuio</strong><br />
3. On the right panel, see the "<strong>Start"</strong> entry. <strong>If that is set to 4, change it to 3.</strong><br />
3. Go to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE / SYSTEM / CurrentControlSet002 / Services / Ndisuio</strong><br />
4. Again, if the "<strong>Start</strong>" <strong>entry is set to 4, change it to 3.<br />
</strong>5. Close Registry Editor.<br />
6. <strong>Reboot</strong> computer<br />
7. Then check if you are able to start those services.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><b>Method 1: </b>You may <b>temporarily</b> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">disable antivirus software</font></a> (and any other security software) and

<p>If disabling the antivirus software fixes the issue, you may have to configure the settings of the antivirus program accordingly. Please contact the software vendor for further assistance in this regard.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Make sure you enable the antivirus software, other security programs, and firewall.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

    <title>Windows Installer error- This installation package could not be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phate71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Installer error- This installation package could not be opened....Windows 7 64 bit-Adobe Reader,Java____</h2>
                    I have a 3 week old Dell Studio 1737, running Windows 7 64 bit. When I try to install Adobe Reader or Java, I get the error- `This installation package could not be opened. Verify that the package exists and that you can access it, or contact the application
 vendor to verify that this a valid Windows Installer package. I`ve tried downloading off/online 32 and 64 bit. I`ve tried the Windows Install cleanup utility, that shows nothing about Adobe Reader or Java.&nbsp;I`ve reformatted the drive to no avail, and Dell support
 was no help whatsoever. Thanks for any help, Steve

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Does there seem to be any consistency to how or when it happens? Can you reproduce the<br />
problem at will.<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<br />
===========================</p>
<p>After the above - update or re-install the sound drivers.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Why is Microsoft allowed to take control of my computer and install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sb fl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Microsoft allowed to take control of my computer and install Windows 10 without my consent&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It's my computer, not Microsoft's.&nbsp; They think they got around what amounts to hacking my computer by calling Windows 10 an "update" instead of what it is really is, an "upgrade".l&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Big Brother at its worst.&nbsp; At 6 p.m. yesterday, when I went to
 dinner, Windows 8.1 was my operating system.&nbsp; When I came back to my computer close to 11 p.m., Microsoft already had kidnapped it, restarted it and was "configuring update for Windows 10".&nbsp; Then, for more than an hour, it held my computer helpless like a
 rapist holds his victim, penetrating it against my will with "upgrading windows", "copying files", "installing features and drivers," and "configuring setup."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they did this without consent against a human, instead of a computer, it would be a criminal act: hostage taking, ot ****.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did say "no" numerous times to the annoying pop-ups" asking me to set a date for the upgrade to Windows10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No means no,
 doesn't it?&nbsp; You didn't have my consent and therefore you are as guilty of a crime as a hacker or rapist.&nbsp; I'm told that I have 30 days to return to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; But my tech people say that could mess up my computer and that Microsoft will attempt again and
 again to install Windows 10 just like a serial rapist out of control and violent.</p>

            <p>I am in the group of many recent individuals that did not want Windows 10 and clicked the small x in the upper right corner of the Windows 10 request. Yesterday it did not close the request which normally happens, but rather proceeded to upgrade to Windows
 10 against my wishes. (On an aside it took over 2 hours and I could not use my computer which is unacceptable). Windows has apparently been aware of this trick to customers for quite some and has indicated it is trying to resolve the issue which simply is
 not true. It appears rather, that you have changed the clicking of the x to represent a person's consent to the upgrade in order to get around those who simply do not want it. This would only have been changed by Windows in order to support what they want
 with no regard for a person's individual decision. This is my computer and my choice which Windows took away from me. This reflects badly on your brand and is a significant public relations mistake. Windows should be ashamed!!!!!

                    <p>So i've been away from Xbox for a few years and now I'm going to be picking up a new One X here shortly. I tried to recover my old gametag, which I can find using a friend's xbox, but the email that it was tied to is no longer available. I created a new one with my current Microsoft account but would there be anyway of restoring or transferring the achievements to the new account?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>DVR Clip Removed &#40;Enforcement&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dallasthedude  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVR Clip Removed &#40;Enforcement&#41;</h2>
                    I've had 2 different DVR clips removed in the past couple of months and I have no idea why! In the enforcement website it doesn't give me any details. It's not so much that I care about them being removed, I honestly don't even know what was in the clips/picture.
 I just want to know if there's anyway of finding out because I don't want to get an account suspension or something for taking an "inappropriate" clip. When something interesting happens in a game I record it, I play games rated E-M and I'm sure there's plenty
 of clips with questionable material but as I said only two clips have been removed so I really don't know where the line is being drawn.&nbsp;

            I have a lot of friends that are always having screenshots and clips removed, almost daily. It's hard to say exactly what it is, but from seeing their posts about it for the past several months, the gereral idea I've got is that they can remove anything
 if it has any swear words/offensive language, anything that might be copyright (like someone mentioned the music above) or anything that has nudity/strong partial nudity/provacative content. I haven't played Wolfenstein 2 yet, I've only played Wolfenstein:
 The New Order so I'm not sure what might have been in the clip that could have been offensive etc... :/ If it was a fight scene and you wound up dying, I'm guessing maybe it had lots of action and shooting, so the only thing I could think of is if one of the
 characters in the clip yelled or said a curse word, maybe?&nbsp; Otherwise, I'm not sure what else could have warranted an enforcement from a scene of you dying in Wolfenstein 2. Sorry about that. :( With Wolf 2, I'm not sure. If there is

                    <p>My 5 year old desktop has Windows 10 Pro right now, after upgrading from a Windows 8/8.1 full product package license.</p>

</p><p>I have bought a new PC without Windows and I activated Windows 10 on it using the same product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I now want to sell the old desktop, certainly without my Windows 10 Pro license.&nbsp;It however still shows that Windows is activated, although it switched from saying that it was with a license linked to my Microsoft Account to simply saying it has
 a 'digital entitlement'.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 7 and loss of Internet connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> highland99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 and loss of Internet connection</h2>
                    In our home office we have a desktop system running Windows 7 as well as an iMac.&nbsp; Both are connected to Apple's Time Capsule, which serves as a router as well as a backup hard drive for the iMac. (our Internet connection is cable-Internet, by the way.)<br />
<br />
Ever since upgrading from Windows Vista to Windows 7, the Windows 7 desktop is encountering frequent Internet connection errors.&nbsp; It generally loses the Internet connection several times per day.<br />
<br />
Today is the worst manifestation we have seen thus far (since upgrading to Windows 7 last week).&nbsp; We generally only have an Internet connection for about 2-3 minutes, then it is lost and must be repaired.<br />
<br />
We go into Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Troubleshoot Problems &gt; Internet Connections<br />
<br />
We allow Windows 7 to automatically diagnose and repair the problem.<br />
<br />
Each and every time it goes through the steps of diagnosing and repairing, it ends up "resetting the local area connection adapter."<br />
<br />
At the end of the process -- after everything has been repaired -- we get the following report:<br />
<br />
"Default gateway is not available - fixed."<br />
<br />
What steps do we need to take to permanently solve this problem?<br />
<br />
By the way, the iMac is NOT experiencing any Internet connection problems whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

I don't know what you are using to assign addresses, so I am assuming it is a router of some sort. You will need to go to the manufacturers site, look at the manual and find out how to limit the DHCP address scope. I changed mine to limit the assigning of DHCP
 addresses to&nbsp;192.168.1.200 through 192.168.1.250. Your router may use the 10. subnet, so your addresses may be different, depends on the router manufacturer, or if you use a DHCP server, the scope set with the DHCP server. That gives me 50 IP addresses for
 any guests that may want to use wired or wireless connections, and should be more than enough. This allows me to assign 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.199 to a device and not have to worry about the DHCP server trying to use one that is assigned permanently
 to a device (Printer, switch, PC, Server, Virtual Server, etc). <br />
<br />
Once you have that setup in your router, you will now need to assign a static ip to your PC. This is all done from the network adapter.
<br />
<br />
From the start menu:<br />
Control Panel<br />
Network and Internet<br />
Network and Sharing Center<br />
On the right hand pane of Network and Sharing Center<br />
Change adapter settings<br />
Double Click your network adapter<br />
Select the "Details" radio button<br />
Write down the&nbsp;following lines:<br />
Connection Specific DNS (May or may not exist, depends on provider)<br />
IPv4 Subnet<br />
IPv4 Default Gateway<br />
IPv4 DNS Servers<br />
<br />
Once you have written those down,&nbsp;you can close that box.<br />
You should be back at the "Local Area Connection Status" box.<br />
Choose the "Properties" radio button.<br />
Select the "Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4)", which will be&nbsp;in a blue box when selected.&nbsp;<br />
Now select the "Properties" radio button<br />
The "Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties" box should have popped up. If so:<br />
Select the following:<br />
"Use the following IP address"<br />
In the IP address box, enter an IP address. Example: 192.168.1.20<br />
Press the tab, the subnet should fill in automatically, if not, enter the value from "IPv4 Subnet" you wrote down from the above step. Examp,e: 255.255.255.0<br />
In the dafult gateway, enter the value from the steps above. Example: 192.168.1.254<br />
<br />
Now to move on to the next 2 boxes, DNS Servers. You may have only 1 DNS server entry from the DNS entry you wrote down from above.<br />
Enter the DNS servers you notes above.<br />
<br />
If there was&nbsp;"Connection Specific DNS" entry or entries, do the following (If not skip the "Connection Specific DNS" sections:<br />
Select the "Advanced" radio button.<br />
The "Additional TCP/IP Settings" windows should open<br />
Select the "DNS" tab<br />
<br />
If there is more than 1 "Connection Specific DNS" entry, do the following:<br />
Select the "Append DNS suffixes (in order):" <br />
Select "Add..."<br />
In the "Domain suffix", enter the first Connection Specific DNS entry. <br />
Select the "Add" radio button.<br />
Add all the DNS Specific suffixes you wrote down. You can only enter one at a time.<br />
When finished sleect the "OK" radio button<br />
<br />
If you only have 1 entry in "Connection Specific DNS":<br />
In the box labeled "DNS suffix for this connection", type in the entry you noted above for the "Connection Specific DNS".<br />
When finished sleect the "OK" radio button<br />
<br />
Check the "validate settings upon exit" box.<br />
<br />
Select the "OK" radio button.<br />
<br />
Select the "Close" radio button<br />
<br />
You should see the 'Windows Network Diagnostics" open, and check for any problems. Hopefully all is well and it states "Troubleshooting could not identify the problem", and choose "Close the Troubleshooter".<br />
Close any additional boxes or pop-ups that are open, and check and make sure allis connecting. If not, go back and verify any steps. the most common are the IP addresses and gateways.
<br />
<br />
Good luck. Post back if it resolves the issue.<br />
<br />

    <title>Boot failure - Page fault in non paged area - BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denny gardener  say:</h3>
<h2>            Boot failure - Page fault in non paged area - BSOD</h2>
                    <p>My PC will not boot into Windows or from my Windows USB Recovery Drive. I gives a BSOD message "Page fault in non paged area" and starts automatic repair. It then restarts and repeats this same cycle indefinitely. It cannot get past the BSOD and will continue
 unsuccessfully trying to boot for hours if I let it run.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It will not boot from the Windows USB Recovery Drive I created when Windows was working properly. After invoking the BIOS F8 boot menu and choosing the USB drive, the Windows 8.1 logo appears for a while but it never displays the recovery screen. After a
 period, it reverts to trying to boot from the HDD.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On 2 occasions, Windows automatic repair reached the recovery environment screen and I was able to successfully restore 2 different system drive images that were created when Windows was working. Neither of those image restorations fixed the problem and
 I continue to get the same BSOD message "Page fault in non paged area" and behavior.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Memtest86 ran for 4 hours with zero errors, so RAM is good.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just before the problem started, I had restarted the computer immediately following the creation of a System Image. Just before that, I had responded to an Action Center message asking me to verify the PC/Microsoft login by entering my password. Any help
 is appreciated since this PC is dead.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>System Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 8.1 Pro &gt; upgraded from Windows 8 thru the App Store &gt; upgraded from Windows Vista. It has been running pretty much flawlessly since the Windows 8 to 8.1 upgrade in October, 2013.</li><li>ASUS M3N78-PRO motherboard</li><li>AMD Phenom II X3 processor</li></ul>

            <p>Hi Mahesh, thanks for your assistance. How can I fix the corrupted sectors/NTFS volume?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 will not boot, so it cannot "boot into safe mode" as you suggest. It shows the BSOD and that's all.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It cannot get past the BSOD.&nbsp;It stops there and won't boot into Windows. So there is no way to boot into safe mode since Windows cannot change the startup settings to allow booting into safe mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, there is no video card, usb drive or card reader connected to the system.</p>

<p>Hi Mahesh, I cannot create an installation media since I don't have a PC with the same 32-bit architecture.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do have the Windows 8 installation media on CD. However, Automatic Repair does not work with this CD because it encounters the error that the OS is different (8.1 instead of 8).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am able to use the Windows 8 CD to&nbsp;run the command prompt, and have run chkdsk successfully on all partitions. Chkdsk is reporting no errors.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I ram Memtest86 for 4 hours and it is reporting no memory errors.</p>

Mahesh, I have the USB Recovery Drive I created when Windows 8.1 was working. When I try to boot into the USB recovery environment, it displays a message saying "the PC ran into a problem and needs to restart".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then, the PC restarts and displays the same message again, then restarts.&nbsp;It will keep repeating this cycle&nbsp;until I turn it off.</p>

<p>Did you change the boot order in your BIOS while trying to boot from the USB recovery drive?</p>

<p>The fact that you couldn't boot from the USB drive leads me to believe that the recovery creation failed.</p>

Hi Mahesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must apologize but I have discovered I got my USB drives mixed up and was trying to use the wrong recovery drive.&nbsp; I can now boot into the recovery environment, but it doesn't seem to work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, when I use "System Image Recovery" it gives a message <br />
"This option is not supported on the operating system you've selected".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the same message when I try to use "System Restore" and "Startup Repair".</p>

Mahesh, is it possible Windows 8.1 locked me out of my computer when I executed the Windows account verification? Because it gave me a message saying "I'll see you in one month" or something like that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why did it say "I'll see you in one month"?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was asked by Action Center to verify the computer. So I clicked the item in Action Center and it took me to a screen with 2 email addresses. However, both of the addresses were hidden by "******" so I couldn't distinguish between the 2 and had to proceed
 with the verification using a new email address. That's when it gave me the message that "I'll see you in one month".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is this what is causing my problem?</p>

Hi Pinaki,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is no way to&nbsp;create a screenshot&nbsp;when Windows will not even&nbsp;boot. Perhaps you can ask a support engineer who is more familiar with the Windows 8.1 trust and verification process.</p>

<h3> utvoslter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nothing happens when I click on attachment in Windows Mail</h2>
                    Ok - I have looked around to see if there were answers before posting this but I have not found anything.<br />
<br />
On my Windows Mail - I cannot click on the attachments and have it open right there. Once I click on the clip, I'd click on the file and NOTHING happens. Not even an error messages. However, if I click on 'save attachments'. I would be able to go where they
 were saved and open them from there - but that has been such a pain in the rear end!! I don't want to have to save attachments everytime.<br />
<br />
I even looked into the properties and it does have %UserProfile% in the "Start In" box.<br />
<br />
I have NO idea where else to look. I even checked my Norton Internet Security and don't see anything that would fix the problem, or at least I don't know where to look.<br />
<br />
Please help!! <br />
Thanks!!

 for about 10 seconds). I bought this laptop (a Toshiba L850 model number PSKG8A-046001) a few days ago. I have worked through postings on this forum and many others trying to nail what's wrong, but alas, I'm at the point where I've run out of ideas. I'm relatively
 well versed in driver updates and the sorts of issues that can happen. It doesn't matter how many install/de-installs, clean-ups, reboots and overall attempts to ensure everything's tidy, this laptop simply won't connect to the corporate Wifi "guest" network
 at my office (it's a 54mb/s Cisco access point using WPA2-PSK authentication and AES encryption...not sure what 802.11 standards it uses but we have dozens of devices here all happily connecting to it; mostly Win XP and Win 7 machines plus iPhones, iPads&nbsp;and
 Android phones....i.e. there's nothing unusual or unique about it). Here's a quick overview of what I've tried:<br />
<br />
Latest Atheros driver version 10.0.0.274 on Toshiba's website listed against my laptop's specific model number plus<br />
dozens of previous drivers including a mix of Win7 and Win8:<br />
<br />
9.2.0.113</p>
<p>9.2.0.467<br />
9.2.0.474<br />
9.2.1.459<br />
10.0.0.34<br />
10.0.0.42<br />
10.0.0.45<br />
10.0.0.52<br />
10.0.0.54<br />
10.0.0.67<br />
10.0.0.75<br />
10.0.0.216<br />
10.0.0.221<br />
10.0.0.227<br />
10.0.0.234<br />
10.0.0.242<br />
10.0.0.251<br />
10.0.0.255<br />
10.0.0.263<br />
10.0.0.270<br />
<br />
...and this morning I found an even newer version related to an Acer laptop 10.0.0.276 which is from the 12/12/2013 (it can be found here
<a href="http://www2.driveridentifier.com/scan/driver_file_detail.php?inf_file_id=1760477&amp;md5=e4eafeaf5aa2cebceaa305c1e9ba6b41&amp;scanid=23CAA918380E490883E5B6ED815246DB&amp;item_id=1199283698&amp;hardware_id=PCI%5CVEN_168C%26DEV_0032%26SUBSYS_E044105B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www2.driveridentifier.com/scan/dr...S_E044105B</a>).<br />
<br />
With each update I've tried connecting immediately and also have rebooted to ensure there's not some refresh issue needing a reboot for it to work.<br />
<br />
I've also run Intel's checking process (<a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect?iid=dc_iduu)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/det...d=dc_iduu)</a> and upgraded the machine's BIOS (<a href="http://www.mytoshiba.com.au/file/download/resource/file/22296/l850(pl10f)_bios_w680.exe)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mytoshiba.com.au/file/downloa..._w680.exe)</a><br />
<br />
Nothing I do seems to offer&nbsp;any improvement, although on two&nbsp;occasions now I have&nbsp;seen it connect briefly but then disconnect again after a few seconds (and I haven't been able to recreate&nbsp;any repeatable circumstances or actions&nbsp;leading up to this momentary
 connection. On one occasion I turned off the "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" function within the "Power Management" tab of the device's properties and it did this temporary connect...so I pursued "power" related settings thinking
 I was onto something. But on trying this a second time and playing around with dozens of different sequences&nbsp;of events in terms of reboot-connect-connect fails-change power setting- try again (and numerous alternative sequences) I haven't been able to recreate
 the temporary connection so have still only seen it do this&nbsp;twice now).<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas HOW to fix this wretched issue!<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a laptop with an Atheros AR9485WB-EG Wifi card on Win 8.1 that's successfully connecting to an access point?<br />
<br />
This really is appalling. I can't get this laptp connected to Wifi so haven't beeen able to do dozens of things like sync my Outlook.com mail with the installed Outlook as I don't want to use up the precious download cap on my mobile phone's plan. I've been
 working on this for some days with no end in sight and getting ready to go and buy a USB Wifi adapter. Really microsoft shouldn't be releasing products like this (win 8.1) with such excrutiating difficulties; I'm seeing problems with Wifi&nbsp;non-connect and performance
 issues on forums all over the web on many different wifi adapters, but this Atheros AR9485WB-EG seems to be up there as one&nbsp; of the worst (and there's virtually nothing on Atheros' website to help). But having said that,&nbsp;I'll be so very grateful if anyone
 on here can assist in getting this resolved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Well thank you for replying but I think your notion of "<span>Since you(sic) trying to connect to a corporate network, I suggest you to check with the network administrator in your office to make relevant changes in the network settings" is naïve in the
 extreme.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Large multi-national corporations that use standard configurations </span>
world-wide <span>on devices like a Cisco access point don't have "network administrators" who will just logon&nbsp;ad-hoc&nbsp;to a device to make "relevant changes". These systems are locked down and configured to provide the appropriate compromise between security
 and functionality. They're also subject to rigorous change control and any modification of settings generally involves substantial testing and verification to ensure any changes don't "break" something else; so me ringing up a help desk on the other side of
 the world where network management is executed from and saying "my laptop won't connect....it's Win8.1 with an Atheros AR9485WG-EB adapter....can you make 'relevant changes' to the access point?" will carry about as much influence as me asking a flight attendant
 on a commercial jet if they could ask the Captain to fly a few orbits around my house during the approach so I can waive to my family...! (i.e. this isn't the same context as someone talking about their home DSL connecting using a simple wireless router)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you read my posting again you'll see that I've stated that all other devices can connect to this network access point without any issues whatsoever; XP, Win7, iOS7 iPhones</span><span> &amp; iPads, numerous different Android phones, VoIP handsets, basically
 anything and everything. The network is completely standard and the notion something has to be done to the access point is completely flawed and it annoys me to no end when a Microsoft person acts like there's just no issue here with Windows...must be the
 configuration with something else....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Bottom line is Win 8.1 has numerous Wifi issues (they're all over this forum and many others...search on "Windows 8.1 wifi" to see what I'm talking about). I'm at the point of giving up and about to go buy something like a Dlink USB wifi adapter. Hopefully
 it will work on Win 8.1 and I won't have the same problem.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Srimadhwa</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well as before with the previous response I thank you for replying but I'm afraid I have to point out to you that your reply is next to completely useless and, (in clear demonstration of the epidemic amongst technical support people), you have made a huge
 assumption, not read what I've written properly and&nbsp;(once again) jumped to a conclusion that is devoid of sound troubleshooting technique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where in all my posts and description of the issue did I say I'm experiencing a "limited connection"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm experiencing is a fault with Windows 8.1 when using the Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG Wifi adapter. It's plain and simple: it just doesn't work on some WiFi access points (and what the specifics of this are no one seems to know, but search on "windows
 8.1 WiFi&nbsp;issues" and you will find hundreds of entries showing there are many many Win8.1 WiFi&nbsp;problems). To get around the problem I have gone out and bought a D-Link N600 Wireless USB adapter and it is now working fine and the laptop connects to the access
 point on the corporate network at my office (thank goodness and thank you D-Link!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me restate the facts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. For the bulk of the time the&nbsp;AR9485WB-EG will not connect to this Cisco access point whereas dozens of other devices (laptops running XP &amp; Win7, iPhones, iPads, Android phones, VoIP handsets) will connect without any issue. I say "for the bulk of the
 time" because since writing the original posting I have had a few ad-hoc connections on some occasions now, but the signal strength is very very low and the connection only lasts for a minute or two before it gives up and won't reconnect. During the very brief
 time it has connected (and it's unbelievably sporadic) I have had Internet access, albeit at a very very slow speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;THE ISSUE IS WINDOWS 8.1 NOT WORKING WITH THE AR9485WB-EG ADAPTER</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There is absolutely nothing needing to be "configured" or "altered" on this wireless access point. It is perfectly functional with many many devices connecting perfectly well and NOW this Toshiba L850 laptop on windows 8.1 CAN also connect via the D-Link
 N600 USB wireless adapter. IF YOU ARE RESPONDING TO THIS POST PLEASE DO <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
NOT</span> TALK ABOUT MAKING CHANGES TO THE WIRELESS ACCESS POINT - IT IS NOT WHAT THIS PROBLEM IS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;THE ISSUE IS WINDOWS 8.1 NOT WORKING WITH THE AR9485WB-EG ADAPTER</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. This is NOT about cables, plugs, radio interference, the weather, sunspot activity or alien transmission interference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Just to reiterate) THE ISSUE IS WINDOWS 8.1 NOT WORKING WITH THE AR9485WB-EG ADAPTER</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...if you're a Microsoft Support Engineer what can you do to get this issue addressed and not just respond with a lame comment that does nothing to further the relief of the (likely) many thousands of people around the world who are probably struggling
 with the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if I'm sounding frustrated but I have spent much time on this and it doesn't seem like anyone at Microsoft has the capacity and capability to accept that there's a Win8.1 WiFi issue going on here. The product is faulty and, in conjunction with
 Qualcomm (and potentially other WiFi adapter manufacturers), it needs to be rectified.</p>

            <p>Hi Philip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work out as expected. I appreciate the efforts you have put in to work on the issue and find a workaround solution for the issue. I do agree it's not a complete solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a research to understand that&nbsp;there are issues with AR9485WB-EG adapter since Windows 8 was released. That was majorly from the device driver end and not from the Windows side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are number of threads which discuss the same issue on multiple devices from different manufacturers. The adapter being the same on each instance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers for the network adapter drivers;&nbsp;Atheros driver version are released by the manufacturers. Since you have tried&nbsp;installing even the latest one, we sure understand that the issue lies more than the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a reference, here is a thread that discusses a number of solutions for the same issue on multiple computers.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/qualcomm-atheros-ar9485wb-eg-wireless-network/1c5a398d-2297-430c-b815-883fd492cb07?page=1&amp;tm=1395277584146">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/qualcomm-atheros-ar9485wb-eg-wireless-network/1c5a398d-2297-430c-b815-883fd492cb07?page=1&amp;tm=1395277584146</a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The discussion is more focussed with Windows 8 operating system, however it&nbsp;focusses on Windows 8.1 as well.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the thread, users have shared multiple solutions which have worked for different users on all the pages within the thread.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before trying the steps, I would <em><strong>add a note of&nbsp;disclaimer that&nbsp;some steps&nbsp;discussed in the threads&nbsp;might require&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;make changes to the network hardware and changes made may cause issues with devices that are currently working with the network
 .</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say that the best people to contact for exact solution for this issue would be the adapter manufacturer. Here is the link to contact

            <p>Hello Vidyaranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I appreciate that you have read through the thread and comprehended the issue rather than just throwing out a stock-standard response that either misses the point altogether or assumes a novice level of troubleshooting skill on my
 part (which anyone who has assisted people resolve complex issues will see is not the case here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do agree that the WiFi adapter's manufacturer is ultimately responsible for ensuring drivers work properly within the Windows sub-system and Atheros clearly needs to come to the party here and work on a resolution BUT (and it's a big "BUT" noted by many
 other individuals who have been challenged by WiFi problems on both Win 8 and Win 8.1 and seen the extent of it across the many forums; and not just with this specific adapter card), Microsoft needs to acknowledge that the plethora of WiFi problems being experienced
 isn't simply a case of users needing to "speak to the adapter's manufacturer" as there are simply too many examples. Something is not right that adapters that worked perfectly well on XP or Win7 (and in many cases Win 8 too) are now completely broken on Win
 8.1. Something is very much amiss. Read this posting from JimHD on 7 December 2013 from the thread you posted:</p>

 for more then 2 months and there are complaint threads for numerous wireless network adapter cards and computer manufacturers.&nbsp; Sadly I have had to appologies to several friends and family members using, Dell, Sam-sung and ASUS computers (all brand new) and
 running windows 8 or updated to 8.1.&nbsp; I recommend they migrate to windows 8 as I had for a time had a good experience; for more then 2 months this wifi disconnect has troubled me and every person I know using windows 8 with a wifi connection.</em></span><br />

 adapter manufacturers. Read: regardless of what's going on/how this problem has manifested itself, Microsoft needs to take some responsibility for these issues.</p>

            <p>hi philip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have sony duo 11 on intel centrino advance n 6235 (wifi adapter) that was prone to wifi dropping prior to 8.0, then seems better on 8.1, but now it starts to come back. (save your self the frustration so dont put too much hope on ms standard solution)</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway, (all other android devices are working, even clumsy lumia phone works on my wifi router) i am just lucky to get the troubleshooter telling me "Wifi doesnt have a valid IP config" issues. so i had to find my way to get the wifi adapter network properties.
 and change the ip4 addresses manuallly. get the numbers from the router using other devices, and assigned the ip on the router to avoid address collision.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Please allow me to be as direct as I possibly can. Of course Windows as the OS can cause<br />
issues with any program or driver however the total responsibility for compatibility is the<br />
device maker who produces the hardware and writes the drivers. There is no way Windows<br />
could&nbsp;do alterations of code to accommodate the thousands and thousands of devices&nbsp;and<br />
drivers out there.<br />
<br />
If Windows were the cause there would not be "many" folks&nbsp;out there with an issue there<br />
would be millions and millions.<br />
<br />
Contact the OEM System/Motherboard Maker and/or the actual device maker's support<br />
<br />
These may&nbsp;help&nbsp;(check both for the latest drivers) :&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade on Samsung Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michelleboyleuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade on Samsung Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on my samsung NP7005ZC-S01UK laptop when the free upgrade download became available. I now have several issues and Saumsung do not have Windows 10 drivers available. I have contacted Microsoft who told me this is a Samsung issue,
 I have contacted Samsung who told me they have an agreement with Microssoft that they support this issue. So basically being passed between both with neither helping me. As anyone else been able to progress with this with either company?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issue I am having is that I cannot connect to the Homegroup. The workstation service is stopped and cannot be restarted, it gives an Error 1079 when I try to retry.</p>

            <p>I have a RV511 which fails to install and crashes on the first reboot of the installation. &nbsp;~More than likely the wifi adaptor &nbsp; Broadcom issue that many folks have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive experienced the same lack of ownership between Samsung and Microsoft and have spent several hours talking to both and being passed back and forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told today that no Samsung laptops are certified to run on Windows 10. &nbsp;I think this is mainly because Samsung are no longer in the pc / laptop market - they dont sell any laptops now. &nbsp; I was told that Samsung and Microsoft are working together to
 create the drivers - but I think that highly unlikely given 6 months in from the release of Windows 10 - and neither company has made any kind of official statement</p>

    <title>Windows Boot Manager Failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brenna kelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Boot Manager Failed</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I was using my computer as always, and everything was fine. &nbsp;When I woke up this morning and went to log on to my laptop, I was notified with a blue screen reading, "Windows Boot Manager boot failed". &nbsp;After clicking okay as it suggested, I was
 then given a screen reading, "Default Boot Device Missing or Boot Failed. Insert Recovery Media and Hit any key. Then Select 'Boot Manager' to choose a new Boot Device or to Boot Recovery Media". However, I don't recall every receiving a recovery media device
 with my laptop, so I'm unsure how to proceed. Once hitting okay without inserting any device, I get a screen reading, "Boot Manager: Boot Option Menu", yet I'm given no options. I'm basically at a standstill at this point because I don't know how to access
 my documents, and I'm in college and have important projects and other documents on there that I can't afford to lose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any tips, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>My voice sounds like a demon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> totallytaben  say:</h3>
<h2>            My voice sounds like a demon</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 seemingly with no problems...until I tried talking to someone via a chat platform. At first I thought it was my headphones, so I switched to a headset my mom gave me...No change. I looked at the settings on
 the chat platform and nothing indicated any solution as to why voice now sounds like I'm the spawn of Satan himself. Tried a different chat platform and got the same result. Checked the sound settings. Nothing looks wrong there either.&nbsp; I did look at the actual
 driver for the microphone.</p>
<p>It's a Conexant High Definition. Model CX20584, Version 8.54.48.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that it may need an update, since this version is for Windows 8 and not 10. However, when I try to install a driver, from the official website mind you, it tells me it can't find the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a Gateway laptop. Model NE71B06U. MFG date: 02/04/2013</p>
<p>It would be much appreciated if someone could figure out why my voice gets distorted when I speak.&nbsp; I never had any problem until I upgraded to Windows 10(which I'm really starting to hate.)<br />

            <p>There is no yellow exclamation mark negating method 1.&nbsp; I did find that the sound driver and the audio input/outputs driver are not the same. I was previously looking at only the sound driver, which is still 8.54.48.0 where as the the drivers for the speakers/microphone
 is 10.0.10240.16384. I have tried reinstalling the original Windows 8 driver however all I get when I run the program under the compatibility mode is the updated driver installation. I can't roll the drivers back either since it has been just over a month
 since upgrading to Windows 10 but I also can not find an update for the sound driver. 0.o</p>

<h2>            Lost files&#58; cannot find files after moving them to different location </h2>
                    
<p>Ok so my roommate in fear that she lost all her files yesterday when her laptop didnt log in properly found some files in the recently used folder, she moved them to her pictures folder then restarted her laptop. The next time she logged in everything was
 back except the files she moved earlier. Now they are no longer in the recently used folder...please help</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She should sort the files by Date Visited (add the header by right clicking on any header and clicking customize and choose date visited).&nbsp; This should bring the recently viewed files to the top of the list (if you're only concerned with recently modified,
 then use that header instead).&nbsp; Then she needs to move them back to the recently used folder and the problem is solved.&nbsp; She may not get them all, but a couple of files in the wrong place is no big deal and the recent items will eventually refresh until the
 new version is totallly different from the old one and definitely no longer an issue.&nbsp; Moving the recently viewed files doesn't change their actual location - they are where they were to begin with&nbsp;- in Documents or wherever&nbsp;(it's just the shortcuts or copies
 in reently viewed ffiles that will have been moved).&nbsp; If when in Pictures you find a file that doesn't belong, just delete it (or you can move it to recently viewed as well if you want).</p>
<p>It's reallly not a very big deal and you will not have lost any data and though you may not see EVERY recently used file when done, you wll get back most and that should be enough.&nbsp; There's no way to "undo" what she did and make it exactly like before.&nbsp;
 You just need to do the best you can.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            There's only 100 (give or take) files in the folder and none of which are the files she wants back so using the header would seem kind of pointless, I also cannot find it in the list. It goes from 'date taken' straight to 'department', missing date visited.
 Any other possible ideas? Being that they haven't been backed up i cant do a file restore, a system restore wont affect files and using the app 'recova' only borught back a small handfull, some of which where missing information so the photos only half loaded...so
 troublesome :S

<p>I thought she just moved the files to the new folder - I didn't realize they couldn't be found there.&nbsp; I wonder how that happened - it shoudn't have.</p>
<p>Are the original documents (not those in Recent Documents but the actual originals in Documents or wherever they came from where they belong or were they also lost when she moved the Recent Items?&nbsp; That too should not have happened if it did (but there's
 nothing to be done about it now).</p>
<p>If you know the name of any particular file or folder that has been "lost", try a full system search (which works different from the Search function in the start menu).&nbsp; Make sure Start / Control Panel / Folder Options / View is set to show hidden files
 and system files and extensions on known file types.&nbsp; <span>
To search the entire C: drive in Vista go to Start / Search Box and type in ‘&lt;filename&gt; or &lt;foldername&gt;’.&nbsp; As you're typing you'll see two hyperlinks appear just above where you're typing and one will say Search Everywhere.&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; That will do a quick
 indexed search and bring up a dialog box.&nbsp; Click on Advanced Search.&nbsp; Click on the location drop down menu and find Drive C: and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed, hidden, and system files (may be slow)."&nbsp; Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now
 be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of searching the entire drive for a file but that's how it's done in Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>I assume you've already checked the Recycle Bin but since you didn't mention it I simply suggest it as an option - they may all be there and a simple restore
 may resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>If&nbsp; they can't be found then they are unfortunately lost or deleted or somehow removed from the system.&nbsp; Here's what I tell people with lost files (though
 it sounds like you've already tried at least one option):</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>If you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck.&nbsp; They have what is known as Shadow
 Copies which are saves of deleted or modified files which can be retrieved in case the changes/deletions were done in error.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 further information on how to use this feature at: </span><a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium, Shadow Copies is not available; however, there's an alternative that's free and mirrors the functionality of Shadow Copies called Shadow Explorer.</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Though it won't help you this time, it could very well save you in case this happens again.<br />
<br />
In case this doesn't work (not all files are available through Shadow Copies - it occurs periodically), here are some additional free recovery programs which might help:<br />

 Recuva first)</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/diskdigger.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/diskdigger.html</span></span></a><span>(try
 this second - if it doesn’t work either chances of recovery are very slim but you can try the other options if you wish)<br />

<p><span>Files aren't actually deleted until they are overwritten (though they're no longer available through conventional methods).&nbsp; If you decide to try these recovery
 programs, you should stop using your hard drive <strong>immediately</strong> so you don't overwrite the data you are trying to recover.&nbsp; Slave it to another PC and run the recovery from that PC.&nbsp; Even now you may have permanently lost some of them if you're
 using that same PC.&nbsp; If you can't do that (slave to another PC), you run the risk of overwriting the data with every action you do on the PC (but you still may be able to recover some or most or even all of the files - it's a matter of luck).<br />
<br />
Only you can decide if the data is important enough to take the PC to a data recovery expert to recover the files (they will have better programs and equipment to do so than any of us do and than I provided above).&nbsp; Do NOT go to Geek Squad or any of those big
 store centers - they mostly don't know what they're doing - take it to a data recovery expert.&nbsp; It will cost quite a bit and they usually offer no guarantees.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</span></p>
<p><span>There's nothing else we can do to help.&nbsp; These are the only remaining options.&nbsp; If these don't work, I'm afraid the information is permanently lost.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope one of them helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>It just happened to me today as well. I took some files from a folder on my additional hard drive d:\ and moved them to a different folder on the same drive. After moving, the files were gone. There were no error messages. The files were gone at the source
 location, but never appeared at the destination location. There were no special folders like MRU involved, just regular folders on the file system. The OS is Windows 10 64 Bit.</p>
<p>I tried a filesystem check but that came up with no results.</p>

<h2>            PUR-User Already Owns Content Error in game on Tribez App</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting the PUR-UserAlreadyOwnsContentError in game on the Tribez app in Windows 10 on gems, which should be able to be purchased multiple times.&nbsp; The app does not restrict how many times you can purchase these packages, since that is how they support
 their game.&nbsp; I am basically allowed to purchase a specific package once, and once I have done that, I can no longer purchase that specific package again (i.e., a package of gems for $2.99).&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game; I have tried
 clearing the store cache; I have tried logging in and out of the store; I have deleted temporary game files; I have tried running the app troubleshooter; none of these have resulted in a correction of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the game itself does not show me logged into Facebook, even though Facebook shows me logged into the app and "Active".&nbsp; Don't understand how that is possible, either, or if it is related in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also contacted Game Insight, the maker of the Tribez, with these issues, but so far, nothing they have suggested has worked either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be the only game/app that I am having difficulty with.&nbsp; All others seem to be just fine - which leads me to believe it is something not communicating between the store and this particular app.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now out of ideas.&nbsp; Do you have any suggestions?&nbsp;
 &nbsp; Thanks - Kaitlin</p>
