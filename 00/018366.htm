            Hi Ray
<br />
<br />Does this only happen in Microsoft Office Applications?
<br />
<br />1
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .
<br />
<br />2.
<br />If that also happens on non-Microsoft Office applications:
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />Choose the Processes Tab
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When this lagging happens when you type, is your Hard drive, CPU or RAM overly busy at that time?
<br />
<br />If so, click on the appropriate column header, so the arrow faces down
<br />
<br />What are the top 5 processes at that time?

            Hi Ray,
<br />do you have problems in locally installed Office program? If yes, did you try to run them in safe mode? Do you have any third-party antiviruses or keyboard input handlers?

<br />1 Open Microsoft Word and create a blank document.

<br />3 On the new screen, choose 'Advanced' in the left pane. Look for “Disable hardware graphics acceleration” at the right pane under the 'Display' section and check it.
<br />4 Click the OK button.
<br />Close out of office and restart computer. 
<br />Open up an new blank document and test. 
<br />Regards,

<h2>            Office 365 Authentication - looping and failing</h2>
                    
<p>We are currently undergoing a migration to 365, several of us have migrated over with no issues. But we are all seeing issues with authentication where by constantly re-directed from portal page to our sts site and looping till fail.</p>
<p>Also using office 2013 and Onedrive for business both logged in and working but when saving a file to onedrive Business prompts a login box for email address, so after assigning email address and clickign next gets prompted again to input password.
</p>
<p>Error &gt; We are unable to connect right now. please check your network and try again later.</p>
<p>I can open Onedrive for business and navigate to folder and create a new file there no problem, i can also save the office document locally and copy it to folder.</p>
<p>Also activating Office for Mac from installation on portal page does same authentication looping between 365 page and sts page, this isn't&nbsp;same for&nbsp;everyone but we are seeing more and more problems with this.</p>
<p>Currently on AD FS 2.0</p>
<p>Advise welcome on where to start looking for issues? </p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>Let’s start with some detailed questions so we can better understand the current situation:<br />
1. How did you migrate your users to Office 365?<br />
2. When did you configure the ADFS deployment? Did it work before, or this is the first time you try it?</p>
<p>I noticed that there’re issues when you try to access the Office 365 Portal and activate Office for Mac.
<strong>Let’s focus on the Portal first</strong>. Please let us know the following things:<br />
a. After the redirection to the STS page, the failure occurs. Can you provide a screenshot of the failed page? Just click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> (under the reply box) -&gt; <strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> to upload your screenshot.<br />
b. Does the issue occur to every federated user?<br />
c. Do the affected users try to access the Portal from inside the domain-joined environment or outside it? Please let them test both.<br />
d. Please run the SSO test at <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer</a> -&gt;
<strong>Office 365</strong> -&gt; <strong>Office 365 General Tests</strong> -&gt; <strong>
Office 365 Single Sign-On Test</strong>. If the test fails, please provide the entire test result by using private message. I have sent you a PM, and you’ll see it at
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Looking forward to your updates.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates. There’re two facts that can prove the SSO service should be healthy: the SSO test result is successful; and the issue doesn’t occur to every federated user. Can you find anything different between a workable user and an affected
 one? Are they on the same federated domain?</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that your screenshot was captured from Word 2016 for Mac. What about on the
<a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Portal</a> page? Is it the same error message? If yes, please then check if you can find any detailed error reported in the
<strong>Event Viewer</strong> log of your ADFS server. You can provide what you find by replying to my private message that I sent previously.</p>
<p>And if there’re different error messages when the affected user tries to access the Office 365 Portal, can you please show another screenshot?</p>
<p>Your efforts on this are appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Allen,</p>
<p>Nothing is noticable between a working user and a none working user. Have the same licence applied from within the portal, and users can login to the portal with no issue. But we do have to do a double step....</p>
<p>If we login to portal.office.com we enter our federadation address.. It then passes through to our OWA page to login with the users username and password.</p>
<p>It will then log them into there portal. <br />
<br />
The similar process for Office for Mac (Application) prompt for a username/password on sts page aswell which fails????</p>
<p>I have tried navigating through the logs on one of our ADFS servers but nothing is standing out... Which locations do i have to look through and is there any additional logging i can enable to make this process any easier?</p>
<p>I have noticed that we also have several users in my office that within office tryign to opena file and save it back to Onedrive for Business constantly prompts for a address and then always fails (Windows - Office 2013) dont know if its related?</p>
<p>Look frward to hearing from you</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>Please see the following steps to get some logs which are specifically about your ADFS services:<br />
1. Open the <strong>Event Viewer</strong> on your ADFS server.<br />
2. In the left panel, select <strong>Windows Logs</strong> -&gt; <strong>Application</strong>. Right-click
<strong>Application</strong> and select <strong>Create Custom View</strong>.<br />
3. Select <strong>By source</strong> and choose all that is related to ADFS as the
<strong>Event sources</strong> (such as <strong>AD FS</strong>, <strong>AD FS Auditing</strong>,
<strong>AD FS Tracing</strong>).<br />
4. Click <strong>OK</strong> to let it run, and see if you can find any errors. Warnings could be just ignored.</p>
<p>I had sent you a private message about the RCA test before. You can just reply to it to provide any logs (containing errors) you can find.</p>
<p>And it is possible that the OneDrive for Business issue you mentioned is related. Let’s focus on the Event Viewer logs first.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>Thank you for the detailed feedback. I see that you have checked the KB which contains some troubleshooting information. Your efforts on this are appreciated.</p>
<p>When checking the Event Viewer logs you provided, I found that Event ID 364 was logged often. Regarding this error, it is suggested you update the password for the ADFS application pool in IIS or reset the password for both the service account and the application
 pool. Please refer to <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2270.update-the-ad-fs-2-0-service-identity-password-in-a-federation-server-farm.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update the AD FS 2.0 Service Identity Password in a Federation Server Farm</a>.</p>
<p>After that, please restart your domain controller as well as your ADFS server, and then see if the issues persist. (Please do this at an off-work period.)</p>

<h2>            Pro Tip&#58; Updating to Build 9926 - consider uninstalling third party Antivirus</h2>
                    After a few hours of battling "system service exception" BSODs and Windows Update errors when attempting to update to build 9926 using both Preview Update and ISO installation methods, I decided to uninstall Symantec Endpoint Protection 12.1.4 (instead
 of simply disabling). Viola, was able to finally install the newest Technical Preview without any issues. Hope this helps some of you going forward, as there is obviously some service/driver conflict during the upgrade process!

    <title>Nokia 830 Firmaware Unknown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick openshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 830 Firmaware Unknown</h2>
                    <p>I have been running Windows 10 on my Nokia 830 since it was released to the public. Recently the screen has been going black. I managed to fix it temporarily by doing a soft reset. Last night this happened again but the temporary fix failed to work but I
 could still ring myself etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading a post I tried to execute a hard reset but no explanation mark appeared so I followed the hard reset combination.My phone now only responds to a soft reset with a vibration and seems to do nothing else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since found another post about the Windows Device Recovery Tool. I have downloaded v 3.11.34101 and followed the instructions. It does not detect the phone at first but clicking on the available button and telling it that it is a Nokia and carrying
 out a soft reset the phone is detected. I get a screen saying Model: Lumia phone and Firmware version: unknown. "Package not available for this phone" with the install software button greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After leaving phone while I wrote this note the laptop has made noises of the phone connecting and disconnecting and finally offered me a model and a firmware. Model 380 and Firmware:02177.00000.15184.36007. Still no package available
 but I can now access the storage on my phone via the PC but the screen is still blank. I can only assume the hardware reset was happening in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain how to get round this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            Turn your phone off and press volume up and the start button (Windows button) and at this time a lightning bolt and a gear icon will appear and now you can connect your phone to your PC/Laptop and your phone will be detected by Windows Device Recovery
 Tool.

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest on this is that I could not get a Firmware package because one of the Microsoft Servers was down. B2X, Microsofts&nbsp;3rd party support supplier had told me this was because of a driver on my PC but could not tell me which driver! I paid for the privilege
 of getting the wrong answer! I would suggest such partners are provided with more detail of service status when they take on any support contract.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to re install the Firmware and my screen came back with Windows 8.1. I was pleased I had solved the problem. I reinstalled&nbsp;Windows 10 and rebuilt my phone. I then started to use it happily until yet again the screen went blank. I managed to get
 it to work again with a soft reset. This kept me going for another 12-24 hours. Current status is it is&nbsp;blank again and reinstalling the Firmware with the WDRT has not helped. Not sure if a hard reset&nbsp;is required but this is difficult without seeing the screen
 to confirm what I am doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told I could send my phone in to B2X&nbsp;but this will take weeks and until they see it there is no view on cost. I think it is looking like a new phone and with the lack of Windows phones in the UK market and support lacking I suspect another customer
 may be lost back to Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your efforts to help me.&nbsp;</p>

            Alignment is an attribute of the paragraph object so using CTRL+L will affect the whole paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the lines that do not appear to have additional spaces between the words, that is because that combination of words happens to fill the
 line more completely.

            When you use "full" justification in 2013 it spreads letters and words based on length of text on the line.&nbsp; But there are 2 types of "Full" justification. One is on the keyboard, the other is only available as a keyboard shortcut.<br />
<br />
Here is a quick example, along with the shortcut keys for the 4 types of justification. I suspect you are using the last one "Distributed Justification". Take note of the widely different spacing in the various lines of the yellow and red highlighted section:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/485b2870-fd3d-40ec-bebc-b1ec4d4bf1eb" /><br />
<br />
Among other font terminology there is a good example of the types of justification in this article:<br />

            Rohn: The last link gives a 404 error.<br />
<br />
One other possible cause of large gaps between words in fully justified text is if a line break is used on the last line rather than a paragraph break.<br />
Line break = Shift-Enter<br />
Paragraph break = Enter<br />
<br />
With a line break, Word will try to spread the last line out, with a paragraph break, it will not.<br />
<br />
Two additional notes:<br />
<br />
1) Fully justified text may look nice, but it is harder to read.<br />
<br />
2) Centering and justification of text in Word is done aligning to the right and left
<i>indents</i>, not the page margins. These are often the same but may be different. The indents are paragraph formatting settings; the margins are section (not page) settings.

            Sorry about the dead link, I didn't check it before pasting. That is why I long ago decided to copy "important" information that I find on the web. There is no guarantee that it will still be there in the future<br />
<br />
This copy of the page is unfortunately missing the graphics:<br />
http://web.archive.org/web/20120620010954/http://designfestival.com/perfect-your-typography-with-tracking-kerning-leading-and-other-typesetting-techniques<br />
<br />
If you really need the graphics to understand the article I'll upload them for you.<br />
<br />
The 2 points you make are valid. However, many people are used to justified text from reading newspapers. As long as the justification is done with discretion, ie NOT using the incompetent pre 2013 MS Word default, I do not find it harder to read and find it
 aesthetically pleasing.&nbsp; I was hugely disappointed when many years ago I was forced (by employer) to switch from WordPerfect to MS Word and I found out how BADLY justification was done in Word.<br />

            <p>Hey Doug. I have an issue with a gap between my pages that shouldn't be there. I don't know if you can see, but the last words 'George protested.' and 'No,no.' are supposed to be together. I tried to simply write the words in and it wouldn't indent in the
 proper place. I adjusted the page layout to be the same as the others, but it still didn't work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Verify that these text lines are in fact a single paragraph as follows: Display nonprinting marks. If you find a paragraph mark (¶) after "protested" and "my," then you have three paragraphs, which you can merge by deleting the paragraph marks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the lines are in the same paragraph already, make sure that the indent is set to "First line" as opposed to "Left" in the Paragraph dialog box—or drag the indent indicators on the horizontal ruler.

                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been recently using onenote to organize my note. Unfortunately some of my pages have gone missing. The funny thing is that it disappears without a trace. I have checked the history and search the whole notebook database and it does not show up anywhere.
 The ones that did go missing are subpages of something so i am thinking it has something to do with that.</p>

    <title>Switching users on a single domain login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonymarrian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switching users on a single domain login</h2>
                    
<p>We use shared computers at school with a generic Windows domain login of "Teacher". Thus, "Teacher" logs in to the Windows domain and *then* signs in to Office 365 to use the resources. On finishing, they use "Switch Account" to sign out, ready for the next
 user. This is necessary because I need to know who is entering the data in our Access app. I did ask this question last year but cannot for the life of me find the thread as to how to prepare the computer properly for this. We are now running Windows 10 and
 "first release" Office 365 2016. Please would you be very kind and remind me of the steps necessary to allow a single computer to be shared in this way (with a single Windows domain login)?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>With best wishes - Anthony</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Do you want to install Office 365 desktop applications on one computer with Shared Computer Activation feature? If yes, we need to use Office Deployment Tool to intall Office 365 ProPlus with Shared Computer Activation feature enabled. Below are two articles
 for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782860.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Overview of shared computer activation for Office 365 ProPlus</a><br />
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/educloud/2015/03/20/how-to-setup-shared-computer-activation-step-by-step-for-your-education-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to setup Shared Computer Activation step by step for your education environment</a><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Office 2013 and Office 2016 have different Office Deployment Tool.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If anything is misunderstood or you have more requirement, please let us know more details about your requirement and envrionment. E.g. is the domain “Teacher” a local AD domain or a domain which is purchased and added to Office 365 portal? What services you
 need to share on the computer? Do you want to <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2015/09/11/step-by-step-setting-up-ad-fs-and-enabling-single-sign-on-to-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enable the Single Sign-on feature for Office 365</a>?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>One of the prerequisites for Shared Computer Activation is that users need their own domain login and their own user profile. Our situation is that the individual teachers use a single login (user name: "teacher"), and then switch Office 365 accounts within
 that login. Despite the dire warnings when you do this, this has been working well. Note the domain is a Windows Essentials 2012 domain. The services shared on the computer (apart from Office 365) are internet, file and print. Since upgrading to Office 2016
 and Windows 10, we are getting messages about "another account from your organization is already signed in on this computer" and I am wondering whether this is because the laptop is not correctly configured to allow the scenario above.</p>
<p>BTW, I looked at the Single Sign-on feature above but that appears way beyond my pay-grade!</p>
<p>With best wishes - Anthony</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>The error message "<strong>another account from your organization is already signed in on this computer</strong>" you got is an expected behavior, as we can't use two or more Office 365 accounts
<strong>belonging to the same tenant</strong> to login into the same Office programs on one computer with
<strong>one generic Windows domain login of "Teacher"</strong>. &nbsp;This kind of operation is not supported&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the same Office program installed on the same computer, please consider using Shared computer activation.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>Hi Olga,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try Optimizing media in your presentation for compatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On the File tab of the Ribbon, select Info.</p>
<p>2. If the media in your presentation was inserted in a format that might have compatibility issues when played on another device, the
<strong>Optimize Compatibility</strong> option will appear. If it doesn’t appear, you don’t have compatibility issues and are ready to share.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdc8eb2e-3f15-4069-93f5-c0737f0cd1ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdc8eb2e-3f15-4069-93f5-c0737f0cd1ab" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Select Optimize Compatibility*. PowerPoint will improve any media that requires optimization.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75aa6d9c-54fb-4ffb-8ca0-4b406211d856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75aa6d9c-54fb-4ffb-8ca0-4b406211d856" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>When the <strong>Optimize Compatibility</strong> button appears, it provides a summary of resolutions of potential playback issues. It also provides a list of the number of occurrences of media in the presentation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to this article for more information: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Are-you-having-video-or-audio-playback-issues-e0a94444-8ea7-4a00-974b-6ad0d6edc4b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Are you having video or audio playback issues?</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, would you please provide the version of PowerPoint? You can check it in
<strong>File &gt; Account </strong>and send the screenshot to us.</p>

    <title>How to return to last stable build, and get out of the insider - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edcaffrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to return to last stable build, and get out of the insider program&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been with the insider program since the beginning, but have grown frustrated with the program, and especially the preview builds. &nbsp;I've sent in many feedback reports, and tried my best to do my part. &nbsp;That being said, in the year plus that I have been
 sending feedback and trying to work through all the issues that preview builds bring, in turn I have received only ONE useful response on any of the problems/issues I've uncovered and reported. &nbsp; &nbsp;Many of the problems/issues I've experienced with preview builds
 have remained uncorrected for that entire time... things such as each newly installed build breaking sound drivers.... that has not been fixed in a year's time! &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; The latest preview build just pushed me over the edge...it is simply a train wreck! &nbsp;How is it that so many basic elements of an OS can be "broken", and worked in the previous build? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; In short, I'm ready to get off this ride, and just have an OS that works, and is dependable/predictable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; This brings me to my question..... I assume that I can just "reset" my pc to the latest version of Win 10 by installing with the Media Creation tool, and turning off insider builds..... am I correct in this thinking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I'm beginning to think that MS is doing itself more harm then good with this "ongoing" development thing.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your input! &nbsp;Part of me wants to keep going with the windows insider program, but the frustration has just gotten the best of me. &nbsp;One would assume that MS would keep wanting to "move forward" with successive Windows 10 builds (including the preveiws),
 but from my perspective, it seems to be "one step forward, and two steps back" with each new build. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I'm in the process of taking the steps outlined in the link...... hopefully it will get my system to a stable, predictable state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Its been fun, but after a year of seemingly being ignored, its time to move on.</p>

            <p>Well, that was a bomb. &nbsp;Those instructions will work, but only for a clean install. &nbsp;There doesn't seem to be any way using that method that will allow for keeping settings and apps/programs. &nbsp;Tried to go the backup/restore route too, but trying to restore
 settings and apps/program after install does not work (error message).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Seems like I'm trapped within this insider preview until MS decideds to release something where everything works. &nbsp;I was afraid that this would be the case. &nbsp;I've gone from frustrated to angry at this point!</p>

            Just opt out of insider previews in settings and win10 will sort it out. These builds are best suited for no-production machines, aside from some program favorites most like to have. True, some of the builds were rough but the last 2 have gone surprisingly
 well

            <p>I'll give that a go and see how things wash out (just opt out in settings). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I was thinking just the opposite about the builds....although there have been annoyances with all of them, these last two have been (for me) the least thought out, &nbsp;and the poorest execution of all the preview builds. &nbsp; As I mentioned, the "One step forward,
 and two steps back" thing is what's pushed me out of the insider program. &nbsp; Thanks for the input!</p>

            <p>Well, tried the above.....just opting out of insider builds, but the OS won't allow it, and according to the link provided in "settings" it requires a clean install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; So, anybody have any idea just how a person can revert to the Windows 10 RTM
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; This is starting to be one of those things that was easy to get into.......but a royal pain in the backside to get out of (the windows insider program)</p>

            <p>This should be pretty easy, since there has only been one Insider build released since the Fall Update RTM build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you haven't removed any of the previous installation folders, you should be able to go to Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Recovery, then "Go back to an earlier build" and get back to the regular RTM build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are there, be sure to go to Windows Update and verify that you have stopped Insider Preview builds.</p>

            <p>Thanks! &nbsp;I tried that one, along with the rest of the things I mentioned......... all I got was an error message that stated windows could not restore this computer. &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm just about to the point of wiping everything out and starting from scratch....but
 since thats a several hour process to get everything reinstalled, I'm going to hold off until I get a "slow" day.</p>

            <p>I actually have fun with these builds, in short the last 5 months from 10240 insider -&gt;10240 RTM -&gt; 10586.36 RTM -&gt; 10586.36 clean install (media creation tool) -&gt; 10240 RTM&nbsp; system image reinstall -&gt;10586.36 insider -&gt; 11082.1000 and all is well. Several
 stories in between these :-). Honestly.... don't let it drive ya nuts, sync all you can to Onedrive and create a folder on a USB to put all personal/private stuff you don't want to sync to retrieve later. Some programs are not going to reinstall anyways, even
 ccleaner for some reason. Incidently, I no longer use ccleaner as I really believe it can't keep up with registry changes and system directories presented with each build. I discovered this during the countless hours I spent digging into the different builds.
 11082 runs so well on this tortured Asus that I went and upgraded another Asus from win8.1 and that went real well. That one I left as RTM sine I install heavy vector/graphic sign software. If you have a VIA sound chip keep in mind the VIA website now has
 the win10 drivers/software you need. I haven't had a Realtec driver problem. Soooo.... give it another go, insider or RTM, and be patient, I found setting the machine aside after install left on and connected for an hour or so &nbsp;allows time to sort everything
 out...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry, things do really sound messed up. At this point your planned clean install sounds like the best way to go. If nothing else, it would give you some confidence everything was installed properly, rather than leaving you with doubts from a kludgy recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope everything goes smoothly.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>All formatting goes when using Word to edit Docx on OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> algycole  say:</h3>
<h2>            All formatting goes when using Word to edit Docx on OneDrive</h2>
                    This is a recent problem and does not happen on the iPhone. When I look at a Word docx on OneDrive, I can review it fine. All the formatting etc is ok. &nbsp;When I press the Word editor button at the top of the OneDrive screen, Word opens the document but
 all all the formatting has gone, words are missing, some text colour has changed to white so can’t be seen. &nbsp;Everything worked fine before the latest updates. And i don’t have this problem using Word and OneDrive on the iPhone. I sent a request to the OneDrive
 team but had no response. What’s wrong ?

<strong>Office Online</strong> or from the <strong>OneDrive desktop app</strong>?</li><li>If it is from the OneDrive desktop app, which build and version is it? Which device operating system are you using?</li><li>If it is from the Office Online, does it happen on all browsers?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages? If yes, please provide us a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4?auth=1">screenshot</a></strong>.</li><li>Is it happening to all files or just to a specific file?</li></ul>

</p><p>Hi. I’ve tried all the above and the problem is the same. I’ve tried opening recent documents and those from a few months ago and a year or so. Its always the same: &nbsp;formatting disappears, word colours go to white and big gaps in the text. I’ve opened the
 same documents in the iphone Word app and there’s no problem. So its something to do with the iPad Word app. &nbsp;Its frustrating as I cant do any work on the move. &nbsp;Can you please help !&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bob hi. Good to hear that I’m not alone - but its not good news really. &nbsp;No, not a single MS person came back. One of the recent ios for Word updates added a button top right to make it viewable on a mobile device. This seems to sort most of the issue -
 but not all of it. Its still a bug. Not very happy. Algy.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016&#58; Unable to open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimclemmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016&#58; Unable to open</h2>
                    <p>About a month ago, I purchased a Lenovo think pad. &nbsp;It runs Windows 7 Pro (64 bit) and Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no problems with the software except for Outlook. &nbsp;I had issues transferring files from my old machine that ran Outlook 2007 on a 32 bit Windows 7 platform. &nbsp;I finally resolved those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had intermittent problems with Outlook not starting. &nbsp;The startup would get to "Processing" and go no further. &nbsp;By starting Outlook in safe mode and removing the Add ins, I was able to circumvent the start up issues. &nbsp;This past Friday, the start up issue
 returned. &nbsp;When I attempted to start Outlook in safe mode, I get an error dialog box with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry, but Outlook has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Outlook will need to be closed<br />
as a result.&nbsp;Would you like us to repair now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three buttons: Repair Now, Help and Close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair now seemingly has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking through forums, went to properties and compatibility and unchecked the compatibility mode box and checked the run as Administrator box. &nbsp;No effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By going into the Control Panel and User Accounts and Mail, I was able to successfully test the account settings and send a test e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p><span>Hello Jim,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Since you have tried the basic steps to start Outlook, let us check if this issue is happening due to a corrupt Profile in Outlook 2016.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may setup your </span><span><span>email account in a new Outlook Profile and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Create a new Outlook Profile following the steps from the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After creating the new Outlook Profile, setup your email account, automatically or manually - in the new Profile.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once the account is setup </span></span><span>allow
</span><span><span>Outlook 2016 to complete the download/synchronization. If you are using an IMAP, Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Active Sync account it may take a few minutes or a few hour or 24-36 hours to complete synchronization depending on the amount
 of emails in your email account. This is similar to the initial sync during first account setup.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check if you are able to open Outlook normally in the new Profile. Try the above steps and let us know the result.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

            <p>Thanks for the help. &nbsp;I reached an acceptable solution, though not an ideal one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problematic file was apparently the pst file that I imported from my old computer. &nbsp;I had some issues with the import initially. &nbsp;I did the import when I got the new computer around Thanksgiving. &nbsp;I was able to get it to work with the imported pst as
 on profile and second profile for current mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked acceptably for about three weeks and suddenly Outlook wouldn't open. &nbsp;I tried creating a new profile, but nothing changed. &nbsp;I deleted the imported profile and now Outlook works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem with that solution is that I have to go back to my old laptop for contacts and email prior to November.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Activation Procedure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> normanzzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Needing a little more information on how activation works. I understand to most people you upgrade make a restore media and then if something happens you are good to go fresh install matches all components and activates. In the past with previous version
 of windows when certain pieces of hardware were changed due to system upgrades you had to reactivate windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is exactly how will this play out? I have multiple PCs running windows. Can I make and use one restore media or will I need to make one from each different machine (all running 64bit home)? And when a component in machine gets changed will I
 need to reactivate and make another copy of my restore media or continue using the same one?</p>

<p><span>The following changes are examples of hardware changes that will

<ul>
<li><span>HDD/SSD </span></li><li><span>Video card </span></li><li><span>Adding extra memory</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>only</strong> hardware changes that can negatively impact the activation status once you upgrade are changes to the:</span></p>

<li><span>CPU </span></li><li><span>TPM </span></li><li><span>Motherboard replacement</span></li></ul>

<h3> johnjacksonuz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 1520 lock&#47;power button not locking</h2>
                    I have the Nokia Lumia 1520(red-if that matters) and I have had it about a year and have only noticed minor software issues. It does have a few scratches, but I dont believe that they are contributing any to my problem. Just today, around 4 p.m, the lock
 button on my phone stopped working. Not entirely, as I can still power on/off my phone, but I can not lock my phone with it or wake my phone up. If anyone knows any solution, any help would be greatly appreciated.

 pressing &amp; holding the volume down &amp; the power keys for 10-15 sec? You may also consider updating the phone's SW (if there's available) by going to Settings &gt; phone update &gt; check for updates. I would also suggest updating the system settings: Store &gt; ...

            <p>This just happened to me as well, 2 weeks after my 12 month warrantee expired.&nbsp; I just worked through the windows recovery tool an reinstalled everything from the firmware up. It still isn't working and AT&amp;T told me to pound sand.&nbsp; Ironically, I can still
 do a reoboot which&nbsp;has to mean the power but is working in some form,&nbsp;just&nbsp;not to&nbsp;power up, or down the&nbsp;phone.&nbsp;</p>

            It worked for a few hours and now its back exactly how it was. This is very frustrating. I have restarted it many times holding lock and volume down buttons. Everything is up to date. I don't know what else could be wrong. I have done everything you have

I&nbsp;will&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;contact&nbsp;Nokia&nbsp;care.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

Ex.&nbsp;One&nbsp;touch&nbsp;lockscreen,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;your&nbsp;press&nbsp;on&nbsp;that,&nbsp;phone&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;lock&nbsp;screen&nbsp;auto.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;confirm&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;double&nbsp;tap&nbsp;to&nbsp;wake&nbsp;up&nbsp;feature&nbsp;is&nbsp;enabled&nbsp;or&nbsp;not&nbsp;in&nbsp;settings&nbsp;app,&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;wake&nbsp;up&nbsp;the&nbsp;screen&nbsp;again&nbsp;from&nbsp;lock&nbsp;screen.&nbsp;<br />

            I've done this, however the problem still exists. Don't waste your time. From my research, the root cause was a result of W8.1 Cyan update. I totally regret updating with this pos and crippling my phone. The right thing for Microsoft to do would be adding
 a "Power Off" app to the Windows store. Shame on you Microsoft for ruining my $600 phone.

            <p>Same thing just started happening to me...</p>
<p>For me - Seems to be related to Bluetooth - if you hit the button at just the right time during a connection to a device (usually happens to me while connecting or disconnection to my car audio) - then the power button wigs out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Double tap the screen still
 works to wake the&nbsp;device.&nbsp; I have used the Phone with the double screen tap for a couple of hours - and EVENTUALLY - the power button does seem to come back to life and work.&nbsp; Although at that point I always power off and do a restart.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting certificate error in Internet Explorer 11 and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the exact and complete error message you get?</li></ul>
<p>A websites's certificate provides identification of the web server. If the certificate has an error, it might indicate that your connection has been intercepted or that the web server is misrepresenting its identity. If you're absolutely positive of the
 website's identity, you know that your connection hasn't been compromised, and you understand the risks, you can choose to go to the website. However, we recommend that you don't ignore a certificate warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open your Internet Explorer browser then go to <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click on <strong>Security</strong> tab. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Click on <strong>Trusted sites</strong>, then click the <strong>Sites</strong> button.
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; On the "<strong>Add this website to the zone:</strong>" URL bar, type the complete URL address.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Click on <strong>Add</strong> button. </p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Once you already added all URL addresses, click&nbsp;the <strong>Close</strong> button.
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Click on <strong>Apply</strong> or <strong>OK</strong> button then close your Internet Explorer browser.<br />
<strong><br />

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>You have to have friends online to chat to them.<br />
Note that if they have set their privacy settings to offline then they will not appear. Facebook has different privacy settings for third party apps. WP7 people hub counts as third party. They will need to adjust their settings to allow this.</p>

            Ha yes I agree that they should be online.<br />
The thing is when I check fb chat in other third party im's and also in normal fb app they are online and I am able to message them.<br />
I presume it might be problm with the phone software.
