<h2>            Create Appointment with Contact</h2>
                    
<p>When I create an Outlook&nbsp;Appointment from a Contact the Appointment does not show the contact name so I have no idea who the Appointment is with when I look at my calendar. Shouldn't there be a field on the Appointment window that shows the contact name
 (from which I created the Appointment)? Including the contact phone number on the Appointment would be nice too.</p>

    <title>6710 GPS doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> super_2002  say:</h3>
<h2>            6710 GPS doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought 6710. GPS in the phone wont find any single satelite without A-GPS support. When I turn on A-GPS it finds satelites and gets fix immediately. Without A-GPS, it always show the message "Waiting for GPS".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was on the open field and my phone could not find any satelite for&nbsp;over 30 min!</p>
<p>Who can give me some hints&nbsp;and what should I do? The only option I have turned on is 'Integrated GPS'. The A-GPS is turned off, network based off, blootooth gps off. Anyone has the same problem?</p>
<p>Please Help!</p>

<p><font>Sorry I cannot help you because I have got exactly&nbsp;the same problem with my 6710. I also spoke with a guy from Nokia, I thought this was sorted out, but later I realised that he switched on A-GPS. But there has to be a solution without
 Internet-access. Without packages iam paying in my own country 1 € for 32 Kilobytes (yes "kilo" no error)! I do not dare to ask, how is it in another country, where you usually rely on GPS. I am courious to find a solution too.</font></p>

<p>Just got of the phone with&nbsp;our cellphone supplier: The device that&nbsp;I returned to them on monday was checked yesterday, and they&nbsp;came to the same conclusion: broken GPS-unit, DOA. They've only tested the usage of it, not opened it&nbsp;or run any diagnostics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They sent me a new one yesterday, which I should have in hand by tomorrow. No questions asked.</p>
<p>I will post my experiance with the new one here.</p>

<p>All right,</p>
<p>Got the new one now. I asked the supplier to break the seal and test the phone before sending it to me. He agreed to do so. So the box i've got came with broken seal, which also means that he probably has tested it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sim card installed&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;phone started --&gt;&nbsp;Volume off --&gt;&nbsp;Maps application started:</p>
<p>- Compass calibrates right away.</p>
<p>- Position showed on map (my position) is a little off, but it shows same position as the first phone.</p>
<p>- 20 minutes, still not fixed on any sats. Note that A-gps function is turned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blasted...</p>
<p>I'm not going to call them today and tell them that this one is faulty too. I'll use the weekend to see if I can get it to work outside of city, in car, etc..</p>
<p>Cause if this phone was tested before sent to me, it might something that I do wrong. Except the fact that I don't do anything but switching it on and starting Maps, like the instructions tells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second note: When I got this phone I had to turn of the A-gps, which could indicate that A-gps was switched 'on' when the tested it. Not sure if that means anything though.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folks, just a quicky: please test to see if your phone charges thru the usb-cable. Mine doesn't. Not the fist one either....</p>

<p>/discussions/board/message?board.id=phones&amp;message.id=64276#M64276</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, it might take a while to get the first ever position fix with AGPS disabled. So don't give up just yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regards to charging, your phone can only be charged through the charging port and not the data port. However you can get a cable such as the CA-100 which would still allow you to charge it from a USB port on your pc/laptop.</p>

<p>Ah, thanks for the response. Yes, I will try during the weekend and also have the mentioned review in the back of my head while testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only thing strange is that my supplier tells that it worked&nbsp;right away, but it might have been the way he tested it. Mabye he just started Maps and got My position, and therefore thought it was ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks so far. Let you all&nbsp;know on Monday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About usb-charging: Dooh!</p>

<br />
If you don't mind a very dim screen and the lights going out quickly then you can use it all the time.<br />
<br />
It only really makes a difference whilst using your phone. It doesn't save any power if your phone is sat there unused on standby.<br />
<br />
It doesn't reduce the performance of the phone or effect programs.<br />

<p>This time i am not interested in performing the update unless nokia assures&nbsp;that a new problem will not arise. Please advise me Is it advisable to update or to avoid it.</p>

<p>Welcome to the forum thi4parent1984, I would advise you to receive the updates as they become available, if you are worried about any updates causing bugs you can always return to these forums to resolve the issue. However updates are always an improvment
 on previous versions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The problems you experienced after updating to Belle was because it was a major update to the phones OS and the general advice given at the time was to perform a factory reset after the update, which would have cleared out any old junk files left over from
 the previous firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;These four updates that are being offered to you are minor updates so you won't experience the same issues as before.</p>

<p>ha ha that was a joke to say that updates are always meant to improve the devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>crippling regressions after "update" for my and my friends' devices:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. C7: packet data logging gone after anna update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. C7: no equaliser for music player after belle update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. E7: adobe 2.5 (has fullscreen view &amp; opens pwd prtected files)&nbsp; "unable to install" after belle update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. E7 &amp; C7: midnight themes are gone and replaced with some ugly piece of bleep that gives neither choice nor pleasant UX for user</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. E7 &amp; C7: SMS character counting lost after belle update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. E7 belle: phone memory reduced to 225mb after microsoft office apps installation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. E7 belle: microsoft office apps editing only docx/xlsx/pptx files. earlier versions not editable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Exchange Active Sync in E7 belle does not display HTML for hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Junk folders are not synchronized in nokia messaging app after belle</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. lock screen button in belle (C&amp; &amp; E7): USELESS AND PRACTICAL JOKE: touching anywhere around the rectangle area in the lock button unlocks the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any answers? Anyone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW CAN BELLE BE AN UPGRADE?</p>

<p>HI Sheldrick</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the issues i have highlighted in my earlier post, NO SOLUTION is available in this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, they are part of "known issues" in the belle update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only consistent "solution" i notice in this forum is to ask us to do a "factory reset", "three button salute", " *#7370# " and "delete and restore" ... etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are detailed tutorials for doing "factory reset". Sometimes, the issues are resolved after factory reset, but a majority of the times the issues do not get resolved and the user has to put up with a crippled product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take "unable to install ovi store" frinstance. All those detailed instructions about installing those 4 qt files in order, restarting the device, etc., all useless in my experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My nokia messaging issue with my address &lt;username&gt;@msn.com is still unresolved. Nokia messaging / email.nokia.com / ... etc says "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/8EED152C-A3A8-4102-B399-3EB8A57FA7AC">Unable to connect with the

<h3> sheenamci  say:</h3>
<h2>            PPT 2010 Macro&#47; Keep Bold-Italic formatting with Apply Notes Master To All</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using this code (http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00760_Reapply_the_Notes_Master_to_each_Notes_Page_in_a_presentation.htm) to change the notes text size on all pages of a project. We work with 2 versions of each project, one with text size 17, the other
 with size 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macro works well, but removes all of the bold or italic formatting. Is there a way to modify the text size and re-apply the notes master WITHOUT losing that formatting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Sheena</p>

            <p>I don't see how because reapplying the notes master (even manually) will destroy bold etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just need to change the font size you can just say:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Notes_Text()<br />
Dim osld As Slide<br />
Dim oshp As Shape<br />
For Each osld In ActivePresentation.Slides<br />
For Each oshp In osld.NotesPage.Shapes<br />
If oshp.Type = msoPlaceholder Then<br />
If oshp.PlaceholderFormat.Type = 2 Then<br />
oshp.TextFrame2.TextRange.Font.Size = 12<br />
End If<br />
End If<br />
Next oshp<br />
Next osld<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could add to this to for example change the slide size</p>

            <p>If you just need to change the text size, there's no need to reapply the notes master; just go to the notes master page and change the text size for the notes master text placeholder. &nbsp;Any text that's had bold/italic applied on individual notes pages will
 stay that way, though the size will change.</p>

<h2>            Adjusting the height of the header. </h2>
                    
<p>I have a macro that was created in house and it drops it into the header.&nbsp; On one of my users machines, when the macro is dropped into her header, it increases the size of her header.&nbsp; The macro is created in a text box and it seems the only way to adjust
 the height of the header is to adjust the height of the text box.&nbsp; I do not want to adjust the height of the text box because of the information that is in there.&nbsp; Please let me know if you can help.</p>

<p>Hello Sherry,</p>
<p>if you need to adjust the height of your header, then click into header and use vertical ruler on your right.</p>
<p>By pulling it up and down you can increase or decrease its size.</p>

 those files back that I had saved then deleted the new account I had made . So by one letter being capitalized it was causing the error

            Details which version/build of Preview? the worst thing that you can do is pull the plug, always just hold the power button down until the system shuts down, you may need to do a clean install as the hard drive may be corrupt now.

    <title>Terrible Battery life - Nokia 6300 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1frothy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terrible Battery life - Nokia 6300</h2>
                    Just got my brand new Nokia 6300 Black through Virgin Mobile Australia. The phone is solid and quality, the screen rocks.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
The Battery life is atrocious. And certainly not what Nokia advertises on their website.<br />
<br />
Yesterday morning my battery was fully charged. I received a 5 minute call, sent maybe 20 Plain Text SMS. Just like that before the day was out - Battery Flat.<br />
<br />
This is really not acceptable. Has Nokia shipped dodgy or underpowered batteries with this phone? What can Nokia do for me?<br />
<br />
I'm not interested in sending in my phone for repairs, not unless I get a brand new replacement sent before I send my phone in. I can't afford to be without my phone.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate some assistance.

            Remember it takes a few charges and discharges before the battery is at it's best so it should improve.<br />
<br />
With that kind of useage you should expect two days life with this model. The battery life quoted is in ideal conditions and are never a true reflection on how someone uses a mobile.<br />
<br />
Doing the following things will drain battery power quickly:<br />
<br />
1) Bluetooth always set to on.<br />
2) Data connection set to "always on"<br />
3) Screen savers with long time outs<br />
4) Listening to music (mp3 or radio) with the headset or loudspeaker<br />
5) Constantly using it so the screen is lit for a long period of time.<br />
6) Being in a poor signal area which causes the phone to constantly search for a network.<br />
<br />
You should also check that any power saving options are enabled in the settings menu.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as for "what can nokia do for me?" the answer is nothing by asking your question here because this is a user to user support forum. The questions are answered by other nokia users, not nokia themselves. If you want to contact nokia use the "contact us"
 link at the top right of the page.

            First of all a big applause for the hardier construction of 6300.<br />
<br />
However, there remains some unaccepatble flaws in the design;<br />
<br />
1. The screen brightness of the 6300 cannot be changed as with other similiar Nokia models.<br />
<br />
2. 6300 does not have a calculator, a basic feature, and useful feature, in all todays phones.<br />
<br />
3. The speaker quality is terrible for a phone claimed to be an entertainment based one.<br />
<br />
4. Recording sensitivity is poor.<br />
<br />
Despite all this 6300 would have been much more perfect if it was 3G and equipped with the WiFi feature.<br />
<br />
Anyway the construction of the phone with stainless steel casing and the slek appearance make me crazy of the phone.

            I do not see it that tragic.<br />
<br />
1. As for the screen brightness, although it cannot be adjusted in the menus etc., it can be adjusted inside some java applications. So we might hope to see a software fix one day?<br />
<br />
2. My 6300 does have a calculator - surprisingly, it is somewhat hidden in the Organizer menu. Maybe have a look there?<br />
<br />
3. Who claims it is "an entertainment based phone"? I saw it advertised as a mainly work/office phone ... with some play features. Which is true.<br />
<br />
4. The last one is true - all it is good for is recording notes by yourself and for yourself ... but it is, after all, a phone, not a dedicated recording machine.

<br />
[You can find calculator in Organsier menu.]<br />
<br />
The speaker quality is terrible for a phone claimed to be an entertainment based one.<br />

[I think it is perfect.]<br />

4. Recording sensitivity is poor.<br />

[Recording sensitivity is good but when you play it it is bad.]<br />
<br />
Despite all this 6300 would have been much more perfect if it was 3G and equipped with the WiFi feature.<br />

[I accept ther was no 3G but there is WiFi in 6301.]<br />

            hi all,<br />
<br />
The 6300 handset is very durable, sleek and practical in 95% of its areas the main issues i've found are silly little problems overlooked by Nokia.<br />
<br />
The standard battery life with the Nokia 6300 is nothing short of disgraceful considering the write up on the handset. I hear there is a higher capacity battery that will allow a better lifetime, but why wouldn't it have been the default battery at point of
 sale? Though I know there are other chargers that will speed up the charging process a definite plus when you have short battery life :)<br />
<br />
Only other issues are memory card not recognised and apps failing, all can be sorted with a quick software upgrade, overall a fantastic handset!<br />
<br />
Hopefully Helpful,<br />

            A lot of people criticise the 6300, mainly on battery life and music volume levels; but as you can see here there are many of us who are perfectly happy with ours. It's not a super-special phone by any means, but it's a good reliable mid-range model that
 meets the needs of the average user well.<br />
<br />
Referring to the comment above about the 6301 having WiFi, everyone should note that it has WLAN capability for VOIP calling only - you can't browse the web using WLAN on the 6301.

            All,<br />
<br />
I have just bought a Nokia 6300 phone and have had the phone on a fist charge of almost 24 hours. it has been on the go now for over 24 hours and been put through the war prpoerly yesterday with sending and receiving via Bluetooth, exploring the menu's using
 various other options including making phone calls.<br />
<br />
So far the battery is not showing any signs of weakness and is still indicating the full battery sign. I will keep you all updated on how it goes.<br />
<br />
One question though, my old Motorola phone had a function called battery meter, which indicated exactly how full the battery was on a scalle from 1 to 100. I could not find this on the 6300. Does this function excist on the 6300? If it does in which menu?<br />
<br />

            OK, here I am again. we are now in day 3 from the battery and after an other half hour of calls last night my battery is now reduced to 1/3 according to the indicator.<br />
<br />

<br />
Watch this space folks!<br />

<p>Guruprasad - Thanks for the info. I had already tried all those tricks without luck. Most of it is for Word. Im having problems with excel and power point also. They give an error that they need to open in safe mode and then when continues gives the out
 of memory error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rohn007 - My thoughts exactly on this one. New memory, a problem, bad memory or installation. I have ran multiple memory tests on this and all pass. plus no other system problems. Running fine on all aspects except office.(I'm also an avid gamer and that
 has improved nicely since).</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>I read an article that says when upgrading from 2g to 4g on xp something unusual happens in that the actual memory gained is 1G thus if you check system memory it will read 3g..which mine does. It also said that for some reason windows grabs the other 1G
 for system loads etc (???) and this is the part of memory that is used for loading word etc and why out of memories occur. It had a fix or a work around for the problem but I cant find it!</p>
<p>Im pretty sure, at least part of it, had to do with virtual memory needing to be expanded. Anyways I tried that with no luck either.</p>
<p>Still checking and trying and still broken</p>

            Yes, 32bit windows can only handle about 3.1 gb. Exactly how much you see depends on how much of that 3.?&nbsp;gb&nbsp;is allocated for video use and other dedicated memory assignments. The extra 1gb is simply not seen, not used.

            I suggest that you start a new thread in which you give full details of the version of Windows, version of Office and how you are trying to start Word.

<h3> drsayandeepjana  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which video player to use on windows 7 PC to watch videos captured with Lumia 720 &#40;720p&#41;</h2>
                    I am using Nokia Lumia 720. Recently I took HD video of stage performance from dark auditorium. The videos are playing beautifully on my device. but when I transferred them to my PC running widows 7, Radeon graphics, Core i5, and tried playing via windows
 media player, the background stage lightings are looking harsh and the colours of onstage dancers distorted. However when I am using zune player, the colour profile is perfect. Also on KMPlayer if I change the Video rendering settings to Direct3d 9 RGB then
 colour profile is perfect, but not with default Enhanced Video Renderer. But I am always getting a system message that my colour profile is changed to Windows Basic temporarily by KMPlayer. Please help me out with this problem because KMPlayer or ZunePlayer
 won't be present in all computers and I will be unable to share my videos....

            It sounds like the third-party codecs installed on your machine are interfering with Windows Media Player. The default H.264 codec that ships with Windows 7 plays videos from Windows Phone just fine.<br />

<p>You keep referring to syncing my calendar but there is nothing to sync to. I am on the calendar, online on hotmail.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see events but these are events that I have previously deleted whilst events that should be current (eg. For today) are not showing. It is like my calendar has reverted to an old version and
 I need to restore events that have dissappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not on an app, I am not syncing to a phone, I am on the hotmail website on a desktop computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have also mentioned email. I have no problem with email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond.</p>

</p><p>Hi Ran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 is continuing to ruin my life. &nbsp;Right now I have a folder called Orders which shows up on One Drive on my Acer computer but which is completely absent on my Dell computer. &nbsp;You will probably ask me about the cloud icon on my taskbar. &nbsp;That is
 not showing up on either computer. &nbsp;Is there any way to make sure that my computers sync with each other?</p>

<p><span>Hi Janet,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I could understand your feelings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the steps below to help troubleshoot:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><del>Ctrl </del>Windows&nbsp;</strong>key&nbsp;<del>and</del> +&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>, type OneDrive, click
<strong>OneDrive</strong>, and check if the icon in the task bar appears on both your computers.</span></li><li><span>Go to your OneDrive in a browser, and check if the Orders folder shows up. If not, it has not been synced up.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your OneDrive icon still doesn’t appear in the task bar, please perform the steps below to reset your OneDrive on both your computers, and check if the Orders folder is synced up with a tick mark:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Make a backup of all the files in your OneDrive folder on your both computers.</span></li><li><span>Press &nbsp;<strong>Win</strong></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">dows</span></strong><span> key +
<strong>R</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Run window, enter: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li>Make sure the OneDrive icon in the notification area of the taskbar disappears and then re-appears after a minute or two. Here’s how to check: Look for the blue OneDrive cloud icon in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c48d1a2-b418-45c0-87f2-6071b8960538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c48d1a2-b418-45c0-87f2-6071b8960538" /></a></li><li>If the OneDrive icon doesn’t re-appear after a few minutes, open the Run window again and enter: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe.</li></ol>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Do user mailboxes need to be licensed in Office 365 if they are in litigation hold to stop the mailbox being deleted after 30 days?
</p>

<p>Our plan was as follows:</p>
<p>1. User leaves the organisation</p>
<p>2. Place exchange online&nbsp;mailbox in litigation hold</p>
<p>3. Disable on-premise active directory account</p>
<p>4. Remove E3 license from Office 365 account. </p>
<p><br />
Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>The answer is yes. But, in case any potential/unpredictable factor, we suggest you backup the mailbox data before removing the data.</p>

<h2>            Problem burning itunes music to disc.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am having trouble burning music from my iTunes on a disc. It hasn't always been like this it just started a couple days ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wit doing some research on the matter I have tried using multiple types/brands of discs, changing the speed on the burn, and even choosing not to have the music text on the disc. Every time it starts like it would burn the first song and it would do so for
 about 30-45 seconds and then stops, discharges the disc tray and says unknown error is burning the disc. I looked up the error # and even that comes up as just an unknown error.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I have a manager who wants to apply some local customization for regional employees. Specifically, we are looking at one of the Advanced Options in MS Office Word 365 Enterprise. Is there a way to apply a change to the Word -&gt;Options -&gt;Advanced -&gt;General
 -&gt;Mailing Address?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we are looking to automatically set a different Mailing Address for various branch offices.</p>
<p>I was hoping to push something via a group policy to the registry but I am unable to find anything listed as a reg key, or any help online other than the manual setting of the Mailing Address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to set this via the registry?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a VBA that could be applied the first time Word starts that could make changes to this field?</p>

<p>I would recommend putting the following code into the "ThisDocument" part of each template:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Option Explicit<br />
<br />
Private Sub Document_New()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Update AutoText fields in document including headers and footers</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next ' in case no fields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each oStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' This goes into headers and footers as well as the regular document<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each oField In oStory.Fields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If oField.Type = wdFieldAutoText Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oField.Locked = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oField.Update<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oField.Locked = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next oField<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oStory = oStory.NextStoryRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop Until oStory Is Nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next oStory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo 0<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>This will update any AutoText fields in the new document and then "lock" them so that they will keep the content from the user who created the document. You do not want to run this on the template, itself, because you do not want the AutoText fields to be
 locked when the document is created until after they are updated.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t adjust vertical margin--Gray area is gone at top</h2>
                    I am running Home Office 2016 on a Macbook Pro with Sierra (10.12.6).&nbsp; I am current on updates on both.&nbsp; Recently, when I open Word I find the cursor at the top of the page. Top margin is set to 1".&nbsp; I do not get the gray or blue bar at the top of the
 left ruler as I used to get.&nbsp; But if I choose View Header / Footer and then close the header and footer, the cursor is now an inch from the top and I now have blue at the top of the left ruler.&nbsp; I am running Office 2011 on an identical Macbook Pro with same
 OS and do not have this problem. When I open Word on that machine it immediately shows me the blue area at the top of the left side ruler and the cursor is at the proper position--1" from the top of the page.&nbsp; I thought it was a bad normal.dot file but I have
 purged that and purged everything else related to Office and did a clean reinstall but the problem still appeared. Any suggestions as to what to do? Thanks.&nbsp; (Wish I could post a photo to show the

            Move the cursor to the top of the page slowly. at the edge of the paper it should change into a square 2 headed arrow. Double click. That should bring back the header/footer display and the grey space between pages.

<h3> traceewilliams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Am I Here&#63;  Why am I allowed to join, but there is nothing for me to participate with&#63;  Oh well, it looks like I can write a post at least &#58;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since I am running two Vista Laptops, that have been kept in very good working order, I was very disappointed to learn that I could not get the free upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;I was never even given the opportunity to upgrade free to Windows 7 either back in
 the day, despite the fact I only had the laptops for a seemingly short while before Windows 7 was released. &nbsp;It seems that this is the place to be for tasters of Windows 10, so I joined the program to see. &nbsp;But I am not given any options to do anything, but
 to 'Get Windows 10'. &nbsp;Where is this 'Hub' place supposed to be, because I cannot find it - it simply is not being displayed on any of the pages before me? &nbsp;And despite my knowledge of the free upgrade of Windows 10 being not available for my Vistas, all the
 Insider pages will offer me are links to 'Get Windows 10'. &nbsp;This is very frustrating, and thinking I must be meant to do this, I sit through an hour waiting for a download, a further half an hour burning the download to a disc, only to play the disc for a
 message to say my operating system is not compatible. &nbsp;So it looks like I have been directed to the Insider Program, yet it feels like I am not really being allowed to be part of it - not fair :( &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not everyone can afford to get the latest products when they become available, and those people must choose to look after their belongings, and make them last, especially if it has taken a long time to save for that item. &nbsp;So is it really fair for Microsoft
 to decide when they deem an operating system too old, then they will just stop sending down the updates, thus 'forcing' that person to seemingly throw out a device that is otherwise still good for meeting their needs? &nbsp;Microsoft have more or less killed off
 XP now, yet a big portion of the world still uses it, perhaps because they cannot afford to upgrade. &nbsp;And now, the same fate for Vista is planned in April 2017, when no more updates will come from Microsoft. &nbsp;So Microsoft are effectively killing off their
 operating systems in favour of the latest one. &nbsp;The fact Windows 10 is available free to users of Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 suggests that these will also be killed off too. &nbsp;So, when a consumer purchases a Windows product, they are effectively buying a product
 with a 'sell by' date!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard that Windows 10 is a smaller operating system, so if the specifications are available to any given Windows device, why can't those who own such devices be given the opportunity to upgrade free too, if they wish? &nbsp;After all, any Windows product
 was purchased in favour of other operating systems, so why would Microsoft do this to their Customers? &nbsp;Why give something free to a select amount, but make others pay for it? &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Everything you buy has a life cycle. Whether it be a car, washing machine, or a computer at some point it will need to be replaced. &nbsp;Vista was first released in 2007. When support for it ends in 2017 it will be ten years old, that is an eternity in the tech
 world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are now a windows insider. With that you will have the opportunity to test new releases of windows 10. Microsoft has not released a new version to its testers as of yet. When they do you will get an email with download instructions. There is no time
 table for the new release so be patient.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of our customers have been facing&nbsp;issues&nbsp;regarding Verizon account in Outlook.com, this&nbsp;may be on the server side. I would suggest you&nbsp;to contact Verizon regarding this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            That answer is not acceptable. It is so easy to blame the other provider isn't it???? Why for 2 days in trying to set up this account on outlook.com has OUTLOOK been saying "Sorry we're upgrading our system"?????

            <p>I too am having this problem with trying to access my Verizon account through "outlook.com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually had my "Verizon.net" account set-up in Outlook and was sending and receiving email until 10 days ago. &nbsp;I have deleted the accounts and tried to add it again and I get the same error message "can't access server, check to make sure login and password"
 is correct. &nbsp;The credentials are correct as I log into Verizon webmail with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I finally called Verizon tech support and they were on the phone for 90 minutes troubleshooting and trying to resolve the problem. &nbsp;I gave them remote access and they checked all the settings, security protocol and more and were not able to get a
 connection.</strong> &nbsp;Verizon seems to think that Microsoft perhaps has changed something in their "security settings" and it is no longer speaking to Verizon (that's the simple explanation) that I can understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verizon forwarded me to "Microsoft for help" and all I was able to get was the computer who after asking me questions, then instructed me to go to the "support page" and/or community forum for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone knows what's going on or has the steps to resolve this issue...please post it I would be most grateful. &nbsp;I don't want to access several different email accounts all day long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Can we possibly get some real support on getting this problem resolved. I have seen several posts not just here regarding this same issue happening since Feb 8th - 10th. My account was working fine until then, and all of a sudden "Username or password is
 incorrect" for my Verizon account which I know isn't the case??????</p>
<p>Please get a competent support person on this issue to get this resolved!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have checked the status of the server, and it states that all is good.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This is the 3rd day of receiving this message and have tried several times throughout the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>****, it seems that Outlook.com is blocking something with the Verizon email accounts as I have stated before, that I am not the only person experiencing this exact same issue.</p>

 roadrunner account and sending a test message and receiving fine in outlook.com, I then attempted to reset up my Verizon email account, and encountered the same error messages as stated above.</p>

            <p>Mohammed, with all due respect, this is almost certainly an Outlook.com problem and has been since February 8th when Outlook.com suddenly stopped being able to access my Verizon account .&nbsp; Many, many other people had this exact same issue occur on February
 8th as well (read through some of the other posts on this topic).&nbsp; That's three weeks ago.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access my Verizon email using POP3 in Outlook 2016 but not Outlook.com using the same settings.&nbsp; I think it's way past time that Microsoft stopped blaming Verizon and started working on this problem and getting it solved.&nbsp; Something changed on February
 8th.&nbsp; Verizon access through Outlook.com using POP3 worked fine until that date and then suddenly stopped working.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what browser you are using, it doesn't matter what day of the week it is, it doesn't matter whether you are using Windows
 7, 8, or 10.&nbsp; The problem is the same.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that Outlook 2016 POP3 setup lets you specify "Require Secure Password Authentication", an option that is not available for POP3 setup in Outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could this be an issue????&nbsp; Why does Outlook 2016 work and Outlook.com doesn't?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're grasping at straws here but Microsoft shouldn't be.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that Microsoft has so little expertise to bring to bear on an email problem that it can persist for three weeks.&nbsp; In the meantime no one from Microsoft admits to a problem or
 says the company is working on it.&nbsp; If you think its a Verizon problem how about working with them on getting it solved?&nbsp; Instead, everyone is saying it's the other guy's fault.&nbsp; Take some ownership Microsoft and help your users!<br />

            It was resolved, for a while, but started happening again on March 23. &nbsp;I assume that others are again having the same problem. &nbsp;What the heck is going on??!!

            Thanks everyone for reporting the problem. Twitter group&nbsp;feeds are cached in the cloud for your Microsoft account, and there was an issue discovered that affected some people's use of groups and Twitter on Windows Phone 7. This problem should now&nbsp;be fixed,
 but let me know if it's not.
