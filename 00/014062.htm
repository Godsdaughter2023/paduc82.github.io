            Do you have Microsoft Office Outlook available on a PC?&nbsp; If so, you could use that.&nbsp; Sync the old phone with Outlok to transfer the data to Outlook, then use iTunes to sync your new iPhone with Outlook to transfer the data again.

    <title>Auto-populate summary sheet with data from multiple worksheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mzrenee18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-populate summary sheet with data from multiple worksheets</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am building a spreadsheet to track purchase orders. I have been searching the internet for the past several days and only found bits and pieces of what I am looking to do. I have a workbook containing 4 worksheets (Summary, ABC, XYZ, CBAZYX). The&nbsp;ABC,
 XYZ, CBAZYX sheets have the same column names all with different data. At any given point, the rows will vary in number. I would like to populate certain cells within the Summary Sheet using the data from the other sheets. The data from these sheets will come
 from the same cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On ABC, XYZ, CBAZYX Sheets:<br />
Column C beginning at row 2 until last row is a cumulative total that needs to be populated in the Summary Sheet F2<br />
The last row containing a value in Column F needs to be populated in H2 of the Summary Sheet<br />
The last row containing a value in Column H needs to be populated in Column G2 in the Summary Sheet<br />
In short, every time a row is added to the sheets or whenever a new sheet is added, the identified cells on the Summary Sheet are populated/updated. I have included a picture of what I am trying to do. I greatly appreciate any help that you can give me! Thank
 you!</p>

            <p>Thanks for posting the screenshot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When columns are not aligned vertically, as shown in the before picture, Word doesn't know where to add the new cell for each row in the new column. When you're redesigning such a table, it's sometimes necessary to temporarily align cells vertically into
 true columns, add the columns, then reformat the table to its original appearance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If &nbsp;that's too much work, then the best idea is to create new cells by splitting existing ones. Then you can create the new cells exactly where you need them and the table width will not suddenly expand.</p>

<p>This issue only occurs whilst using the Outlook Application. I am able to send all these emails using the Outlook web app just fine.</p>
<p>The emails that do not get sent do not appear in an Outbox or draft, it simply dissapears.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why i can't send some emails using the Outlook application.</p>

<h2>            SMS messaging on nokia 6600</h2>
                    I want to copy my sms messages from my old nokia 6600 to my new nokia 6680. The problem is that it seems that it can't be done using either of the phones' pc suite. I read in here that the only way to move the messages is using card reader to copy the
 mail folder from the memory card. The problem is that my sms messages are not stored on my memory card, but on the phone memory. So can anybody tell me how can I copy the sms messages from the phone memory to the memory card?

            Hi! I've the same problem.<br />
badmanab, I didn't understand your advice... if you go on the settings you can only choose if you want to read the sms on the telephone memory or on the memory card: I don't think you can copy the sms messages from one memory to the other...<br />
Am I wrong?<br />
bobar4e, have you solved the problem?<br />

            Hi, I used to have the same problem nd then i downloaded an application called sms suite and installed it on my 6600. what iot does is backup your entire sms folder into a text file which it stores on your memory card. I removed the memory card and inserted
 into my card reader and was then able to select the sms's i wanted and then paste them on my new phone. Takes a bit of time but it works. I found sms suite at the following site

<h2>            I am unable to access contact list in Outlook while addressing emails</h2>
                    I cannot even access any contact list. It is like it is an empty folder.&nbsp; I have to type in every address in the "to" box to send an email.

 Sometimes, you might experience some error while viewing or navigating certain websites. Because the web browser stores old cached files, this could cause websites to stop functioning properly. Clearing the cache will prompt your browser to download the latest
 files from the server and allow it to work properly again. I would suggest that you try it
<strong>multiple times</strong>. Trying another browser can also help. If you were able to view your contacts using another browser, you can try to use it for now while we are still fixing the issue.</span></font></p>

            Are you still&nbsp;experiencing this issue? Have you tried removing the SIM&nbsp;card&nbsp;and reinserting it back? How about using another operator SIM card to further test this? Also, try checking from Store for any update available for the system apps. We'll wait
 for your response.

<h2>            E3 &#43; Shared Computing&#58; Auto-Activation and limits</h2>
                    
<p>We are planning a migration for one of our customers, and there are a few things we're not sure of, and would like to know how it works.<br />
The plan is to license all the users with E3, and deploy Office 2013 or Office 2016 (ProPlus) by using ODT, and configuring the Shared Computing.<br />
The environment the users will be working is really dynamic. Meaning that users will constantly be using different computers.<br />
I did read the following article:&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782860.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782860.aspx</a>&nbsp;but i still have a few questions:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>The article says: "<i>The licensing token that is stored on the shared computer is valid only for a few days. As the expiration date for the licensing token nears, Office 365 ProPlus automatically attempts to renew the licensing token when the user is logged
 on to the computer and using Office 365 ProPlus".</i> How will Office try to reactivate itself? Will it try to use the current Windows credentials, or are there services needed like ADFS in order to make this work?
</li><li>How long will this token be valid by default? </li><li>The article says: "<i>Normally, users can install and activate Office 365 ProPlus only on up to five computers.
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Office 365 ProPlus with shared computer activation enabled doesn’t count against the five computer</span></b></i><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> limit.</span></b>".
 So if shared computing is configured, and the user has the appropiate license the described computer won't count a an "activation". How does this exactly work? And is there a limit on how many computers the user can work on with his/her E3 license in combination
 with Shared Computing? </li></ol>
<p>Would be glad to receive some information of how it works. Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Eric</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>1. After signing in, Office will attempt to obtain a SCA license from Microsoft’s cloud licensing service. A user who has been assigned an Office 365 ProPlus license (or Project Pro or Visio Pro licenses) by their admin will successfully obtain it and the
 license will be stored in their Windows user’s profile on the machine. If the user doesn’t log on to the shared computer for several days, the licensing token can expire. The next time that the user tries to use Office 365 ProPlus, Office 365 ProPlus contacts
 the Office Licensing Service on the Internet to get a new licensing token.</p>
<p>2. You may check the expiration date via checking the licensing Data. Please follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
(1).Find the licensing token. The current user’s license files can be inspected by going to the following locations:<br />
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Licensing<br />
or:&nbsp; %localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Licensing</p>
<p>(2).In the Licensing folder, you can find {ACID}.authString.txt.</p>
<p>(3).Open it with Notepad. It contains the expiration date and other information.<br />
Start Date: indicates when the license was issued<br />
(example: 2014-06-18T16:42:13.5520000Z)<br />
<br />
End Date: indicates when the license expires<br />
(example: 2014-06-26T16:42:13.5520000Z)</p>
<p>3. That is because, for multiple users, on the same PC (for example a Windows Server with an RDS role enabled) can obtain their own licenses concurrently and the Office client adjusts its activation state to each individual user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;No, as the article mentions, it doesn’t count against the five computer limit.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Iris</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently encountered an add on to my IE called Tango Toolbar, I've already attempted a scan of spyware and adware and that didn't do the trick on removing it, when I attempt to go to the control panel and head over to the add/remove programs, that tango
 toolbar comes out listed however whenever I try to remove it it takes me to a page that doesn't exist and won't remove. How do I go about removing this spyware/adware, I also noticed that it gives me pop ups every once in a while, greatly appreciate the help.</p>

<p>I have found out a way to get rid of unwanted software called access.exe it is part of tango. go in to start manu then Help and Support.</p>
<p>then go into undo changes to your computer with system&nbsp;restore. find out what date you might download file. restore a week before</p>
<p>you might want to save any software you want on cd or dvd rom,&nbsp;I done this to my computer to day and it works</p>

                    <p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p>I do a fair amount of my simple graphics in XL. BUT.... I seem to be missing the Select Object Cursor tool
 that allows you to click and drag to select multiple objects; it used to be in the 2007 version but not in the vs 14.7.7 version of Excel included in MS Office for Mac 2011 ... which means each individual object has to be selected, then grouped .. a major
 faff! So where is it? &nbsp;I have read posts that claim the command is included and can be re-instated to the toolbar, but there is no instance of the command in the Keystroke drop-down list in my version.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had already attempted methods 1 &amp; 2 with no success so I ultimately went with method 3, which fixed some but not all of the issues. The MS Store is still missing. Cortana has been restored as well as the Start Menu, but still no ability to log in with
 a PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ultimately had to resort to creating a new account and deleting mine from the laptop and then recreating it, BUT.....this has caused a new issue. After rebooting between deleting all of the User files under my account (after moving the files I wanted
 to keep to the newly created "family account"), now my personal Account Profile while showing my identity to login purposes now has a TEMPxxxxxxx as the username in the Explorer file structure. Obviously this will not suffice. I've ultimately now resorted
 to moving back to a previous Build (10162) and still no joy. It appears I'm going to have to do a completely new clean install and reinstall all of my applications which I was hoping to be able to avoid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thomas Miller&nbsp;had requested how to create the new user account if you can't access the Start Menu. Rather than attempt to Left click on the Start Menu, use a Right Click and you can select Settings. From there go to User Accounts and then create a new "family"
 member account. If you want to try my method (I don't suggest it honestly as it still has bugs.), make sure you create the new "family" member account as an Administrator or else when logging in with that one, you won't be able to delete the previous user
 account.</p>

<h2>            Mail merge in Office 2013 - unable to select Excel file for data source&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Trying to do a mail merge, Word/Excel 2013, </p>
<p>Following procedure here</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-and-print-labels-using-mail-merge-276a2cd1-74d2-43d0-ab5a-b90460358ad5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I create my excel file with a few columns (first name, last name, company, etc.)</p>
<p>Open blank Word file</p>
<p>Start mail merge -&gt; Labels -&gt; Pick my label -&gt; etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select recipients -&gt; Use an existing list -&gt; select the Excel XLSX file&nbsp; (C:\Temp\whatever.xlsx)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a "Select table" dialog, with&nbsp;a "Workbook" listed that was NOT the XLSX file I selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I hit "OK", I get "Word was unable to open the data source" (as the file listed is not what I selected, and doesn't exist)</p>
<p>If I click on the drop list for "Workbook", the "OK" button gets greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>"Excel Files via ODBC (*.xls,xlsx,xlsm,xlsb)" just got me back to the "Select table" dialog that I could not get past (see original post).</p>

            When did you last launch Word? When did you last restart your Mac? This is usually a symptom of internal confusion caused by continuous running over extended periods.<br />
<br />
It would also be advisable to confirm that both Office &amp; OS X are fully updated then repair disk permissions using Apple's Disk Utility or comparable app.<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since I can imagine, Outlook 2016 (V15.40 - 171108) doesn't remember the entered proxy settings and bugs me by promting for the proxy credentials nearly every 60 minutes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm searching the web for an solution for about 6 months now and had no success :(</p>

</p><p>I made sure that the date from the dialog is submitted to the keychain and that every application was granted to access the keychain item.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Gøran Homberg,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about deleting the keychain directly. Open the keychain tool and try to remove the following keychain entries:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Exchange</li><li>Microsoft Office Identities</li><li>MSOpenTech.*</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then reboot Outlook and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we recommend you to contact our dedicated Outlook for Mac in-app support team to get targeted help. About how to contact them:

<h2>            Using excel spreadsheet 1 data to create reports on worksheet 2 and identify within changing date parametres</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to create a workbook that takes raw data from worksheet 1 and collates text and aggregates the count on worksheet 2. Also, am trying to filter said data by date ranges, so that only data within defined date ranges show up on worksheet 2....But am
 without the knowledge of formulas to acheive this.<br />
<br />
I have set up worksheet 1 as the raw data collection page and have managed to add the drop down boxes with list info from worksheet 3. This is working well, just need advice on how to get worksheet 2 underway and working.<br />
<br />
Hope this is enough information to go by. Any assistence with this would be greatly appreciated.<br />

    <title>Bulk Selection Option from Sender is not available in new outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bulk Selection Option from Sender is not available in new outlook upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new outlook online portal lost the feature for find all the emails from the specific sender to select bulk emails and delete or archive in bulk. This is really handy option to free up the server space rather than selecting each one and delete them. This
 is really required feature so it is request to developer to add this in new updates asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            Hi I’m Linnell I'm an Independent Advisor
<br /> if your referring to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />To search you can use search at the top you can define using the For example Search inbox and put in the senders name. You can then click on Results it will highlight all the emails and right click and delete or press delete on your keyboard if you need to deselect some then Hold down your CTRL key and select they will not be highlighted anymore and will not delete. To archive in bulk same action except right click and select Archive. You can also use CTRL A to select. 
<br />Is there anything else I can help you with? 
<br />Regards,
<br />Linnell

            You can still find and delete - use the search field about the message list - the click in the circle to the left of Results to select all. Then you can use the Delete or Move button to do something with them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Or use Sweep - select a message, click Sweep button.<br />

            Sorry to say that I know the option you guys are showing me but the previous version of outlook has feature if you used or not I am not sure. when you hover your mouse pointer over the sender's name then it will shows the option "Find all the email from
 this sender" so you don't need to type anything in search or go to sweep etc. just click and it will filter then you can select all and delete. Rather than giving long way in new version, I think if there is good feature in existing version then adapt that
 in new upgrades.

            That option didn't make it into the new outlook.com - i will ask the product team about it. They may have removed it because people didn't use it or it slipped by. 
<br />
<br />But... Sweep with do the same - select the message, click sweep, then vhoose delete messages inbox.

            According to the product team, they removed it because it was rarely used. (I'm shocked they are reading mail this late at night.) 
<br />
<br />There is a suggestion at uservoice - anyone who wants this feature back should vote for it

<h2>            Can&#39;t opt into Windows Insider Preview from FCU version 16299.15</h2>
                    <p>Without too much flair, here's what I attempted:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Windows Insider Program.</li><li>Press the "Get started" button.</li><li>Select my&nbsp;<em>Insider</em> account.</li><li>Select "Active development of Windows".</li><li>Select "Fast".</li><li>Select "Confirm".</li><li>Select "Restart Now".</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After these steps and the reboot, I expected to be enrolled into the Windows Insider Program and be able to see settings on the same&nbsp;<span>Update &amp; Security -&gt; Windows Insider Program page. However, I get presented the very same "Get started" button
 with no message whatsoever. This happens in a continuous loop, and it seems I can't opt into Windows Insider Preview builds.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have already tried running a repair installation by downloading the latest Windows 10 ISO, and installing it over my current installation, keeping all apps and files in the process. This has been advised by the Support Team, and after being
 pointed to that procedure they didn't continue anything and instead just told me to here and ask the same thing.</span></p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Usually I also offer this advice, but in one of my virtual machines, I started from release 16299.125, joined Insider, and was surprised that 17063 started right away, and this was before verifying my account. Wonder if it was just this build that allowed
 that.</p>

<h3> raian levy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Abandoning Ship &#40;switching to Android&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Raian and I've been a Windows Phone user since 2012. I know i am not a big celebrity but I was one of the few WP supporters and wanted to&nbsp;tell about&nbsp;my&nbsp;journey. Keep in mind that English is not my primary language, so don't correct every single
 misspell on the comments.</p>
<p>I remember when&nbsp;I first got my&nbsp;Lumia 720, I&nbsp;got it because I wanted to get out of an Android/IOS world and Windows Phone 8 was still very young, but&nbsp;the community and I were sure the platform would grow.</p>
<p>Then came Windows Phone 8.1 For Developers. I grabbed my copy of the OS as soon as I could and enjoyed the new additions to the OS such as Cortana, wallpapers&nbsp;and the much needed action center; this was on my Lumia 925.</p>
<p>When I heard about Windows 10 Mobile I was pumped AF and decided to install it on my old 720. It was VERY laggy and glitchy but with time it got better and knowing that it would eventually run smoothly giving that MSFT said they would adapt the OS to run
 on 512MB RAM devices. </p>
<p>Then I got it on my HTC One M8,&nbsp;I wasn't totally convinced by Win10 but decided to give it one last chance. my friends always told me it was a dead platform but I had faith in Microsoft, knowing they would do the right thing;&nbsp;I got it on the slow ring, thinking
 it would eventually be updated to final software bc the retailer said so when I bought the device.
</p>
<p>But then it happened. Microsoft announced the list that would be supported for the final upgrade and my HTC wasn't there (the good old lumia 925 was though) so I said to myself that it would come out, that I just needed to wait some time... weeks went by...
 months went by... my device isn't supported, the 512mb devices weren't supported and my 925 among others got removed off the list. I've been stuck for a few months now on build 10.0.10586.494 and some weeks ago I found out that more than half the lumias were
 cut off and wouldn't be able to continue upgrading via Windows Insider. this plus the lack of lumia sales this year PLUS Pokémon GO being available in my country since yesterday and already being excluded by my friends bc they go hunting around the city and
 meanwhile I'm here trying to run PoGo and failing miserably. All this problems led me to rethink if i really wanted to stand by the underdog. The answer is no, bc we, the community, are the only ones standing by it. Microsoft has fired tons of employees and
 doesn't really care for Windows Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you made it this far I congratulate you for keeping up with me and my "rant", I felt like i needed to say this, let my words out.And i'm not leaving Microsoft as a company, I'll still have my trusted Surface 3 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Thank you Windows Phone for all this beautiful years, but my new&nbsp;Nexus 6P is standing in a sealed box, right next to me.</p>

    <title>My Microsoft Outlook Is totally Screwed UP&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the historian  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Microsoft Outlook Is totally Screwed UP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have had Hotmail since 1996. Have had little problems. In February I switched to Outlook and have had a few minor problems. Now, recently, something has happened that is either Malware, a Major Major Virus, or Outlook is totally Messed Up. I have no idea.
 I came here and wrote a message recently but have no idea when. I was told by someone that I should empty my Cookies, delete my History, and all that stuff. I did all and nothing has changed. This is what is happening. I go into Hotmail and, for Example, I
 try to print a message, when I start to hit print, the screen pops back to the list of 200 or more emails. I have gotten so behind because nothing is working.&nbsp; If I go to Junk Mail, I try to delete. It pops back to Inbox. I try this a few times and give up.
 I go to Deleted Messages to delete, and as I hit delete, it pops back to Inbox, One time a couple days ago, I did this and it poped back to Inbox and deleted my INBOX!!&nbsp; This is now beyond serious. I am ready to throw my whole computer away! I finally after
 doing a couple FULL Scans with Microsoft Sec Ess. to no avail, went to Malwarbytes which I used awhile back and it removed a major problem, and it showed no threats.&nbsp; So, does anyone have any idea what is going on and what I should do. Any other FREE sites
 that can detect the most serious problems? I will pay for something if I have feedback that it will most likely work.&nbsp; Or is it some other problem related to Outlook itself?&nbsp; One more thing,.&nbsp; I sent my daughter an email that should have gone to her desktop
 and her I-phone, and she said it only went to her I-phone. She said this was not normal. Please, please help! Thank you.
</p>

<p>There was no real TOPIC that ift so I clicked on Deleted Email. It is really sending, trying to delete, trying to move around within, etc.

            I did not really detect that your problem was addressed here. Someone other than this person helped you. Outlook, windows in general blew up today. 7/10/2013. Outlook could not send OR delete stuff stuck in out box. Finally got error "cannot open your
 default e-mail folders...." Using inbox repair tool scanpst.exe which frankly I do not expect to fix anything. I do back up frequently BUT had a ton of legal emails today and have probably lost them. I will let everyone know that MSFT did this, and not just
 to me, the net is loaded with complaints from the past couple of days, and beg them to re-send. How unprofessional. But I'm not taking it on myself. Thank you msft. Do a google on the past couple of days of complaints. We are not alone and it is NOT our computers!

            <p>I just wanted to say that the problem has been fixed for awhile now.&nbsp; After having other problems on the internet including very slow progress, I reset my Internet Explorer completely.&nbsp; This fixed many problems including many sites that were not working
 very well if at all and my Hotmail works fine again. </p>
<p>Thank you for continued help.</p>
