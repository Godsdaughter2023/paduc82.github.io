    <title>Surface Pro pen nib replacement compatability - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmg6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro pen nib replacement compatability</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Microsoft Surface Pen on 1 March 2018 for my SP3 when my old pen broke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new one is burgundy, has no clip on the side, has 1 flat side and the rest cylindrical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Model 1776 SN 0150681752574.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently dropped it and the nib broke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Microsoft Pen Tips but there are no instructions how to change.</p>
<p>I googled it and all the youtubes are for a different version of the pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to pull out my remaining broken nib until I know the nibs are compatible...</p>
<p>
</p><p>are they?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the nibs are SN 0114861846574. There is no model number</p>
<p>but they are a pack of 3 (2H, HB, B).</p>

    <title>How can I get my Surface Book to interact with TomTom satnav through - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr do&#39;brien  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get my Surface Book to interact with TomTom satnav through USB port on the keyboard</h2>
                    TomTom forum has not been able to decide on this, some saying it cannot be done others giving precise details of settings changes, which when followed do not work anyway. &nbsp;It seems ridiculous that an expensive modern tablet/laptop cannot interact with
 a satnav. &nbsp;surely it is in the interest, of both large companies, to be able to solve this seemingly minor, but important, &nbsp;problem. Can anyone solve this problem? &nbsp;I have addressed both Microsoft and TomTom directly without any success. I bought the Surface
 to obviate the need of a PC , not so clever it seems.

            It would be helpful if you could provide some details about what actually happens when you try to connect the two devices together as well as a brief outline of the steps that you've taken to troubleshoot the problem so far.

            <p>Thank you very much.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was kind of you to go to the trouble to reply to my query.</p>
<p>I have had TomTom devices for many years&nbsp;with no problems.&nbsp; This one is Start50 Go.&nbsp; It syncs perfectly with my PC and my Surface Pro 1, soon&nbsp;to be abandoned. This Surface Pro 4&nbsp;Book is only a few weeks old, and I have&nbsp; other devices connected fine; phone
 and printer.&nbsp; I downloaded TomTom MyDrive and then connected my TomTom device to the USB port with cable.&nbsp;The device said connected.&nbsp; MyDrive said not connected (connect your device.&nbsp; And so it went.&nbsp; After many uninstalls and installs and checks on System
 and Control Panel&nbsp; I had to surrender.&nbsp; I did get advice from TomTom, but it turned out to be for Windows 7 not 10.&nbsp; I replied to the TomTom technical support person to that effect,&nbsp;and got no further advice.&nbsp; I found&nbsp; advice on the forum as below
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.discussions.tomtom.com/mydrive-connect-apps-474/new-surface-pro-4-book-and-tomtom-mydrive-999339/index1.html#post1072349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://en.discussions.tomtom.com/mydrive-connect-apps-474/new-surface-pro-4-book-and-tomtom-mydrive-999339/index1.html#post1072349</span></a></p>
<p>I made all the changes advised to no avail.&nbsp; I hope this clarifies the situation.</p>
<p>I had bought the Pro Book to replace PC and earlier Surface Pro.&nbsp; So very disappointing.</p>
<p>I should be really grateful and interested if you can help.</p>

    <title>Surface 3 and hosted networks&#47;Ad hoc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lllllo_olllll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 and hosted networks&#47;Ad hoc</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surf3-surfdevice/not-connecting-with-samsung-ue48hu7500l/45e483d7-71d9-4f28-bcc3-c04fdc7bd9ea#LastReply" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>So now the Surface 3 also has the same problem as the Pro 3....My guess is that both surface 3 and pro 3 use the same Marvell wifi controller chip which may have some designing issues (we won't know for sure until a tear-down report is out)....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, Steven, could you please also help to test if your surface 3 can create an ad-hoc network? Rumors are MS also disabled this function on SP3 due to its wifi chip driver issue.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1:&nbsp;<br />
Open the Command Prompt (CMD) as an Administrator.<br />
(Press Windows key + X + A)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2:<br />
Configure Ad Hoc Wireless connection. Type in CMD this command:<br />
netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=&lt;your desired network name(for example: Test_network&gt; key=&lt;your password(for example: 12345678)&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3:&nbsp;<br />
Next, you need to start it. Type in CMD the command below:<br />
netsh wlan start hostednetwork</p>
<p>
</p><p>(My SP3 returns the error message 'The hosted network couldn't be started. A device attached to the system is not functioning.')</p>
<p>
</p><p>THX!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Unable to complete a new install of Windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicktraeger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to complete a new install of Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I've been attempting to do a new install of Windows 7 on my PC for probably a month now. &nbsp;I purchased my PC through alienware and when it arrived I installed Windows using the disk I received. &nbsp;Perfect everything is fine. &nbsp;I then decided to reformat,
 no immediate reason why, just wanted a clean start. &nbsp;Perfect everything is fine. &nbsp;Fast forward to now. &nbsp;I attempted to do another reinstall of windows and eventually am told: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The partitions on the disk
 selected for installation are not in the recommended order. For additional information about installing to GPT disks go to the Microsoft website (www.microsoft.com) and search for GPT." I could not tell you if this popped up when I did my first clean install.
 &nbsp;Either way I noticed it this time and figured it pertinent information. &nbsp;Anyway, I click through this and select OK to continue installing Windows. &nbsp;I then am presented with the error below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have a current discussion opened up regarding error message 0x080070241, which appears roughly 10% into the beginning process of performing a new install of Windows on a computer that alread has Windows running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Figured I might as well start a new discussion regarding the message about partitions being out of place or not in the right order. &nbsp;This all seems so incredibly confusing to me and it feels like it should not be this hard. &nbsp;I've already did a full clean
 install of windows and now when I try doing it I am stuck in this never ending loop of errors. &nbsp;WHY?</p>

            Booting from GPT is only supported for 64 bit editions of Windows 7 (and Vista) on UEFI based systems (UEFI – Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).<br />
If your computer does not support UEFI, delete all the hard drives partitions and create a new partition:<br />
1. Boot from the Windows DVD <br />
2. Click Install Now <br />
3. At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced)<br />
4. Click Drive Options <br />
5. Select the partition(s) you want to format<br />
6. Click Format - this will delete EVERYTHING on that partition<br />
7. Create a new partition and select a partition to install Windows on.<br />
8. Continue with install.<br />

            Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

            How did you initiate the repair upgrade? Because, a repair upgrade is basically reinstalling Windows 10 while keeping your apps, files and settings.

            when i boot from the disc i get two options, upgrade or clean install, when i try upgrade wich keep your programs etc, i get the message that it seems that i have tryed to upgrade and to remove the boot media and continue with previous upgrade, and that

            You did not perform a repair upgrade as instructed. Please see the instructions I provided in my previous reply:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Because you booted from the install media, you performed a 'Custom install'. This archives your files and folders to Windows.old.
<br />
<br />You will then have to reinstall your applications and necessary drivers.

    <title>Avatar reset in Kinect Sport Rivals - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cirion3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Avatar reset in Kinect Sport Rivals</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday one of my kids characters reset in Kinect Sport Rivals and he had to go through the creation process again for the avatar. He lost all progress when it comes to shop purchases (such as items and outfits) and all the games were reset as if he had
 never played them before. His star and fan level though was still intact</p>
<p>Obviously kinda devastated.... what to do about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not expecting any help from Microsoft as this game is really old, hoping the community got some ideas.</p>

<p>Was the original avatar migrated from the Xbox 360 or made on the Xbox one? </p>
<p>The only reason I ask is there are 2 different types of avatars that can be used for your profile.</p>

</p><p>There are many possible reasons why you are experiencing this issue. If you are getting Code 43, that means you need to update the device driver. To properly install the correct and most updated driver for your Sallen Controller, we suggest that&nbsp; you contact
 the controller's manufacturer for in-depth assistance. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried an online chat with Skype and was told - just keep trying or set up a new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no one else to call or contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that is good enough. Surely you can verify who I am. I haven't changed my log on or any details except my email and credit card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to actually verify who I am or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to unblock my account - or is it that I have to use Facetime or go to the trouble of setting up a new accoutn because there is no one to speak to?</p>

</p><p>Confirmation codes are sent to your account's <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-and-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">security info</a></strong>. This is to verify that the true
 owner of the account is the one requesting for access, however, if you do not have access to it anymore, you have to answer and pass the verification and recovery process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You first need to pass the verification form before you can replace the associated security on the account. Note that this form was established in the interest of account and data security, meaning that the system will only grant access to the user who would
 be <strong>able to pass the verification process</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you on this, I advise that you answer the recovery form once more, this time use a device where a successful sign in previously occurred. An Account Specialist will double check your answers to ensure that there are no discrepancies. As long as the
 information you provide matches the account, you will be able to recover it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you cannot recover the account, as much as I regret to inform you this, the only option to move forward is to create another account.

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased an HP XW6600 Workstation from a business on eBay.</p>
<p>The COA is attached to the outer case, but on the corner where come of the product key characters are is missing 3 digits. I have the rest of the product key, just missing 3 digits.</p>
<p>I have not yet contacted HP for a replacement key, which I soon will, but I do not see HP providing a replacement key. At least it is worth a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wondering, if I have over 95% of the product key on the original genuine Microsoft COA, why can't Microsoft give me the missing digits? The whole product key should be in some database, otherwise how would they activate it, comparing product key entered
 and the valid product key in their database?</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us posted and sharing this information with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have you contact HP for further assistance, since HP is your OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).
</p>
<p>Refer the link-</p>
<p><a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have purchased the version of Windows directly from Microsoft then&nbsp;you may contact Microsoft for the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do get back to us for any issues pertaining to Windows in the future. We will be happy to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Ok, I contacted HP and this is what they sent me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
"Thank you for contacting Hewlett-Packard.
 Based on your email, I understand that the unit you recently received has a portion of the
COA sticker missing.
Specifically, it is part of the sticker that contained part of the Product Key for Windows.
Unfortunately, the COA is the only copy of that key we possess.
Microsoft is very specific about how and where we can put those keys.
The best advice we can offer would be to contact Microsoft and advise them of the situation
to attempt to get the remainder of the key produced.
I apologize we cannot be better assistance in this case.
If you have any other questions or issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
Thank you for contacting Hewlett-Packard."
&nbsp;
Evidently, they do not even keep a list/database of what product keys that they put on their products.
&nbsp;
Does Microsoft keep a list/database of product keys issued?
&nbsp;
So basically they are saying that contacting Microsoft is the only way to resolve this issue with the
missing digit's on the COA.
I can provide a photo of the COA sticker to prove this is a legitimate request.

            <p>Microsoft can not help you and if you read the information the Support Engineer supplied you with Microsoft is very specific about you contacting the OEM Manufacturer, in your case HP, about replacement Product Key.</p>

<p>Your way out of this is for&nbsp;you buy Recovery disks from HP to reinstall Vista as using that method normally does not require your input of the PK</p>

<p>Neither one wants to take responsibility and even put an effort into trying to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The replies that I have got, with this post, have not even addressed/answered some questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer in question is an HP XW6600 workstation.</p>
<p>The hard drive was wiped/sanitized. No O/S, no recovery partition.</p>
<p>Missing 3 or 4 digits on the COA for product code for Vista Business 32 bit edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Microsoft issued the software, and HP sells the hardware, who is liable?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well..</p>
<p>If HP supplied you directly with a PC including recovery media (or the ability to create recovery media), and&nbsp;if you subsequently 'lost' the media (or didn't create them before HD failure/format), do you think HP should be obliged to replace for nothing?
<strong><em>I</em></strong> don't.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you sold on this PC to soembody else without the media (or ability to create the media), should the subsequent owner have the right to expect free replacement from HP.
<strong><em>I</em></strong> think not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said all that, this thread should point you in a direction that might give you a 'happy ending'...</p>

            <p>Once again, HP has pointed me back to Microsoft for the COA key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quote from recent email:</p>
" With regards to replacement COA's, we do not have permission from Microsoft, 
the software manufacturer of the operating system, to create or distribute additional COAs.
Microsoft has elected to retain that ability themselves, which is understandable as the COA 
is a license key for their own software.  Any replacement or new COA's will need to be obtained
through the original software manufacturer.
This would apply to any software we are permitted to distribute."

I am ordering the restore media from HP.

    <title>TV Display stuck in 640x480 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vcwer2  say:</h3>
<h2>            TV Display stuck in 640x480</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon! A little insight about the problem I am facing: my HP Laptop Display isn't working due to a problem with the LCVD cable and this is why I use my TV as the main screen of my computer via an HDMI cable. My TV has its resolution of 1920x1080.
 I am using a Windows 10 Education license.<br />
<br />
Today I tried playing a 1999 game and the game had its settings set on resolution 640x480. All went fine until the game crashed, had to use different desktops to be able to stop the process, and now my TV is stuck in 640x480. The problem is that in Settings
 &gt; System &gt; Display the 3 labels under "Scale and layout" are greyed out, without any way for me to change the settings. The TV works on its normal resolution in HDMI mode when connected to my television receiver.<br />
<br />
I have searched for a little while over the internet, but didn't find a viable solution. Maybe because there aren't a lot of people trying to play really old games on really advanced machines.<br />
Post Scriptum: The game that caused me this problem is Tiberian Sun from EA Games, tried other games older or a bit newer than this one and didn't face a problem like this.</p>

<p>Hi VCwer2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I think this is more of a graphics driver compatibility problem, and nothing to do with Tiberian Sun. As a matter of fact, I'm still playing this game until now. Tiberian Sun and Red Alert are my favorite games of all time, this brings back
 my childhood memories, and playing these games is my way to relax after an exhausting day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to your concern, make sure that the cable is connected PC's GPU, if it's already connected try to reconnect it, as well in the TV's end. You can also try using different ports, and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you can update your graphics card driver to the latest version that can be found on the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

                    <p>I just bought a new HP Windows 10 PC a few weeks ago. I recent noticed that all the colors are slightly off and the screen is dim. Anyway I can fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I noticed because I do digital art. I posted a picture on FB and noticed that the colors looks much more yellow/red on every other device. The brightness is all the way up, but it's still much dimmer than anything else. I tried messing around with
 the RGB settings, but I can't get it right&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you are still facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An outdated or incompatible display driver could be causing the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try updating the display driver by following the steps below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Type devmgmt.msc and press enter to open device manager.</p>
<p>3. Expand display adapter.</p>
<p>4. Right click on the driver and choose the option to update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to face the issue, uninstall the driver and restart the computer and have Windows automatically install the latest driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, I suggest you to download the latest display driver from the computer manufacturer's website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. </p>

            A friend of mine is real good with computers and other tech, and he said HP often have slight color issues. The only solution he had was to buy a second monitor. Instead of doing that, I've just hooked it up to a spare TV and currently using that as a
 monitor when I'm using color. Thanks for the help, though.&nbsp;

<p>over a&nbsp;month ago my 12 year old son got rude racialist and threatening messages on his xbox while playing a game i spoke to this bloke telling him i was going to report and file a complaint about him as iam an xbox live ambassador but he then started sending
 me the same kind of messages insulting me my wife and my son i have all these messages on my two systems now offer a month later this guy still on xbox doing the same thing sending out these messages i spoke to xbox support about this and was told to file
 complaint the normal way and her son gets them all the time now iam left with no option to photo these messages and get the police involved because xbox failed to act even thinking of getting a friend who works for a major news paper to take up this story
 to see if this gets xbox attension no one on live should have to put up with this kind of treatment so much for terms and conditions of live being an xbox ambassador for which i put in a lot of time means nothing to xbox just as always the mighty pound note
 and doller is god to them</p>

<p>The fact that your an Ambassador has nothing to do with any of this. That is a 100% volunteer program. You put in as much time as you want. The complaint system is not a joke at all. Take a look at the suspensions and ban forums. I'm sure you know where
 those are at. Also just because it a month later how do you know nothing was done? How do you know they did not get a few days off of LIVE or a communications ban? Easy, you don't know this. XBLPET will never tell you what if anything they do to a user.</p>
<p>As a parent you could take the steps to secure your child's account to where he can only get messages from their friends.It's not up to just Xbox to keep our kids safe, it's up to parents as well.

<p>As a parent I do police my son's account he only has a mike when he plays me he talks to no one on line with out my consent he was in a game playing his Xbox when these messages just turned up I then spoke to this person on my account and got even more rude
 abusive messages insulting my son wife and me and this person ic still playing on live like nothing happened I am now left with no option to protect my family as I see fit this is going to then police to see if they can do something about it you haven't even
 seen the messages because if you had and have a family you would do the same I put my trust in Xbox live to make people stick to the rules Terms &amp; Conditions as you put them but this seems to be one way street this person has been on live nearly every day
 since this happened so I will take these messages with evidence to the police &amp; contact my solicitor to see if I can take legal action myself &nbsp;10 years of loyal service by me and bringing my family on there your next gen customers mean nothing so we will now
 see what the legal services can do for me ?</p>

<p>Just because you see him on live still does not mean nothing happened to him. He may have had a communications ban. Were they make it so you can't talk to anyone or message them. They have been know to do that at times. I have seen people post about that
 in the suspensions area.Let's also not forget the fact that just because you reported him does not mean something will happen right away. They may be making a case against this user. Maybe they watch people for a while to see how they act and then drop the
 hammer on them. That's something we will never know. Now your welcome to take it to your local police and all but we all know how those systems work out. Most of them ask you if you have means to block communication with someone harassing you. Don't get me
 wrong, I am a parent myself with 2 kids on live. That's the reason I wrote my guide for other parents who don't know how to make it safe for their children. Mine can not get 1 single message from anyone not on their friends list. They can not hear anyone on
 live while in game either. </p>

<p>This is not a Ambassador issue I have been on this program for few months and have help lots of people who have come through to me on the program lots of parents who are frightened for there kids safety after reciveing such messages this has been a long
 time coming but when it happens to you it's different ball game all together I a once proud member of the live community &amp; ambassador program will not take this when it happens to my children even if its a silly fool making these threats in my country this
 is a crime racial threatening messages through the live system is Cyber Bulling in anyone's eyes we in the uk take our family safety very serious and it's about time Xbox live did to those messages will disappear from our systems in the next few days so have
 photos of all 8 messages now i get the opinion that nothing getting done even after ringing Xbox support about this issue only to be told by them this happens all the time that she herself had to take away her sons mike and live because of these issues the
 amount of times I've used the saying XBOX LIVE TERMS &amp; CONDITION are there to protect Xbox &amp; people from such things now makes me feel sick to my stomach we promote live as family friendly when in truth it's far from it ?</p>

<p>I don't recall ever saying it was an Ambassador issue. I also understand as a parent your concern. I am just telling you your options that I see. I have also pointed out that just because you still see them online means nothing happened or will not happen
 at a later date.</p>

<p>This type of thing happened to me last Thursday with serious threats. I called XBOX and the gentleman on the phone said there was nothing he could do so call the police which I did. Because the young lad was down in London that had made the threats the police
 officer would not take me seriously which irritated me to no end. The police in my perspective are useless and because it isn't something common like Facebook I was told that London Police would probably do nothing.</p>
<p>In my opinion if these people can send abusive messages to adults and children alike, they should have a communications ban, a complete live ban, or a fixed penalty notice and a letter of apology to be sent to the "victim".
</p>
<p>I hear a lot of abuse on XBOX (I play mainly MW3) and some of the things stated on there is vile! I have even had a message after having a chat with my friends about my pregnancy on there, from a child telling me he hopes I have a still born! Children and
 Adults alike nowadays are vulgar on XBOX and there should be better policing and harsher consequences.

<p>I went to support was joke went to police &amp; solicitor that got police more willing to complaint even went to one of the more higher up Xbox Live Ambassador but that was like tow the party line if you go to the ban forum full of console bans but all because
 it effects there bottom line Money the rest of us are not worth there time dont get me wrong the system is still the best out there Live the best online service but you do get the drawback of these problems until there bottom line is effected they just dont
 care Terms &amp; condictions are quite strict but not always inforced unless Bottom Line effected most times this has happened when in matches were you get the odd female gamer who is there first target then moves on to the person who defends the women gamer and
 on woulds just the way it works its the land of the Xbox Tough Guy down a mic brave with mouth not so much in real world ? Anyway back to points very sorry your had this happen to you no one deserves that was starting to think this was one person war but until
 we make a stant nothing gets done Iam standing will not stop until this gets addressed no matter the cost my children mean lot to me i Wont all this to continue</p>

<p>Every online platform has this rogue element where the smallest minority is the worst representation of that platform. The internet gives a certain anonymity to people who believe they are able to get away with anything they like</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There are already tools in place to deal with such things if and when they arise...file a complaint, block communications, only allow voice communications with Friends list, mute all other people in the game room/party</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>No its not nice when the nasty side of Gaming rears its ugly head. The way I have always looked at it is that its the internet, all virtual and never personal. Words are just words and are meaningless when delivered by strangers who you will never meet in
 real life...if you get an abusive message, report it by filing a complain, block communications and continue with whatever you were doing</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Dont cloud the issue with meaningless ranting about vague topics and be clear and concise when dealing with Xbox Support or even Microsoft support. The Xbox Ambassador program has no authority and is merely normal users with experience volunteering to share
 that knowledge and experience with others to hopefully help them out. It is not a route to getting specialist treatment from support or enforcement. As an ambassador, if someone contacts you to say they are having an issue then its your duty to refer them
 to Customer Support directly, and thats where your role ends</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It is a shame that such an element exists, when its children doing it then you have to wonder where their parents or adult supervision is to allow such things to happen. When its adults doing it all you can do is pity them and take the steps I have outlined
 to deal with it. The internet can be a wonderful place but it also has a darkside to it, common sense and a thick skin is often needed when you venture out into cyberspace</p>

<p>If Thant person man was over here in UK he would be being fitted for black bag by now Thats justice in my eyes not move on let it slide Ive already contacted police &amp; solicitor about this they advised me to talk with the powers that be to get this sorted
 but the enforcement team are like finding lord lucan handy that to busy to solve problems but when this dosn't effect the icome bottom line no so important but when live loses a few Quid there like piranha to those people</p>

<p>So your response is to say if this person was in the UK you would do physical harm that would lead to their death....do you not see how over the top that is?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Money has nothing to do with it, there are plenty of system tools in place to manage such instance and deal with it whilst protecting you and your children to prevent it happening or to stop it happening if it does arise...all this talk of police and solicitors
 is just OTT in my eyes</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I do respect your passion for wanting to protect your children but that passion is better being channelled into realistic action rather then a quest to shout at someone or to put someone in a body bag</p>

<h2>            Looking to join a clan for older adults</h2>
                    
<p>I play about 3 nights a week, for a couple hours.&nbsp; Mostly battlefield 3, but some gear wars, and modern warefare.&nbsp; I'm in my late 40's.&nbsp; Just wondering if there were any clans&nbsp;for my age group. Always think I'd be better if I played more, but it is what
 it is.</p>

<p>I would suggest you give Console 3 @Proboards a look. Alot of there members are extremely laid back back and they are not regimented like many of the clans that will post here in your there. They are just simple a group of people that play with each other
 on a variety of games.</p>
<p>N.B This not my community, just one I thought might interest you.</p>
