<h2>            Resetting oversized DPI &#40;488&#37;&#41; in  Windows XP</h2>
                    The dpi setting in my HP laptop (Windows XP) has been mistakenly set at 488% - this results in grosslyover sized pages - I have tried to access the display properties page to reset the dpi setting but because of the oversizing I cannot move over the page
 to access the activating buttons to reset the DPI setting to normal - I cannot move the pages up or down either - any advice welcome
                </div>

<span>We got some bad weather here and the power went out. Upon booting back up I was greeted with a CMOS
 reset message. Loaded optimized defaults. Tweaked some things back here and there.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Then I noticed Windows Apps refused to launch. Went to see my activation... GONE! Even worse, my product key is supposedly blocked! It was activated prior to the power going out. I upgraded from a legit licence of 8.1</p>

            Hi Don.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> WIndows apps that don't have an Uninstall button in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features may cause unintended consequences if they're uninstalled.  Edge removes Bing Search from the search box (no big loss for many), Connect you'll have to test it to see.  
<br />
<br />The Pro's at Microsoft TechNet forums have created an uninstaller for these apps which you can install and it will load them all (Get apps) then provide a button to run a script for each to remove it safely.  Get it here:  <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Windows-10-Store-Apps-5f60b9e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcen...</a>
<br />
<br />Set a System Restore point first so you can go back if necessary:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Sorry to inform you that there is no option to uninstall\delete Microsoft edge, but you can use the application “natural speaking” in internet explorer by making it has default browser as below.
<br />
<br />- Open internet explorer and go to settings icon. Then click on the option make “internet explorer the default browser”.

                    I am using 64 bit 5.1 silverlight with Windows 8.1 pro 64bit until recently this was working fine I could view Amazon streaming videos just fine however I am now getting a silverlight problem error message and despite clearing cache, application storage
 and several removal and reinstalls this problem is still happening.&nbsp; I know it is not an issue with Amazon because the flash player will stream all videos from there site just fine.&nbsp; The problem exists in IE and Firefox and Waterfox &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As you are facing the issue only on Amazon website and you are able to access all the other websites, I would suggest you to contact Amazon and check if there is some update going on or any known issues with their website. If you check the issue seems to be
 with all the web browsers. </span>

            Update:&nbsp; The problem exists only on Amazon.com and using the Silverlight player this issue occurs on my desktop,laptop and tablet all running 64 bit Windows 8.1 with 64 bit Silverlight 5.1.&nbsp; Videos using Silverlight on other sites work fine and Flash videos
 work fine on Amazon.&nbsp; I have noticed that when Silverlight add a website to application storage this does not seem to be happening with Amazon.

    <title>System Image Recovery Hangs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chester62  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Image Recovery Hangs</h2>
                    I have used Create a System Image and System image recovery several times. Lately, I still am able to create a System Image, but the system image recovery process now hangs. When I get to the point where "Preparing the system image recovery" message, the
 wheel spins for a few seconds, then the screen goes black and nothing more happens. I have to turn off the computer and turn it back on. The system image never recovers. Is a Windows 10 update causing this problem?

            <p>I discovered that if I wait until the step "Advanced Options" to connect the external drive containing the System Image, and then click on "System Image Recovery", the recovery proceeds normally.<br />
</p>
<p>If I connect the external drive before starting the recovery process, that is, before clicking on "Shift" &nbsp;and "Restart", the system hangs when I get to the "System Image Recovery" step.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Debra,
<br />
<br />Is the battery working on your laptop?
<br />
<br />If it is, this may be due to a faulty accelerometer sensor on your laptop. This sensor is designed to protect your hard drive in the event of a knock or fall.
<br />
<br />If the battery is not working on your laptop, the power lead may be loose . . .

            Hi Debra, I would return the laptop without delay, this is caused by a hardware issue, not a software issue, and as such there is nothing you can do to fix it . . .
<br />
<br />You are entitled to a new laptop, do not take any excuses from the seller . . .

            During the warranty, it is the full responsibility of the manufacturer for the functioning of their device. I suggest you to either contact seller or the manufacturer for better help.

 controls in my own account and now using a general account and it states that I require the password created by windows and God only knows how to find that. Windows chat help wants me to redo my entire system but I have way too many paid for programs installed
 and would have to take it out to do this all over again. I was using Enterprise and told by windows that enterprise was going to lose its update service so I did the update and it messed up my system totally and I took it out to remove windows ten then and
 it just updated it right back onto my system while asleep and removed my access to remove this update. it appears windows is now hijacking peoples systems</p>

<p>My query was in regards to windows ten not enterprise. I had been using enterprise before and this same thing took place and I had to remove everything from my system and buy a new system to have the same issue take place all over again. this is an issue
 with windows ten taking control over accounts.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No it wasn't helpful and I want to know is how does an update create a password where there is only one account on the system. I had but one account on mine and it as much as Hijacked the entire thing when it gave the latest update and when I came back on
 it had as much as loaded a brand new copy of windows onto my system which I had to reset my whole system on a new&nbsp; account anyway. But I am pissed off due to having a program set a password on My paid for computer so that I no longer have access to the administrative
 options which would even allow me to reinstall the system over again anyway. It did this to me back when I was using enterprise and updated to windows ten. I had zero access and had to as much as take it out and have the entire system wiped along with my files
 my programs and all my files. And when I did get it back it refused to recognize the secondary storage device I use to save my things on rather than saving them on the main hard drive. and I have never recovered these and some which I finally did recover were
 removed again buy this outrageous program which seems to want to take over all controls on my system and use only their rental programs and even set up a limited or metered account where I pay a server for ultra high-speed account which has zero metering on
 it I pay a flat rate so this program has hijacked all my information, my settings and my High speed internet which I pay for and placed my system on a metered one so they can charge me money. I called support and all they want to do is to treat my system like
 a dell computer and redo the entire system. Well I don't have a dell system I have a custom system and I can't even use the drivers that the devices are meant to use instead of using windows **** drivers fore lower speed systems. I have a Teradyne system with
 a * Gig drive with ultra four g download capability on a system Server which allows me ultra high speed downloads and uploads at a speed which most are still downloading at. And when I contact windows all I can get is someone in the Philippians which is the
 most corrupt place in the united states who wants me to give them my information and access. The first night I spoke with one of these guys they said wait twenty four hours and in that twenty four hours I got so many emails from people saying that thank you
 for the purchase and we need confirmation and this came all from the people working for windows in that particular end of Microsoft. and My issue is still unresolved. How does an update set a password on anyone system taking over their administrative account???</p>

<p>I spoke with someone who reported he was from Microsoft tech support. He advised me to allow him to access my system through the rescue me with the cross on it. and he said it would clear itself. The next day I had what appeared to be a new copy of windows
 on my system and I had to make up a nhew account. He told me to do a clean install and I told him that I couldn't due to my not having access to my Primary admin account to save my files which I could no longer view nor could I add or delete anything from
 my system due to the requirement of the admin password to do so. The next thing I got was a pop up saying I had a virus and that I needed to contact them right away. I looke dthe number up and it had no Microsoft connection but some woman in Arkansas NM FA
 and about nine or ten other states asking for confirmation of my purchase along with a new set of things found nin my connections box which I turned off immediately where I could. but I still have zero ability to open my admin account and my photos documents
 and everything I have done for years saved including family photos of passed on family etc. And I need this issue fixed.</p>

            They have taken control over my administrative password and installed an older version of Windows 10 over my new version and When I try and download the tool to remove it. or use the Windows defender, they both ask me for administrative password to complete
 to download and launch the tool. So how can I get around this. I am worried with contacting windows Help as I got this the same day that I was asking Windows online chat for help and the guy told me to wait twenty four hours and when I came back in twenty
 four hours was when I found that I had the old version of windows loaded over top of my brand new version just installed last month. Now I can't access any of the settings my Photo's documents of court files. So How can I contact Microsoft for help when it
 was them that I believe I got this from. I tried to contact them on the twelfth and spoke with one guy named Michael in the Philippeans( this is how people from there spell the name of the place) and that was the day that this thing got l

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you able to create any backup prior to the infection? Have you tried creating another user in the computer that has administrative privileges. Depending on where you are, if you are not computer savvy yourself, the best option might be to bring this
 computer in to a computer shop and have them try and see if they can recover the files for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the future, make sure you have layers of protection and recovery. There are lot of good free option out there. Check out Malwarebytes and Avast Free Anti-virus. For recovery, AOMEI backupper and RollBack Rx Home edition. Check them out, they have saved
 my computer many times on many occasions. Taking steps like this will make protecting your machine a lot better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            No They have the password reset and this particular windows program isn't my windows program but a second one that they installed over top of mine and set their own password for this. It was done through the Microsoft online chat located in the Philippeans
 and the guys name was Michael he said that I needed to wait for twenty four hours and it would be resolved. But the only thing that was resolved was the fact that my screen went black and I could no longer see what was taking place. I discovered that this
 windows program is an older version of windows ten and I found that out when I tried logging into my game. it refused to allow me to log in and came back with an error stating that my version of windows wasn't the same copy as used when I signed in with yesterday.
 So the tech guy while he was on my system set a old copy oif windows on top of my brand new copy which was only licensed last month and removed my password. I only ever had one account on my computer and the password was so specify

            Bell Aliant advised me that they had no way of asking or seeing what my administrative account settings are but they passed it up the line to their security department and they will call me on Monday. But the main issue for me contacting Microsoft tech
 was that My screen was going black flickering all the time and I thought it was the monitor so I contacted Microsoft online support but by then I guess with the updates on the 12 of June I got the ransom ware as it says in my defender which Picked it up only
 yesterday. But It can't remove it without the account password and I really need someone I can trust to fix this. I just had this system redone less than four months ago brand new clean install and now this. I olive on disability which in Canada isn't much.
 So I can't afford to take it out and the last time I took it to them they said they had saved my files to the desktop but it was only the icon for the save and not the files when I did find the files I couldn't open them due to having a di

                    <p>I'm using Windows 7 Pro, SP1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately, I've noticed that when I click a menu command such as "file, save as"&nbsp;for any of several different programs, after the command has processed the command (save as...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl+S) still shows on the screen as&nbsp;a ghost (even if I closed the program).
 I've also noticed that MS Word has been locking up on Save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas&nbsp;on the cause of all this?</p>

            &nbsp; It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into Safe Mode.&nbsp; Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in Safe Mode.&nbsp; To
 get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode.&nbsp; Then run a full system scan.<br />

&nbsp;Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at <br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</a><br />

&nbsp;If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem.&nbsp; To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore.&nbsp; Click the box that says Show more restore points.
<br />
- <br />
&nbsp;You can check for corrupted system files.&nbsp; Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type CMD in the search box, right-click CMD.EXE and click Run as administrator. Then from the command prompt type sfc /scannow.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log.&nbsp; To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer.&nbsp; Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.<br />
&nbsp; `<br />
&nbsp;When you get your system back in good working order, I urge you to back your system up to an external hard drive and make regular periodic updates to it.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t resize taskbar in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristym1972  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t resize taskbar in Windows 10</h2>
                    This morning I had a nice size taskbar full of all of the icons I wanted and then my battery died. When I plugged in my laptop (Dell Inspiron 7558), my taskbar was tiny and all but three icons were gone. I tried right clicking then bringing up properties
 but nothing worked. I went to display settings to see if anything had changed there. I clicked a different resolution then revert and the taskbar completely disappeared. I checked online and tried almost every suggestion short of resetting my laptop. I finally
 decided to just restart it and it did bring the taskbar back. The problem now is the same as the original problem. The taskbar is too small and it won't resize by scrolling over the top to get an arrow, then clicking and moving up. Also, I can't make the sections
 bigger or pin programs to the taskbar. I've made no changes to the hardware or added new software and it came with Windows 10 in August 2015. Any help &nbsp;would be appreciated very much! TIA!

            The sfc scan found no problems. There was an error with DISM, error 87. It says the online/cleanup-image/restorehealth option unknown. It also said to check the log and gave me the file path. When I checked the log it is showing activity as far back as
 March 24th. The interesting thing is that it DISM was apparently doing something this morning at the time these problems started. What exactly is DISM and what will happen if I uninstall it?

<p>Sounds like an issue with your licenses. It used to happen on 360 also if you were playing on a console without the licenses in the correct place. Ensure your xbox one is set to your accounts HOME</p>

<p>dude, just went through this about 2 months back. i love my xbox also BUT their service SUCKS.took 57 days to get xbox repaired. i sent in harddrive and you would think put new harddrive in package and send back. no brainer right ? the on line "<strong>[Mod
 Removed]</strong>" who read off some company crap had no real answers for the delays.the xbox 360s has an "over heating problem.after finaly getting the superviser and ripping him a new one finaly got the new harddrive back.in fact they sent 2 new hardrives
 back. xbox service is bad. goog luck.</p>

<p>Just downloading everything for BF3 right now on my old console. my Star Wars console is @ fed ex and i paid 15$ to make sure it was packed up right !!! Now that was kind of upsetting but i don't want to take any chances ..... now if only i would of saved
 my game saves somehow but i didn't want to take the time to figure that out , wich was probably a mistake .... but i figure i can dust of my Wii that i never used !!!! i will say the days of them sending a secure box to ship it in already are missed .... i
 guess its quicker to box it up yourself and take it down there but it felt more secure back in the UPS days !!! it will take all night to download !! &nbsp; &nbsp; smiles !!</p>

<p>Make sure you wrap the Console and the Power Supply in Bubble-Wrap &amp; secure it in the box (atleast an inch of padding around console).. Don't just put it in a box to bounce around &amp; get damaged by postal workers..</p>
<p>Any damage caused from your negligence in packing the console for shipping can void your warranty &amp; you will be charged for it to be repaired &amp; sent back etc..</p>

<p>Well, that's a bit stupid... What happens if the Power Supply is the problem &amp; you don't send it with the Console... They will just test it with their PSU in working order &amp; say nothing is wrong with the console &amp; send it back.. Then you are back to square
 one again, as your PSU in your posession is the problem..</p>

<h2>            EVOLVE DLC PACKS NOT WORKING INGAME.</h2>
                    After buying Evolve, I puchased a few dlc skin packs and a couple aren't working after they've been installed. They are the WENDIGO and BOG skins for the Wraith monster. All other dlc works fine. I have uninstalled everything and reinstalled, I've cleared
 the memory cache, did a full restart and even unplugged the xbox for 2 minutes. Is there something wrong with that dlc?

    <title>How do I identify a new type of virus&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric kolotyluk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I identify a new type of virus&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently I got hit by the FakeRean virus that I downloaded via Firefox 4 Beta 6. The mechanism is that the web site opens a global modal dialog offering to play a video, but instead installs a virus. In most cases I can recognize this as an attack, and the
 solution is to open Task Manager and terminate Firefox. Because the attack uses a global modal dialog, all other features of Firefox are disabled. However, if you're not thinking quick, sometimes you click the dialog by mistake instead of terminating Firefox.</p>
<p>Mozilla are actively working on this vector in Firefox 4, and hope to have a solution for the global modal dialog problem before the final release of Firefox 4.</p>
<p>Windows Security Essentials was able to identify it pretty quickly as FakeRean, but was not able to block it. Also, after running a scan and removing some&nbsp;occurrences&nbsp;&nbsp;of the virus, the virus was still able to&nbsp;propagate to other places. I scanned my computer
 3 or 4 times without resolving the problem. Finally I downloaded and installed Windows Defender and had it scan a few time. For a while I had both Security Essentials and Windows Defender scanning at the same time. Finally after a day and a half I seemed to
 have gotten rid of the virus, but it took a great many scans by two applications to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>More recently I have encountered a similar, but far more nasty virus. It as the same behavior of many of the 'fake' security software viruses, it claims you have a virus, and prompts you to scan. It uses a combination of pop-up windows, system tray warnings,
 etc., although not quite as annoying as the FakeRean I had before. The nasty part is any time you try to run your security software, Security Essentials or Windows Defender, it intercepts them saying they are infected, so you cannot run them. Also, it seems
 to be smart enough to detect when you go to a web site to download security software and blocks that too. After several hours of trying I was not able to run any currently installed security software, or download and install any new security software. I probably
 could have found a few other things to try, but I had performed a full system backup the day before, so I simply booted my Windows Setup DVD and restored the last image backup - which seemed to solve the problem. A subsequent scan by Security Essentials found
 nothing.</p>
<p>This recent virus was also installed via Firefox 4, but beta 7 this time. I think I may have clicked on some dialog to activate it, but it was not too clear. Also, the attack site(s) seem to try installing a Firefox plug-in, but I never confirmed the request
 to install.</p>
<p>After restoring my system image, I ran into the same problem again via Firefox 4 beta 7 and picked up the virus from some web site, but this time I was being really careful to not click any dialogs or confirm any actions, so something more devious was going
 on as I picked up exactly the same virus, but a different way. Again, just restored my last backed up image and my system is clear of the virus again.</p>
<p>I can't say that Firefox 4 is specifically the problem because I have not tried other browsers on the same web sites, but these new attack sites seem to be getting more devious at getting around the security features in browsers. Also, they have no problem
 getting through Windows Security Essentials even when active protection is enabled.</p>
<p>Anyway, does this particular virus have a name? It would probably be 'fake' something.</p>
<p>Can anyone think of any way to identify the virus? I might try leaving Security Essentials open next time I go web browsing and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Can anyone think of any other ways to combat this virus, short of restoring the last system image backup?</p>
<p>Cheers, Eric</p>

            Hi Eric,<br />
<br />
I wouldn't know if this particular virus has a name. It may be the <strong>ThinkPoint</strong> virus, or, it could be a new virus of some kind.<br />
<br />
I'd have you post the issue in <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Support+Website+Forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
firefox forums</a> and check if other users too are facing similar issues.<br />
<br />
The best way to combat the virus as of now, is to run a complete scan using your security software in&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a> to flush it out.<br />

<p>My security scans look good. Unless the virus can find a way to alter a system image backup, I'm pretty confident the virus is gone.</p>
<p>Maybe some day some bright *-hole will figure out how to infect a system image backup. I hope Microsoft have considered this vector and have plans to protect the image files.</p>
<p>Cheers, Eric</p>

<p>Sorry, I have no file because my security software was crippled there was no way to determine what the file was. I don't even understand the vector at this point as this is the most mysterious virus I have seen to date.</p>

            This issue might happen if there are any pending updates in the Windows or if some system files might got corrupted.

            Hi Don.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />See also the fixes here:  <a href="https://appuals.com/fix-windows-update-error-c1900107/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appuals.com/fix-windows-update-error-c1...</a>
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

                    <span>
<p>I cannot empty my recycle bin properly. Please help me!!!</p>
<p>It has 418 MB of files in it and I have already tried emptying it in safe mode but that didn't work. I think the file responsible is a 3GPP Quicktime file but when I tried deleting it on its own, it starts deleting but stays at 0MB deleted and the speed
 and time left both say calculating. I can't even restore the file to delete it.</p>

<p>Here is another method :<br />
Try Method One first. <br />
Note : <br />
1.) Make sure you are in Elevated Command prompt. Most people somehow overlook that step.<br />
2.) The command line has spaces in between. To avoid typo, <strong>copyandpaste</strong> the command line to the cmd<br />

 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try the following compliments of Andy Song (this will almost certainly work - you may even want to try it first as it is simple and relatively
 fast):</span></p>
<span>
<p>
<span>1.</span><span> Open a windows explorer, click<strong>Tools</strong> menu -&gt;
<strong>Folder</strong> <strong>Options (NOTE: You must be logged in as an Administrator to do this entire&nbsp;procedure.)</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Click<strong>View</strong> tab</span></p>
<p>
<span>A) Dot<strong>Show hidden files and folders</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>B) Uncheck<strong>Hide protected operating system files</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.</span><span> Locate the path to<strong>C:\</strong> drive, or the one that has Vista installed on it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.</span><span> Right click on the<strong> $RECYCLE.BIN</strong> folder and click<strong>Delete</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.</span><span> Vista will then automatically recreate a new<strong>$RECYCLE.BIN</strong> folder but the old one
 and its contents should be gone.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

    <title>Win 10 to Win 7 revert process got hung and now I only have a command - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickinbama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 to Win 7 revert process got hung and now I only have a command prompt to save me....please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I can't believe how poorly thought-out Win 10 is. We've had problems with computer hangs, middle mouse button no longer allows you to click, recovering data for various programs, and being unable to print wirelessly. I attempted to use the "simple" process
 of reverting back to Win 7 but, upon the final pass to boot the system into my old OS, a quick error message flashes on the screen and I am left with recovery options....NONE of which works. According to the system, there is no backup file to use (even though
 Win 10 asked if I wanted it to create one) and all of my software was already on the system when I got it, so I don't have any system disks. I do have the ability to use the command prompt and that's it. I don't even know if there is a windows.old file on
 my computer because I'm not sure how to find it using a command prompt. Again, before you respond, I've tried every recovery method offered that I could use and I Windows isn't coming up so I can't use it to navigate to a solution. Any help would be greatly
 appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the system will not start in safe mode either.</p>

            <p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the suggestion provided by Andre Da Costa replied on June 4, 2015 from the below link and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/rollback-to-previous-windows/ac25b625-93a8-4864-8afd-4eb5f4a08736">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/rollback-to-previous-windows/ac25b625-93a8-4864-8afd-4eb5f4a08736</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run the below command to back up data.</p>
<p><strong>xcopy&nbsp; source&nbsp; destination&nbsp; /M /E /G /H /Y</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This one uses archive attributes of files to distinguish the files that have not been changed since the time last back up was taken.<em> /M</em> switch turns off the archive attribute on the files after copying the file to
 the destination. This attribute will be set only if someone modifies the files after wards.&nbsp; For the above example the command is given below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Xcopy&nbsp; D:\Data&nbsp; Z:\Backup&nbsp; /M /E /G /H /Y</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Back up data using date and time stamps</strong></p>
<p>We can do incremental backup by specifying the date the last back up was taken. Xcopy will copy only the files that have changed after this date. For this we need to run the below command.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>xcopy source destination /E /G /H /Y /D:mm-dd-yy</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

    <title>Windows 10 Taskbar and Sims 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neekohlass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar and Sims 4</h2>
                    Whenever I attempt to play the Sims 4 since getting Windows 10, I cannot hide the task bar at the bottom of the screen. Also it does not go to full screen, because I can see the top of the window and when I click it I can drag the window all over. I have
 already selected the auto hide option and played with the task bar settings, and nothing works. Sims 4 is my one stress reliever, and now it's driving me crazy! Can anyone help? I bought this computer so I could play my games on it.&nbsp;

            Thanks, I just got off chat support with them and they said it was Windows that was the problem and I should contact Windows. Which I found pretty much as useful as a pair of glass cymbals. Oh well, I really hope this gets straightened out.&nbsp;

            <p>I suspected as much for EA, the problem is the game DRM which the cause of 99% of the problems I have seen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some titles will not run on anything better than XP and Sims 4 is the current platform so I understand your frustration</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scan their forums and that is why I was aware in the first play of the game issue</p>
