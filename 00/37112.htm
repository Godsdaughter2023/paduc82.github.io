<h2>            Cortana &#124; Microphone &#124; Something&#39;s not right. Try again in a little bit</h2>
                    <p>Whem I click the microphone icon in Cortana, a receive this message "Something's not right. Try again in a little bit" or "Something went wrong. Try again in a little bit".<br />
<br />
It seems that Cortana can't access or make use of the microphone from my Surface Pro 3, because it always show the error messagem whem I click the microphone icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In others applications, such as Skype, the microphone works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a factory reset, but the error persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>Yes. The search is working fine. </p>
<p>The problem is only when I click the microphone icon, printing the error "Something's not right. Try again in a little bit" or "Something went wrong. Try again in a little bit".</p>

            I have exactly the same problem and symptoms. The only place where the microphone doesn't work is Cortana. Cortana will even get the "hey Cortana!" words and popup the little box, which will immediately crash. The microphone is a webcam and it's working
 on everything from VOIP in games to Skype, etc. As I said, Cortana even gets the "hey Cortana", it will simply crash when I get to talk to her. Same thing happens when I manually click on the microphone. Crashes with "Something's not right".

            <p>I have exactly the same problem even after fresh installing windows quite a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some point, Cortana stops working with no changes in Location/Language. Also no changes in the audio settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search works great if I type something, but if I click on the microphone, it just pops up the "listening" tag only to forward to the error message cited above. Sometimes it says "something's not right ...", some other times it says "something went wrong
 ..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>- I already tried to rebuild window indexes and restarted the computer</p>
<p>- Already ran search and indexes troubleshooter</p>
<p>- Already ran "sfc /scannow" and the dism commands (CheckHealth and RestoreHealth) as admin</p>
<p>- Sound/Mic is working fine in all the other applications (including Cortana inside a Win10 vbox machine)</p>
<p>- Cortana fires up if I say "Hey Cortana", even though it prompts the same error afterwards (that proofs mic works)</p>
<p>- If I reinstall windows, Cortana works for a few days, then the problem comes back out of nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>- I tried changing mic level, as suggested above, but it is seems to be fine</p>

            <p>Changing microphone levels, the "Right audio" in the microphone settings, switching microphones from the default one to the webcam one, didn't matter at all. Same for sfc /scannow, indexing troubleshooter and the rebuild of the index. I'm really out of ideas
 now.</p>

            <p>I finally found a solution last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I will describe my problem. As I said, I tried to reinstall windows quite a few times, and, each time, I kept checking on Cortana while installing and personalizing. In the end, Cortana was still working.</p>
<p>A few days later, it suddenly started to throw the "something's not right" message. Even though it responds to "Hey Cortana", it will stop right after it starts listening. Type search, on the other hand, kept working most of the times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the solution. I came across this website where the guy said he changed the number format settings and the only way to get Cortana back in business was to reset them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Voilá. It worked for me. All I had to do was go to Control Panel / Clock Language and Region / Change Date Time or Number Formats / Additional Settings / Reset / Apply. Not even a computer restart was needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if you guys are facing the same problems I had, but that's for sure a tricky "solution" that might help quite a few people, cos most of the world use metric system instead of US, or use comma instead of point for decimals. For some weird reason,
 it will prevent Cortana from listening to the user.</p>

<h2>            Lenovo Yoga Pro 3 touchpad not working</h2>
                    Hi! My laptop's touchpad stopped working a couple days ago after a device update. When I access device manager and control panel there isn't even an option for a touchpad (settings says "mouse" instead of "mouse and touchpad", and device manager only shows
 HID compliant mouse) so most of the solutions suggested online don't work. Thanks for the help!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Esa,<br />

Since updating the driver didn't help, we suggest running the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. To do so, press
<strong>Windows key</strong> &gt; type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; hit <strong>Enter</strong> &gt; under
<strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, click <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong> under
<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>. <br />

<p><span><span>Hi
</span><span><span><span>hobill</span></span></span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would first suggest you to connect some other keyboard to this computer and check if it’s working fine.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Let’s also follow these troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Type ‘regedit’ in the start search box, hit enter. Open regedit.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. in registry editor window, browse to this location
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hkey_Local_Machine\system\currentcontrolset\control\class\{4D36E96B-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.In the right pane, if you find upper filter and lower filter listed there. Right click on them and delete them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Close registry.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.Reboot the computer and check if the keyboard is working properly.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry
 incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry,

<h2>            In Windows NTFS file or folder operation permissions lists, what does a small red &#34;X&#34; mean by a user name&#63;</h2>
                    For example, on some files or folders the "Guest" user name has a red "X" by it, while for other files and folders on the same drive on the same computer the "Guest" user name does not have a red "X" by it, even though the file and folder permissions for
 the user Guest are the same on both. Why?

<p>No, these folders are not on a mapped network drive.&nbsp; They are all on the local drive, which is the same drive that Windows Vista is installed on.</p>
<p>Yes, I am able to access all of the folders.</p>
<p>I don't receive any error messages when accessing any of the folders.</p>

Try to log in to the computer using another administrator account and check if you can access the files and folders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the computer is connected to a local area network, and logged in to that network as an administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can also access the files and folders when logged in to the network as a different administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is sometimes a red "X" by the "Guest" user name in the NTFS file and folder permissions, and it doesn't seem to depend on whether or not the computer's guest account is enabled or disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does the red "X" mean when it appears on the "Guest" user name, in the NTFS file and folder permissions?<br />

<h2>            difficulty with &#34;built in administrator&#34;</h2>
                    ok, here goes. When i bought this computer, it had windows 10 already installed. Also note that whenever I go to open different apps, a pop up appears saying that "this app cannot open, because you have built in administrator, please sign in with a different
 account and try again. So I did what most people would do, try to create a new account on my laptop, but whenever i go to create one, the application suddenly closes itself. I have had many problems with these apps, and the power dvd player that was installed
 with the computer. I am not able to play a dvd series without paying an additional $300 to upgrade it, and the windows dvd player that should have come free with the computer is not installed.&nbsp;

            Hi Carl
<br />
<br />Data backups that contain your files should work, system backups that also contain a copy of the OS may not
<br />
<br />In Windows 10, open the old Control Panel (Click your Start Button, then just type control and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />If necessary, on the top right, set View to Icons or small icons
<br />
<br />Go to Backup and Restore (Windows 7)
<br />
<br />From there try to navigate to load one of your old backups and see if you can access the data from there . ..

            <p>You are correct. &nbsp;Edge has yet to catch up. &nbsp;But then everyone knows that. &nbsp;Microsoft has made no secret of the need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders are expecting to see extensions tested in Edge during the Redstone builds they will be receiving, starting in a few weeks or perhaps in January. &nbsp;This is a feature proposed for Redstone just as Bulldog says.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The situation with M$ Edge not supporting extensions is just a repeat of their usual development philosophy; just throw it at the wall and see what sticks!&nbsp; They still haven't figured out that the end user population is more than sick and tired of them deploying
 half baked software.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look carefully, you will see that W10 is mostly half baked.&nbsp; From my observation they added a lot of W7 code back into W8.1 when they figured out that the corporate customers would never accept W8.1.&nbsp; There are hundreds of modules that should have
 been upgraded to the W10 look and feel and then integrated into a more robust menu system.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is the <b>VIDEO_TDR_ERROR (116)</b> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that an attempt to reset the display driver and recover from a timeout failed.
</i><br />
<br />
<u><b>The basic definition of a 0x116 bugcheck is:</b></u><br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
<i>There may be a bug in the video driver or video hardware.</i></blockquote>
So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for
<i><b>'Timeout Detection and Recovery'</b></i>. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN article!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>Timeout detection:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries to preempt this particular
 task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds. If the GPU cannot complete
 or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</i><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Preparation for recovery:</b></blockquote>

<b>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</b></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware. The
 operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;

<blockquote><b>Desktop recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.

<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<b><i>(Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with
 the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.)</i></b><br />
<br />
<u><b>The following hardware issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.
<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as VRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
<b>GPU testing:</b> Furmark, run for ~15 minutes and watch temperatures to ensure there's no overheating and watch for artifacts.<br />
<br />
<b>RAM testing:</b> Memtest - Refer to the below:<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>Memtest:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />

<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />

You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<b>To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:</b><br />
<br />
<b>a )</b> Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
- Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
- Then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
<b>b )</b> In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
<b>c )</b> Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
<b>d ) </b>Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
<b>b ).</b> Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
<b>e )</b> Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<b>Run System File Checker:</b><br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure. Whether it's heat, power issue (PSU issue), failing VRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following software issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
- Incompatible drivers of any sort <br />
<br />
- Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
- Corrupt Direct X - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113</a><br />
<br />
- Corrupt system files (run System File Checker as advised above)<br />
<br />
- Buggy and or corrupt 3rd party drivers. If you suspect a 3rd party driver being the issue, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

<h3> partyrican  say:</h3>
<h2>            One specific folder indicates &#34;not responding&#34; when trying to open</h2>
                    <p>First of all, please forgive me when trying to explain my problem, as I'm not a computer whiz by any stretch...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 8.1, no recent changes to my laptop, and I'm trying to open a folder that I regularly open several times a day. In fact, my problem started after already opening/using this folder several times today. When I double-click to open it, the file
 opens with the blue-circle icon indicating the request is being processed, but nothing happens after several minutes. I try closing it to re-try, and that's when I see "not responding" on the top of the file box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specific folder I'm trying to open is a sub-folder in my Music folder. All other folders within the Music folders can be opened with no problem. The specific folder only contains jpeg files. Even though I can't open the sub-folder in question, using
 File Explorer I can still open other folders within this specific sub-folder that I now can't open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened in the past, with this and other specific folders, on a one-time basis (in other words: it's nothing that happens regularly - maybe a few times a year). Usually, I just restart my laptop and I'm then able to open the folder. However, this
 time that's not working. I've tried resetting defaults in the Libraries folder, re-naming the specific folder I'm trying to open and even copied the folder to desktop - all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Again, please keep in mind that I'm not a computer whiz when providing solutions. Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the quick response. However, none of those issues pertain to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not get an "access denied".</p>
<p>It is not encrypted.</p>
<p>I am the sole user of my laptop, so "permission" is not an issue.</p>
<p>User profile is not corrupted.</p>
<p>The file is not corrupted. (I can now access it through File Explorer's Libraries folder, but still not through my Music folder. Again, it is only one sub-folder in the Music folder that cannot be accessed through normal opening.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, to review, I cannot open the sub-folder directly through My Documents-Music-, but it can be opened through File Explorer-Libraries-Music-.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

 DEFAULT printer, then by default Windows should print to the printer!

<h2>            Windows 10 clipboard inconsistent behaviour if the window from which it copies is closed before pasting</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I am running a healthy, recently in-place upgraded, activated copy of Windows 10, build 10.0.17134.137. On each of these apps,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows 10 Mail</p>
</li><li>
<p>Microsoft Store</p>
</li><li>
<p>IDLE (Python Text Editor)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>( I am sure there are more)</p>
<p>
</p><p>, I managed to reproduce the following behaviour:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy text from a window of the app.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Close it</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select another window of the same app or, any other app.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Try to paste. Does not work. Clipboard appears to be empty.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>updated</strong>: The issue persists on any freshly created user account. My system files doesn't appear damaged according to both the sfc &amp; dism utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's both surprising and immensely ridiculous. I don't know which exactly. Know issue and fix?</p>

    <title>Guia de conquista jetpack joyride - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atila hunter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Guia de conquista jetpack joyride </h2>
                    
<p>Hey pessoal, esse é meu primeiro guia, então sejam gentis rs</p>
<p>1-O jogo jetpack joyride é um game bem simples de se jogar, ao longo da sua gameplay você vai pegando as manhas do jogo, o jogo não tem para nos brasileiros no windows phone, para adquiri-lo você tem que mudar a região do seu celular para a dos Estados unidos,
 então reinicie o celular e baixe o jogo</p>
<p>2-Agora vamos para as conquistas que é o que todo mundo estava esperando, mas antes quero dizer que não platinei o game (ainda) pois tem uns acheviements muitos difíceis e que requer que você junte dinheiro muito dinheiro</p>
<p>3- vamos as conquistas</p>
<p>-Alpa Charlie Echo-5(G)</p>
<p>Nessa conquista você tem que voar mais de 2km (ou 2000 metros) não se preocupe muito com ela uma hora ela libera</p>
<p>-Bullseye-15(G)</p>
<p>Essa é meio complicada ( eu consegui na cagada rs), você tem que terminar o jogo em exatos 200m (é mais difícil que parece)</p>
<p>tem dois métodos para conseguir ela: o primeiro método e não equipar nenhum gadgets, evitar veículos e quando chegar aos 175m se jogue em um zapper(um bagulho amarelo que da choque), já o segundo método você tem que equipar o gadgets Freeze-O-Matic e se
 jogar no primeiro zapper que ver na sorte a conquista pipoca na sua tela</p>
<p>-Class Act-15(G)<br />
Nessa conquista você tem que voar mais de 1km vestindo o Top hat, Classy suit e traditional jetpack</p>
<p>Porque essa conquista é difícil ? bem não é difícil, é cansativa, primeiramente você tem que juntar 23500 coins para comprar o top hat que custa 6k, a classy suit que custa 7500 e o traditional jetpack que custa 10k,depois disso voe 1000m e a conquista é
 sua</p>
<p>-Crazy Freaking Skills-15(G)</p>
<p>Voe mais de 800m no CFT(maquina roxa de teletransporte)</p>
<p>Conquista auto-explicativa, pegue o veiculo e evite os zappers, faça essa conquista quando já estiver bom no jogo pois é meio difícil de controlar o CFT</p>
<p>-For science-5(G)</p>
<p>Mate ou derrube 1000 cientistas, não se preocupe com essa conquista ao longo de sua gameplay você ira libera-la</p>
<p>-Fuzzy Locks-5(G)</p>
<p>Morra por zappers ou lasers 99 vezes, não se preocupe com essa conquista também, vai ser liberada ao longo de sua gameplay</p>
<p>-Gold Digger-5(G)</p>
<p>Colete 20 moedas apos morrer, conquista acumulativa , não precisa se afobar para consegui-la, uma boa forma de conseguir ela é equipar o gadget Insta-Ball</p>
<p>-James Who?- 15(G)</p>
<p>Compre 2 jetpacks, auto-explicativo, essa conquista é chata pois você precisa juntar mais de 13k de coins, já que os jetpacks mais baratos custam 6k e 7k</p>
<p>-Not so Green-5(G)</p>
<p>Basta completar 10 missões, fácil fácil</p>
<p>-Romeo Alpha Delta-15(G)</p>
<p>Voe 5km ou mais em uma unica corrida , a conquista mais difícil do jogo</p>
<p>Tem dois métodos para conseguir ela: ou você vai na raça,ou você junta muito dinheiro para liberar os gadgtes Dezapnator e Turbo boost, compre um pacote de reviver ( vem 3 ou 4 corações por 10k) compre um super head star(vai ajudar bastante), colete o maior
 numero de tokens possível, pegue todos os veículos que aparecer e boa sorte( você vai precisar)</p>
<p>-Spice of life-5(G)</p>
<p>Para a conquista pipocar, você tem que andar em todos os veículos do jogo, são eles:</p>
<p>CFT- Teletransporte roxo</p>
<p>Lil stomper- um robozão vermelho que *** muito alto</p>
<p>Bad as Hog- uma moto com uma shotgun</p>
<p>Gravity suit- roupa azul que não tem gravidade aplicada sobre a mesma</p>
<p>Profit Bird- um pássaro vermelho que peida dinheiro</p>
<p>Mr.Cuddles - um robô dragão que cospe fogo</p>
<p>-Rejected-5(G)</p>
<p>Voe perto de um token mas não pegue ele</p>
<p>Essa eu nunca consegui,mas tem um método na internet que é assim: comprar e equipar o gadget Gift Token que custa 5k. Comece um novo jogo e você verá o símbolo aparecer na frente de você e, lentamente, é atraído para você. Fique perto da parte inferior do
 mapa e quando ele está próximo, lançar-se para o teto, para evitar bater. Depois que ele passou, a conquista pipocara na sua tela</p>
<p>-Veteran-15(G)</p>
<p>Complete 40 missões, auto-explicativo, vai conseguir durante a sua gameplay</p>
<p>-Happy Snap-5(G)</p>
<p>Salve um foto, quando terminar uma partida vai ter uma foto de um momento qualquer da partida, clica nela e depois no disquete, a conquista é sua</p>
<p>-A man, my son-15(G)</p>
<p>A segunda mais difícil do jogo nessa você tem que completar todas as missões e começar de novo, para isso você tem que conseguir as 105 estrelas e passar do nível 15, apos isso comece as missões de novo e a conquista pipoca</p>
<p>Conquistas Secretas:</p>
<p>-Blinged Out-15(G)</p>
<p>Compre um upgrade de ouro para seu veiculo, basta juntar 10k e comprar um upgrade de ouro para seu veiculo preferido</p>
<p>-Pretty Women-10(G)<br />
Compre um kit de roupas, recomendo que compore o Top Hat e a classy suit para adiantar a conquista Class Act</p>
<p>-Tee Hee Two-10(G)</p>
<p>Colete 69 coins em uma partida (aquela carinha), auto-explicativo bem fácil também</p>
<p>-Walkies-5(G)</p>
<p>Nessa conquista você tem que estar equipar o gadget Flash e percorrer uma distancia acumulada de 10km</p>
<p>Valeu pessoal, obrigado por ter chegado ate aqui espero ter ajudado, de um like ai no post, de algumas dicas nos comentarios de como eu posso melhorar o guia, até o próximo post valeu falou</p>

            <p>I that so?&nbsp;I just bought 2 weeks ago an hp laptop with Windows 10 and all of a sudden &nbsp;I am having trouble connecting to my Router (Linksys N750). I spoke to a Tech there and said that my Network Access Protection had stopped and that the network firewall
 was down and only an Network Engineer could fix it. Mentioning that my IP address had to be changed?
</p>
<p>If I connect directly with an Ethernet cord to my laptop the internet works perfect.&nbsp; Now I am even more confused. I never had any problems with Windows 8 wish&nbsp; I can go back to it but for now I need help to connect to my router.&nbsp; Any suggestions what might
 be happening? </p>
<p>Thank You in advance.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Media Center is a huge dissappointment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boulevardier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Media Center is a huge dissappointment</h2>
                    <br />
After trying out Windows 8.1 Media Center Pack for 2 months I'm giving up and will be returning Windows 8 for a refund. I will shortly be installing Windows 7. Here's Why.<br />
<br />
I use the Windows Media Center to control my entire Home Theater System. I was really happy with the old Vista Media Center but unfortunately after 6 years of great service my hard drive died. I replaced the unit rather than repair in order to get the latest
 and greatest. I decided on a Windows 8 desktop mainly because no one was selling Windows 7 into the Home user space anymore. I did my due diligence research on Windows 8 and became convinced that it would work for me.<br />
<br />
Surprise number 1: All versions of <b>Vista included Media Center</b> (except home basic), and all versions of
<b>Windows 7 included Media Center</b>. Windows 8 comes in two flavours: Home and PRO. Who do you think would be more likely to have a home theater system? A home user or an office worker? If you answered the Home user you'd be wrong according to Microsoft.
 I wonder how many home theatres Microsoft has seen in a professional environment?&nbsp; I purchased a PC with Windows 8 and then had to upgrade to
<b>PRO at extra cost.</b> But wait, where's the Media Center? Still can't find it!
<b>It turns out Windows 8.1 PRO doesn't have it either. </b>It only gives you the
<b>right to purchase</b>, at <b>extra cost,</b> the exulted Media Center Pack, which I did.<br />
<br />
Finally I got to use Windows 8.1 Media Center but quickly ran into the following issues:<br />
1) There is no "Play DVD" button anywhere in Media Center 8. N.B. this button used to exist in both Vista and Windows 7 versions. Why no DVD's? Somebody at Microsoft decided that no one plays DVD movies anymore. Can you believe it?&nbsp; If you go to the "DVD playback
 options for Windows" section (Google it) you will see the following statement: "Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 Pro don't come with DVD movie playback capability. If you're running Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 Pro, you can search for a DVD player app in the Windows
 Store (learn more about the Windows Store). If you have Windows 8.1 Pro, you can also buy the Windows 8.1
<i>Media Center Pack that includes DVD playback</i>." However the<b> last part is false</b>: Windows
<b>Media Center pack does NOT include DVD playback</b> options. To play a DVD you must leave the Media Center, put down your remote control, look for the elusive mouse and start a third party player such as Cyberlink PowerDVD. Your remote is now useless. You
 have to start, stop, pause, rewind etc. with your mouse.<br />
<br />
2) Similarly for BluRay movies I have to exit Media Center and start Cyberlink PowerDVD. N.B. Media Center could never directly play BluRays but a Cyberlink button was available
<b>inside </b>the older Vista Media Center and Media Center 7 so that it was possible to start a BluRay movie from WITHIN Media Center with a remote.&nbsp; In Media Center 8 again, put down your remote and pick up the mouse when you want to watch BluRays.<br />
<br />
3) My Hauppauge Colossus TV tuner card does not work with Media Center 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N.B. this card is listed as Windows 8 compatible. Although it is listed as Windows 8 compatible it is not Windows Media Center compatible. This is bizarre. Windows Media Center is the
 only Microsoft application that needs and uses TV tuner cards and if doesn't work then the only other option you have to bring a TV signal into your PC is to install a third party app. I tried WinTV, which didn't work. There are&nbsp; several other good choices:
 XBMC and Mediaportal to name just two. If you go the XBMC route you would have absolutely no need for the Microsoft Media Center since XBMC does it all in spades. By the way the Colossus works perfectly in Windows 7 including the Media Center. Can't watch
 or record live TV without a functioning TV tuner card.<br />
<br />
4) Before my Vista Media Center died I managed to backup my "Recorded TV" files. I copied these into Windows 8 Media Center's Recorded TV file. The thumbnails are displayed properly in Media Center but will not play at all. Curiously both the Windows 8 Media
 Player and the third party Cyberlink PowerDVD both play them properly. but Windows Media Center 8 does not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the irony of this sad situation:<br />
Windows 8.1 PRO ofers you great Media Center solution ...... unless you want to watch a DVD, BluRay, Live TV or Recorded TV. What a load of tripe!<br />
<br />
Stay away if you want to keep your sanity.

            <p>Windows 8.1 Media Center is a huge disappointment ,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Firstly it is not Windows 8.1 Pro With Media Centre that is the problem it is actually software/ Hardware driver&nbsp;error that is causing your issues somewhere during the down load it became corrupt,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Secondly your better off using VLC Media Player or Gom Player for any DVD play back both work great on Windows 8.1 and they can work at the same time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've been using Windows 8.1 with no media centre and can play all dvd's and movies forward and rewind with no issues as I did with Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8 Pro Pack With Media Centre I also tried Windows 8 Enterprise as a trial but found it to expensive
 to buy.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All Issue with Windows version since Windows 98A have always been hardware and third party software compatibility which I keep close eye on.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;To me I guess your&nbsp;Home Entertainment centre was came out around Windows Vista time so naturally their will be issues With newer version of Windows this will also vary with what those'd issues will be,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What you have to do is wait for Microsoft to issues updates to correct the problems your experiences like When Windows 8.1 online down load caused many users and still is for some.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My mate is experiencing this with his&nbsp;HP laptop Windows 8 Pro&nbsp;With Media Centre due to hardware driver issues he can not finish the installation I told him to contact HP and see what they would recommend they told him to wait until Microsoft issues a driver
 patch before upgrading which should be this Tuesday 10th&nbsp;December 2013,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I told him wait a extra two days as their will be a huge demand on the update site which can cause drop outs if their is a huge update list.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For all users I am surprise with people who have been using Windows products have not taken the time to really look at their problems and find other software that can do the same thing why you need media centre beats me when you got free appliance from open
 source that can work perfectly well at no cost to the end users and function just the same as Windows media centre if you want media centre on Windows 8.1 then been patient and wait for the updates to start flowing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No OS works perfectly even Apple have their faults after updating or introducing new software I found this with my mobile Phone recently everything has been moved to different locations and do not function the same as before but I am waiting for a patch
 to correct some of these issue in the mean time&nbsp;I have found work around for a lot of these issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>similar i have many games that only run in Windows 98 and did not run under XP Pro Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Vista Sp2 ultimate or Windows 8 with media Centre&nbsp;but now work perfectly under Windows 8.1 to my surprise better than previous version of Windows even 98, my
 advice is just be patient and see if their is update for issue to Windows 8.1 problems.</p>

            <p>1) The statement "If you have Windows 8.1 Pro, you can also buy the Windows 8.1
<em>Media Center Pack that includes DVD playback</em>." isn't false. I upgraded my Windows 8 computer several months ago to add Media Center. When I look under movies, there is a spot for "Play DVD", but I've noticed once or twice that this option disappears
 occasionally. The way around this is if you go into your "Movie Library" there will be a tile in there for your disc (typically with a disc icon on the corner) and you can play it from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) With the new and "improved" Media Center, they may have broken older third party plug-ins such as CyberLink's PowerDVD plug-in for BluRays. Unfortunately, the only way to remedy a situation like that is to make sure you get the newest version possible
 from CyberLink, after checking to make sure that it is compatible. After checking CyberLink's forums, I found that the plug-in is still included with PowerDVD 13, however you must have Windows Media Center installed before installing PowerDVD 13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Unfortunately, I don't know what to tell you as far as this issue is concerned, as I have yet to use a TV Tuner Card in my computer. The only thing I can think of is that the manufacturer of the card may have updated drivers/software for the card, or
 the older drivers, such as those written for Windows 7, would work if installed. I have had older hardware that has worked with the previous version of windows drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) As far as the recorded TV files from your vista computer not playing on the Windows 8 Media Center, that sounds like a glitch. If you are able to play back the recorded tv files using media player and powerdvd, then the files are fine, but something may
 need updating or fixing inside Media Center.</p>

<p>Hey Maloney</p>
<p>Thanks for the very late .... and useless response.</p>
<p>I already removed Windows 8.1 and installed 7 long ago.</p>
<p>All is good now, no Blu ray player purchase required, and I can manage, troubleshoot and use every one of my components quite easily thank you very much.</p>

            <p>After much work, I am finally running Win 8.1 Pro with Media Center with a CableCard in an HD Homerun Prime. A long and difficult haul, but everything finally all works. It is wonderful to not pay for a DVR rental and to have true integration between PC
 and TV life. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Feature Request: WMC needs a remote management capability</strong>, so that you can review the guide and schedule recordings from a different PC on the network. Because of the DRM you cannot RDP into the WMC machine - it causes all kinds of problems,
 including system lock up. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2nd Feature Request: Find some way to allow the DRM and Hyper-V to co-exist.</strong> For the same reason that you cannot reliably RDP into the WMC machine, you cannot run HyperV (according to SiliconDust) on the WMC machine. But a WMC is typically
 powered on 24x7x365, which makes it the perfect place to host home based software services. However, running them in the same OS as your DVR appliance is risky at best. These should be partitioned into their own OS instance. These days, hardware is more than
 capable of running 2 or 3 OS instances, one for WMC DVR, and others for web servers, ftp servers, home based cloud storage, Plex, ...

 was working fine and the next came up with the error message of paper jam.&nbsp; There was no paper jam and never was one.&nbsp; Don't know what caused it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HP has overnighted me a replacement which is an upgraded 8600 and warrenty remains on it.&nbsp; It is working
 just fine and has a few more features on it.&nbsp; Like e-mailing it print job it wireless&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp; so far so good!!!</p>

<h2>            Viewing maps in driving mode or navigation mode without specifying destination</h2>
                    <p>It's obvious that the navigation mode exist.. but I can't enable it without specifying a destination. This is a feature in all navigation apps. I searched this forum, and it has been asked many months before. I don't want to revive old thread, and since
 the apps has been recently updated, perhaps it already added.. I am wondering if there is a way to enable it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no way around it, when will it be added? </p>
<p>I like the app, but the lack of the feature is pushing me to use other apps. And Here+ drive is no longer available too..</p>

            <p>Just to make you guys aware without this feature windows maps is essentially not usable for driving as it must be supplemented with an app that has this feature. And if im going to use some other app half the time then there is absolutely no reason to use
 windows maps in the other half. Most of the time in a car you are not going to enter in a destination. Hopefully Microsoft realizes this and updates maps with this feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also traffic layer in driving mode would be helpful as well.</p>

<p>Are the Maps team going to implement this feature - if not, why not and what can we do to encourage the Maps Team to re-evaluate their priorities?

<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would not connect&nbsp;or sync.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;I couldn't get it to work and really don't want my email on this computer anyway,&nbsp;when I went the settings&nbsp;to change back to a local account and I keep&nbsp;getting error code 0x80004005.

            Hi Judy,<br />
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally we get the error code 0x80004005 when we don’t have sufficient privileges to perform the requested operation. So I would suggest you to log in as administrator and then try doing the same.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:Disable proxy connection</strong><br />
<br />
If you use any proxy connection, then follow the steps to disable proxy:<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Gearbox at the top right corner in Internet Explorer.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Connections tab, and then click LAN settings.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck the Use a proxy server for your LAN box.<br />
</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Ok.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Temporarily disable any antivirus program installed on your computer and then install the update.<br />
<strong>Important Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software or perform
 any troubleshooting, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
If the issue still persists perform system file checker<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Use the <strong>System File Checker </strong>tool to repair missing or corrupted system files<br />

            <p>Hello Pavan. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up email to see if this issue has been resolved. I do appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of last evening (10.28.15) I still have Not been able to resolve this problem. Since receiving your troubleshooting steps on 10.20.15 I have tried all of your recommendations plus a few I found while surfing the forum for similar&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>This problem started to happen when I tried to use the windows 10 pro built in Mail program to check my email. I believe I gave it my email address and pop3 server information and it could not find the server.
 Then when I went to go back to Local, this error problem started.&nbsp; I have tried other suggestions to change my Hotmail/outlook/Microsoft account&nbsp;password which I did but to no avail. I have not used my Hotmail email for years and do believe I closed the account
 years ago too.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still Unable To:</p>
<p>1. I&nbsp; cannot return to using a local account, Continue to get error code when I try.</p>
<p>2. I cannot restore the system.&nbsp; I get a different error code when I try to do a that.</p>
<p>3. I cannot use pretty much any program to restore my system, I have tried everything!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: We do not use a proxy server but I went ahead and followed the steps anyway and&nbsp;all was as it&nbsp;should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: I do not have a file to run so I did not disable my antivirus program for any reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: I ran the System File Checker Tool and the result was "windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations".</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Other Methods I tried:</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. DISM.exe Online/cleanupimage/scanhealth. Result was "No omponent Store Corruption Detected".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. DISM.exe/online/cleanup/restorehealth, Result was "Restore Operation Completed Successfully".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
