<h2>            Windows 8 - Stuck on &#34;Please Wait&#34; screen with cancel button that doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    Hey there. I'm having a really awful problem with my laptop that I can't seem to find any answer for.<br />
<br />
Whenever I boot up my laptop, it seems all fine and dandy. As if there's nothing wrong with it. But when I sign-in to my profile to the computer, I am greeted by a large screen that just says "Please Wait" with nothing else but a cancel button on it. Not even
 a loading symbol. At first, I thought this was part of the computer doing its thing with updates or so, so I let it be for a few hours. But then I realized it doesn't go away. My screen is unfortunately locked onto this single screen that I can't get away
 from. It's not the computer itself, because I can use CTRL+ALT+DEL just fine, and it allows me to sign out, open the task manager, etc. It just seems to be this weird... "Thing" involving Windows 8 that keeps my laptop locked on it. The mouse cursor remains
 an hourglass loading symbol and the cancel button doesn't work. Tapping it or clicking it, either way doesn't get rid of it.<br />
<br />
I've been worrying about what was wrong with it. But I have no idea what it could possibly be. I use an ASUS Notebook laptop that I didn't even have for a full week yet! I can remember a few things that I did before this started happening, but I do recall shutting
 down the laptop after I did those actions and having it work fine. Now, it just doesn't want to try. Here are the things I did before this happened:<br />
<br />
- Upgraded to Windows 8.1<br />
- Activated SecureBoot to get rid of the little watermark<br />
- Used CCleaner to clean my laptop of registry errors and getting rid of temporary files<br />
- Used Malwarebytes and scanned, found no malware results.<br />
- Defragging<br />
<br />
These are possibly the major things I've done using the computer. The minor things would be like playing League of Legends, a Gamecube emulator, and scrolling around on the Internet.<br />
<br />
To kind of get a brief picture of what is happening, here it is:<br />
<br />
Booting is fine. Turn on the computer and everything is fine. I reach the sign-in screen, log-in, and I am greeted with "Welcome" with the loading symbol. Then I am taken to the Start Menu for Windows 8 and immediately greeted with a screen that says "Please
 Wait" and a cancel button. I cannot perform any action other than CTRL+ALT+DEL, and ALT+Tab, which allows me to see my desktop and task manager, but if I click those it still shows this screen. Restarting the computer has not helped me.<br />
<br />
Things to note:<br />
<br />
- I did NOT use a CD to activate my computer. The laptop came with no CD.<br />
- I am using an ASUS Notebook computer that recently upgraded to Windows 8.1<br />
- There was a time where I clicked the "Cancel" button immediately as the screen popped-up and I got rid of it. Can't do so anymore.<br />
- Task Manager doesn't read what it is. ALT+Tab, however, reads it as if it may be an .exe file.<br />
- After the first incident, I system restored before this began happening and it was fine. But after some more time and shutting down, it happened again.<br />
- For some reason, I cannot activate the BIOS settings at boot anymore. I think I don't have enough time to, but it won't let me.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this is enough information for anyone to seriously help me out. I'd like my laptop back, but I have no complete answers to help me out. I don't know what to do anymore.<br />
<br />
Thanks and very much appreciate anyone who can solve this problem. I can provide any more information if needed, but I think I said enough.<br />
<br />
- Justin<br />
<br />
<u><b>UPDATE #1:</b></u> I managed to somehow get to the BIOS settings, turn off SecureBoot, and cancel the "Please Wait" screen from out of nowhere. However, this problem still persists. I just found some way to get passed it for once that's it.<br />
<br />
<u><b>UPDATE #2:</b></u><b> </b>My laptop just blue screened! The result was KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE.<br />
<br />
<u><b>UPDATE #3:</b></u> I managed to system restore back to the original point. It was the same point I system restored the first time.<br />

NOTHING WORKS. I cant even remove everything from the hard drive and re-install windows 8 :
<br />
<br />
<i>"After you install Windows 8.1, you won't be able to use the recovery partition on your PC to go back to your previous version of Windows."</i><br />
<br />
I tried to restore to a previous point, doesn't work.<br />
I ran safe mode and then restored to a previous point, works but if I restart the computer I get the forever "Please Wait" blue screen.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
While it seemed to work until i restart the computer, I noticed there is an windows update of 444 ko or something waiting to be installed. If i can delete this update or prevent the system from updating itself automatically when I open my session, maybe i can
 solve the problem. I dont know.<br />

            Steps I took to resolve a very similar issue on my Windows 8 machine. You might have to restore to a restore point prior to the first time that you installed the updates that started the "Please Wait" screen issues
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\ in Windows Explorer</li><li>Right click on cmd.exe and select "Run as Administrator"</li><li>enter <b>chkdsk /f</b></li><li>The check disk utility will probably notify you that the disk cannot be scanned and fixed because it cannot locked while currently in use. Select that you would like to run the disk check the next time you restart your machine by entering
<b>Y</b>&nbsp;at the Y/N prompt</li><li>Install the windows updates that are pending</li><li>Upon restarting after the install, the check disk utility will run and you should be good to go.</li></ol>

            I have this same issue on my new Dell 7537, where the blue screen covers nearly the whole screen apart from two thin strips at the top and bottom. Everything else in windows seems to be running in the background, but no mouse or touch inputs work.
<div><br />
<div>As I tried to log out via ctrl+alt+delete the computer said "you still have 2 programs running, please close these before you log out" blah blah. One program was the task manager, and the other was "please wait, installing mcafee updates".</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have mcafee this might be the issue. As I was writing this the blue screen has dissappeared and the normal desktop has appeared!&nbsp;</div>

            My asus is doing the same thing. I updated to windows 8.1 and updated my java. I am so frustrated all I keep logging into is a pink screen that says please wait and has a useless cancel button. I tried restore and called asus support but nothing's worked
 so far. Anyone have any ideas what I can do. And please dumb it down I don't know much computer lingo.

            Is that that only way to resolve this problem? My computer came with windows 8 preinstalled so no disk - its an Asus 550c. &nbsp;I upgraded it to win 8.1 yesterday then got this problem. Its a shame that microsoft allows OEMs to sell laptops with their licensed
 software and not have to provide disks, then provides os updates which blow lots of compters systems out of the water from what I'm reading on various sites, &nbsp;then refers us back to the manufacturer. &nbsp; Seems to me that Microsoft is letting the side down here
 then leaving us to sink with our useless laptops. Very disappointing.

            <p>It seems like the only resolution to this problem is to restore the computer back to Windows 8...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone that is having issues and needs to access their files - if you plug in an external monitor you are able to get to windows explorer via several steps</p>
<p>1 - search explorer and open file explorer (it should open in the background)</p>
<p>2 - plug in your external monitor</p>
<p>3 - move your mouse to the top right hand corner of your EXTERNAL screen and go to the search bar</p>
<p>4 - search for settings and select PC settings</p>
<p>5 - go into pc and devices, display, and set your external monitor to the main display (check box below)</p>
<p>6 - click apply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your laptop screen should now have windows explorer and your external monitor will have the "please wait" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu Flickering, Please Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So recently I've been having this issue with my start menu on windows 10. It might be related to a graphics driver issue that I'm unaware of. I have gtx 970 with latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a video of someone having the same issue as me. The video is recent so I'm assuming that this is a rather new issue. I'm not sure I tried looking all around the internet for something similar to my problem and this was all I found. A link to a video
 from someone else will be below however my problem is identical to his.</p>

            <p>I currently have the newest video drivers available. Also the one thing that makes me think it's related more to something else is that if this was caused by a video driver issue then wouldn't this be something detailed on forums? I'm running the sfc /scannow
 command now. I'll try and get this all done before my class starts at 12:30 est.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try reinstalling the current driver and see if that fixes anything also. If it doesn't I will revert back to the driver before this one.</p>

            sfc /scannow has finished it came back saying there were no integrity violations. So it isn't a corrupt system file. I'll reinstall my driver now to make sure it isn't a corrupted driver issue.

<p>You have a <strong>TOSHIBA</strong></p>

<p>They are telling you to go the HP website to find out how to reinstall on a Toshiba:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"1. If your computer came with no CD or DVD to reinstall Windows, it<br />
instead came with a recovery partition and instructions for how to<br />
use. Read those instructions, and if you no longer have them, find<br />
them on the <strong>HP web site."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already advised you how to reinstall on a Toshiba:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do you mean to do a&nbsp;recovery to Factory Settings?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For that, press and hold 0 (zero) as you power on, then follow directions.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also had this very problem - I have imported videos from an iPhone 5 and these appear to be in *.mp4 format, which can be imported and played with Windows Media Player with no issues. However, the iPhone6+ (and presumably iPhone 6) export video in
 *.MOV format and this currently does appear to cause a crash in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to import the movies one at a time (the crashes seem to be intermittent) and then edit them in Adobe Premiere with no issues. However, double-clicking on the file causes Win 8.1 to crash, and there is no preview thumbnail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was initially quite pleased to find this thread as I realised other people were having the same problem, but I will be happy to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated the drivers. All optional updates are also installed. Whole computer is up to date..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked that my both display adapters are working fine, Nvidia GeForce 820M and Intel HD R Graphics..</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, the problem still exists.. .MOV files work fine on quicktime, but not on windows media player.. However, when I process and edit these on my computer and save as .MOV, that file works fine on windows media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what's the problem.. Windows 8 is giving me such a depression, I cant understand how come it can be so buggy. :-/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>One windows event log, it doesn't show any errors. ( http://i.imgur.com/WEPVx7M.png )</p>

            <p>This problem is being reported on lots of different forums. The conclusion seems to be that it relates to 2 Windows updates but no one seems to be able to fix it - except to remove the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please Microsoft fix it</p>

            <p>This began happening to me today after Windows Update installed KB3018943. Unistalling that fix resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago exactly the same thing happened with <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
KB2975719 - uninstalling it resolved the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To be clear, the problem is as described in the subject: '...&nbsp;</span>crashes when folder containing .MOV file is opened' It is NOT about playing MOV files. I get these crashes under at least two circumstances
 - opening a folder containing MOV fies in Windows Explorer, or trying to save a MOV file from an email attachment into such a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>... update one hour later &nbsp;.... although the problem was temporarily resolved after uninstalling KB3018943&nbsp;it returned a little later. I suspect that my perception that it was this fix came about because it had &nbsp;been installed just before I saw the problem.
 On reflection, it is just as likely to be because this was the first time I had tried to save a MOV file for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I revisited the article which first pointed me to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB2975719 (</span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-files/mfmp4srcsnkdll-crashing-when-mov-file-is-selected/83b68537-658c-4920-96c4-2f7da8a3bfaf).
 This has been updated recently . . I am about to research what the updates are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>... and finally &nbsp;-- I hope - the above article says that the bug was reintroduced with two other fixes (KB3000850, KB2995388). Checking my Windows Update, the former had Failed but the latter was installed. I uninstalled it, but this did not fix the problem.
 What did nail it in the end was renaming&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">mfmp4srcsnk.dll, as described in that article. Mulling things iover, I checked the Windows Reliabiliy Monitor (</span>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Action
 Center\Reliability Monitor) and found all today's crashes, every one of which showed that module to be the culprit, for example:</p>

<h2>            Task Bar and Sound stops working on a semi-regular basis</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting pretty sick of these problems....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems like every other day or so my task bar doesn't work when I first boot up my computer and doesn't work at all unless I restart. The start button doesn't work, the "Search the web and Windows" bar doesn't work, and nothing happens
 when I click the Internet Access icon, Sound icon, Notifications icon, and the Clock/Date icon. I CAN right-click the Start button and choose somethings from there but I shouldn't have to do that. Why is this even an issue? Further more, why is this a commonly
 recurring issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem: My sound goes out randomly. This has happened twice now. First time it happened I was watching a Youtube video and the video stopped playing. I clicked pause/play several times and the video did not respond. I refreshed
 the page and it started playing but without sound. I updated my sound drivers and the sound started working again. Today, the same thing happened. I was watching a Facebook video and it stopped, I refreshed the page and the video played without sound. I tried
 to update my sound drivers again but according the Windows they are all up to date. Why would the sound drivers not working stop the video from playing? Why is this even an issue? I never remember having this problem on Windows XP or 7. Sound nor Task Bar
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any PERMANENT fixes for the Task Bar problem or some kind of solution for the sound problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Restarting my computer DID make the sound begin working again but I'd still like a solution for PREVENTING the problem.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem. Require me to constantly reboot my Asus laptop when the taskbar icons (search / wifi / start button etc) stop working. Like many people I accepted the free upgrade to Windows 10 and therefore don't have a disc. Can you offer any other means
 to solve this problem??</p>

            <p>Just to update, these issues haven't been happening much lately. The taskbar/start menu issue has only happened once in the past few months and I have had no more sound problems. What some may be sad to hear is that I didn't do anything to stop the problems,
 they just kind of stopped on their own. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem that I started getting after this and still occasionally happens from time to time is that my computer will randomly not shut down completely. I choose shut down from the start menu and it goes through the normal process of shutting down.
 My screen goes blank but my PC stays running, as if it's stuck in the final step in shutting off. I once waited to see if it was just taking a long time to shut down instead of forcing it to shut off using the power button on the PC itself but when I woke
 up the next morning (yes, I turn off my PC every night) it was still running but my monitor screen was still blank. Now, like I said, this doesn't happen as often as it used to but I'd still be interested in knowing what causes this. Whether or not this is
 a PC issue or a Windows 10 issue or some kind of conflicting program with Windows 10?</p>

 says that it's going to make changes to my computer.&nbsp; What if the files are rendered completely unreadable!&nbsp; I ran the Scan feature and several "drivers" were listed as outdated.&nbsp; Can that be right?&nbsp; I just bought the latest and greatest computer!</p>

<p>You need to import the dbx files into your <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unnamed</span></em> e-mail client. Win7 does not have a native e-mail program of it's own.<br />
<br />
Are you using <strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> perchance?<br />
<br />
<strong>Transferring data from Outlook Express to Windows Live Mail:</strong></p>
<p>For messages:</p>
<p>Copy the *ENTIRE* OE message store folder to a flash drive. (Folders.dbx must be included). Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail. Open WLMail and: File | Import | Messages | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 and point to where
 you saved it.</p>
<p>OE Message Store Location:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Addresses:</p>
<p>Open the Address Book in OE and File | Export | Address Book (wab) and save it to the Desktop. Copy to a flash drive. Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail.</p>
<p>Open the Contacts list in WLMail, (Go | Contacts on the Menu Bar), and File | Import | Windows Address Book (wab) and point to where you saved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you use a CD or DVD instead of a flash drive, after placing on the new machine you must remove the Read Only attribute in Properties before you import.</p>

<h2>            Viewing photos stored on sd card</h2>
                    <p>I have a bunch of photos stored on an SD card and all I want to do is view them on the surface tablet by being able to click the next picture or view them as a slide show.</p>
<p>When I click on a photo on my SD card, I get a message saying there's an app I can use to open the photos but it didn't tell me what the app was or where to find it.</p>
<p>All I want to do is look at all the photos by being able to click next or as I said like a slide show. I can look at each picture one at a time if I want to keep going back to the original folder but that's a pain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for asking the Question!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry to know that you face issues with Photos. As I get it right you need to access the Photos stored in SD(Secure Digital ) card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can use the Photos app to view the pictures.<br />
<strong>a:</strong> Press <strong>Windows logo + Q .<br />
b:</strong> Now type <strong>Default Programs </strong>in the text box and hit enter.<br />
<strong>c: </strong>Now click <strong>Set your default programs<br />
d:</strong> Now click <strong>Photos</strong> present at the left part of the screen.<br />
<strong>e:</strong> Then click <strong>Set this program as default </strong>and then click
<strong>ok.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Reply to us if you face any issues with Pictures or any other Windows Issue, and I would be glad to assist you again and try to rectify the issue as early as possible.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have a nice day!</div>

            <p>Thanks for trying to help me. I followed your steps but it doesn't seem to make any difference in the way I was viewing them before.</p>
<p>I can't click on the photo app to access them. Am I suppose to be able to?</p>
<p>The only way I know to open them is to go to my desktop, find the drive with the sd card, double click the drive and then open one of the pictures on the card. If I want to see my next picture, I have to go back to the sd card and click on the next picture.
 I was hoping I could just slide the screen to the right and keep viewing all the pictures on my card but that doesn't seem to be an option unless I'm missing something.</p>
<p>And I'd also like to be able to view them as a slide show but I don't see any option for that.</p>
<p>I'd be happy if I could just swipe the screen to the right and keep viewing each picture on my card.</p>
        </p>

            <p>I just wanted to report that I can now view my photos from my sd card as a slideshow. I ended up calling the microsoft help desk, not to find out how to do this but to find out if I could return the tablet after 14 days if some of the issues I was having
 didn't get resolved within 14 days. In any event, the lady I spoke to found out how I could view my photos as a slideshow.</p>
<p>In case anyone else is interested, here's how you do it.<br />
Click on your external drive from the desktop and highlight all your photos.<br />
Right click and click "preview" from the screen that appears.<br />
This will bring up a screen with your pictures that looks like Windows Media player. If you click the middle button, it starts showing each photo as a slide show.<br />
If you want to view them at your own pace, just click the over arrow.<br />
If you right click this screen, it will also give you some options like how fast the slideshow goes and the exit button for when you want to close everything out.<br />
Very easy and I'm so happy this can be done on the tablet.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info...I hope Microsoft staff reads this... but personally I think it's pretty stupid that one had to do all this monkeying around to view pictures on SD cards.</p>
<p>The Photos app on metro should be intuitive enough to allow user to select the location where photos are stored..photos app list "locations" but only two are viable... skydiver and camera.&nbsp; pretty stupid or arrogant of MS to think people would only have
 pictures on&nbsp;MS's skydiver or only use their tablets to&nbsp;take pictures.</p>
<p>Nice looking Photos app, too bad it's pretty useless and not&nbsp;intuitive and not users friendly... like&nbsp;you said makes you want return the tablet and may be get an android tablet instead.&nbsp; at least with the android tablet, the gallery app allows you to pick
 SD card or local drive to view photos... don't need monkey around </p>

<p>I have a bunch of photos stored on an SD card and all I want to do is view them on the surface tablet by being able to click the next picture or view them as a slide show.</p>
<p>When I click on a photo on my SD card, I get a message saying there's an app I can use to open the photos but it didn't tell me what the app was or where to find it.</p>
<p>All I want to do is look at all the photos by being able to click next or as I said like a slide show. I can look at each picture one at a time if I want to keep going back to the original folder but that's a pain.</p>

<h2>            Groove Music Pauses when minimized</h2>
                    I'm getting the problem, when playing music in the Groove app&nbsp;on Win10, where&nbsp;it always pauses the music once minimized.&nbsp; Fires right back up once maximized again.&nbsp; I've tried restarting the app, reinstalling the app, adjusted the advanced audio options
 to dis-allow apps to take exclusive control, in addition to generally poking it with a stick.&nbsp; No matter what I do it always pauses.&nbsp; Seems kind of odd that this can't be run while minimized.&nbsp; I mean ideally it would give me audio controls on the task bar
 but I'd settle for running while minimized.&nbsp; I do know it'll work fine just keeping it open in the background, and that's what I'm currently doing, but it'd be nice to clean up the desktop some.&nbsp;

<h2>            Realtek RTL8723BE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC constanly disconnects</h2>
                    <p>For a few months now (I want to say since October) my internet connect has been very unstable. At random times it will disconnect then reconnect itself. Or sometimes I have to manually troubleshoot to reconnect myself. I've tried all sorts of ways to try
 and fix this. I've made sure I have the latest driver. I've uninstalled the driver so it can reinstall. I've tried rolling back the driver. I've made sure the box in unchecked under the power management tab. I've flushed the dns and released/renewed the server.
 I have no idea what the problem is. My laptop in an Asus X751M and I've have the latest drivers (including firmware/BIOS) for this laptop. This laptop also originally came with Windows 10 (64 bit) so I can't downgrade to 8. Is it my laptop or something to
 do with Windows? My connection was not always like this and this laptop is not that old. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi! After @Gerry reviews your event viewer and suggests solutions, here's my 2 cents. Routers are just like all electronic devices. They wear out. I was having your problem and I solved it by replacing my router. I bought a new NETGEAR cable Modem Router.
 I'm no longer getting disconnected. If you have a Ethernet cable, you could use it and see if you're still getting dropped! Not always a easy thing to try!</p>
<p>Here's what NETGEAR has to say about your problem!.</p>

            Thanks for the input but I know for a fact its not the router. I moved back in mid October and the problem started before then at my old house. In fact a new router had just been installed weeks before the move. Now at the new place with a new router the
 problem still occurs. It only happens to my laptop as well. Other devices Such as gaming consoles, cell phones, other laptops, etc work fine. This disconnection also happens at other people's homes as well. I've tested this out at my grandmother's and two
 of my friends.

<p>Hi! It seems to me you have found the cause and that is your laptop. You could try a external adapter and try to solve your problem that way. Have you been to the manufacture site( Asus X751M)to see if there is a wireless adapter driver update?</p>

            The RTL8723be is a terrible wifi card. Bad drivers do not help it, and if you were to look at any PC makers forum that uses the 8723be chip they all have the same connection issues and weak signals. In fact I just worked with a user who wanted to replace
 the card because it was so bad on his HP but because HP white list in bios what hardware you can use the options were few on what could replace that Realtek card. I myself am in the same boat as my HP has the 8723be and most likely your disconnects are from
 having a weak signal and reaching the threshold of disconnecting from access point (router). Unfortunately your options are few, replace the card with either a compatible better solution such as a Intel wifi card. Use a external option such as a USB wifi adapter
 or place notebook or router closer together. Yes, your router could be part of the issue but more likely your router is far more capable of range than your notebook. The weakest link is the one to focus on which is obviously the RTL8

<h2>            Windows 10- Can&#39;t create rcovery drive.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a brand new ASUS ZenBook Pro, which came preinstalled with latest Windows10.&nbsp; I see many other posts regarding difficulty creating a recovery drive, but mine is a bit different.&nbsp; I don't get any error message stating "a problem occurred...".&nbsp; I get
 a different message, that simply is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86152aa6-2260-4afd-abff-8d0e578a70a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86152aa6-2260-4afd-abff-8d0e578a70a0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted ASUS, but let me warn any potential ASUS buyers, they have&nbsp;TERRIBLE tech support.&nbsp; There is a definite Chinese to English language barrier, and they do not at all seem interested or invested to help.&nbsp; Their only suggestion to me was to buy
 a Windows 10 disc (and my computer doesn't even have a disc drive!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any better ideas for options to fix this?&nbsp; I have tried scanning file system for errors using- command prompt&gt; sfc/scannow,&nbsp; and there were no errors detected in file system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer hard drive (512GB SSD) did come with a recovery partition which does not have a drive letter assigned to it.&nbsp; However, to me the partition is useless if my hard drive&nbsp;fails since that partition will be potentially unusable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any expert help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes,&nbsp;I did make changes to my Hard drive partitions.&nbsp; My hard drive is partitioned into 4 volumes: (see attached pic below).&nbsp; What I did was make an adjustment by taking 175 GB hard drive space from Data (D:), and adding it to OS (C:), since all my saves
 default to C:,and C: was running out of space, since it was a smaller partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/351f7c22-9053-4fb2-995e-e1f41ae9eb2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/351f7c22-9053-4fb2-995e-e1f41ae9eb2c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It does not matter what USB port I put the drive in.&nbsp; It never gets to the point in the create recovery drive tool to even ask for a USB drive to be inserted.&nbsp; I just get the first page (see below) and click Next, whereby I get the message indicating
 I can not create a recovery drive on this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55f95bb4-94a0-4819-9c4e-444a716a2c6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55f95bb4-94a0-4819-9c4e-444a716a2c6e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for looking at the link you provided, that helps me somewhat in that it appears as though creating a recovery drive may not be necessary... correct?&nbsp; From what I gather, if I am unable to create a recovery drive, then I can simply download and create
 installation media instead.&nbsp; Is this a correct assumption?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, and since my recovery partition is apparently damaged, do I even need the recovery partition at all?&nbsp; Or can I simply merge the recovery partition with the data (D:) partition, and eliminate the recovery partition altogether from my hard
 drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to (two times) perform just a basic&nbsp;backup using Control Panel&gt;&nbsp;"Backup and Restore (Windows7)" and I got an error- "The backup did not complete successfully".&nbsp;&nbsp; My backup selection included making a System Image.&nbsp; Since I believe my system
 recovery volume is damaged, this is maybe why I am getting the error.&nbsp; Also, when I review settings for backup, I have a Yellow triangle warning at bottom stating "a system repair disc may be required to restore a system image":</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4ca6bda-cf2a-4efd-8122-5fa8c1235e35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4ca6bda-cf2a-4efd-8122-5fa8c1235e35" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My next question, since it seems fairly clear that my recovery partition is corrupt, is if I RESET my PC in order to reinstall Windows 10&nbsp;using a media creation tool, and simply reset the OS, will I regain the ability to create a system image backup, as
 well as create a recovery drive?</p>

            <p>I went ahead and tried to restore windows 10 using media creation tool. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize as I am very tech unsaavy compared to most in here.</p>
<p>It did&nbsp;NOT go at all as described in the "how to" from the link that was sent.&nbsp; There was no option to "restore" from the USB, but somehow I clicked things went ahead and installed Windows 10 again, I assume over the top of the existing windows 10.&nbsp; The
 process was a bit confusing and I was kind of flying blind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my computer is now potentially a mess.&nbsp; but maybe not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually works fine in all normal operations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am unable to make a proper Windows backup.&nbsp; When I select option to backup that includes a system image, the backup fails, every time.&nbsp; It hangs up at 97% while it is trying to "create a system image of OS (C:)"and then fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do a custom backup where I only select my files, it works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>SO the system image is the issue.&nbsp; I guess.&nbsp; I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to create a Recovery Drive to USB, as earlier, It actually gets to a point where it is looking for a USB.&nbsp; It can't find one, even though I have a brand new USB 3.0 16GB plugged into the 3.0 slot.&nbsp; I have tried all 3 slots.&nbsp; I have tried it formatted
 as FAT32 and NTFS.&nbsp; It doesn't work no matter the combination.&nbsp; However the USB ports work and I can save items to and from the USB drives, no problem.&nbsp; The Recovery Drive creation tool just can't seem to recognize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However one other thing is that before I had all these issues, I did manage to create Windows Image Backup, on 1/6/16.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dare I restore from this?&nbsp; How do I do it??</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Flash drive needs to be of a specific type to be used as a Recovery Drive...</p>
<p>When you look in ThisPC, it needs to be listed as a "Local Disk"... If it is listed as a Removable Drive, it won't work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you made your System Image before you modified the partitions, there may be a problem... It is not possible to restore to a partition or drive that is smaller than the original, and even to a larger one is a bit of a problem sometimes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending when, and of what, you made the image, you may be able to just overwrite the entire drive and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are now running Windows 10 from Installation media, it will probably not be the same as it was from ASUS as far as Tools, Utilities, and other preinstalled features go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way you would use the System Image would be to boot from the Win 10 Flash Drive and select REPAIR when you get to the INSTALL screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Troubleshoot on the first screen, then Advanced on the next... You may need to select Advanced a 3rd time, but you will get to a screen with multiple options for Refresh, Recovery, Startup Repair and such...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will be an option specifically to Recover, Reload, Restore or whatever, using a System Image... I don't remember the exact term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... It appears to me that you are missing a Partition... The one that contains the files to Restore the machine to factory... The tool to create the Recovery Drive must be detecting that....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR... The remaining 499mb Recovery Drive has been damaged... That is the partition that contains WinRE, which is the set of tools needed for a Recovery...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately the same thing&nbsp;can be done with the installation media as I mentioned...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing... most, if not all of the ASUS preinstalled stuff you probably lost may be available from ASUS's webpage for your machine... probably Driver Downloads section... Some of the stuff that you lost, you may be better off without anyway, but that
 is just a guess...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us informed of any developments.</p>

            <p>I do appreciate your continued assistance, and again I apologize for my inexperienced questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the exact same USB drive to create a Recovery Drive on my son's (Dell) Alienware computer and it worked flawlessly.&nbsp; On my computer under ThisPC, it is listed in the same section under Devices and Drive with my C: and D: partitions.&nbsp; It does not say
 anything specifically&nbsp;"removable" when I select it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was afraid about the fact that my original (and only)&nbsp;System Image is now invalid since I have since modified my partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO as for the installation media.&nbsp; I tried to boot from it the following way-</p>
<p>Settings. Update and Security&gt; Restore&gt; Advanced&nbsp;Startup&gt; Restart Now... and never got to the screen that specified Repair, Restore, etc. from the Troubleshoot link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I had to choose the USB recovery media option, and from there basically re-installed Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after re-installing windows, when I go through the same motions, I am able to get to the option to repair, restore, etc. so maybe it is fine?&nbsp; I am just afraid to restore it to the earlier image since as you say, my hard drive partitions have changed...
 and I hate to create a deeper issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I am fine.&nbsp; I am just worried I am unable to backup my computer anymore.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now every time I try to run backup using Windows preferred method (system image included) the backup fails.&nbsp; However I am able to backup using custom settings where I uncheck the box asking to save a system image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fear my re-allocating partition sizes has made a mess of things.&nbsp; It is still under warranty, so should I just send it back to Asus and have it restored to factory defaults?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question, if I saved all my files, and totally wiped everything down to a fresh Windows 10 install would I be in better shape?&nbsp; and then just reinstalled all my programs and imported all my files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine if the Flash Drive is usable, you need to look in ThisPC...</p>
<p>The drive may be of the correct type, but another issue exists...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the reason that the Recovery now works is because the installation of Win 10 either fixed it , or created another one.... How many partitions do you have now ?</p>
<p>You may have an extra one now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you make a just a System Image by itself ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you made the original System Image before any modifications, you should be able to use it to return the machine to it's condition at the time it was made...</p>
<p>That will involve basically deleting everything the way it currently is...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also just delete everything on the drive and start fresh... The only real issue with that is that anything preinstalled by ASUS will be lost...</p>
<p>A lot of it can probably be downloaded separately, but if there is anything in particular you feel is necessary, you should check for what is available first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method I was mentioning to boot the machine is done with a Restart, or when you first power on with the Flash Drive in the machine... You may need to hit a key like F12 to choose the USB as a Boot Device... Some machines use ESC to get to a Menu..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless as to how you boot though, the process to get to the options would be the same... If you did this from within Windows you would select the Advanced Startup option... which in your case would have required you to then insert the flash drive..</p>
<p>
</p><p>That may or may not be what you did... Did you choose the USB Recovery from within Windows, or a startup.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS may have a special feature specifically for USB Recovery, or it may be an option that I haven't yet seen on my machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a Recover from Image or something like that..</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is the option of attempting to get the needed media from ASUS to Restore To Factory... I have read on multiple threads that ASUS doesn't have that available though...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending when you made your system image, it may do same thing... Except that your account will already be set up.</p>

            <p>Thank you again, all of your info is very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. So yes, I show another "recovery" partition.&nbsp; Slightly smaller in size, not labeled as RECOVERY, but says recovery inside the contents of the partition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So should I eliminate my original partition at this point? Is it confusing the OS to have 2 recovery partitions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes I do have the option to create a new System Image.&nbsp; But since I have one system image on my backup drive, I am afraid to write another one to it to avoid confusion, or overwriting the original.&nbsp; But any advice on this would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Do I dare&nbsp;restore my computer from the original System Image? (the partitions at that point were sized differently).</p>
<p>If I do this, how do I do it?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I don't have any interest in the Asus stuff that came pre-installed so I am not worried if I lose any of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. How would I perform a clean wipe? And reinstall Windows and all my Nvidia graphics card drivers?&nbsp; Is this too daunting and am I asking for trouble?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. What is the difference/ best option to create regular data backups? I see two options:</p>
<p>A. "Save backup copies of your files with File History"</p>
<p>B. "Backup and Restore (Windows 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I currently attempt to perform option B. (Backup and Restore Win7), it hangs at the 97% mark where it is "creating system image of OS", and then always get error- "Did not back up successfully".</p>
<p>If I use custom backup settings within Backup and Restore (Win7), and uncheck the box "create system image", then I can successfully backup my files.&nbsp; however I do still see a folder in my backup drive that says "Windows System Image" dated on the date I
 did my original backup before all the issues after the partition modifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is option A. (File History) a better way to back up my personal data? And if so, where/how is this backup being saved and how would I access it?&nbsp; When I run it it simply says "File History is on" and I click "run now" it runs in background, and finishes.&nbsp;
 But I don't know how to use this form of backup in the event I need to restore my files.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Where was your original Recovery partition... By the picture of your partitions, it doesn't quite look right... The Recovery partition is between the Windows and Data...</p>
<p>I was wondering how you reconfigured this to end up that way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If you make another System Image it will in fact overwrite the 1st... The only thing that can be done is to put it on a different drive, or Rename the first&nbsp;&nbsp; just maybe add a -1 to the name..
</p>
<p>The thing about this is that Windows won't use the image if it has been renamed... So whichever one you wanted to use, you would need to return it to it's original name...
</p>
<p>I wasn't suggesting that you make another... just wondering if you could..</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) You can't repair your current setup with that image, but you can overwrite what you currently have and put it back like it was... The problem with this is you will be back where you started with inconvenient partition sizes... Which may be fixable without
 doing damage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to do that would be to boot from the installation Media... REPAIR...</p>
<p>Select Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced &gt; Recover From Image (or whatever the correct wording)... I can't guarantee that this will overwrite everything, but it should....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no way to test that as my machine is set up differently...</p>
<p>&nbsp;If it doesn't, or instead, you could boot from the installation media as though you were going to do a installation, and select CUSTOM..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get a screen to choose where to install that will have selections to Delete, Format, ETC...
</p>
<p>Just delete everything... power off your machine, power on, and again boot from the installation media, and go to the Recover From Image like before...</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)+5) You would delete everything like the last paragraphs above...</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) I don't know why you are getting the error in Step B... It may be a space issue, but I really don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as Step A... I don't have a good answer there either because I have never used any of those features... I backup all of my stuff manually at my convenience...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous experience with 3rd party automatic backup was always getting in the way, so whenever I make a major change to the OS, I create another image, and every so often, I copy my personal files to a USB drive...</p>
<p>I do know that in order to use File History you need a dedicated drive that is always available...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... sorry about the delay.,.. I had to scrape some ice...</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Thanks again for sticking with me on this semi-mess. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So first- Yes , my recovery partition was originally located between C and D.&nbsp; It was odd to me too, and kind of a pain to move space from D to C, since you can only trade space between adjacent partitions, and&nbsp;that's where I am&nbsp;certain things went wrong.&nbsp;
 Basically I had to move 175 GB from D: Data&nbsp;to the Recovery partition, then move that extra 175GB from Recovery to C: OS.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;bet during those steps, the Recovery partition became messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, in an ideal world, I would never have a separate D partition at all.&nbsp; To me, just keep everything in C, and let there be a little recovery partition and that little EFI partition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But inside D, there&nbsp;was/is a Microsoft Visual&nbsp;C++&nbsp;.exe file and a bunch of eula.txt files and install.res.dll files, as well as a VC_RED.msi file in D, so I kept D:&nbsp;at 125GB, so I didn't ruin those other files, and I'll stash music in there too I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have two recovery partitions sandwiched between C and D, making things even more difficult.&nbsp; For the life of me I can't figure out why they would create a separate D: Data partition on a drive... when it can't be used properly for backup since it
 is part of the same drive.&nbsp; Backups are only good if they are on a totally separate drive. anyway.... that's how I created this mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So knowing what I now know, I guess I am fine living with things as they are, and dealing with it. If Windows somehow fails I know I can reinstall it with the installation media I created on a USB, or I can use the Recovery drive USB I created, then just
 keep up with backing up all my data libraries on my own.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a bit more research I am seeing that backup method A (File&nbsp;History)&nbsp;seems to be the cleaner&nbsp;preferred Windows10 method to keep personal files backed up.&nbsp; I can just periodically plug in an external drive and run it as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the thing that still annoys me is the two recovery partitions that take up space, even though they are small, (499 and 464 MB) it still feels messy to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your opinion, since the first recovery partition (499 MB)&nbsp;is essentially corrupt and useless, do I still need it? Can/ should I merge it into the adjacent D: data partition?&nbsp; or will this make more of a mess?</p>
<p>Using the partition manager, here is a pic of the options that I could choose for it... which if any do you recommend?</p>
<p>Format..., shrink..., delete...??&nbsp; Am I asking for trouble?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08dc4e81-8b35-454d-9d04-ab71f5e51c3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08dc4e81-8b35-454d-9d04-ab71f5e51c3e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or as the other option, you mentioned for 3) above, that I could potentially use my original System Image made before the partition changes, and get my computer back to the original state, and then try to fix the partition sizes without doing damage?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>And to do this you say I should boot with the installation media (USB flash) that I downloaded from Microsoft, and then try to find the Repair option, then plug in the external USB drive with the original System Image and somehow get it to Recover from Image
 in there?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am interested in trying this option, but feel a little bit scared that I may dig deeper into a mess... but if it worked I'd be happier than I am with things now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Here is my ONLY reservation with that method:&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in 6) above,&nbsp;I have been unable to successfully back up my computer using the older B. method (Backup and Restore Windows7) since I'm guessing the partition changes ruined my recovery partition.&nbsp;
 As I said, it hangs up at the point where it is trying to "create a system image" but it still seems to be writing all the other stuff to a backup.&nbsp; I say this because when I look into the backup file&nbsp;that has my original system image, dated 1/6/16, I also
 see backup data that has been created 1/18/16.&nbsp; So apparently my successful backup image that was originally created before all the changes on 1/6/16, also has modifications to other backup data dated 1/18/16 (after the partition changes).&nbsp; SO I am slightly
 suspect that my&nbsp;original backup with the original System Image may be flawed.&nbsp; And if I try to recover to it, it will create issues.&nbsp; This is only a hypothesis.&nbsp; It may be totally fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing is the Windows 10 option to Reset PC.&nbsp; although I am not sure exactly what will happen for me if I do it since I have messed with the original partition sizes.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reality, you don't need the Recovery partitions at all...</p>
<p>The only thing you will lose is the ability to start a Repair, Reset from within Win 10...</p>
<p>You will be instructed to Installation Media... I deleted my Recovery...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your newest partition appears to be blank, so you would lose nothing deleting it...</p>
<p>The original Recovery partition must still have some function or you wouldn't have been able to select some of the Recovery Options you said you used\tried...</p>
<p>Unless I understood that incorrectly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The D:\ partition can be used for backup, but if the drive fails you are out of luck... It's only useful for saving maybe a System Image of C:\ only...</p>
<p>Most people use the D;\ to store their Pictures, Videos, Word Documents, and etc. on, instead of mixing them up with Windows files on C:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this to a certain degree, but most of the files are secondary backup, and\or images of C:\ and installation files...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RESET PC most likely won't solve your backup problem... It may fix windows, but not the recovery...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Image may be OK... just the other misc. files may have been updated...</p>
<p>I would think if the image would have been modified, the date would have changed...</p>
<p>You just described one of the primary reasons I don't use any type of automatic backup... There is always the potential to overwrite a "Old" good file, with a "New" corrupt one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the only changes are Temporary Files from the internet and stuff..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to try the Recovery of your image, you then need a bootable 3rd party imaging tool to move things around and have them still have a chance of working...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could then make individual images of each partition, delete the old ones, and put the images back on in a different location..</p>
<p>
</p><p>That could be a lot of work, and I can't guarantee 100% it would be successful....</p>
<p>I play with that type of thing a lot, but Windows has become a little more finicky about it with every new version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option would be to delete everything and start fresh... You could then have your three partitions with everything working... You would lose any preinstalled stuff, but most could be reinstalled...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you mentioned Nvidia... </p>
<p>That tells me you may have two graphics processors..</p>
<p>There have been issues with Nvidia, but if everything is working now, either ASUS's Nvidia's or Microsoft's are working properly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you done a Disk Cleanup of System Files yet ? I'm thinking the newest partition may still be empty because that hasn't been done yet...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure mine was empty to start with also, but later had contents...</p>

<h2>            Unable to change Desktop Aspect Ratio</h2>
                    I cannot change the aspect ratio for my desktop.&nbsp; If I go to "Intel Graphics Media Accelerator Driver for mobile", Display Settings Tab, Aspect Ratio Options button, the system defaults to "Full Screen".&nbsp; If I select either "Maintain Aspect Ratio", or
 "Center Image" the "Apply" button stays grayed out and only the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons are active, but hitting "OK" doesn't have any affect.&nbsp; Also, in the "Personalization" &gt; "Desktop Background", "Picture position" drop down menu box only the "Stretch"
 option works.

            Hi RCHal486,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Are you using a laptop are a desktop?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Select some other pictures for desktop background and check, if you are able to select other picture position options. These options may depend on the type of the pictures you select.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The aspect ratio of your desktop may depend on your on the graphic card you use. Check with your desktop/laptop manufacturer or graphic card manufacturer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />

 to this problem.&nbsp; I did find one that listed the subject error and peramiters from the () but that was all.&nbsp; I would like to do a mini dump but have forgotten how as I mostly use a MAC now.&nbsp; Could you help me with how to do a mini dump? Thanks.<br />

            <p>You can clone Win10 from the old HDD to the new one and save reinstalling.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Win10 activation is linked to your motherboard so there is no need to worry about activation keys if</p>
<p>you do decided to reinstall Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use AOEMI Partition Manager, but Macrium Reflect is very well regarded and often recommended.</p>

            <p>Yes, you can reinstall Windows 10 on the same computer without affecting your activation status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have few options -</p>

            Hi mamel0316,
<br />
<br />
<br />I’m Independent Advisor willing to help you, first, let's scan the document to your computer to upload later. 
<br />
<br />Not sure which program to scan you have installed, but let's install Windows Scan from Microsoft Store ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9wzdncrfj3pv
<br />
<br />After that, make sure your scanner is turned on.
<br />In the search box on the taskbar, type Windows Scan, and then select Scan  from the list of results.
<br />Place the item you want to scan face down on the scanner's flatbed and close the cover.
<br />On the Scan page, do the following: 
<br />Under Scanner, select the scanner you want to use.
<br />Under Source, select the location you prefer to scan from.            
<br />Under File type, select the type of file you want the scan to be saved as. For example, JPEG
<br />Select Show more to show the Save file to options.
<br />Under Save file to, browse to the location where you want to save the scan. 
<br />Select Scan   at the bottom of the screen to scan your document or picture.                 
<br />After your scan is finished, select View to see the scanned file before you save it, or select Close to save it. You can edit the scanned document or picture in the preview that appears when you select View. 
<br />
<br />Then, the question would be where do you like to upload your scan.
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
<br />Angel.

    <title>Replacing the AWFUL head strap on the hp mixed reality headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgepacker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replacing the AWFUL head strap on the hp mixed reality headset</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Does any one know if there is an alternative to the head strap for the hp mr headset? the factory one is terrible, when ever i wear the head set i can see into the real world from the bottom which completely ruins the experience,
 if i tighten it to hard one side gets shorter than the other and to top it all off it rips out my hiar when ever i take it off. I think the first issue could be fixed by putting some thicker padding on the bottom but the other two issues are unfixable, if
 any one knows of an alternative head strap please comment, i belive the head strap is the same one that is on the lenovo explorer.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
