                    My computer should I stop for three or four minutes, freezes and I must manually turn it off. &nbsp; I wanted to do system restore but now there are zero restore points except for today at the time I am trying to do it. &nbsp;My computer is several years old and
 had dozens of restore points &nbsp; is there a way to create a restore point (like override) because I have no option to make one.&nbsp;

            HI, &nbsp;This did not help. &nbsp;It does create a restore point but it is the current date and the problem already exists, so it thinks there is nothing wrong. How do I create a restore point prior to May 12, 2013 when I noticed the problem and all of my restore
 points prior to that date are somehow gone? &nbsp;Any date after May 12 has the problem. &nbsp;I need to create a restore point prior to May 12, 2013.

Sorry, your question is equivalent as asking "How can I create a snapshot of myself at the age of 12?". Unless you invent time travel, you cannot go back in time, neither with yourself nor with Windows.

            <p>Do the following:</p>
<p>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the
 store you purchased it from and report it to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/counterfeit-windows-7/www.microsoft.com/piracy">www.microsoft.com/piracy</a>
</p>
<p>If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with
 the physical product go to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/counterfeit-windows-7/www.microsoft.com/howtotell">www.microsoft.com/howtotell</a> and
 verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.</p>
<p>065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220, 221 area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221, 232 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted</p>
<p>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>
<p>Validate Now:</p>
<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. Itâs quick and easy.</p>

<br />
[quote]</p>
<p>Im making this thread so when people are stuck on a certain part of&nbsp;a level, they can just look here rather than posting. I hope you like it.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Tips</span></span></b></p>
<p>1. Choose your destiny</p>
<p>The game offers several levels of difficulty - the higher the level, the harder it is to remain hidden, and the less frequently you'll be allowed to save your game. Skip the easiest level if you want to the game to be any fun at all.
</p>
<p><br />
2. Silence is golden.</p>
<p>The ideal way to complete a hit is to do things as silently as possible. Use the silencer on your pistol - you can buy one if you haven't got one, or use your fire wire to keep things quiet. Or perhaps arrange a little accident... because....</p>
<p><br />
3. Pushing is the answer.</p>
<p>You can now push anyone at all just by walking up to them and pulling the right trigger. Which may seem like a lot of fun, but what use is it? Well, it's very useful for pushing people down the stairs, thereby killing them. Killing someone in such a manner
 results in little noise, and there are also other places they can pushed down or into, such as into crocodile pits and over fences.</p>
<p><br />
4. It was an accident. </p>
<p>And that's not the only way to cause an accident. You can also use explosives to topple chandeliers and the like, crushing anyone beneath. But be careful - you'll have to wait till your target is right underneath, or you'll have wasted your opportunity.</p>
<p><br />
5. Notorious 47</p>
<p>The more noisily you complete a hit, the higher your notoriety will become. And the more notorious you are, the more likely you are to be discovered in the next mission. So try to..</p>
<p><br />
6. Leave No Trace.</p>
<p>Aside from just completing a hit silently, it's also important to get rid of any incriminating evidence. That means hiding or leaving with any extra guns you brought with you, taking your suit with you, and also hiding bodies in skips, crates and so forth.
 Similarly, make sure you remove the tapes from any video cameras that might have caught you in action.
</p>
<p><br />
7. Back from the dead.</p>
<p>Should you be gunned down by enemies, you'll go into slow-mo mode which gives you one last chance to fight back from the brink. Shoot your foes in the head before you die and you'll be given enough health to continue. Although the whole point of the game
 is not to find yourself in that situation. </p>
<p><br />
8. Guns, guns, guns.</p>
<p>You can purchase a variety of guns with the money you earn during the missions, although again bear in mind this isn't a shoot fest. If you do find yourself having to shoot through a room, grab another character to use as a human shield. Pushing in the right
 stick to switch to first person mode also helps.</p>
<p><br />
9. Close Combat<br />
47 is now fairly handy with his fists, so if a character does spot you, it's not all over. Punch his face off before he can reach any allies by hitting the right trigger.</p>
<p><br />
10. Mapping it out.</p>
<p>Finally, as in previous games, you have access to a map that shows you the position of all foes, as well as any interesting objects. I personally think this is cheating and hence don't use this, but if you want to go for it.
</p>
<p>So that's it, have fun with the game, and don't forget to play it through a few times, trying different tactics, as there's a lot to do in Blood Money, and multiple ways of completing missions.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MISSION 1&nbsp; A - VINTAGE YEAR</span></b></span></p>
<p>Difficulty -&nbsp;Very Easy</p>
<p>Mission Objectives<br />
* Kill Don Fernando Delgado<br />
* Kill Manuel Delgado<br />
* Escape via the Water Plane in the Hanger below.</p>
<p>EXTRA INTEL</p>
<ol>
<li>We heard that Manuel likes to entertain friends and enjoy merchandise in the wine cellar.
</li><li>A guided tour of the wine cellar might prove useful, especially when looking for potential traps.
</li><li>The entrance to the secret lab is hidden somewhere in the wine cellar. </li></ol>
<p>From the start go to the left and head around the back of the complex, there will be one guard on patrol â sedate him and take his uniform and shotgun and hide his body in the undergrowth nearby. Walk back round towards where you started and either climb
 over the broken part of the wall or go through the doors. There is a guard at the front door. Head towards the door to the left of the main door but instead of going through it climb up the drain pipe beside it. Shimmy round to the left and go through the
 window.The target will either be in this room sitting playing a musical instrument or next door at the balcony. You can either kill him or wait and shove him over the balcony, the guard in the room is asleep so sedate him after youâve killed the target and
 take his uniform.</p>
<p>You then want to head for the wine cellar so either climb back down the drain pipe or walk through the house and head back outside. Enter the wine cellar and go downstairs, the next target should be nearby so enter the room on the right and stand near the
 barrels. Heâll enter and go to the table, wait for him to leave the room and as he leave strangle him and then dispose of his body in the bin behind you. Head towards the ! on the map and open the door. Head straight across and beside the bed there is a workers
 uniform â put this on and then head towards the elevator. Go down to the hanger and walk round to the plane and escape.</p>

<p><b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MISSION 2 - CURTAINS DOWN</span></span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Difficulty - Easy</span></p>
<p>Mission Objectives<br />
* Kill Alvaro d'Alvade<br />
* Kill Richard Delahunt<br />
*Escape</p>
<p>EXTRA INTEL<br />
1. The content of toolboxes will not be searched when you are&nbsp; frisked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
2. There is a lift shaft from the backstage area to the stage. It's closely observed and only actors are permitted.<br />
3. Lead actors go to their private rooms to rehearse during breaks<br />
4. The large chandelier is attached with bolts to the floor of the attic<br />
5. Only actors are allowed on stage<br />
6. Light technician have key card to Light Control Room.</p>
<p><br />
Head to the cloakroom booth on your left and talk to the man, he'll hand you your coat and 47 will take a handgun from the pocket before returning it. There is a door on the right of this room, enter it and wait in the toilet for the worker to enter â sedate
 him and take his uniform and toolbox.</p>
<p><br />
You want to head to the Western corridor on the first floor. In your workers uniform you should be able to go anywhere apart from on the stage itself. There should be two rooms with stars outside them, you want to enter the one with the ! Inside it. If the
 coast is clear enter the closet, the actors will take a break and one will enter the room, he'll leave for a toilet break, when he does replace the fake gun with the one you got from the cloakroom and leave. He should then kill the actor on stage later.</p>
<p>You then want to head up onto the scaffolding behind the stage. Look on the map for the ! And you should be able to plan a mine here. There is sometimes another worker who wanders around here so either try avoid him or when he leans on the edge shove him
 over. Eventually the next target will leave his private box and go to the stage to see the dead actor. When he trips going down the ramp detonate the bomb.
</p>
<p>Then just head back towards the entrance, collect your suit from the toilet and leave the building.</p>

<p>Difficulty - Medium</p>
<p>Mission Objectives<br />
* Find the CIA agent<br />
* Kill Carmine De Salvo<br />
* Kill the Human Trafficker (OPTIONAL)<br />
* Kill the Las Vegas Mobster (OPTIONAL)<br />
* Protect the CIA agent<br />
* Escape</p>
<p><br />
EXTRA INTEL<br />
1. Admission Papers are required to check in. Future patients often wait in the park outside.<br />
2. Troublesome patients are often confined to the medical wing.<br />
3. The brochure lists some interesting facilities such as a library, a gymnasium and a large spa area.<br />
4. Therapists occasionally get contacted for private sessions<br />
5. Some guests hide stashes of alcohol in quiet places, let's hope they don't get alcohol poisoning.<br />
6. Weight lifting can be fatal<br />
7. Some guests cheat the spa's diet by smuggling camping stoves into their room, sounds dangerous.<br />
8. Deceased patients are taken straight from the medical wing to the morgue.</p>
<p><br />
Walk up the path and you will come to a bit on the right with two dumpsters at it, there is a patient behind one and when the coast is clear you want to sedate him. A guard will walk up and when he turns away from you sedate him, take his uniform and dump his
 body.<br />
Continue back up the path and enter through the main door. You want to make your way towards the medical wing. On your way there you'll enter a room with a guard sitting at a table beside a locked gate. Either sedate him or use the stun gun and drag his body
 outside and dump it in the dumpster nearby. Go back inside and take the video and key card from the table.<br />
Go through the locked gate and continue on towards the medical wing.<br />
When you reach the medical wing stand beside the window of the locked room ahead and when only the guy sitting there is alone climb through the opening and stun him, take his uniform and dump his body in the dumpster in the room. Then head into the cell block
 area and look in the cells for a guy with ginger hair. Go in and talk with him and then give him the drug. Leave and head back to the room where you left the security guard suit and put it back on. Now head back towards the main entrance and keep and eye out
 on your map for the main targets.<br />
If you head up stairs you can place a bomb on the location marked ! on the map.<br />
Then&nbsp; when the target goes to take a drink out of the globe you can detonate the bomb and take him out.<br />
Then head back towards the main gate and enter the morgue area, revive the agent and leave through the other door to escape.<br />
There are also two additional targets that get added during the mission. You can either kill them or leave them alone. They are dressed in coloured robes and should be fairly easy to spot - just kill them when they are alone.</p>

<p>Difficulty - Easy</p>
<p>Mission Objectives<br />
* Kill Vinnie Sinistra<br />
* Retrieve Microfilm<br />
* Escape suburb</p>
<p>EXTRA INTEL<br />
1. Garbage trucks can dispose of waste<br />
2. The surveillance team have an unhealthy appetite for donuts<br />
3. Vinnie has complained about the neighbour's son taking potshots into the garden with an airgun.<br />
4. Vinnie lives close to a veterinary surgeon. Sometimes a vet needs to tranquilize wild animals.<br />
5. Rumor has it that Vinnie's wife flirts with the hired staff, but Vinnie trusts her completely.<br />
6. Some field agents are too nosy in teenage girls' rooms.<br />
7. A Barbeque's is being prepared for the party, be careful with flammable liquids.<br />
8. Vinnie just bought an expensive and unusual necklace for his wife.</p>
<p><br />
Quite a few ways of doing this level, first off you need a disguise to enter the house as it is crawling with FBI agents. Walk around the corner and approach the rear of the van with the big hot dog on top and take the donuts, place them on the ground and inject
 them with the sedation syringe. Approach the back of the white van and knock the door and leave the donuts. The FBI agents inside will eat the donuts and fall asleep. When they do go in take a suit and the video tape and enter the house.<br />
Head up the stairs and eventually the target will enter one of the rooms and face a desk. Snap his neck or strangle him and move his body round the corner away from the door. The micro film is located on his wife's necklace so your either going to have to kill
 or sedate her. She is usually in the indoor pool area so you could sedate her there and take the microfilm. Then all you need to do is go back to the van and collect your suit and then leave through the gates where you started.</p>

1. Walkie talkies transmit everything - even background sound and music, which could reveal someone's location.<br />
2. Clubs usually have a back entrance for staff<br />
3. Bookstore walls are like paper - you can overhear what's going on next door.<br />
4. Clubs in this area are known for having a hat-dress codes and music themes<br />
5. Some private apartments have a useful view<br />
6. Pianos can kill - especially when dropped from the sky.<br />
7. A guy dressed as a yellow bird checked into a hotel room a couple of hours ago</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mission starts in the hotel, you need to follow the red bird with the case through the Mardi gras crowd to their headquarters. It's simple enough just watch out for when they stop for a cigarette. When you reach the headquarters you will be unable to
 enter without a yellow bird costume. You can either head back to the hotel and get one from a guy in a room upstairs or go down the alley beside the headquarters (when nobody is there) and go to the right. There is a yellow bird standing beside the bin. Take
 him out, take his suit and dump his body in the bin. Head into the headquarters, up the stairs and kill Mark Purayah Jr.</p>
<p>Take the walkie talkies and diamonds case and go back outside to the crowd. The two other targets move around so you need to listen to their conversations to work out where they are. You should be able to track them down. You may need to get new disguises
 to enter some locations such as the clubs or bars&nbsp; but you should be able to hunt them down quickly and kill them without too much trouble. Use your map, you should be able to spot them on that.<br />
I usually found one of them always inside one of the clubs on the second floor and the other one wandering around the back alleys and on the main streets.</p>

* Kill Lorne de Havilland<br />

* Retrieve the video tape<br />
* Escape the site</p>
<p>EXTRA INTEL<br />
1. Don't expect any presents this year - Santa drinks too much.<br />
2. The bartender knows how to help improve performance in the grotto.<br />
3. Waiters often shower in the staff changing room.<br />
4. Even small, annoying Dogs eat sausages.<br />
5. The glass bottomed jacuzzi looks down on the pier 70 feet below<br />
6. Among the high society, spiked drinks are all the rage.<br />
7. Heavy light rigs are installed in the photo studio.<br />
8. Lorne recently hired a former US air force helicopter pilot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Head across the jetty and then head to the right and along the waters edge past the guard. You'll see a guard room ahead. Watch the guard inside and wait until he moves away to the drinks machine and enter the room and sedate him. Take his uniform and dispose
 of his body over the rail. Switch of the alarm gate and then head through it and take the elevator. Head to the bar area and go behind the bar and grab the aphrodisiac. Go to the other side of the bar and wait for the bartender to place the cocktail glass
 down. Add the aphrodisiac and wait for the waiter to take the glass out to the target. He'll leave to go to a room with a girl so follow them and then open the door, he'll leave to a balcony area â just push him over.</p>
<p>Next you'll need to get a bodyguard uniform and head to the VIP area, go through the door guarded by the two bodyguards and enter the elevator and take it to the studio floor. The target walks around this level but the best place to kill him is on the balcony
 of his room. The video tape is also located on this floor in the room with the computers in it, wait till the guard turns away from you then swipe the video tape from the table. Then take the elevator to the roof, kill the guard at the door and go outside
 and escape in the helicopter.</p>

5. The lower class kitchen prepares food for both the tourists on board as well as the gators on the top deck. Extra flavour could be added.<br />
6. The boss has received some heavy duty hunting gear from a business alliance. The&nbsp; present is kept secure at the staff Headquarters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disliked this mission very much as I always seemed to get spotted killing someone or trying to pick the locks on a door so beware of your actions and try to be a bit more stealthy than me.<br />
From the start head right and move down towards the boxes on your left, wait for a guard to pass and sedate him and take his uniform â drag his body in behind the boxes. Move back up towards where you started and head to the right and up the stairs, turn right
 and enter the room and take the key from the table then head back outside and enter the room across from you using the key.</p>
<p>The first target is in this room, you should be able to push him over the rail when nobody is looking.</p>
<p>Head up the stairs and you'll see the next target and a woman â they will enter a room. Wait until the woman leaves and go in and kill him. Leave the room and head upstairs (stairs at the south side of the boat) and then enter the door on the right, there
 is another uniform on the bench so put that on and leave. Enter the next room, should be a chef and a cake in here, the next target will enter this room then go back outside â follow him and when you can push him overboard.</p>
<p>Go back to the cake and use a poison syringe on the cake then take it and head outside and up the stairs. You'll get searched at the main door and have to surrender your weapons, go inside and put the cake on the captains desk. The remaining targets are
 also here you can either go back and take out the guard and get your weapons or take out the other targets by strangling them.
<br />
Then just make your way back down the stairs on the boat and head to the rear of the boat on the 1st level and use the boat to escape.</p>

<p>Difficulty - Medium</p>
<p>Mission Objectives<br />
* Kill Sheikh Al-Khalifa<br />
* Kill the scientist<br />
* Kill Hendrik Shultz<br />
* Steal the diamonds case (OPTIONAL)<br />
* Escape<br />
EXTRA INTEL<br />
1. It would be wise to check in at the reception as one of the first things you do at the casino.<br />
2. Security is very tight in high profile casinos, so staff have key cards which only provide access to the floors they work on.<br />
3. As requested, we have left an agency pickup in your hotel room, #701.<br />
4. The casino has strict fire-safety procedures. Easily accessible fire alarms are located on the top floors.<br />
5. It's important to find good vantage points. Room balconies may provide this.<br />
6. The VIP lounge has been reserved all day by the Sheik â only waiters are allowed in this area.<br />
7. There is no cell phone coverage inside the casino to prevent cheating. Anyone receiving a call has to step outside.<br />
8. The items used in trade are carried around in an ordinary looking suitcase so they don't attract too much attention.</p>
<p><br />
This level can be made a little easier if you take the sniper rifle with you. It can be completed without it but it takes a bit longer</p>
<p>Firstly check in at reception and get your room key then head to the elevator on the right and get in. Climb the hatch and wait for Hendrik Shultz to enter the elevator.<br />
Strangle him and take his room key, suit and weapon then exit the elevator on the 7th floor and go to his room and collect the DNA case.<br />
Head back downstairs (I climbed back up the hatch of the elevator and dropped all of my weapons) and into the casino area. Guards are protecting Sheik Al-Khalifa so they will search you.<br />
Meet with Sheik Al-Khalifa and talk with him. Wait for the dancer to finish the dance and a guy will collect the case â collect the black case and then follow the Sheik once he receives a call he gets up and leaves.<br />
He'll head up a quiet staircase to go outside so when the coast is clear and he turns his back strangle him and take the diamonds case.</p>
<p>Head back up to the 7th floor and go out onto the balcony directly behind the lifts. Climb the wooden trellis between the two doors and then shuffle along the edge and over the balcony and enter the room. You need to sedate a staff member to get a key card
 for the floor and then raise the fire alarm, enter the scientist room and hide in a closet and then kill him.<br />
Head out by going out onto the balcony and jumping over and then collect the diamonds case, your suit and weapons and then leave the casino.</p>

* Retrieve Information<br />
* Kill Eve (After completing objective 3)<br />

<p>EXTRA INTEL<br />
1. Trailers arrived earlier with decorations for the parties<br />
2. Information about who is trying to kill you might be found on a laptop on the top floor.<br />
3. Don't go for a swim in the shark tanks at the *** Party.<br />
4. Be careful with pyrotechnics, they could kill someone.<br />
5. Bartenders are usually well informed.<br />
6. Look out for the singer at the heaven party.<br />
7. The devil is never to be trusted.<br />
&nbsp;8. There is a food elevator which might be used to transport more than just food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Head into the building in front of you and towards the desk with the guard. Talk to this guard and he will then proceed to get up and move into a back room. Go after him and sedate him and take his uniform. Head back outside and then left towards the car
 park ramp. Go into the guards booth and when neither of the guards is looking swipe the tape. Head down into the parking lot and take the stairs ahead of you to the lower level.<br />
In the middle of the lower level there is door leading down into the basement. Pick the lock when the coast is clear and go down the stairs.</p>
<p>You now need to get a staff suit for the *** party. Wait at the bottom of the stairs and view your map, youâll see an exclamation mark in one of the rooms. You want to leave the stair well when you see an enemy walking into that room. Go in behind him and
 sedate him and take his uniform. Then head back out of the room and go directly a head of you towards the fork lift trucks, beside one of the doors in the pyro machine, rig this and it will kill one of your targets when she performs her pyro show. Go back
 towards the room you killed the staff guy in but take the big decorated door on your left. Head straight towards the bar and talk to the guy in the red devil suit. Heâll challenge you to a fight so follow him to the torture room and when it starts kill him.<br />
Take his key and leave the room and head for the elevator.</p>
<p>Get in the elevator and climb the hatch, when you reach the garage floor climb through the gap and onto the top of the next elevator. Wait here until your next target the CIA agent enters the elevator, strangle him and take his suit and case if you want.
 Head back to the top floor and when you exit the elevator go through the doors on the right into the restricted area (the CIA agents suit lets you in here) and then through the double doors on your right. Check the laptop and then hide in the closet. Wait
 here and eventually the final target will enter the room. Strangle her and then take your case and get into the elevator and go to the garage and then head towards the car and escape.</p>

1. The Guards here will open fire if weapons are detected by the metal detectors.<br />
2. Any confiscated weapons at the museum entrance will be stored away by security.<br />
3. The white house is surrounded by an iron gate, which varies in height.<br />
4. Guards will respond if the laser alarm system in the Museum is triggered.<br />
5. The first lady has a dog which is regularly taken out for a walk in the backyard<br />
6. The oval office has been the setting for many historical meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equip your customized silverballers for this level.<br />
When the level starts notice the woman with the case. Sheâll head behind the bus for a cigarette, place your silverballers in her case and then head inside the museum. The woman will get stopped by security and they will take away the case. Once inside head
 straight ahead and take the door on the left. Wait inside the toilet for a museum staff member to come in. Sedate him and take his uniform. Leave the toilet and head through the door directly ahead of you and take the second door on the left.
<br />
Sedate the marine outside and take his uniform and hide his body behind the metal object.</p>
<p>Go inside and head for the security office, take out the guard sitting at the desk and then take your silverballers from the case and the key card from the table. Then head back out and towards the long corridor on the West end of the map. Youâll be unable
 to pass through the double doors without a key card so get the key card from the security office. As you proceed youâll get caught on camera a few times â not much you can do to avoid them as they are all over the place. Dressed as a Marine you should be able
 to go pretty much anywhere apart from the oval room. Go up the stairs and Watch the target on the map, when he enters a room alone you can take him out.</p>
<p>Head to the room on the west side and take the stairs outside the window and go across the roof. Kill the janitor and take his suit and key card. Enter the door and go into the security office, go into the door beside it. You should be able to get a secret
 service uniform here which should grant you access to pretty much everywhere. The target is located down the stairs in the oval office, when you enter it will trigger a small fmv sequence and then he will blow up the door and run away. You need to go into
 the next room and hide behind the cardboard wall beside the other door until guards come in and check the room. Then you should be able to walk about freely in your secret agent disguise.<br />
Head back towards the roof where you killed the janitor and the last target will be waiting for you. Kill him then go up the ladder and make your way back towards the main entrance â be careful not to go through the metal detector but the gate beside it. Then
 go towards the gate and escape. Iâve not been able to find the video surveillance tapes but I think if you head across the roofs and avoid the main corridors you may be able to avoid being seen on camera.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Hitman: Blood Money Glitch - Requiem Safe Spot</span></b><b><br />
</b>On the final level Requiem -- where you have to wake up and kill all witnesses in the church -- there is a major glitch. As soon as you wake up, exit the church and head south. There will be two stone mausoleums (or sheds). Enter the one that is furthest
 away from you. <br />
<br />
When the doors are closed, the guards cannot open them, and they will all come running down. You can keep opening and closing the doors as you please without worrying about all the guards rushing in to kill you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Unlimited&nbsp;Save Glitch - Can only do on&nbsp;rookie, normal or expert.</span></b></p>
<p>Click save and when it says its saving press start quickly. The save screen should disapear and when you click load, it should show you when you saved etc but the bottom will show that you have not used any saves therefore you have unlimited saves. I found
 this out whilst messing around randomly, its a treat to you lot.</p>
<div><br />
<div><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Infinite Money</span></b>
<p>You can re-play any level you've already beaten, and if you earn more money (by not leaving witnesses, low notoriety, etc.), the difference is added to your account balance (e.g. if you made $400,000 the first time and $500,000 the second time, then $100,000
 is added to your balance). However, there is a glitch in the game that will let you add this difference to your account as many times as you want.
</p>
<p>First, complete a level as poorly as possible, earning as little money as you can. Then save the game and go back to that level. This time, earn as much money as you can, and make sure you create a save point immediately before escaping the level. After
 you escape, the mission review screens will show your new account balance. You can press the B button to return to the first of these screens, and then press they Y button to replay the level. A warning message pops up alerting you that your progress will
 be lost; however, it turns out that your save points and account balance are NOT reset. As soon as the level restarts, you can load the save point you created earlier and escape the level again. Your account balance will again be increased by the difference
 you earned. You can repeat this process as many times as you wish. (This one is from Gamespot)</p>

<p>Within the level entitled "The Murder of Crows", you will notice that there are three seperate bars in the area: Salsa, Rock and Blues. You can acquire outfits that correspond with the particular bars. Once you have selected the appropriate costume for your
 bar of choice, enter the bar, position 47 to stand amongst the other dancers on the dance floor and then leave the controller alone. After a few minutes 47 will start to get his groove on with the ladies and start dancing.</p>
<p><b><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Hidden Rat Club</span></span></b></p>
<p>In Curtains Down, there is a room in the basement on the west side where there are three rats. Occasionaly, a worker will come in and try to kill them with a nailgun. If you kill all three rats, a ket card entitled RATCLUB KEYCARD will appear on one of the
 tables on the west side of the room. If you take stairs near the target's dressing room to the second floor, and use it on the door on first door to the left, it will open a storage room with what appears to be a cel, and on the other side there are a bunch
 of rats havinga party and doing things like boxing, and playing cards.</p>

<h2>            No cursor in most fullscreen games</h2>
                    
<p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>I've been having this issue since I setup my HTPC. The mouse cursor works fine during standard windows use, but when I launch most games, the cursor disapears. I have mouse trails disabled, and I have no option to change the video acceleration settings in
 the Advanced Video settings.</p>
<p>Here is my hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motherboard: Asus M3A78-Pro </li><li>CPU: AMD Athlon AM2 5200+ </li><li>Ram: 4GB PC5300 (667 Mhz) </li><li>Video: EVGA 8800GT 1GB </li><li>HDD: 250GB Seagate SATA (7200.11) </li><li>LiteOn 4x Bluray/DVD-Rom </li><li>KB/MSE: Logitech Cordless Desktop MX3000 </li></ul>
<p>The only games that I have tried that work are COD:Modern Warfare 2 (in the menus), and World of Warcraft (ONLY with Hardware Cursor DISABLED- causes rapid flashing of the cursor when this is enabled). I have also tried disabling Visual Themes and Desktop
 Composition under the compatibility settings for launching games. I have the latest drivers for all the hardware, and the latest Logitech software installed.</p>
<p>P.S.- The main game in question is Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. I have not tested the original game for this problem. The Cursor appears on the screen, but does not move with the actual cursor which can be seen when mousing over menu items (the menu
 buttons light up).</p>
<p>How can I resolve this?</p>

<h2>            Xbox live Locked due to Hacker</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>10 days ago my xbox live account was hacked. Immediately I called xbox and told the guy what happened and after not being able to change my password back, he said he would just lock the account until the âinvestigation teamâ could verify that it was
 my account and they should have it back to me within 7 days. However, after my account was locked I managed to change my password back by resetting it through email but my account is still locked. I've tried phoning xbox 4 times now to unlock it but they can't
 because apparently thats not their department and they can't contact the investigation team?</span></p>
<p>Is their any way for me to unlock my account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 cannot adjust brightness</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 has been harassing me with all kinds of broken parts here and there. Now here's another glitch I can't tolerate to live with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, I cannot adjust the screen brightness after I put my HP laptop to sleep and then wake it up. I tried both the keyboard "F2"/"F3" and the brightness adjustment bar in the control panel. The sliders work, but the brightness doesn't change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A reboot fixes the problem only temporarily. When the laptop wakes up from sleep/hibernation, the brightness will be frozen again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already checked my drivers in the "Device Manager".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M</p>
<p>Both are up to date. I even reinstalled them, doesn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is HP Envy 17 TouchSmart, windows 8.1, 1920*1080.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help ASAP!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>You may try changing the Power options settings for Sleep to never and check.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> on the desktop Screen and select
<strong>Power options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Select the option âChange advanced Power settingsâ.</span></p>

            <p>You need to look into the driver that is being used for your graphics card.&nbsp; Did you machine come with Windows 8 installed, or did it come with windows 7 and you have upgraded it to windows 8?&nbsp; If the latter it is possible that the upgrade process did not
 find a suitable Windows 8 driver and instead used the Basic Video driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a look in Device Manager at the driver in use for your video card.&nbsp; If it is not an NVidia driver, check on the Sony and/or NVidia web sites for up to date drivers for your card. Even if an NVidia driver is installed, check for a more up to date driver.</p>

    <title>Using Vista drivers &#40;especially video drivers&#41; with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebell1952  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Vista drivers &#40;especially video drivers&#41; with Windows 7</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 RC and the drivers that were on the machine worked fine. However, I am hosting a Windows 7 Launch Party and received a Signature copy of Windows 7 Ultimate. When I tried to install the promo OS I had to do a clean install which wiped
 out the drivers. I contacted the manufacturer (HP) who are apparently <strong><em>not</em></strong> going to provide updated drivers for my machine (which is only 2 years old) for Windows 7. When I contacted their support people I was told to use the drivers
 for Vista, but when I try to install the drivers I am told that my OS is not Vista and the install terminates. So, is there any way for me to fool the software into thinking I am actually running Vista?

<p>Windows 8.0 isn't supported and is actually dangerous to use -- it's easy to hack and nearly every hacker on the planet knows how to do it now.&nbsp; You should make sure you update to 8.1 or Windows 10 as fast as you possibly can.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Regarding the "low disk space on recovery disk D", you can solve that using the excellent answer provided
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-low-disk-space-on-local-d-drive-message/831bb7d0-5570-4f52-ace4-3ed3fb3d60b5">
here</a>. It just takes about 30 seconds to do.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The other issues (hot, stuttering) is likely because the system is performing a lot of extra work in the background, causing the CPU to heat up and cause lag for other items like youtube.&nbsp; This could even be a sign of an infection, because often when a hacker
 compromises a old system like Windows 8.0, they will force your computer to do expensive work like cryptocurrency, which makes the computer very hot and slow. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>So for this, the first thing you should do is make sure you're updated so hackers cannot get into your system.</li><li>Then press Ctrl-Shift-Escape and look at the Processes tab, see if you can find any program that is using too much CPU or Disk activity (memory matters but is less important). &nbsp;</li><li>If you aren't running any tasks that are using your processor, and not playing and media/videos, this page should show your CPU is less than 5% used.&nbsp; If the number stays higher than that, it means some program is hogging your CPU and causing it to be hot
 and sluggish.&nbsp; For example while I type this, I have 100s of processes running yet my CPU shows only 8%.</li></ul>

<h2>            BSOD - No dump files are created</h2>
                    <p>This is something I wanted to ask the community for a long time...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...my Windows 10 installation had some problems in the past, I solved the VAST majority of 'em but sometime (expecially after my saturday 18h session of intense online gaming on multiple engines with extremly high demands in terms of graphics and processing
 power), I got BSOD.</p>
<p>Annoying system freeze, bla bla, sad face...now, this would be all well and good (almost expected), but the fact that I've never seen a memory dump or minidump is driving me mad, I've also activated the "showparameters" key in the registry in order to try
 and catch an error code, but the only things I've got are codes unrecognized by the mighty google...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: WHY my system is not creating a dump file (any kind, I've tred them all) I also tryed to change the folder, thinking that my RAID 0 where I've the System could have been the cause, but I've got no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Halp?</p>

<h2>            Weird problem related to Windows 10, explorer.exe, and internet connection</h2>
                    <p>Here's what happens:</p>
<p>Symptoms: </p>
<p>- everything freezes/very unresponsive</p>
<p>- explorer.exe crashed and restarted a few times. </p>
<p>- Harddrive active time = 100% with 0/small disk activity (read &amp; write) while CPU and memory usages are normal</p>
<p>(I monitor using task manager and performance monitor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>First encounter: turned my PC on (after windows update) and the symptoms occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few restarts, I was able to identify that</p>
<p>- Windows works properly without internet connection (WiFi and LAN) (CPU, RAM, Disk, etc)</p>
<p>- whenever I turn WiFi or plug in LAN cable on, the symptoms occur. </p>
<p>- The symptoms disappear when I turned off WiFi (did not test with LAN cable) i.e. explorer.exe stops crashing. Disk active time back to normal.</p>
<p>- I also use dual boot (Ubuntu) and everything works fine, including internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<p>- uninstalling that update and the update before that</p>
<p>- uninstalling/disabling software that changed during the last few days.</p>
<p>- system restore (it failed to restore, though)</p>
<p>- restarting a lot of times. shutting down and booting up a lot of times.</p>

<p>Hi Patikorn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are facing issues while using Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your effort towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the device settings are incorrect, corrupted or incompatible drivers or due to hardware problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
</span><strong><span>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run System Maintenance troubleshooter</p>
</span></strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with system performance and maintenance. Follow below steps:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Right click</strong> on <strong>Start </strong>button, select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Change the <strong>view by </strong>option on the top right to Large icons.<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click on the <strong>
view all </strong>option on the left panel.<br />
<strong>4. </strong>Run the <strong>System Maintenance </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Update Drivers</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>For <strong>Windows to recognize your device</strong>, you might need to find and install a compatible driver. Most
<strong>hardware interfaces </strong>require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, power outages, viruses, or other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become corrupted. Downloading
 and installing the latest driver can resolve these types of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps recommended by <strong>Andre Da Costa </strong>
on <strong>Updating drivers </strong>from following article and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>How
 to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</span></span></span></span></strong></a></p>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Click&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>here</strong></span></a> for more information on fixing network connection issues.</p>
</span></span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply. I've tried the first option, it did not detect anything wrong. No change.</p>
<p>For the second option, I instead uninstalled both network drivers and reinstalled them using stock drivers. No change. I cannot use online drivers because, obviously, whenever I connect to the internet explorer.exe crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up doing factory reset on Windows 10 (although I hate to do it) because I am unwilling to spend the next 10 days and nights trying to fix this (I used Windows 10 reset functionality with keep my file option). It now works properly although I'll probably
 have to spend the next 10 days re-installing everything. And yes, I'm a little mad because I've spent the last few days trying to fix this thing and in the end I don't know what caused it.<br />
<br />
So, in short: if anyone happens to have this problem and is reading this: factory reset will get you PC to working state.</p>
<p>Note: when I used the reset functionality, Windows 10 was kind to me enough to give me a list of programs I need to reinstall.</p>

    <title>task manager displays wrong cpu speed&#47;utilization - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            task manager displays wrong cpu speed&#47;utilization</h2>

<p>
</p><p>as can be seen, windows 10's task manager reports cpu speed as 3.26, where it is actually 4.13.</p>
<p>similarly, a multiplier of 28 will show a maximum cpu utilization of 80%.</p>
<p>the computer is running prime95, so it is definitely 100% loaded; this can be seen in various applications (e.g. intel extreme tuning utility, and many many others)</p>
<p>
</p><p>possibly the 125 bus speed is ignored? task manager seems to assume it is set to 100 in its calculations</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a fix for this?</p>

<p>Hi Jimmy,</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Task Manager</strong> displays the programs, processes, and services that are currently running on your computer.</p>
<p>On the CPU section of the Performance tab, the actual CPU is now specifically identified in detail with the brand, the model number, the speed, as well as the number of sockets, cores, and logical processors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other third party performance monitor specifies the utilization and speed of the processor using different algorithms which differs from Windows Task Manager computations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, different algorithms are used to measure performance. For example, the algorithm used by Intel in its branded maximum speed is different than the algorithm used by Windows Task Manager to directly measure the speed of the CPU. You can use other
 processor utilities, such as the Intel Processor Identification Utility or CPU-Z, for additional processor speed measurements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you face any issues on Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            the cpu is overclocked to ABOVE the stock 3.5, yet task manager shows a value BELOW the stock. this simply cannot possibly be considered accurate...

            well i guess a possible workaround is simply to set the multiplier to 35, in which case the calculations will be correct again, but this requires the computer to be able to be overclocked to 35 with a bus speed of 125 (in other words: stable on a +25%
 overclock)
