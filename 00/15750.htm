<h2>            Office 16 hangs on file Save&#47;Open after Windows 10 Creators update</h2>
                    <p>I have been successfully running Office 16 Pro and Windows 10 since late 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Win10 Creators update trying to use the File function to Open or Save or SaveAs or just browse causes Word (and Excel) to become unresponsive. The only thing I can do is use Task manager to end the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various things, including reinstalling Office using the online repair function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any advice</p>

My opinion is likely that it is your Application which is causing the problem.&nbsp; Does it happen on other databases as well?&nbsp; If you want, you can email me a copy so I can take a look for things that may be causing that issue.&nbsp; If you decide to do so you can

            I've seen Access forms (all versions) take a painfully long time when I edit a form that has a crosstab or a very complex query as its RecordSource. If that is your case you will find it helpful to remove the recordsource while you are editing and replace
 it before you save and close the form.
<div><br />
<div>The reason that the above causes a slowdown is that Access must force all controls to re-visit the source when there is a change made to the form/report</div>

    <title>Bugs, errors and features to be implemented in Nokia 5530 Express - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n5530em  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bugs, errors and features to be implemented in Nokia 5530 Express Music</h2>
                    
<p>I have the following feature requests (I previously had a SE phone):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You <strong>cannot assign different melodies for different alarms</strong>. Even old $50 non-smartphones can do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. You cannot make one alarm for Monday, Thuesday and Friday and another alarm for Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. Work days are absolutely insufficient. Please,
<strong>make it possible to assign any number of days for any alarm</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Delivery reports <strong>must be</strong> a part of the sent messages. It's absolutely inconvenient to have them in a separate folder. This way you have to go into a separate folder just to know if a message was delivered or not (in case you've sent a
 dozen of messages and missed on-screen delivery reports).<br />
<br />
4. Received SMS messages <strong>do not</strong> include sent date information (a time/date when a person hit 'send' ), only a time/date of actual delivery.<br />
<br />
5. When adding a contact to a contact list, earlier SMS messages from this contact remain unidentified.<br />
<br />
6. Service requests, e.g. *NUMBER# have <strong>no</strong> user feedback. All other mobile phones I've dealt with say: "Requesting ..." (I can upload video demonstrating this issue.)<br />
<br />
7. Many actions, like hanging up cause very uneven feedback - the phone shutdowns in less than a fraction of a second. I can upload video demonstrating this issue.<br />
<br />
8. It's not clear if a mobile telephone is fully charged up - especially if you haven't heard the completion sound/alarm.<br />
<br />
9. The <u>same</u> telephone numbers with <u>different prefixes</u> are <strong>not</strong> recognized. In my country you can call a person "8 123456789" and receive a phone call from "+7 123456789" - Nokia 5530 will treat these two numbers as
<u>different</u> numbers when in fact they are the same.</p>
<p><br />
Also you can call a person or a land line phone by omitting country and city prefix like 1234567 and then that person or number will call from "+(country prefix) (city prefix) 1234567" and, of course, Nokia
<u>will not</u> recognize this phone number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this is a direct request to Nokia software engineers: if <u>the last five</u> digits of a number match
<u>any previously</u> stored number it <u>must</u> be <u>treated</u> as the old already saved number, e.g. a call from XXXXX12345 must be treated as a call from PersonA who has 12345 telephone number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. When entering an SMS message, the phone sometimes goes nuts and after you've finished typing a sentence ending it with dot, all subsequent characters are entered in CAPS mode. (I can upload video demonstrating this issue).</p>
<p><br />
11. QWERTY keyboard in wide screen mode should look exactly like a QWERTY keyboard, like here
<a href="http://www.gonzalobarr.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/qwerty.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gonzalobarr.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/qwerty.gif</a> So the second row should have a different indentation and e.g. 'A' char should be located almost in the middle of 'Q' and 'W' chars above. Right now in wide screen QWERTY keyboard the
 second and third row chars are located exactly under first row chars and it's not easy to map this image with your memory of QWERY keyboard. That makes typing much more difficult.</p>
<p><br />
12. You cannot edit a contact before opening it, which means a lot of unneeded clicks. Please, add "Edit" to contact "Options".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More to follow.</p>

<p>Okay, firstly you say you previously had an SE phone. SE phones in general are feature phones, meaning they are designed for fashion and looks, and well, "features". Some of these things you are looking for are also available in Nokia phones, but in Nokia
 phones using their feature phone OS, which is the s40 series. The 5530 runs on its smartphone OS, the s60 series (specifically s60v5), meaning the phone is designed to accomodate various applications which make use of the phone's hardware to let you do many
 other things that feature phones arent usually built to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Assigning different melodies for different alarms can be done usually on feature phones (non-smartphones). Smartphones usually can't. That kind of answers your question. Any smartphone that can do this usually is due to modded features, or applications.
 There are various applications &nbsp;which would already do what you want, so why bother with it? It is normal for smartphone users to download their favorite apps and load them onto their new phones. Nokia already knows that a lot of its users already use these
 apps, most of which are available free on ovi store. Since you are new into the Nokia smartphone scene (and since you bought the 5530, which means it is also that it is likely your new smartphone), I'll be helping you with that. The difference between smartphones
 and feature phones is that feature phones are loaded with the features already, with smartphones, Nokia allows you to choose which alarm app you want from the ovi store and the multitude of different alarm software in the net. And with smartphones, google
 is your friend. Here is the top result on google for a 5530/5800 alarm which allows you&nbsp;&nbsp;to change your alarm tone for every alarm, not to mention a host of other features you might like.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://full-ngage-games.blogspot.com/2009/01/handyalarmprov103s60v5symbianos94regged.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://full-ngage-games.blogspot.com/2009/01/handyalarmprov103s60v5symbianos94regged.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Actually what you are asking really is unnecessary &nbsp;in my opinion, and you seem to be the only one complaining about that. You can simply set an alarm for monday and set it to weekly, so every monday you get the same alarm. Do the same thing for tuesday,
 wednesday, thursday and friday, and you already got what you're asking for. I am not sure but if I remember correctly, this alarm app may be of use to you:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nokiaseries.net/2483/shaanxi-haocheng-xclock-v3-0-s60v5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokiaseries.net/2483/shaanxi-haocheng-xclock-v3-0-s60v5.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. This isnt Nokia territory anymore, its Symbian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. One question, does your previous phone do this? I havent encountered any phone that does this, I've seen Moto, Nokia, and Samsung, and AFAIK my friend's SE walkman doesnt have this. This is very network dependent as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Not really noticed it (using 5800, same OS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. This happens on mine. I see a "requesting" prompt, and AFAIK there's also such a thing on the 5530</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Have you updated the firmware recently? Anyway, hang-ups and crashes are kind of something to expect from any smartphone, especially from users unfamiliar with it. However the 5530's fault likely lies in unstable software, which you could fix simply by
 updating it. latest is around v20 I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Uhm, if its not fully charged the bars keep on moving. Alternatively, you could also download green charging. The screen changes if its fully charged, and the phone shouts at you as well.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/18547?clickSource=related%2Bcontent&amp;contentArea=applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/content/18547?clickSource=related%2Bcontent&amp;contentArea=applications</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. I'm not sure I can help you with that since my phone works perfectly in that aspect, and the 5800 and 5530 has the same s60v5 software, albeit the 5800's is older.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. For some reason, I feel that &nbsp;7,8,9, and 10 are all related and that your firmware may need an upgrade, or reinstallation. And its not Nokia's fault really, no company tests every unit that it churns out. They just test certain batches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;It may be more comfortable for you, but Nokia though of a lot of other people as well, especially people who may have bigger fingers that yours. Making a qwerty keyboard like that would make the keys too small to click and would be difficult to use
 since it is a touch phone. If you want to know what I mean, try to download Opera Mini and use the qwerty keyboard of the app, it has the same layout as you want. You'd see what I mean by the keys becoming too small. The iPhone has the advantage of a bigger
 screen in this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. This phonebook is standard for all s60v3 and v5 phones. Meaning it is identical. Nokia had no intention of changing it since everybody else seems ok with it. They're not going to change it for a single complaint. Besides, I find it ok. Whenever I need
 to add an additional number or email to a contact, I dont open contacts to edit it. Simply type the number and click the contacts icon in the bottom. It will ask if you would like to add it to a previously saved contact. Easy. Or you could highlight the email
 address or number in your message and select to add it to a contact. You dont really need to go to the contacts menu to edit things.</p>

            13. I presume you're referring to your old non touch phone? Non touch phone as less power consuming than touch phones, not to mention that smartphones are more power consuming than feature phones. For example, a Nokia 5610 can match or exceed a 5800 for
 battery life (I have both phones). The 5610 is a feature phone, the 5800 is a touch-smartphone. At this almost equal value for battery life, please note that the 5610 has a 900mah battery, while the 5800 has a 1300mah battery. Your 5530 has a 1000mah battery.

<p>1. This feature is absolutely easy to implement, so why should I bother finding applications which often cost
<strong>money</strong> and <strong>drain</strong> phone battery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Well, I have three SE around and all of them have this feature. Again - it is absolutely easy to implement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. It is Nokia firmware, all under Nokia control, Symbian is a Nokia subsidiary. Nokia can do anything about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Yes, all my previous non-smart phones showed that information. Super-duper Symbian/Nokia doesn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Should I upload <strong>video?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. There's no feedback here, should I upload <strong>video?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. There's <strong>no</strong> firmware update for Nokia 5530. 6 months after release and not a single update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. There should be one simple BIG SIGN on the screen that the phone is fully charged. Nothing more, nothing less. Or alternatively a charge bar should change its color. I shouldn't guess that information - it should be momentarily readable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. It's a very important missing feature which my 7 years old Nokia phone had and 5530 lacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Should I upload <strong>video?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Nokia's decisions are not automatically the best because Nokia is the oldest mobile phones producer. Most people remember QWERTY keyboard the way it really appears in their memory, the way keyboard appears in their imagination - and I bet changing it
 to that <a href="http://www.sotovik.ru/images/review/Highscreen/PP5420/scr/Highscreen_PP5420_009.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sotovik.ru/images/review/Highscreen/PP5420/scr/Highscreen_PP5420_009.jpg</a> is a matter of few minutes. It looks like you've just never bothered learning blind typing method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. God, you are so pro-Nokia, they are impeccable, blah-blah, I'm getting tired of what you saying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are just defending their decisions and solutions even though in many cases those decisions and solutions are just against common sense. It seems like you've never heard the words HID and usability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I will add more items to this list.</p>

<p>No offense taken. I understand your gripe. Actually, one thing I hold against Nokia is releasing the 5530 and 5230 at all using the s60v5. It was released in a price range where most people would be migrating from feature phones, and would be expecting similar
 to yours in terms of apps, not really understanding smartphone quirks, why smartphones often have less pre-installed features and whatnot differences between smartphones and featurephones. They should have made an s40 touch version (their feature phone OS)
 for this price range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Actually those apps are free. Smartphones often do not have this feature simply because there are already better apps for this out there and these apps are also updated more frequently than the firmware updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Maybe you would also like to know that the SE Satio also does not have the feature you are asking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. No Nokia can't dictate anything if you understand how corporations work, especially since the Symbian Foundation is not entirely Nokia's. They're just the major stockholder AFAIK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Well then, I cant do anything about that. Never had a phone from any brand that does that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. No, no need to load video. Its just something that I have no control over. You could try to remove the battery for 5 min before powering up again. This is a standard reset procedure which induces the phone to reload information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. This is again something I have no control over if you have no feedback. The above procedure may fix it, though I dont guarantee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Yes there is. A number of threads here were already exultant about the update. Dec 9, 2009, the v20 update was released in the asia pacific region. If you do not have update, then that probably means your phone is network locked or branded. Is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Standard for all nokia phones that the phone will beep once fully charged. Again, I havent encountered a phone which has that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Apparently someone else has this issue and it was traced to a network fault on orange. O2 users also report such things, but I havent encountered anyone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;No need to upload. As I said this is likely a software/firmware problem, as the 5530 was released prematurely IMO. If you are network locked and cannot update, take it out on your network who demands Nokia to not release firmware updates for their phones
 unless after they are done customizing it. Which they dont really prioritize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;Oh yes I have learned blind typing method. I sometimes type on my 5800 without really looking at the screen. I have used a similar keyboard on Opera Mini, and I must tell you that I absolutely hate it. The keys are too small and too near each other
 that I often make wrong keypresses. Its a user-to-user preference, and your preference may not be in line with what many others would want. You are also the first one I have encountered to make an issue of this, and would therefore be relegated as the minority.
 In business decisions, what the minority wants is usually ignored. I'm afraid I cannot say anything which may um, sound less offensive, but its true from the business perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. It is not being pro-nokia. What I am saying is true. This is the standard Nokia phonebook. I might also add that the SE Satio phonebook and Samsung Omnia HD phonebook are identical, just to show how "pro nokia" I am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. No its not an excuse. You should understand that touch phones do eat a lot more battery than non-touch phones. Also, maybe its your theme, as 5530 should have more than 4 bars battery indication. (I was sitting next to a guy with a 5530, and he does
 have more than 4 when I looked) The link contains pictures of the 5530 having more than four bars. (Links to GSMArena phone reviews)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please understand that I am not bashing you or anything. What I am trying to do is to help you get the most of what you want from your phone. This is not being pro-nokia, since the deficiencies you are talking about also exist in phones from other brands
 (as I said, even the SE and Samsung flagships have the same deficiencies). What I'm asking is to let us help you. Besides, the apps dont cost a thing. The developers are just letting you have the decision of letting you choose which apps to have on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing, if you are network locked, which you seem to be due to the lack of updates, your network may have removed certain preinstalled apps (vary from country to country) for their own purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDIT: For some reason I cant edit my above post. The GreenCharging application which I suggested for your problem#8 changes the screen graphic once the battery is full into a big green lightbulb saying that the battery is full. The phone will also "speak"
 that it cant take it (charging) anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I re-read your post and I think I understand your stand against Nokia better. Please correct me if I am wrong in my assumptions. Also, regarding the "pro-nokia" label you threw at me, if you would visit the gsmarena forums, you would actually see that I
 usually recommend buying an Omnia HD from Samsung instead of an n97 unless you really need the qwerty keyboard, and at that I'd still ask the person to consider an Omnia Pro if he has no qualms about WinMo. That forum in particular is impartial, and made primarily
 for people who are looking to buy a phone. You can post there your budget, your required features in a phone, your OS preference, and we would be the ones looking for the phone that best suit your needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, back to topic:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are &nbsp;"mad" (for lack of a better word) at Nokia for selling a smartphone with as you call them "deficiencies." Re-reading your post I understand that you were a previous feature phone user, which we in gsmarena like to call "dummyphones." Please understand
 that those types of phones have all their features loaded onto the phone because there is no other way to add them. However, smartphones are sold in what I would term as "blank state".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To give an analogy, lets say you buy a laptop. It works out of the box fine, however, to make it work the way you want or need, you still need to buy an MS Office license, and AV license, etc. If you do not like using Paint to edit your photos, then you
 would buy PhotoShop, or Corel. If you do not like Windows Media Player, the &nbsp;you would download VLC. The situation is the same in smartphones. If you do not like the way the built in apps are made, you have the capability to download and customize your phone
 applications almost into whatever way you want. Think of a smartphone as a mini computer in that sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smartphones are meant to be connected to the internet, upon buying smartphones are meant to be customized by the user to his own tastes by adding in his favored applications and his replacements for the default applications. This is primarily the reason
 why I question the wisdom of making the 5530 and 5230. Basically you are giving smartphones with these kinds of quirks to people who have always bought featurephones before, not knowing the differences in buying a smartphone from a feature phone. Buying a
 smartphone requires extensive research and reading reviews before buying (You could have avoided your qwerty problem if you did do your homework and read the GSMArena review, where they showed pictures of the keyboard). With the huge lineup of smartphone from
 every brand, &nbsp;You could have chosen something which would have fit your bill better, however I do not guarantee that you would not have any gripes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please understand that this statement is made in the assumption that you have never used a smartphone before and may be having the wrong expectations regarding smartphones. With all your preferences, if you had went to GSMArena forum before buying your phone,
 I would have told you to buy a modded phone from samsung instead, if any fit your budget, as most of the smartphones with the features you want built-in are more expensive than the 5800.&nbsp;</p>

            Oh yeah, if you went to GSMArena with these kinds of wishes for your phone, I would have told you to buy an OmniaLite from Samsung if you could have afforded it (240 euro, more expensive than 5530). Running WinMo + touchwiz interface, it would actually
 give you a some of what you wanted (like that keyboard). Be warned however that the only things I have heard about that keyboard you're wishing for are bad. They're too small, etc.

<p>I sincerely apologize for the tone of my messages and I'd like to thank you for your excellent explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However bear in mind, that my biggest gripe is the absence of software for this very smartphone, and the fact that most old unsigned applications cannot be installed on this platform without ugly and dirty hacks I don't want to go through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot run 99% of old Java applications because this phone lacks direction keys (Up, Down, Right, Left).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm forced to install paid applications for features I previously had in my dumbphone for free - that's very upsetting and disgusting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd be glad to know how to contact Nokia support <strong>directly</strong> so that they could look into these issues and relieve my pain of using the semi "<em>advanced</em>" phone.</p>

            Hi Lee,<br />
<br />
First of all, I’d like to explain that in Office 2016, we can choose four locations to save our files generally Local, OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint document library.<br />
<br />
Local is saving files to our local computer.<br />
<br />
OneDrive is saving files to our personal OneDrive (login as our Microsoft account) while OneDrive for Business is saving files to our OneDrive for Business library (login as our Office 365 for Business account). About different between OneDrive and OneDrive
 for Business, you can refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-OneDrive-for-Business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#__how_does_skydrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive for Business is different from OneDrive</a>.<br />
<br />
SharePoint is saving files to a SharePoint document library similar as below<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ee0b920-994a-4d6d-b771-c8b79bf31586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ee0b920-994a-4d6d-b771-c8b79bf31586" /></a><br />
<br />
So, back to your post, I’d like to confirm the following information<br />
1.Regarding “every document is now being saved to both OneDrive and SharePoint”, are you referring those documents are automatically saving to OneDrive (login as Microsoft account) and a SharePoint document library after you click Saving<br />
2.Are those files are open locally or online<br />
3.Does this happen in all Office 2016 software<br />
4.Please try to click File Save as and then save the files to local computer, after these steps, will these files still automatically saving to OneDrive and SharePoint document library<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can copy only data files Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, Downloads, and Favorites from one user account to another. For us to assist you better, we'd like to know more information on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you trying to transfer the data from old computer to new computer?</p>
<p>2. Have you created a new Microsoft account on the new computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + E</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to <strong>C:\Users</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click on the account that you want to copy the files from.</p>
<p>4. Right click on the folder or file and select <strong>Copy</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Paste the file or folder on an external hard drive or a USB, and connect it to the new computer.</p>
<p>5. Navigate to <strong>C:\Users</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Open the new account and paste the folders or files there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can have the same Microsoft account on two different computers, however Windows will only sync the settings you choose across all your Windows 10 devices that you've signed in to with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

                    In Access 2010, while building a macro in design view, the SetWarnings action command is not available in the "Add New Action" drop-down menu.&nbsp; I can import a macro from an earlier version of Access and copy/paste the SetWarnings into my new macro, but
 I can't simply select it while building a new macro.&nbsp; Is there a different command in Access 2010 or am I missing something?

    <title>Bulleted list bullets no longer scale with font size&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> syfier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bulleted list bullets no longer scale with font size&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an avid OneNote user and consider myself to be a very active note-taker. I have a system down with which I do not have to pause to do formatting when I am typing my notes. My default template has a single box with a defined bullet order which I can
 immediately start typing into, using the CTRL+Shift+&lt; and the CTRL+Shift+&gt; shortcuts to change font sizes when going up or down in the bullet hierarchy. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c2bce12-e057-4015-ad06-ed58f6fd2eef" /></p>
<p>In OneNote 2007, changing the font size in a bulleted line changed the bullet font size as well (As seen on the right). This resulted in nice, clean organization where deeper sections in the bulleted list were tighter together and smaller in font. I just
 updated to OneNote 2013, and this seems to have changed. The bullet font size must be updated manually (selecting the particular bullet level and changing the font) as opposed to matching the font size of the line the bullet prefixes. Note taking has become
 much more cumbersome, as I now must either rework over all of my notes after a class to change the formatting manually, or just accept that every line, no matter how deep in my bulleted list tree, will be as large as any other line, regardless of the font
 size (As seen on the left).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas as to if or how this can be changed? I really don't want to move away from OneNote, but I find the lack of any kind of list &nbsp;formatting options unacceptable, especially when they were present in earlier &nbsp;versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ahead of time,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Robert</p>

            <p>Hi JairOV,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I've installed the OneTastic add-on and tried messing around with the custom styles and everything else. While they are nice for saving particular formatting so that it is easy to set selections to that same formatting, they don't seem
 to do anything for preventing me from having to manually update each time I want to tab in to or tab out of a list level. If I am missing something, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

    <title>InfoPath form customizations for Sharepoint Online List not saving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            InfoPath form customizations for Sharepoint Online List  not saving</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was given access to create pages/lists on our SharePoint 2013 site. I have created a custom list and custom columns via SharePoint Online. I then went to customize the form via the List Ribbon -&gt; Customize Form which opens my desktop InfoPath 2013 Designer.
 I make design only formatting changes and submit form (I have saved and submitted and tried quick submit). Once the form submits none of the changes save. If I make a change to a field (such as name or control type), that change will save and update in both
 the list and the entry form. However, any formatting changes to the form do not save (font, color, pictures, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few notes:</p>
<p>1) When I go to list settings-&gt; form settings-&gt; the ONLY option available is "Customize the current form using Microsoft InfoPath"</p>
<p>2) I get the following communication error each time after I submit a form change (keep in mind field attribute changes will save but not form formatting changes): "The Web service request could not be authenticated."</p>
<p>3) I have tried creating the form list first and once that is saved to the site, it reverts back to the standard form settings and I cannot make changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advanced.</p>

<span>Hi ASmithOCM,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I tested by customizing the form in InfoPath. I created a list in SharePoint online and then clicked
<strong>List</strong>&gt;<strong>Customize in InfoPath </strong>on the ribbon. Once the form was opened in InfoPath, I made some changes, like inserting picture, changing font size, font color and all these changes appeared in list form.</span></p>

<p>As far as I'm aware the latest and correct version of QT for your phone is 4.7.3. 4.8 is intended for Symbian Belle phones. The chances of any new releases for S60 5th edition phones are slim to none.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows mobile 6.5&#58; How to uninstall preloaded youtube app&#63;</h2>
                    My 3G Tmobile dash came preloaded with a YouTube app. Phone's for work and don't want / shouldn't have this access. How do I uninstall? It's easy for 3rd party apps but I've done a fair amount of research and can't knock out anything native.
<br />
<br />
<p>Is there a special uninstall app I can purchase or some other way to remove this? I'm not a developer or anything, just fyi.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
PS - If this isn't the right forum, please let me know what is!

            There really is no easy way to remove pre-installed applications on a windows phone because these applications are written into ROM memory, which is accessible to the normal user.<br />
<br />
However, you can delete the shortcut that is found on the programs page.&nbsp; The software will still be on the device, buy you won't see it in the list of installed applications.&nbsp; To delete the shortcut, use the File Explorer application to navigate to \windows\start
 menu.&nbsp; Then scroll down to find the link for the YouTube application and delete it.

            Normally, when you open an e-mail attachment, Word creates a read-only copy to which you can't save changes, so saving would trigger a prompt that asks you to give the file a new name. If you did that, look for that new file, which should contain all the
 changes you made.

</p><p>I'm afraid I did not click save as and save it as a new name. I had clicked enable editing to the document when I first opened it and was working of it from there. I then had only been clicking the small save icon instead as I thought that would be saving
 the document however I now can't find the saved document any where. Is there any way to recover this?&nbsp;</p>

            No it's not a fault with the phone.<br />

As the thread starter says 'Unsigned', you need to sign it in order to install it on your N95.

            Hi abbashid<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you are about 3 weeks too late as processes have changed at Symbian Signed and only Samir can now sign RotateMe using Open Signed Online as it uses UIDs in the protected range.

            I believe that the only way we will now get rotate me is if it becomes a signed release(This could take ages by all accounts) or if Samir changes to a non protected UID so that we are able to self sign.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong here.<br />

            Maybe.<br />
<br />
It depends entirely on how you bought Office and exactly what you bought.<br />
<br />
If you bought a factory installed and activated copy, an "OEM" license, or a "MLK", Medialess Kit, then NO. They are only good on the first computer they are installed on. Cannot be transferred to new machines.<br />
<br />
If you bought the big-ugly-yellow-plastic-box CD holder version, or an online download of a "FPP" / "Retail" license, then YES.&nbsp; The FPP license allows you to install on two machines at the same time AND to transfer those installations to new machines as required.<br />
<br />
So, you will have to go through the paperwork that came with the old computer to try and figure out what type of license you have.&nbsp; One shortcut you can use is go into the Office button &gt; Word Options button &gt; Resources option &gt; About button.&nbsp; In the middle
 of the dialog box, look at the "Product ID" field. if the second group of letters is "OEM", well then you are out of luck because you have an OEM license. But that is the only clue the MS gives us to license type.&nbsp; I keep suggesting MS add a display field
 to the help dialog to show the license type. Maybe they will add it in 10 years or so.<br />

<p>Does the Jambox use Bluetooth? If it does please ensure your laptop has Built in Bluetooth adapter, if it doesn't you could use a USB Bluetooth adapter.
</p>

    <title>Change default page colour in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaymondo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change default page colour in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>I'm <strong>trying</strong> to help a friend out by changing the default page colour of Word 2013 as they find it easier to read text when its on a shade of blue background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The posts I've read say to change the Normal.dotm file to have the page colour set to the desired colour and to save. This
<strong>should</strong> then make any new documents based on the default template the desired colour. For some reason, I cannot get this to work. Any other change I make such as font, font size, paragraph changes ... these all save correctly, and work correctly.
 The page colour change doesn't stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, I thought of creating a macro to change the page colour when the document opens. So I created the macro, tested, then added to Normal.dotm template. As a debug, I added a messagebox to check the macro started when a document was created
 or opened. The messagebox appeared, but the page colour wouldn't change. I changed the macro to use hardcoded RGB values instead of the theme colour. Again, this didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the macro can only change the page colour once the page colour has been changed via the Design tab then the page colour menu. Once the page colour has been changed through this usual route, the macro then works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to set the default page colour to a shade of blue, or why the macro wont change the page colour until its changed through the tab menu?</p>

</p><p>Hi Mrs. Richardson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I already have that option checked (tried with and without).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further testing ... </p>
<p>Using the macro to change the page colour, if I go to Design &gt; Page Colour, I can see that the current page colour is set to blue (the shade of blue has a highlighted box around it) but the actual page colour is still white. It's not until I manually set
 the page colour that it changes. After the manual change of page colour, the macro works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost like the page colours are loaded (or accessible by code) until clicked on.</p>

</p><p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oops, forgot that bit. Fortunately, I've used the same code as you have provided (using a blue colour). There aren't any other macros either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said above, the macro runs and I can see from the colour picker that the colour I have chosen is actually selected, it just doesn't turn the page that colour, it remains white. The only way I can change the page colour is by using the mouse and clicking
 on the colour. After this point the macro works fine ... meaning if I change the page colour back to white after clicking on the blue, I can then change the page blue using the macro.</p>

            <p>This is a bit of a mystery. If you add the options to display and print background colors and images, does that improve things at all? For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub SetPageColorOnCurrentDoc()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(255, 255, 0)&nbsp; 'yellow color<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.Solid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.View.DisplayBackgrounds = True<br />

            <p>Hi all. I hope the thread is not already dead. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that this problem exists. I am using Word 2013 and have set a macro that turns the background color to gray. It makes it easier on the eyes when grading papers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that, initially, the macro works, but then the behavior described by Jaymondo occurs. If you delete the macro and make a new one, then it will work again, until I change document.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Jaymondo, I also see that the appropriate color has been selected correctly in the picker; it just refuses to show on the page. As soon as I click on it, the page color turns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to replicate this easily by building the macro, closing the active document, opening a new document and trying to apply the macro again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrea</p>

            <p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is the code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Gray()<br />
'<br />
' Gray Macro<br />
'<br />
'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.ForeColor.ObjectThemeColor = _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wdThemeColorBackground1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.ForeColor.TintAndShade = -0.25<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.Visible = msoTrue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.Solid<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, the other macro I set up to return the document to white always works. Here it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub UnGray()<br />
'<br />
' UnGray Macro<br />
'<br />
'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.Visible = msoFalse<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First of all, you should verify that the options to display and print background colors and images are enabled in Word Options (File | Options | Display: "Print background colors and images"&nbsp;and File | Options | Advanced: "Show background colors and images
 in Print Layout view").</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, try using a numeric constant, as follows (12 instead of wdThemeColorBackground1), which really shouldn't be necessary, of course...</p>
<p><br />
Sub AddGrayBackgroundColor()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.ForeColor. _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ObjectThemeColor = 12<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.ForeColor.TintAndShade = -0.25<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Background.Fill.Solid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.ScreenRefresh<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that I also added Application.ScreenRefresh at the bottom. </p>
