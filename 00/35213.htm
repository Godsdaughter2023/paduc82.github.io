<h2>            HP Solution Center Software</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Deskjet F4280 All-in-one printer.</p>
<p>I want to use the HP Solution Center software when I scan documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new computer with Windows 10.</p>
<p>My printer is installed on this new computer.</p>
<p>How ever the HP Solution Center software is not on the new computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP said "to find the HP Solution Center Software go to Windows.</p>
<p>Installs with the HP full feature Windows Driver for multifunctional printers.
</p>
<p>Search for Solution Center to find and open software."</p>
<p>I have done my best to find this on the Windows web site and do not see it.</p>
<p>I only want to use the HP Solution Center when I scan documents on my HP Deskjet F4280 All-in-One printer.
</p>
<p>I need to download the software do you know the Windows download name for this?</p>
<p>

<h2>            The Known Outlaws are looking for YOU&#33;</h2>
                    

<div><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Known Outlaws are looking for you!</span></span></strong></div>
<p><br />
<br />
We are looking for 4 Reach 5 Black Ops gamers who are competitive, have fun and love to win matches. We are an elite clan. Unlike some clans we have strategy and call outs. We are&nbsp;The Known Outlaws(KO). We have real teams who work hard to be where they are
 today. KO is about being a part of something bigger then yourself. Your voice, hard work, and dedication will not go unnoticed. Possibly even rewarded on your dedication to the clan. KO has been around for 6 years and has 20+ members. We are looking for spots
 to be filled in Reach, Black Ops, and Home Front at this time.<br />
<br />
Fun Nights:<br />
<br />
Some clans don’t have this where everyone gets together on the same game and plays. Oh do we play as a team, wreck havoc on maps, cause people on the other team to quit cause they fear us, and we have people challenge our strength. But KO also has fun, relaxed
 nature and over all enjoy each others company. We do not go by kills or who won us the match. We simply win for KO. Strats go out the window on a game night. Unless we are provoked by randoms then we hit them hard and win. We do not go by KD. We go by attitude,
 and how much you really want to be in a really awesome elite clan. You are stronger together than alone. If you are tired of rage quitting and team members quitting when you may have been able to win the match. Then come and give KO a try, we have structure,
 and we move as a unit. We also have many strong members in our clan who you will meet and simply enjoy the atmosphere that KO offers.<br />
<br />
Here in KO, we know everyone has weaknesses but here are KO we work with you to make those weaknesses strengths. To help with this we have one on ones to help you become stronger and better. We do not judge, we help each other succeed in the clan. KO trains
 and works hard to become better.<br />
<br />
If interested please contact KO Tatsuke300 who is the recruit and captain in KO. They will direct you and try you out for KO material. The trial lasts up to ten days, this is mainly for attitude towards others and to see what you have in skill. Skill may place
 you on a team, which help us crush other clans and get us to victory. Looking forward to meeting a lot of you on the battle field!</p>

Do you have what it takes to become apart of something bigger then yourself?</div>

<p><span><span>Hi Rickdm,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This error occurs when you have a USB device or USB port problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to remove the speakers, restart the computer and check what happens.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it is possible, try plugging a different sound device into the computer. Try a different pair of speakers to make sure
 that the problem is not related to the sound device. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Determine whether you can hear sound. If you can hear sound, there is a problem with the sound device.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This may also happen if the usb port is damaged, try with a different usb port. If still not working, then contact manufacturer
 since it is a hardware issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

<h2>            How do I remove an unwanted Windows Vista download from the Hard Drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I've been there into the Command Prompt section and I'm very leery of doing anything there, but I did try some of the options suggested by the person who posted the information below. I'm probably not understanding how to type the commands in because
 the system tells me so, besides it's the first time I've tried anything like this. What I would like to do is get rid of the Windows.Old system that somehow got loaded in and became the (default) first boot option. I have the Windows Vista Home Premium Disc
 that was the main operating system on this computer, but I can't access it the way the system is operating, By the way, both downloaded systems are in the Command prompt, but I just can't understand the process of how to get rid of the unwanted one. Wanted
 to post some pictures of rhe Command Prompt screen, but system somehow was not accepting my JPEG photos? Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. I've added some notes below. Hope some one can understand my frustration with
 this issue!</p>

 I can't sign into it. I have the Windows Vista Install Disk and get in that way. I chose it by mistake, and it was put in there inadvertantly in error, and I'd like to remove it. [So in reading this over, I think I should also mention that when the system
 boots, the drivers for some reason &nbsp;are marked or assigned Windows.Old drivers.]&nbsp;My dilemma is, " if I delete that entry, and I think I now have a better grasp as to how that's done, will I be able to recover or get back to the operating Windows Vista that
 was their before all this happened. For example, load the Install Disk and do a repair to get that same system that was there prior to when all this occurred and sign in to that Windows program that has an account and password that I created before all this
 happened. I mean I've looked at that disk, it's a WD 250 GB disk and it has 139 GB's of used space and about 79 GB's of unused space, so everything is still on the disk. Lots of Documents, Programs, Pictures, Movies etc. That's what I'd like to get it back
 to, if it's at all possible. I'm no Techie people so bare with me on this, I just hope you get an understanding as to what I'm trying to say and do. There's only the one hard drive in this computer, so in the Command Prompt there's the Boot Mgr and (default)
 Windows.Old. Any help and guidance would be greatly appreciated, thanks Roy.</p>

            So, thanks for responding to my questions, but I think I'm not explaining my issue correctly. I'll try again. So what I'm trying to do is recover whats on that Disk. I, for however it was accomplished, really don't know how I did it, and by mistake, installed
 that Windows.Old in the Boot Menu and thats what comes up to sign into when Windows Vista boots, and gets you to the sign in screen. So when I try to sign into this windows program it does not recognize the account nor the password because it was never created
 for this program. Further more, if and it asks, if you want to change the password, I cannot because I never made a disk with the password, so that doesn't work. So the question that I want answered is, if I remove this Windows.Old from the Boot Logger in
 the Boot Menu, will I be able to reload Windows from the Windows Boot disk? So if I do a download of Windows Vista Home Premium (Repair, Fix, whatever) and I'm hoping that it would work, is it possible to reclaim my operating system

<p>As for the third part of of your reply. I cannot acces the computer or drive in that manner.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Boot into Windows Vista</li><li>Log in with an administrator account</li><li>Open up an elevated command prompt</li><li>Type <code>bcdedit /export c:\bcdbackup</code> and press </li></ol>
<p>This will create a file named <em>bcdbackup</em> on your C disk. Note that there is no file extension in the file name. No file extension is needed here. You can change this location or the name of the file if you like, but having it stored on the root of

<ul>
<li>Enter <code>bcdedit</code> and press </li><li>Enter <code>bcdedit /v</code> and press By using the V switch the list will give you the UUIDs</li></ul>
<p>You need to use the V switch to see the UUIDs for the different operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you see any entry for Windows.old on the right side of the <em>description</em> headline? If so, then you need to delete it. And to delete it, you need to know its identifier.</p>
<p>The identifier is the UUID number you see on the right side of the <em><strong>identifier</strong></em> headline, including the braces. Braces are the curly brackets at the start and the end of the number.</p>

<p>Depending on how many operating systems you have installed, this could take anywhere from 4 minutes to 15 minutes. Just let it do its thing, you will see a confirmation message when it's done.</p>
<p>When you see the confirmation message, type <code>bcdedit /v</code> again and press . Make sure that there is no entry for Windows.old.</p>

            Sorry that I haven't been here in a while, but I'm quite fed up with trying to recover this disk and just wanted to do other things to get me away from this for a while. I did try some YouTube suggestions, resettig passwords, and others, etc, etc....................to
 no avail. So Smittychat, in what you're suggesting, does that mean that I'll lose whatever is on that Disk? OK, so I realize why the backup is the first thing that's done, but here is my problem. &nbsp;1. The Computer came with Windows XP Home pre-installed, have
 no idea where disk might be, thought I created Recovory Disks, but they don't seem to work and could be they're for the other Gateway computer, which is working just fine, or if Gateway can help or whatever. &nbsp; 2. Have lost or misplaced Producy Key for Windows
 Vista Home Premium, no help from Microsoft Support, (real live human support on phone)????????????, don't know where I saved it to, or if I wrote it down and have lost it. Quite unusual, because I'm very vigilan

    <title>Can&#39;t Restore System back to pre-Scam date - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielcashman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Restore System back to pre-Scam date</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. My HP pavilion desktop got scammed a week ago (my fault, of course) and I want to restore it back to a date prior to the scam. I've tried all the anti-malware products recommended by Microsoft, and I've deleted thescammer's software, as far as I
 can tell. Still have some problems, as in I can't change my user account log on password -
<strong>error code 0x8007042c</strong>. Windows 8.1 will not allow me to choose a restore date prior to scam. When I try, it shows me a single event as a restore point, and that event (deletion of scam software) happened after the scam. No other restore points
 that I can find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way around this? I really hope I don't have to reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>You posted under Windows RT but Windows RT doesn't have System Restore (RT tablets don't have System Restore because they can use "PC Refresh").&nbsp; Since you definitely don't have Windows RT, I'll move your conversation to the forum where it will be better
 served. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your issue, the best I can recommend is actually the same:&nbsp; PC Refresh.&nbsp; This process will not remove any of your files or settings.&nbsp; When you run it, the all your personal files and settings will be kept and any Windows source files will be restored.&nbsp;
 When it's done you will have to reinstall any desktop-mode programs that didn't originally come with your computer (any programs you added yourself, you'll have to add again with the CD or download you used the first time).</p>

            Thank you, Shawn. I found my way to a way to restore my system to a date prior to deleting the scam software (see my initial note). How much earlier would the new restore date be, one day or longer? I'd need to restore it to a week ago at least, to get
 rid of any residual scammer software. Thanks very much. BTW, my desktop came with Windows 8 and was upgraded to 8.1 via Windows updates process.

            Doesn't necessarily need to be any stretch as long as it was before the software was installed.&nbsp; A minute earlier or a week earlier won't matter as far as the snapshot comes.&nbsp; You can always try a few too: system restore can be "undone" if you don't like
 the results or want to try another date.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not say how far the scam went.</p>
<p>Did you give them Remote access?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advice we give.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are the only one who knows if you have given them Remote Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</p>
<p>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only way that you will know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Microsoft does not contact you, unless YOU have made prior arrangements with them to do so.</p>
<p>There is a section in the link I&nbsp;am supplying you&nbsp;about this at the end of it</p>

<h2>            Rise of Nations</h2>
                    I have XP Home Premium in a Dell GX620/Pentium4-3.2GHz w/3GB RAM. My monitor is 1440x900 native resolution.When I try to play Rise of Nations&nbsp;I cannot get a resolution higher than 1024x768x32. I have upgraded the video card to Nvidia GeForce 9500GT 1GB
 with no change in resolution. Is there anything that can be done to improve the resolution to 1440x900x32?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for posting to the Microsoft Answers forum.&nbsp; First thing is to make sure your drivers are up to date and you have all the patches\updates for the game.&nbsp; This link is to the RoN download page:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/riseofnations/downloads.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/games/riseofnations/downloads.aspx</a>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; While researching this question I found out that the parameters for the game are&nbsp;set&nbsp;during the initial install based on your hardware.&nbsp; It did not appear to indicate that you can have the game re-check your PC to reset the parameters.&nbsp; This link has some
 good information about how to change the settings files. <a href="http://ron.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/display.cgi?action=ct&amp;f=13,4539,,10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://ron.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/display.cgi?action=ct&amp;f=13,4539,,10</a>&nbsp; Of course you need to make a backup of any files before you change them.&nbsp; If you are not comfortable making changes to files then I would suggest you save your game files and
 then uninstall\reinstall the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also this link may help you find more specific information about Rise of Nations:

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I would suggest that you first check windows update to see if all ypur drivers fo your system are updated to the latest versions available.If none are being offered for your system, navigate to your graphics card manufacturer's website to check and see if
 your are running the latest version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If there are newer versions of the drivers installed being offered, download and install them and that should solve your issue unless if your graphics card is simply not capable of running your desired application.</p>
<p>Good&nbsp; Luck.</p>

    <title>Asus Taichi21 Upgrade to Fall Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Asus Taichi21 Upgrade to Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus Taichi21 running Creator's Update. I keep getting prompted to upgrade to Fall Creators Update because my existing version will no longer be supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot upgrade to Fall Creators Update because I get an error with ACPI.sys and I keep getting reverting back to Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a fresh install of Fall Creators Update and determined that there is a conflict with the Intel HD 4000 driver. As long as I do not install the Intel HD 4000 driver, my laptop runs fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me find a work around? Either I need to find a way to make the Intel HD 4000 driver work or not be prompted to upgrade to Fall Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either is fine. I'm quite happy with Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Thank you. My ASUS Taichi will run the latest version of Windows 10 again. I was running 1703 and despite my disabling specific update, I was getting prompted to upgrade to 1709. The update failed each time but I had to endure the 20-25 minutes each time
 for the process to roll back. The 1803 RC4 I downloaded works great. No more issues with ACPI.sys resulting from the incompatible Intel HD 4000 driver incompatibility. Can't wait for the release now.

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A .CSV file is a comma separated values file and is NOT a video file. Please be careful when opening this as it could be malicious. Normally you would open a .CSV file using Excel. If you are
<em>definitely</em> sure it's a video file (some people rename the extension to make it allowable to be sent) then you can save it as a movie extension eg. &nbsp;movie.csv san be saved as movie.mov or movie.mp4 or movie.wmv</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Silver members use Internet Explorer, Netflix, and similar apps&#63;</h2>
                    The #XboxReveal today didn't mention anything about the restrictions placed on non-paying Xbox Live members (read: Silver members) Currently on the Xbox 360 Silver members can't access anything from the Internet outside of ads and content available to
 buy in the MarketPlace. If you want to use any app that connects to the Internet you are required to pay for an Xbox Live Gold membership (MSRP $60 US) This makes no sense. This is the most important issue for me in deciding if I will buy an Xbox One. I cannot
 and will not support a platform that charges a toll for accessing the Internet. Please, Microsoft, quit with these arbitrary limitations that feel like people are being scammed into paying for Live when they dont use the features that make Xbox Live a service
 worth paying for.

            No. My decision is based on principle. I cannot support a console that requires a toll be paid to access anything on the Internet. Internet explorer and Netflix are simply examples of the types of services that should not be behind a Paywall. I will be
 getting "next-gen" consoles, but the Xbox One will not be one of them if Microsoft is going to continue to use this unethical business model.

<p>So wait you're saying its wrong for him to make a choice based on what features come with the money he's paying initially for the console and don't require further purchases ?</p>
<p>If I bought a car and found I had to buy wheels and seats separate I'd be a little annoyed. If one company is saying buy from us and get this with it for no extra cost and the other is selling for the same price and then selling the extra as well separately
 I don't know many people who would buy both individually for more.</p>

<p>Presently nothing is set in stone but the talk is for multiple levels for PSN membership maybe three. At present PSN has two levels with the upper one giving you games and a few other bits. So no its probably not going to be a mandatory thing.</p>

<p>Presently nothing is set in stone but the talk is for multiple levels for PSN membership maybe three. At present PSN has two levels with the upper one giving you games and a few other bits. <strong>So no its probably not going to be a mandatory thing.</strong></p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Similar to how the XBL membership isn't mandatory either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Except how you know most of the functions do work so well and games lose 50% of their content or in some cases 100% of it if you don't pay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I meant was Expect Sony to offer enough at the standard level to make people like it and offer more stuff with higher levels.</p>
<p>And easy one would be</p>
<p>Basic - access to all main apps, patches and online along with in game chat and party chat</p>
<p>Gold - Early access to demos, extra deals, part of purchases refunded to you, ability to play some games free that Sony gives to you</p>
<p>Platinum -Same as gold but access to the Sony editing suite and sharing system to allow you to share gameplay and easily make youtube video then also monetise them along with a higher % of your purchases back and maybe the ability to disable any potential
 adverts / promotional content normally shown, if it is shown&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't see Sony totally getting rid of free online multiplayer and making a pay only feature.</p>
<p>They have done a great job with PS+ by actually giving players rewards for their membership.
</p>
<p>That doesn't mean there won't be some changes, but I can nearly guarantee that I won't need a paid subscription to browse the web or use Netflix (and similar apps).</p>
<p>You can't do much else other than play single player games on an Xbox 360 unless you pay for Xbox Live. It may not be mandatory in general, but 80% of the systems functionality is locked behind that Paywall.

<h2>            unable to start XP from disk to repair system files</h2>
                    Computer fine last nite, switch on this morning and system files missing or corrupt.&nbsp; came on microsoft support, changed Boot Drive priority to CD-ROM drive but now get "Disk boot failure, insert system disk and press enter"<br />
<br />
have tried both disk drives, one nothing happens, the other disk drive looks to be loading then message appears again saying failure<br />
<br />
not sure what else to do as without the set-up menu I cant obviously continue to repair the system files<br />

            <p>you want to run checkdisk first and not do a repair install for several reasons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. your installation cd is probably at sp2, and you are/or should be at sp3. this will screw up lots of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. you also do not want to run the recovery console from an sp2 disk either for the same reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>burn a cd with Hiren's boot cd, from a working pc and insure that it will boot.</p>
<p>then run chkdsk c: /r&nbsp; over and over until no errors are found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Courtesy of Jose Ibarra:</p>
<p><b><u>Anywho, to make a Hiren's boot CD, do this:<br />
</u></b><br />
I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB drive).<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD, does not care about your Administrator passwords and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with
 that.<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
You can also easily copy your personal data (documents, images, music.) to an external drive.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the
 bottom of the page, do not click on any ads).<br />
<br />
<br />
Unzip the Hiren's to some folder where you can find it.&nbsp; There is a Hiren's.BootCD..<b>iso
</b>in there that you are going to need next.<br />
<br />
Hiren's has instructions to make a bootable USB that you can use, but it requires you to first burn the .iso to a CD and some other steps, so I suggest another way...<br />
<br />
Download RUFUS 1.20 from here (read some stuff on the page so you can know more about it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a><br />
<br />
I will caution you to be careful that you don't accidentally format any of your hard drives - be sure your USB stick is in and know what the drive letter is!&nbsp; This part always makes me a little nervous,
 so be careful.<br />
<br />
Launch RUFUS and all the defaults should be okay, for the Device, choose your USB drive letter, Quick format, FAT32, label it if you want to and in the Format options box, click the little icon that looks like a CD and a window will open.&nbsp; Navigate that dialogue
 to point to the folder that contains the Hiren's.BootCD.15.<b>iso </b>that you unzipped earlier and the box should change to say ISO image (RUFUS understands the Hiren's ISO file).<br />
<br />
Double check you have the right Device selected in the top (NOT you HDD) Click Start, acknowledge the warning and let it finish (it will take a little while) as it copies the files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hiren's ISO is also good size.<br />
<br />
When RUFUS is done, it will say 'DONE' in the bottom.<br />
<br />
Put the USB stick in the afflicted machine and reset/reboot and press whatever key you need to press to get to a boot menu where you can select the USB as the first boot device (that is F11 for me).&nbsp; If you don't see a boot menu choice, you will have to adjust
 your BIOS to boot from the USB first instead of the HDD.<br />
<br />
When the Hiren's menu comes up, choose the Mini XP Mode and it will start loading (slowly from a USB drive) and eventually you should see a Windowsy looking desktop.&nbsp; You should recognize that part and feel comfortable, but it is not your desktop - it is the
 Hiren's desktop!<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop</p>

<p>How much longer will it be until the Friends Tab is released for Home on Xbox One? They gave us the preview a month and a half ago when they were showcasing the Xbox One August Update. How much longer will it be, I'm ready to have this convenient feature
 already!</p>

<p>I'm not a part of this "preview program" some peps are talking about. I saw on Xbox's YouTube a video saying the September Update is already out! I logged on my Xbox 1 since it's Friday evening for me, and their was a Console Update. Just finished it, but
 I don't see the extra Friends pane on the main Dashboard Screen. It's just Pins, Home, and Store. Media Player works well viewed pics from my USB yay Xbox 1 is doing more.... things which Xbox 360 can do.

    <title>HP OfficeJet 6600 - Wireless Scanning - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HP OfficeJet 6600 - Wireless Scanning</h2>
                    I recently purchased an HP OfficeJet 6600, and am running Windows 8 Professional.&nbsp; I have contacted HP Support, they were unable to help, and recommended contacting Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I have my printer connected to my wireless network.&nbsp; My Windows 7 PC can both print and scan, but my Windows 8 PC can only print.&nbsp; When I try to access the scan to computer functionality, it tells me that Scan to Computer is unavailable, because it "Cannot
 connect to the printer."&nbsp; I have tried the following steps (many reboots of both the PC and printer involved in the following steps):<br />
<br />
- Update the software on both the PC and the printer to the latest versions<br />
- Disable the firewall (Windows Firewall)<br />
- Reinstall the drivers<br />
- Run the HP Print and Scan Doctor tool (couldn't resolve the issue)<br />
<br />
It seems the only additional information HP discovered during my support call was that the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) service reports that it is running, and shouldn't be causing any issues.<br />
<br />
I looked at the Microsoft FixIt tools, but they don't appear to be available for Windows 8 yet.&nbsp; Any advice is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Did you download the windows 8 scanning software for the printer-scanner? that must be installed. Then--this is important-- the scanner must be connected to the wireless
<b>router</b> either wirelessly or with an ethernet cable, not connected to another computer on the network. You can share printers connected to another computer on the network, but not a scanner. Scanners must be connected directly to a computer to scan or
 &nbsp;a wireless printer connected to the network router. You might have a wireless printer but it is just a shared printer if it is connected to another computer.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>HP will have the directions for connecting the printer to the router.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT-- Your model scanner is not a wireless network printer-scanner. To scan you'll have to connect directly to the new computer.</div>

            As stated in the original post, yes I have installed the Windows 8 software and have it connected to my wireless network, not another computer. And yes, this model does support wireless scanning, as evidenced in both the manual and my ability to scan using
 my Windows 7 PC without a direct connection.

            Sorry--I look at the specs quickly and said it had no ethernet connector. If it works on the win 7 computer it should work on the win 8. Try installing the printer all in one on the new computer again from scratch--remove it and reinstall. Is File and
 Printer sharing set up on the new computer? How about setting up a Homegroup or joining the win 7's homegroup? That usually makes it easier to share. Type Sharing in the Search Charm and search in settings. Pick Share Printers-- that is a well hidden setting
 in win 8 that might have something to do with this.
<div>That's all I can think of. I have a wireless printer scanner on my network with win 7 and 8 computers and had no trouble setting up printing and scanning, so it does work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try HP Support again. Maybe someone else would know more. Good luck.</div>

            I have tried uninstalling completely, rebooting and reinstalling. Sharing from the Windows 7 PC isn't what I'm interested in, as it's only the scan function that I'm unable to get to work, and it also happens to be a laptop. &nbsp;As a side note, I did have
 homegroup sharing setup and working for my previous non-networked printer.
<div><br />
<div>I may try HP support again, but am hoping someone else here may have run into the same issue, or may have any other ideas of what's happening.</div>

    <title>Problem with change touch pad mouse wheel setting on Sony VAIO - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruirui666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with change touch pad mouse wheel setting on Sony VAIO</h2>
                    I have a very minor question, but it's annoying nonetheless. On my recently bought Sony VAIO, the touch pad mouse wheel would only scroll (vertically) one line at a time. I tried to change it to five (in control panel under mouse), but every time the computer
 goes to sleep and I start it again, the wheel goes back to the 1 line scrolling. Other things are perfectly functional, but this one bit is very frustrating, and makes viewing webpages and anything else very tedious. Hope someone can help! Thanks&nbsp;

<br />
The&nbsp;sound works, but the only problem is the&nbsp; "Loudness Equalization" does not work properly like before, additionally&nbsp;it has no "Short or Long" settings. Now it pops up saying that Enhancements causes problem and must disable it.</p>

            <p>FINALLY! HOURS AND HOURS OF SLAMMING KEYBOARD... I found a way to stop that god forsaken VIA HD Audio from replacing your working audio driver-- for me, at least.<br />
<br />
To begin with, windows will always attempt to update and&nbsp;install new drivers, recently there's some words roaming about Windows 10 Audio not working or something, I guess VIA HD Audio is made to replace it?<br />
<br />
So to fix it, simply refer to this: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/&nbsp;or from this quote to disable windows from automatically installing new driver:</a><br />
OR refer to this quote which is taken from the link (in case the link is down or whatsoever preventing you from opening the website page:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Open the Control Panel by right-clicking the Start button and selecting Control Panel. Navigate to System and Security &gt; System &gt; Advanced system settings. Click the Hardware tab, click Device Installation Settings, and select the “No, let me choose what
 to do option. Select “Never install driver software from Windows Update.”" </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Now to uninstall VIA HD Audio Device, Right click Start &gt; Device Manager &gt;&nbsp;Expand&nbsp;"Sound, video and game controllers" and look for VIA HD&nbsp;Audio, double click it to bring up properties &gt; Switch to Drivers Tab &gt; Uninstall &gt; Tick/Check/Mark uninstall/delete
 software device &gt; OK. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit2: (Untested, testing...) Now to really stop it from updating, you need to download
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/wushowhide.diagcab</a>. It's a troubleshooter gotten from Microsoft that “hide” them, preventing Windows from automatically installing them.
</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally to reinstall High Definition Audio Device driver (for me, not sure about other users), return back to Device Manager &gt;&nbsp;Action button &gt; Scan for hardware changes... and it will install the driver.
</li></ul>
<p>As a warning, disabling the option to automatically installing recommended drivers....... wait, I'm not sure if disabling that is a bad idea, but it's causing problem either way.<br />
<br />
If problem persists, just re-enable automatic driver update, uninstall the audio driver, and re-scan hardware changes. Apparently that will install recommended audio driver like before.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
<em><del>EDIT: The god forsaken windows will still attempt to update your driver even automatic driver update is disabled. This happens if you put your PC to sleep, boot, restart, etc... God damn it. I need to further test this.</del></em><br />

 make the Selphy 910 work is to network it to my wifes computer running Windows 7 (64bit).&nbsp; I'm definitely going to get a MAC. I'm tired of Microsoft and all of their problems.&nbsp; And I hate it when MAJOR MFG won't even help.&nbsp; Please help. You can email me at
 "Remove PII"&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much

            <p>Thank you for your quick reply.&nbsp; The steps you suggested did not work. Canon is telling me that my antivirus software is blocking the driver?? I turned off "Windows Defender" and firewall but that did no good,&nbsp; They than sent this:</p>
Blocked Ports and Programs
<p>In some cases, third-party security or firewall software may be blocking or restricting port traffic or programs causing unexpected results such as inability to install or loss of functionality. Check with the software manufacturer for information on unblocking
 ports or adding exceptions for specific programs.</p>
<p>The following are ports and programs necessary for your printer to function properly.</p>
<p><strong>Ports</strong></p>
<p>TCP 80</p>
<p>TCP / UDP 8611</p>
<p>TCP / UDP 8612</p>
<p>TCP / UDP 8613</p>
<p>UDP 3702 - (Windows 7 / Windows Vista)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell software engineer said it isn't my anti-virus program or Firewall.&nbsp; At this point I don't know who to believe or what to do.&nbsp; THANKS FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND HELP</p>

            I don't have the printer driver on my laptop. That is the reason for my question in the first place.&nbsp; THE CANON SELPHY 910 DRIVER WILL NOT INSTALL ON MY WINDOWS 8.1 LAPTOP NO MATTER WHAT I DO. I've tried all of the aforementioned suggestions and none of
 them work. The "idiots" I've had from Canon printer support know less about computers than I do and have done everything in their power to "blame the issue" on someone else.&nbsp; If I had the driver installed on my computer I could do what you suggest.&nbsp; It seems
 to me that someone out in the "world" would have had this problem ( or maybe they were smart enough to stay away from Windows 8.1) and know a DEFINITE solution for it.&nbsp; I'm pretty amazed that this hasn't occurred with others.

<h2>            Cannot map NAS drives using WiFi - only Ethernet works</h2>
                    <p><font color="#000000">I am having trouble mapping shared drives on my NAS using WiFi. I have three new Acer i5-4th Gen laptops running Windows 8 with Intel 7260-N WiFi cards. My NAS
 is also new. It is a Zyxel NSA325, replacing a WD MyBookWorld. The hard drives from two such WD boxes went into the Zyxel. So I do not have another NAS on hand. My router is unchanged. It is a Netgear WNDR3700v1 pre-MIMO dual-band N-router.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">One of the new Acers is a (wonderful) V7-482PG-6662 (sourced from Canada). The other two laptops are M5-583P-6428 machines. The V7 never had a problem with connections.
 Both M5’s had troubles at first. Then I got one to work. But the second M5 stubbornly only connects via Ethernet.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I also have an old Win-7 Ultimate desktop, that has no problems connecting to the NAS via WiFi. I also have an old WD LIVE TV-Plus that often does not see the NAS
 at first via network shares. But once I log on&nbsp;the NAS from a PC via the web screen, it seems to wake up and the WD can find it via network shares.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">There are two users for the V7. Both have read-write access to the NAS shares. This machine never had a problem seeing the NAS or maintain the shared drive mappings.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">There are two separate users for the two M5 machines. They only have read access to the NAS. But I have tried getting on myself too. I am not using a Homegroup.
 There is only the default WORKGROUP named; no differently named workgroups set up. Under network advanced sharing settings, I would prefer only to have the first, top private network sharing / discovery option enabled, with no other file or public sharing
 activated. I prefer not to use media streaming, twonky, etc. But in the course of this project, I have had these items (homegroup, public sharing, etc) activated.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I can map NAS shared drives on both M5 machines when connected via Ethernet. But originally neither machine would establish a share mapping when using WiFi. I went
 through many, many recommendations from the internet, trying to fix the problem. For example:</font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><font>Make sure that Client for Microsoft Networks is on</font></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><font>Set up and reset Windows Credentials for users</font></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><font>Entered net config server /autodisconnect:-1</font></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><font>Make sure that Network List Service is started on automatic (as well as not on)</font></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><font>Tried using Net Use commands, but got error messages</font></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><font>Went through multiple cycles of closing down all network advanced sharing settings, then uninstalling and reinstalling network adapters via device manager, then opening up all network advanced sharing settings.</font></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><font>Various cycles of rebooting and leaving machines on with the hope that they would connect.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I have not tried any of the advice about reg editing or setting different MTU values. Most of such advice online dates from 2009. And it was not needed to get the
 one M5 machine working.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">After cycling through the items above, the one M5 laptop started listing the NAS occasionally under Network in File Manager. At first this only happened
 in like 1 in 20 reboots. But I started getting luckier. And after one round of closing down shares and reinstalling adapters, it started to work reliably. And has kept working ever since.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">But try as I might to replicate this success, the other M5 laptop still does not allow share mapping on WiFi. The NAS shows under Computer in File
 Manager, as well as as a media device, but clicking on it returns a nothing there message, which is as I expect as I do not have media streaming activated,&nbsp;neither on PCs nor on the NAS. The NAS only shows under Network, and therefore only allows drives to
 be mapped, when the laptop is connected via Ethernet. I&nbsp;tried comparing adapter settings between when using Ethernet and using WiFi (for example, that the same Microsoft LLDP protocols are ticked). I also tried repairing Windows 8 and reloading all Windows
 updates. But I have not thus far gone all the way back to a complete Windows 8 restore to factory conditions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Advice, help please, thanks!</font></p>

            Problem was the internet security software. It flagged all wifi networks as "public". Why this messed up only one of three machines, I do not know. But once all home wifi networks were flagged as "trusted", all went well.

<p>we have done all the troubleshooting methods that Microsoft recommend and let the WUDFHOST through the firewall, i am unable to turn the firewall off or the antivirus as there are time when i do not get onto the machines to change those settings back causeing
 a security leak and potential issues down the line,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have a few that have no issues and some of these changes have helped such as the change in firewall rules allowing the WUDFHost through
</p>
<p>
</p><p>but there are still a lot that disconnect multiple times a lesson.</p>
