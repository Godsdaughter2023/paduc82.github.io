<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter - How to downgrade Firmware Version 1.3.8305 to 1.2.x</h2>
                    <p>MS Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Narrowed down the problem. For some reason, the 1920 * 1080 resolution refresh rate on Wireless Display Adapter is set to 30 Hz</p>
<p>on Firmware&nbsp;1.3.8305, but in firmware 1.2.x the refresh rate is at 59 Hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verified it on another Display Adapter whose firmware is not upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I downgrade the firmware from 1.3.8305 to 1.2.x.?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Vasuki</p>

            <p>Hi Jenith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply and pointers. </p>
<p>The problem is not there when tried to connect from Laptop (Win 10/Win 8.1/Win 7) or Android (5.1.1).</p>
<p>The issue is specific to OnePlus 2 Model. Actually got 3 Adapters on a sale and even my relative who has a similar setup is experiencing the issue only with OnePlus 2, but works fine with laptop or samsung mobile phones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem we see on screen is, when the screen cast is done from OnePlus 2, the TV shows a pixelated view and slow refresh rate, while viewing movies / changing between apps or scrolling the content looks distorted. The screen gets pixelated as if
 the adapter is not able to refresh the content quickly.</p>
<p>

<h2>            I got Ripped Off And Got The Run Around By Xbox Support Agents About My Day One Controller Replacement</h2>
                    
<p>About a month ago I contacted Xbox Support about an issue with my controller, The back of my controller was becoming wiggly and it became hard to play with. I made the replacement order with the agent and planed to ship it out ASAP, It ended up that the
 holidays got in the way and I couldn't ship dealing with family times and what not. After The holidays on&nbsp;<span>Jan 11, 2015 I contacted Xbox Support again about my issue to set up my replacement order again. Here is the&nbsp;transcript for that&nbsp;conversation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>info:</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Please wait for an agent to respond.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">The current average wait time is 2minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">Thank you for your patience.</span><br />

<p>As you can see, He reassured me that I will get the same controller back that I send it. Witch means I thought I would get back my Day One controller. So after I was done talking to Christian I went out and Ship off my Day One controller to an Xbox service
 center. About a week later I get a package in the mail and I was excited to see my new Day One controller I was so proud to show off. I open the box and There was a normal Black controller. I remembered when I first talked to a Xbox support agent she told
 me that if there was a chance that the Day One controller was out of stock, they would call me and let me know and allow me to pick another controller. I received no calls and no emails, no contact at all from no one from the service center or Xbox Support.
 I contact Xbox support again to deal with this issue. &nbsp;transcript for that&nbsp;conversation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Xbox Support Agent tells me she will call me the following day to tell me when I will&nbsp;receive the replacement controller, which is exactly the same edition. I agree to this. The next day no one calls me, but because I messed up my number. So I decided
 to contact Xbox Support give them the service request number and see if they were ready to ship my new controller. Here is that transcript.&nbsp;</p>

 holidays were over I contacted Xbox Support again and spoke with Christian, He said that the replacement order was expired so he would Create a new one for me. I asked him to make sure that I would get My Day One Xbox One controller back for sure. He said
 -"Christian: Yes Nathan. :) Our service center will going to send the same edition of controller that you have Nathan :)"- He didn't say anything about them being out of stock. I remember from the first time I made the replacement order that the agent said
 "If there is a chance the Day one controller is out of stock, we will let you know". The day after talking with Christian I sent out my controller, fast forward a week later, I get a package in the mail and I was excited to see my new Day One Controller only
 to find out I was sent a normal controller and didn't get a call or email stating they were out of stock.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>So no only was I told there was nothing on can do from someone who had the power to do something, I know have to pay for the mistakes that were made and wait till they are restocked of Day One controllers and that's still not 100% going to resolve my issue.
 I worked really hard for that Day One console. The controller is the only thing that shows I got it Day One. I support Microsoft buy trusting them with my money at the beginning of the Xbox One life cycle and this is how they repay me? Just because I got a
 Day One console they don't stay true to their word and replace it? I got lied to a multitude of times with false information. This is unacceptable. All I want it my Day One controller back and not have to wait for ever and still not might get it back.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The only issue here is that when you didn't get what you wanted you became very mean. The world will not end if you don't get your way, try and distance yourself from your feelings of hate in this situation and get some perspective on how this particular
 bit of white ink on your electronic device got you so angry.</p>
<p>The support persons you delt with were not at all misleading, the situation was that their stock ran out and that's not under their control nor are they able to see the future, or frankly able to count how many they have in stock at that very moment (they
 prolly just get a report/webpage that says yes/no for stock etc).</p>
<p>Turns out they didn't have the type of controller you sent to them, that's a bummer, but why accuse someone of being a liar if they are not? Clearly you were and maybe still are upset, so find someone to hug and be happy :)</p>
<p>I have no reason to believe you won't get your controller eventually, other than I'm not sure if they still produce those ones, but in the end you should try and accept that whatever you get back from them is going to have to do. Maybe you can get one of
 the nifty skinned ones like the titanfall one or the others, those are far more interesting than some white text that no one will notice :)</p>
<p>PS: You got an achievement for buying day one, you also got a pretty nifty video game machine also on day one too... it wasn't 'just' a controller.</p>
<p>Keep working! It only took you 3 weeks to afford the console? That's pretty easy stuff, keep at it and you can buy some real great stuff, plus the experience you get from actual work itself.</p>

<p>I know 3 weeks over time doesn't sound like much at first. But back then I was making $10.25 and hours witch is minimum wage in my province I was living on my own and just getting but. I pulled in an extra 80 hours those 3 weeks. Taking people shifts and
 bagging my manager to give me more hours after my time was up. I know it's stupid to fuss over a controller. But when I finally got that console day one I felt more indepentent and happier then I've ever been. That controller is symbolic to that moment. And
 not being able to play with it kinda makes me feel a little sad. I trusted them I would get it back. And I didn't

<h3> thom valk.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Midtown Madness&#58; Chicago Edition doesn&#39;t launch&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of lately I reinstalled Midtown Madness: Chicago Edition on my computer. However, everytime I try to launch it, it does absolutely nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright, so I insert the disc, run the Setup.exe (works perfectly fine), finish the installation, and then try to run it. But nothing happens, the disk isn't being read, the Midtown.exe Launcher doesn't open, nothing happens. I've already tried to run the
 "Incompatibility troubleshoot", but nothing worked there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The disc had minor scratches on it, so I took it in for a quick laser-fix today. Still nothing works, and I'm having the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows 7 64bit Home Premium Service Pack 1 (the game is for Win XP, but worked on my pc before)<br />
Thanks in advance, any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Thom</p>

            I had this problem too. I installed the complete setup, and everything works, until I try to run the game. My computer (which is Vista) does not load the game, it just tells me that the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">executable
 file has stopped working. This is very unusual because I got it to work earlier, but now it does not. It seems as though all of my older games will work, except this one.</span>

<h2>            Windows 7, 32 bit Install on XP Machine Hangs - Expanding Files 27&#37;</h2>
                    
<p>Need help!</p>
<p>I have a Dell XPS 400, Pentium D 3.0Ghz, 4GB memory (recently&nbsp;increased from 2GB)&nbsp;running Windows XP SP3 that I'm trying to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional - 32 bit.&nbsp; Here's what I've done so far:</p>
<p>Ordered and downloaded the Windows ISO file from Microsoft and burned to DVD - no problems.</p>
<p>Have installed several times - all result in hanging in the Expanding Files stage - always at 27%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most recent tries have been with purchased copy of Windows 7 Pro - which I successfully installed on my wife's laptop - (was using Vista Ultimate) - so the DVD copy of Windows 7 Pro should not be the issue.</p>
<p>After a few tries of waiting for 30 min, 1 hour and 2 hours, I tried waiting overnight (7 hours) and still hung at same place - Expanding Files - 27%</p>
<p>See an exerpt below&nbsp;from the setupact.log file from the most recent run.&nbsp; Also from the most recent run, I've disabled almost all system try software, no thumb drives attached, turned off NAS and network printer is off - still the same result.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last
 line at 20.24.47&nbsp;in this log file always appears as the&nbsp;activity before the system hangs.</p>
<p>Appreciate any help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows media player &#40;11&#41; launches but doesn&#39;t play file</h2>
                    When I double-click on an audio file, WMP opens up but then doesn't play the file.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both MP3 and WMA (and almost every other format) files are set to open with WMP by default and video files of various formats still work fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can get audio files to play by right-clicking and selecting 'Open with' - 'WMP'. &nbsp;Drag and dropping files into the now-playing list also doesn't work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running WMP version 11 on XP Pro.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

            Did this just start recently?<br />
If so, what changed?<br />
<br />
Try uninstalling the codec pack, it can cause conflicts playing media files.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists, you may try reinstalling Media Player and test.<br />
<br />
In addition, you can test for a corrupt profile by testing under a new account:<br />

<h2>            Xbox One S and Turtlebeach 800x elite headset not working</h2>
                    I bought the new Xbox one s yesterday and after doing all the updates and installing my games etc. I can not get my 800x elites to produce any sound either for a game or dashboard. The system assigns the headset and it shows its attached but I get no sound
 whatsoever. I've changed the audio setting back and forth but have not had any luck getting this to work. I plug the headset into my old Xbox one and they work fine. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I mainly play with a headset.

<p>You have probably done this but make sure the optical cable is pushed right in. I don't have the s yet but if it's like my ps4 I really need to push hard to get the optical cable to go in.

<p>I have the turtle beach 500x, and I once had an issue like this too when no sound came through the headset. So I googled it. The wireless headset may need to be manually paired with the transmitter. I tried finding a link for you, but it looks like turtle
 beach's website is playing up or I'm getting a security notice from IE. Just google your headset model and write no sound next to it. It should show some links from turtle beaches website support, and you can find the answer... when they get their site working
 properly again. </p>

<p>Hi Gokul,</p>
<p>I am not sure what you are asking me to do here. I am completely aware that A710IS is a compatible camera, and have seen that on the Microsoft website.</p>
<p>My question - shouldnt the camera have installed/recognized without the need for installing drivers, as mentioned in the Windows 7 web site? The fact is that it did not, and that is what i am trying to figure out.</p>
<p>The first link sends me to the generic link for A710IS and i am not sure how that helps regarding the Windows 7's inability to recognize the camera.</p>
<p>The second link is the link not to the driver, but to&nbsp;the driver updater, and this implies that i have the old driver and software CD available, which i dont. This link works only by using the old CD.</p>
<p>My question remains - Why is the Canon A710IS camera not getting recognized automatically? This problem ocurred after I reinstalled Windows 7, and was recognizing earlier just fine.</p>
<p>Is there somewhere in the registry that i can look to fix some entries to fix it? Is there any patch or any download/update from Windows 7 that might address this problem?</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Mahesh</p>

<p>OBTW, if a product is Windows 7 compatible, it doesn't mean it would get detected without installing any drivers! Drivers (software) is the key here..</p>
<p>Bother to read through the FAQs in<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=221&amp;modelid=14117#SupportDetailAct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=221&amp;modelid=14117#SupportDetailAct</a>
 ?? FAQ addresses your query on how to get the cam get detected.</p>
<p>That has all the info. I personally own a Canon cam and had a similar issue. Read through the FAQs and download ZoomBrowser (<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=221&amp;modelid=14117#DownloadDetailAct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=221&amp;modelid=14117#DownloadDetailAct</a>
 ) to view the pics..</p>
<p>There IS NO way the cam would get recognized automatically without any software installed for it!</p>
<p>Ciao</p>

<p>Hiro,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>I called Canon Support, and they categorically told me that they DO NOT have any driver for Windows 7 and it should be auto recognized in Windows 7.</p>
<p>I even asked them what if i were to find an older driver of the camera, install it and then update it - they said that was not possible either.</p>
<p>Their response was that it is part of the Windows 7 architecture that it will recognize all compatible cameras without the need of any drivers to be installed. I also find something missing in the whole picture, but the bottom line - my camera does not get
 recognized.</p>
<p>To top it, I do not have the original CD that came with the camera, so cant even try out the install of the old driver and see if that works. The links that you sent points to an updater file for Zoombrowser and it EXPECTS the original CD or original software
 to be installed so that it can update the Zoombrowser to the next version available, and the one that is certified for Vista/Windows 7.</p>
<p>As an extreme step, I did a completely fresh install of Windows 7 just to make sure that i am not adding any contamination through any downloads, etc. After the fresh install, i updated the latest fixes and patches for Window 7 , and after restart I connected
 my camera. The camera is recognized as a Canon camera, but it is not recognized as an Imaging device, and the driver properties give an error code 28, which is typical of the missing driver :)</p>
<p>So the question remains, where the heck do i find the driver :) ?</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

            <p>&nbsp;You can easily determine if you have a sticky shift key by typing something into a word processor and seeing if everything comes out in upper case.&nbsp; Since your posts here don't seem to have that problem, it would seem like that's not your problem, even
 though it's a natural thing to suspect,&nbsp;unless of course your posts are coming from another PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have you considered the possibility of having a virus or other malware?&nbsp; I'd try making sure my antivirus program and Windows Defender are up to date, booting into Safe Mode, and running both of these to do a full system scan.&nbsp; If they don't fix the problem,
 I'd use System Restore to go back a day or two before the problem started.</p>

<h2>            Disable hardware acceleration Win8</h2>
                    


Flash player green screens. 



Everyone says turn off HW Acceleration. 



They say do this with Flash settings....it's not in my Flash settings. 


They say do this on Control Panel- Display- Trouble shooting tab.....I don't have a troubleshooting tab. 



These forums say, 'don't do that, Win8 is perfect, let us handle your acceleration you ignorant user'. Thanks Bill. Win 8 is **** BTW Bill. I don't have or want a touchscreen Bill. 



These forums say, 'update your driver'. I've done that. 



HOW DO I DISABLE HW ACCELERATION IN WIN 8? 



Thanks for any help.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can disable it via your browser settings. <br />
<br />
<u><b>Firefox</b></u> - Tools &gt; Options &gt; General tab &gt; Uncheck 'Use HWA when available'<br />
<br />
<u><b>IE</b></u> - Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced tab &gt; Check 'Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering'<br />
<br />
<u><b>Chrome</b></u> - Navigate to the address bar and type <b>chrome://flags</b> &gt;
<span><font>Hit enter and it should take you to a page like this. Scroll down till you find "<b>GPU compositing on all pages</b>". Select the option "<b>Default</b>" and change it to "<b>Disabled</b>":<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<h2>            Quick game resume not working after last update</h2>
                    
<p>After last update (I guess, since now console updates are automatic), let's say since more or less 10 days, the quick resume function isn't working anymore on most games.</p>
<p>I use the quick power option, meaning the console turn on immediately and the stanby is soft.</p>
<p>Well, now games like Forza Horizon 2, Diablo 3 and other, that were supported by quick resume, now all launch from start every time I power on the console.</p>
<p>This means I can't quit sessions halfway in my games as they're resetted after every restart.</p>
<p>Some other games, like Shadow of Mordor for example, still work, thu.</p>
<p>Can you help me, please?</p>

            <p>Hey there, lock! That definitely could be a factor into this, especially since it's only affecting your digital games. Trying out the second step I posted above would be one way to confirm this; trying this console on a different internet connection. The way it could affect it is the time it takes for your console to connect to our servers to confirm you have the license for the game.</p>
<p>You could definitely reach out to your ISP to see if they are aware of any issues, or possibly swap out the device you have. We also have a large collection of devices listed in our Networking Hardware Information forums. You can check in there to see if your device may have a known issue that can be addressed simply by changing a setting or two. :)</p>
<p>Post back and let me know what route you're taking! We'll hopefully nail this one down. :3</p>

    <title>Incredibly long &#40;Just about 1000 seconds oddly enough&#41; boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exr90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incredibly long &#40;Just about 1000 seconds oddly enough&#41; boot time on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Precision T5400 with Dual Xeon X5460 CPU's and 12 GB RAM full buffered RAM, Nvidia GTX 960 (EVGA) and 256GB Samsung EVO 850 SSD. System has A09 Bios revision, which is latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 (x64) takes almost exactly 16.6 minutes (which happens to be about 1000 seconds strangely enough) to boot after post (BIOS, Not UEFI). After posting, the black screen with the Windows logo appears, and the spinning circle. It stays that way for
 15-20 minutes, before then displaying the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior only exists in Windows 10. I've tried a clean install, no change, and it even does the same lag when booting from Windows 10 install media (both DVD as well as USB media). Being RTM vs fully patched makes no difference. Using current drivers,
 no difference. I've tried it with ALL usb devices removed (even kb/mouse) and no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I turn ON Fast Boot, the problem stops UNLESS a reboot is performed (by me, or by windows update, etc). This makes sense because Fast Boot is effectively a form of Hibernate and it's not actually having to go through the full boot process again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've used Windows Performance Recorder and Analyzer to look at what's up, and the entirety of the lag is happening during the PreSession stage, which shows nothing of note going on during this time from a process standpoint. System and Idle are the only
 two processes going on during this time; which under System lives NTOSKERNEL and two child processes, ACPI.SYS and HAL.DLL; that's it. Memory and Disk are effectively idle during this period. From all various ways I look at the data, it's just idle for almost
 1000 seconds before then completing the boot and otherwise the computer acts normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot is attached, and WPA file is available if someone from MS can make sense of it (I can put it on OneDrive or something).&nbsp;<br />

<h3> sanatupadhyay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Difficulty in compiling C&#43;&#43; codes the second time because the older exe is open in the OS &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10, and Eclipse IDE with MinGW compiler to do C++ programming. The build option works well for any project the first time. But I cannot execute build command the second time because the output exe files cannot be opened. I get the following
 error message:</p>
<p>"cannot open output file filename.exe: Permission denied</p>
<p>collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the older exe stays open somewhere in the OS even after terminating from the IDE. I tried closing Eclipse and then deleting the exe from Windows explorer. But the exe files reappear on refreshing the explorer. Task manager does not show the
 exe to be running and I cannot figure out where do I have an open handle in the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How can I figure out where the exe files are open?</p>
<p>2) How can I set my OS so that I don't have to manually close the exe everytime. I would like the compiler to have access to replacing the old exe when a build command is given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I am using McAfee Total protection as anti virus.&nbsp;</p>

            I think your code is still running, this is a common problem with Eclipse . . .
<br />
<br />In the Eclipse IDE, click on 'window' - open perspective - debug
<br />
<br />If there is a thread still running in the top-left window, click it and stop it
<br />
<br />Do that before trying to recompile your code . . .

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. I did not see any running thread in the debug perspective. I am new to eclipse, so it is also possible that I could not locate the right place to look for threads. The version of eclipse which I am using for C++ is&nbsp;eclipse-cpp-oxygen-1-rc4-win32-x86_64,
 on a 64 bit machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have another question. If you think the problem lies with a running thread in eclipse, then how is it possible that I cannot delete exe files even after I exit from eclipse? Shouldn't all running threads die automatically after I exit from the IDE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

            Yes, you would imagine that all running threads would be killed when exiting the Eclipse Environment. 
<br />
<br />But unlike Visual Studio, Eclipse runs your project on a separate thread, over which the Eclipse IDE seems to have no control, that is one of the reasons I don't use it!
<br />
<br />Sanat, seeing as you are using the  Eclipse IDE, I fell you should pop over to the Exlipse Forum and post your question there. I think interacting with the developers on that forum will provide you with a quicker and more in-depth answer . . .

            Thanks a lot Dave. I hope to find the answer at the eclipse forum. I was almost convinced that this was an OS issue, hence decided to ask for a solution here first.

            Sanat, I am glad to help, no it is not an OS issue.
<br />
<br />I am a developer and had many issues with Eclipse when I was starting to code.
<br />
<br />The Eclipse community is huge and you will get a fast answer over on their forum
<br />
<br />Best of luck with your coding . . .
<br />
<br />Dave :)
