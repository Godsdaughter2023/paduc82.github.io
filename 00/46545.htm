                    <p>I'm not able to set a picture password or change the lock screen from my Microsoft account on Windows 8.1 Pro x64. When I try to change the lock screen, I get the dots going in circles forever, and when I try to set a picture password, I'm given the error
 message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Enrollment failure.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">There was a failure during the enrollment process. Please try again later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installed OS is Windows 8.1 Pro, retail, 64-bit.&nbsp; The hard drive on which it was installed was wiped clean of partitions just prior.&nbsp; A local administrator account was created, and all available updates were installed via Windows Update.&nbsp; After Windows
 was brought current, my Microsoft account was added as a standard user account.&nbsp; No third-party apps or applications have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The local administrator account is able to change the lock screen and set a picture password.&nbsp; The Microsoft user account is unable to do this even if set as an administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have checked the system integrity with the command "sfc /scannow" and it reported no integrity violations.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have tried clean booting (using MSConfig to disable services and startup items) without any change in the problem.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This installation came on the heels of a previous installation of the same OS on the same PC and having the same problem.&nbsp; Before wiping that installation in favor of the current one, I had tried system refresh with no change in
 the problem.&nbsp; I have nuked and paved after that, repeating all the steps to get current on Windows Update, and this problem is still present.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Memory is good, the hard disk drive is good, and there are no detectable failures in any of my PC's hardware.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Because someone insists on marking the only response I got as the answer even though it answered nothing, quoted here is the reply that actually was the answer:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
<br />
</p><blockquote>
<p>After 2 1/2 weeks of fruitless troubleshooting, I was not able to find the update causing this problem.&nbsp; I was not able to make this problem reappear except by performing a fresh install of Windows 8.1 (nuke and pave), installing updates, and then adding
 my Microsoft account and trying to create a picture password. Also, I was not able to find a solution by any means less invasive than the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The solution I found is as follows:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Perform a <strong>System Refresh</strong>.
<ol>
<li>Go to <em>PC Settings</em>.</li><li>Tap or click "<em>Update and recovery</em>" on the left.</li><li>Tap or click "<em>Recovery</em>" on the left.</li><li>Tap or click the "<em>Restart now</em>" button.</li><li>Tap or click on the "<em>Troubleshoot</em>" button.</li><li>Tap or click on the "<em>Refresh your PC</em>" button.
<ul>
<li>It's the icon with diamonds above the hard drive.&nbsp; Make sure you click the right one, or you'll be doing a next-to-nuke and pave instead.</li></ul>
</li><li>If the administrator account has a password, you will have to log in.
<ul>
<li>Beware if you use a keyboard layout other than Sholes's Workaround (aka US aka Qwerty). Before entering the password, tap or click on the "Change keyboard layout" text, then tap or click on "See more keyboard layouts" until the keyboard layout you use appears.
 Except for "US," they are listed in alphabetical order by language.</li></ul>
</li><li>Insert your Windows 8.1 media if prompted, read what will happen, tap or click the "<em>Next</em>" button, and when ready, tap or click the "<em>Refresh</em>" button.
<ul>
<li>When Windows says a list of apps removed will be saved to your desktop, it means to the desktop of the administrator account you use for System Refresh.</li></ul>
</li><li>Wait while Windows performs the System Refresh.&nbsp; The PC will reboot a few times.&nbsp; You will know it's done when the lock screen reappears.</li></ol>
</li><li>Log in to the account(s) affected by this problem, and <strong>create a picture password</strong>.
<ul>
<li>When you log in after a System Refresh, Windows will treat it as it did when you logged in for the first time ever. Double check and readjust every security and privacy setting that you customized before the System Refresh.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Reinstall</strong> your removed <strong>apps</strong> and <strong>reapply updates</strong> from Windows Update as normal.</li></ol>
<p>Note that System Refresh may not work if you upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 via the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; It will only work if you created Windows 8.1 installation media or if Windows 8.1 was preinstalled.&nbsp; See the thread "<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-system/how-to-refresh-windows-81-if-upgraded-from-windows/6b828a53-3267-46ec-b8d5-14e3996790d1">How
 to refresh Windows 8.1 if upgraded from Windows 8 and files are missing</a>" for more information.</p>

            <p>Hi Ariel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>Based on the issue description, I understand that you are unable to create a picture password to your Microsoft account as it gives the error: Enrollment failure. There was a failure during the enrollment process. Please try again later.</p>
<p>I can understand how frustrating it could be when things don't work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better understanding on this issue, I would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;</span>What I the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;</span>Is the computer connected to a domain Network?</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;</span>Have you tried creating picture password using a different user account?</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;</span>What is the format of the picture you are adding to set picture password?</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;</span>Does the same issue reoccur irrespective of pictures you select to set a picture password?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you have already tried the SFC scan and clean boot method along with Windows updates installed, I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 3: </strong>If the issue still exists, I suspect it is due to the corrupt profile (User account).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Follow the steps below to&nbsp;Create a new user account in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Press <strong>Windows Key + Q</strong> <span>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Now, Right-click on <strong>cmd.exe</strong> from the result and select

<strong>net user username password /add </strong></p>
<p>and hit Enter.</p>
<p>**[Replace ‘username’ and ‘password’ with your desired username and password]**</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Copying old files to newly created User Profile:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure that you have unchecked Hide protected operating system files and Hide extensions for known file types from&nbsp; Control Panel&gt;Folder&nbsp;View.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Go to</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\(Your-Corrupted-Profile-Name)\</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> can be different according to the drive, where you have installed Windows 8.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Copy all files except three files : <br />
<strong>NtUser.dat<br />
NtUser.ini<br />
NtUser.log</strong><br />
If you cannot find the last file then there will be two log file with <strong>.LOG1</strong> and
<strong>.LOG2</strong> extensions.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Go to <strong>C:\Users\(New-User-Profile-name)\</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Paste all those copied files here.</p>
<p>Now delete the corrupted profile. You have successfully transferred all information and settings of the corrupted profile to the newly created User Profile.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>What I the make and model of the computer?</span><br />
</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>It is an Acer Aspire 5733 (specifically an Aspire 5733-6838 manufactured in May 2012 and purchased in January 2013).<br />
</span><br />

</span><span>No.</span><br />

<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><br />
</span><span>Have you tried creating picture password using a different user account?</span><br />
</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Yes.</span>&nbsp; The local administrator account is able to set a picture password successfully, but a newly created local standard account (not the same new account noted below) fails to set a picture password with the same error message.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>What is the format of the picture you are adding to set picture password?</span><br />
</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>It is a 1366x768 JPEG image.&nbsp; I tried with a 1366x768 PNG image, resulting in the same error message.</span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><br />

If the issue still exists, I suspect it is due to the corrupt profile (User account).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The new account has been created, but I am not able to complete the steps suggested.&nbsp; The Microsoft standard account profile directory name is ariel_000, and the new local standard account profile directory name is arielmt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are seven files in my Microsoft account profile directory named NTUSER.*:</p>
<ul>
<li>*.DAT</li><li>*.dat.LOG1</li><li>*.dat.LOG2</li><li>*.DAT{2aece882-43b4-11e4-80be-782bcb393c42}.TM.blf</li><li>*.DAT{2aece882-43b4-11e4-80be-782bcb393c42}.TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms</li><li>*.DAT{2aece882-43b4-11e4-80be-782bcb393c42).TMContainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms</li><li>*.ini</li></ul>
<p>I have tried to copy all files and directories except for these seven while logged into the local administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File Explorer silently refuses to copy my files. It gives no errors yet does not perform any actions via copy/paste or drag-and-drop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running the following robocopy command from an elevated command prompt:</p>

            <p>I have new information, and my PC's configuration has changed significantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a system refresh from the advanced startup menu, but this time without reinstalling any of the 101 updates noted in the second post.&nbsp; My PC still has no apps or applications installed other than those which came with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this vulnerable state, my Microsoft standard account is able to set a picture password successfully.&nbsp; This isolates the cause of the problem to one of the 101 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm presently going through the laborious process of noting and installing updates one at a time, rebooting, and setting and clearing the picture password after each one, in order to determine which update causes the problem to reappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to daily work and personal schedules, this will likely take several days to complete.&nbsp; If anyone knows which update it is, kindly post it please.</p>

 would let me.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>After 2 1/2 weeks of fruitless troubleshooting, I was not able to find the update causing this problem.&nbsp; I was not able to make this problem reappear except by performing a fresh install of Windows 8.1 (nuke and pave), installing updates, and then adding
 my Microsoft account and trying to create a picture password. Also, I was not able to find a solution by any means less invasive than the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The solution I found is as follows:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Perform a <strong>System Refresh</strong>.
<ol>
<li>Go to <em>PC Settings</em>.</li><li>Tap or click "<em>Update and recovery</em>" on the left.</li><li>Tap or click "<em>Recovery</em>" on the left.</li><li>Tap or click the "<em>Restart now</em>" button.</li><li>Tap or click on the "<em>Troubleshoot</em>" button.</li><li>Tap or click on the "<em>Refresh your PC</em>" button.
<ul>
<li>It's the icon with diamonds above the hard drive.&nbsp; Make sure you click the right one, or you'll be doing a next-to-nuke and pave instead.</li></ul>
</li><li>If the administrator account has a password, you will have to log in.
<ul>
<li>Beware if you use a keyboard layout other than Sholes's Workaround (aka US aka Qwerty). Before entering the password, tap or click on the "Change keyboard layout" text, then tap or click on "See more keyboard layouts" until the keyboard layout you use appears.
 Except for "US," they are listed in alphabetical order by language.</li></ul>
</li><li>Insert your Windows 8.1 media if prompted, read what will happen, tap or click the "<em>Next</em>" button, and when ready, tap or click the "<em>Refresh</em>" button.
<ul>
<li>When Windows says a list of apps removed will be saved to your desktop, it means to the desktop of the administrator account you use for System Refresh.</li></ul>
</li><li>Wait while Windows performs the System Refresh.&nbsp; The PC will reboot a few times.&nbsp; You will know it's done when the lock screen reappears.</li></ol>
</li><li>Log in to the account(s) affected by this problem, and <strong>create a picture password</strong>.
<ul>
<li>When you log in after a System Refresh, Windows will treat it as it did when you logged in for the first time ever. Double check and readjust every security and privacy setting that you customized before the System Refresh.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Reinstall</strong> your removed <strong>apps</strong> and <strong>reapply updates</strong> from Windows Update as normal.</li></ol>
<p>Note that System Refresh may not work if you upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 via the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; It will only work if you created Windows 8.1 installation media or if Windows 8.1 was preinstalled.&nbsp; See the thread "<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-system/how-to-refresh-windows-81-if-upgraded-from-windows/6b828a53-3267-46ec-b8d5-14e3996790d1">How

            If you mean your game saves, they can't be lost if you have played online and didn't deleted the saves voluntarily. If you still have in-game issues I suggest you to contact Turn 10 as the game developer or post at their support forums.&nbsp;

it wont be lost. If by chance it is contact turn 10 or xboxlive support.</p>

            So long post short. Cloud saves will not get lost and it is your back up if something happend to you save on the console. Clear local saves and see if it syncs up or uninstall the game and reinstall it to force the sync

            <p>Pros</p>
<p>Second partition allowing you to keep defragment track of your data also when reinstalling windows version/edition files will not be affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cons</p>
<p>Keeping data on same partition if you reinstall windows data will be affected also keeping info on same drive as windows doesn't matter if one partition or two have&nbsp;possible risk&nbsp;of HDD failure keep in mind the C drive spinning all of the time windows read/write

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I understood from your reply is as follows. If my understanding is correct, please say yes; if my understanding is not correct then please correct me and explain further. Thanks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pros</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeping system and data on different partitions of same fixed drive will give me an option to reinstall system only from a system image without touching data, when the need arises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I guess, the size of each system image will be smaller and more images can be stored on the back drive. Image creation will also take less time (Reflect or Acronis).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cons</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I haven't understood what you have tried to explain as cons; and therefore, I request you to further elaborate on it.</p>
<p>I think, you are probably trying to say that if hard disk crashes (fails), both partitions will fail, not only one. Hence, keeping system and data on two different partions won't make any difference. Is this what you are saying?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect, you are also trying to say that, whether one or two partitions, C: drive will keep spinning all the time, and therefore, hard drives lifespan will be less than others.
</p>
<p>If this is what you are saying then, I couldn't understand why the lifecycle of the HDD will be reduced? I would want to think, in such situation, that C drive will probably spin all the disregard whether you have system and data on two separate partions
 or on one un-partitioned drive.</p>
<p>I do not know enough about this spinning issue, and therefore, request you to explain in greater detail about why that would happen?</p>

            <p>UPDATE (PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having put User Data in a separate partion of new HDD--<br />
<br />
1. Windows File History won't pickup data from separate partion drive (it keeps looking for user data in System partion)<br />
<br />
2. Turned off Windows File History and installed Seagate Dashboard but this applicat6ion also looks for data source in System partition, not in data partition<br />
<br />
3. In System partion User acct., no more I see any Documents folder (even after checking View &gt;&gt; Hidden Items). But if I attempt to create a new folder named Document, it says the folder Documents already exists.<br />
<br />
4. If I go to Data partition's Properties &gt; Location and try to Restore Default C:\Users\me\Documents, Access is denied though I have all Administrative rights in Properties &gt; Securities.</p>

            <p>The best solution is to keep Windows and all your software on the system partition (C:) and your data (documents, music, pictures, favorites, etc.) on a separate partition. A separate physical hard drive is even better. There are many advantages to this
 setup, including:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- You can backup your software and your data on different schedules and with different applications (e.g., an image for your software and folder backup for your data.)</p>
<p>2- You can independently restore your software and your data.</p>
<p>3- You can easily move your data to another computer.</p>

            <p>Two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <span><span>Separating data from Windows is a false comfort if it’s done with the thought that the data will be safe if Windows ever has to be reinstalled. The reason I call it a false comfort is because I fear that many people will rely on that separation,
 think that their data is safe there, and therefore do not take appropriate steps to back it up. In truth the data is not safe there. Having to reinstall Windows is only one of the dangers to someone’s hard drive, and not even the most likely one. This kind
 of “safeguard” falls into the same category as a partition for backup of other partitions; it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers that affect the entire physical drive, not just the particular
 partition. Safety comes from a strong backup regimen, not from how you partition.<br />
<br />
However for some people it can be a good idea to separate Windows and programs on the one hand from data on the other, putting each of the two types into separate partitions. I think that most people’s partitioning scheme should be based on their backup scheme,
 and backup schemes generally fall into two types: imaging the entire hard drive or backup of data only. If you backup data only, that backup is usually facilitated by having a separate partition with data only; that permits backing up just that partition easily,
 without having to collect bits and pieces from here and there. On the other hand, for those who backup by creating an image of the entire drive, there is usually little, if any, benefit to separating data in a partition of its own.<br />
<br />
By the way, in all fairness, I should point out that there are many well-respected people who recommend a separate partition for Windows, regardless of your backup scheme.&nbsp; Their arguments haven’t convinced me, but there are clearly two different views here.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2. </span></span><span><span>Some people make a separate partition to store backups of their other partition(s). People who rely on such a "backup" are just kidding themselves. It's only very slightly better than no backup at all, because it
 leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: head crashes and other kinds of drive failure, severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, even theft of the computer.&nbsp; In my view,
 secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer.</span></span>

            <p>You have argued your case very well and I have no doubt about whatever you have explained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still have a serious concern left. And, that is, <strong>how best to implement</strong> your suggestions in a given enviornment? Let me describe the environment and you guide me how to put your thoughts into practice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My data is mostly <strong>creative</strong> in nature, <strong>not reproduceable</strong> if lost or
<strong>corrupted</strong> for any reason. Very recently I met with such a situation, and most recovered files turned out to be juunk. Therefore, I have taken a
<strong>policy decision </strong>that I must have <strong>three independant</strong> backups on
<strong>three different physical</strong> drives: </p>
<ul>
<li>one external drive with USB Casing, which if needed, can be used as a fixed drive</li><li>one portable, USB drive</li><li>one fixed drive</li></ul>
<p>I am no more keen on <strong>cloud storage </strong>any more though I have 1 TB free courtesy Microsoft but at one time it will no more remain free. More importantly, free storage or paid storage is cheap in comparison
<strong>Internet bandwidth</strong> it consumes in the process of <strong>sysncing
</strong>user data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Entire computer system is protected by American Power Corporation's UPS-Backup which has
<strong>45 minutes power backup </strong>plus a software that <strong>automatically closes all running applications</strong> before shutting down the UPS. 10 years ago I had a power fluctuation, momentarily though, but enough to corrupt my accounting database
 on which I was working at that time. That is when I reached out for a UPS, which also has built-in surge protector. This takes care of one aspect of data integrity and data security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for System Images, I have decided to have <strong>at least </strong>one fixed drive, which is
<strong>physically independant</strong> of the fixed drive on which the System files reside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this is all theory and may sound good. You may also find some scope for improvising it on certain counts, and I do request you to suggest that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Physical built of my computer (assembled) has following features. </p>
<ol>
<li>I <strong>have</strong> partioned ST 1 TB&nbsp; (2016) and <strong>C: </strong>has system files, and<strong> D:
</strong>has data files <br />
</li><li>I <strong>can </strong>partion WD 1 TB&nbsp; (2013) where System Images can reside one one partition, data backup on 2nd partion</li><li>I <strong>have</strong> set ST 500 GB (2013) for continuous <strong>data</strong> backup using Seagate Dashboard software</li><li>I <strong>can</strong> set ST 160 GB (2007) for<strong> data </strong>backup using Reflect Macrium Free Ed</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Going by your recommendations, I can <strong>remove </strong>the existing partitions of ST 1 TB&nbsp; (2016). I had created the partions on advice of some with a view to keep each backup smaller in size. Actually, I had tried that before receiving your reply,
 and again just now. For this, it was necessary for me to <strong>restore Data location</strong> to its
<strong>default value</strong>. So, I went to the <strong>Properties</strong> of D:, Tab
<strong>Location</strong>, and clicked on <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> which changed the path to C:\Users\me\Documents. Next I clicked at
<strong>Apply</strong> button and got error message "<strong>Access Denied</strong>". When I clicked OK button, same thing happened. So, I went to Tab
<strong>Security</strong> and checked <strong>Permissions</strong>. I found System, Administrator, and me had
<strong>Full Control.</strong> I couldn't understand why I am being denied access.
<strong>Any solution? </strong>What should I do? Without restoring defaults, I cannot implement your suggestion to keep Windows and Data on
<strong>same unpartitioned drive</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If</strong> I am able to <strong>remove</strong> partitions on ST 1 TB (2013) then there will be
<strong>no need for partitioning</strong> WD 1 TB drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to setup ST 500 GB (2013) with Seagate Dashboard software because <strong>
Windows File History </strong>wouldn't want to recognize the partion D:\Data and it keeps looking for C: before I can Turn it On.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two different lines of thought whether there should be <strong>partition or not</strong>, and that makes things confusing for lay users, for whom
<strong>only objective</strong> is to setup a <strong>simple and workable </strong>
structure without spending lot of time in structuring and maintenance, and without inviting too much of complexity.&nbsp; Therefore,
<strong>I request your help!</strong></p>

    <title>BAD IMAGE error message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenreiner  say:</h3>
<h2>            BAD IMAGE error message</h2>
                    I have windows XP on a dell system and every time I turn on my computer I get a series of error messages. The first one is ISASS.exe - Bad Image. All of the next messages are similar ending with Bad Image.<br />
The error message block reads as follows: This application or DLL c:/windows/sys 32 / wewusigo.dll is not a valid windows image. Please check this against your installation diskette.<br />
How can this be fixed and what is the cause of these errors? I have run the Microsoft and Malware scans and neither program found infected files.<br />

            There are two things slowing you down.<br />
<br />
First, the gross deficiency in the MS Answers forums to prompt for system information when new questions are asked.&nbsp; There is probably no hope for that.<br />
<br />
Second, it appears you are paraphrasing what you see in the error messages instead of telling us exactly what the error messages say (try to do better!).<br />
<br />
It is not ISASS - it is lsass.exe (with an ell) and I don't think the message says "Bad Image".<br />
<br />
It might say something&nbsp; "...is not a valid Windows image".<br />
<br />
I have more lsass.exe error messages and solutions than you can shake a stick at and would overflow this page.&nbsp; Your solution depends on exactly what your messages say.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked so we know nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these
 issues.<br />
<br />
This dereliction and gross deficiency in the MS Answers forums implementation unnecessarily prolongs the resolution of simple problems.<br />
<br />
Perhaps someday they will fix this hideous oversight.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday the XP forums "Ask a question" dialog will ask these questions automatically when a new thread is started so I do not have to ask them every single time.&nbsp; It might even be possible to resolve an issue in a single reply when enough information
 is provided.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If you can get on the Internet, do this:<br />
<br />

            <p>Information provided by KenReiner in a duplicate thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I posted this error problem on this question and answer form and received a response but I am unable to respond back to that person through email as I cannot get on Outlook Express. Here is my answer in hope that the individual will see it and respond to
 me.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your response. I will attempt to answer your questions the best I can.<br />
<br />
Dell Dimension 3000 <br />
<br />
XP Home edition <br />
<br />
Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
Using AVG and Malwarebytes ( I ran the Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware programs that you recommended with no resolution to the problem)<br />
<br />
No known interruptions that I am aware of.<br />
<br />
CD drive does work<br />
<br />
I do not have a bootable XP installation CD as it was not supplied by Dell. The paperwork from Dell indicated I should try the restore function which I did and I was not able to restore using several different dates.<br />
<br />
When I first start the computer I get the following error: Services. exe Bad Image (this is in the header of the error message) The message in the body of the error is: This application or dll c:/windows/sys32/wewusigo.dll is not a valid windows image. Please
 check this against your installation diskette. <br />
<br />
After clicking OK I get the 2nd error message: Isass.exe - Bad Image Win the header with the same message as above in the body of the error.<br />
<br />
The user accounts screen comes up and I can then click on one of the two users I have listed.<br />
<br />
Then the next error appears: Userinit.exe - Bad Image in the header with the same error as above.<br />
<br />
After clicking OK on the error the desktop appears with the following error: Jusched.exe - Bad Image and again the same message in the error as above.<br />
<br />
Then I click on that message and the next one appears:<br />
<br />
Issch.exe - Bad Image<br />
<br />
Then there are 19 more error messages all with the same wording in the body. It appears to me that as each program tries to load I get the program name - Bad Image along with the same message as above in the body.<br />
<br />
Finally I am able to click on the Firefox Icon to start the internet.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I have explained the exact steps I have taken and the error messages I receive.<br />
<br />
Can you help????"</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Its’ look like it is a virus infection, I would suggest you run the Microsoft safety scanner and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you download and run the Autoruns to find any startup entry that references wewusigo.dll, and disable it</span></p>

            A fair shot.<br />
<br />
MSE or MSS will not touch it.<br />
<br />
As a test, have you inflicted your own system this way and has MSE or MSS resolved the issue?<br />
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; have you ever actually used autoruns to fix any problem before?<br />

<div>Here are comprehensive instructions that will keep you safe and resolve your issue the "right" way.</div>
<div><br />
</span></span>A "Cannot find...", "Cannot start..., "Cannot load...". "Could not run..." Cannot run" "Error loading..." or&nbsp;"specific module could not be found" message at startup is usually related to malware that was set to run at startup but&nbsp;the referenced
 file(s) has been deleted after a malware scan leaving behind a registry entry or startup item pointing to a file&nbsp;that does not exist. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It could be from a malicious software removal or an uninstalled application. &nbsp;The entry may have a curious&nbsp;looking name since it was probably generated at random when the malware was installed. If you search your system for the referenced file,&nbsp;you may
 not even find it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows is trying to load this file but cannot locate it since the file was mostly likely removed during a scan&nbsp;for malicious software. However, an associated orphaned startup parameter or registry entry remains and is telling&nbsp;Windows to load the file
 when you boot up or login.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to remove the referenced entry so Windows stops trying to load or run the file. It may or may not be&nbsp;in the registry but you can find it. &nbsp;Autoruns (see below) will find the item no matter where it is.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You need to be sure to fix the problem and not just fix the symptom of the problem by simply relieving your system of the displaying message - that is not a fix (there is a difference).<br />
<div><br />
<div>If you just locate and uncheck the item in msconfig, that disables the item but does not remove the reference to&nbsp;the bogus startup item from your computer. &nbsp; The msconfig program is not a startup manager, it is a troubleshooting&nbsp;tool. &nbsp;Disabling things
 in msconfig to put a stop to the messages and thinking your problem is resolved is short&nbsp;sighted and leaves behind a sloppy XP configuration. &nbsp;Merely disabling the display of a startup error message should&nbsp;not count as a "solution" to the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are comfortable editing the registry you can search for and remove the reference directly from there or remove&nbsp;it using a popular third party tool called Autoruns. &nbsp;The problem may not always be found in the registry though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Before making any changes to your registry by hand or with third party tools, be sure to make a backup of the registry&nbsp;first. There is no undo or quit without saving option in regedit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a link to a popular registry backup tool:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also use Autoruns to find the leftover startup item no matter where it is hiding. &nbsp;Autoruns does not install anything&nbsp;on your computer. &nbsp;It will display all of the startup locations where the reference might be so you can disable it or&nbsp;delete it
 completely. &nbsp;Here is the download link for Autoruns:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Launch Autoruns.exe and wait for it to finish populating the list of entries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When Autoruns is finished scanning your system, it will say "Ready" at the bottom left corner. &nbsp;Autoruns can be a&nbsp;little intimidating at first if you have never see it before since it displays a lot of information. &nbsp;You are really&nbsp;only interested in a
 couple sections.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem item is usually in the system startup or user startup entries so click the Logon tab&nbsp;and see if the startup item is there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Scroll through the list and look for a startup entry related to the file(s) in the error message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you don't find it in the Logon tab, look for it in the Everything tab.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also click File, Find to search the Logon or Everything tab for all or part of the name of the item.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right-click on the offending entry and choose to delete it. &nbsp;If you are not sure what it is, you can just disable it,&nbsp;reboot and if the issue is resolved, and then delete the offending entry. &nbsp;If you don't see it in Autoruns you may have to edit the registry
 and remove the item from the Startup folder there. &nbsp;Autoruns should display the same&nbsp;information though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you had or have an infection, follow up with this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>

            I started this early , I build computers , one thing you should not be using XP unles your are the Govermment , as they are the only ones that will get up dates . I have been using Windows 10 preview from all most from the start , it is a VERRY good system.
 This is at least 4 that I have worked on . I suggest using 7 or 8 . I still have a copy of Win 7 Pro I have not used . In &nbsp;working with Win 10 , I have found out that it does not have a burning soft ware , it is fine with me as there are Companies that make
 there business in making it &nbsp;. I really suggest that to going to Win 8 &nbsp;, or 7 if you have to . It would be really best to go to Windows 10 . I have used &nbsp;Win 10 &amp; the main &nbsp;issue is not having a burning soft whare, sorry for repeating my self , but the drives
 I put in are blue ray , &amp; you need better drivers . I ca put a computer to gather with Windows 98 &nbsp;, &amp; have it work . The only use it has there are some older games that can only run on olde

<h2>            Started hostednetwork - Without Internet Connection</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to start a hosted network through the cmd line command without an internet. Experienced multiple issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Firstly, even with an internet I get the error</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The hosted network couldn't be started.</p>
<p>The group or resource is not in the correct state to perform the requested operation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>-There is no apparent 'Microsoft Virtual Wifi Adaptor' in Device Manager (even with hidden devices)</p>
<p>-I can create a wifi using the settings dialog with an internet connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I want to do this without an internet connection as I want to send message from my iPad to my computer using a private network that doesn't rely on an actual internet connection, but just requires and ip from my computer and iPad to communicate. Specifically
 I'm using TouchOSC to broadcast messages from my iPad.</p>

</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOU HAVE SERIOUSLY GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I really want to go back to the way my Laptop was before Windows 10 just decided to hop on my system and update itself!! I don't want to loose all my files because this Laptop goes way back, but isn't my Microsoft&nbsp;account I have on my system still
 going to be there or do they DELETE THAT TOO?? </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I save all my files and whatnot on a cloud saving device or put them in a flash drive they plug that flash drive up once I factory reboot and download my stuff back? Thanks in advance!</strong><br />

            <p>The factory reload will not have any effect on your Microsoft Account or the data stored in OneDrive. It will however remove everything from Windows itself including personal data, Apps and programs. However backup means TWO copies, put your files on a USB
 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the camera worked originally it is reasonable to assume rolling back will restore its function. Obviously it would be better to get the camera working in Windows 10 but you are far from alone in the problem you have and see no definitive fixes. One peculiarity
 is users report the camera missing completely, not even an unknown device in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing I would try takes some time but that is a completely clean install of Windows 10, eliminate anything left over from previous blocking access to the camera. Whatever you do make sure you have created recovery disks to give you a reliable fallback.
 Check the documentation provided with the computer, recovery disk creation should still work even though you have upgraded.</p>

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Di</span><span><span>d you make any changes to the computer before
 the issue occurred?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any other backup programs any other third-party backup programs?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes then
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall</a> those third party backup program and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if they help in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></span><span><span> Verify if these two services are running:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Volume Shadow Copy service
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Windows backup</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also ensure that their dependency services are running. You can check this information from services.msc. Follow the steps below to check the services.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to start and type services.msc in the search field.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the two services.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-Click on the service one at a time.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select properties.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Dependencies Tab.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the dependency services.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure they’re also running.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start a service, right click on it and select start.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Check to see if clearing temporary files from the computer helps. Use Disk
 Cleanup to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Try to</span></strong><span> run [System File
 Checker] SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 4: Also t</span></strong></span><span><span><span>ry
 to set your computer in </span></span></span><span><span><span>Clean Boot state and check if the same issue occurs.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><br />

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b><span>Note:</span></b></span></span><span><span><span> After
 clean boot troubleshooting step, follow <b>Step 7</b> in the provided link to return your computer to

                    <p>Firstly, I'm a pharmacist, but I'm also the network admin for my pharmacy. I'm sure you know which job I'm better at being that I'm asking questions here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I acquired some computers from another company awhile back, and they were on windows 8 enterprise. The machine actually has a Xeon W3520 which probably would have been amazing 8 years ago. I always dreamed of having one of these in high school...
 That said, it's still a pretty awesome computer and more than what I need for running my pharmacy software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I cannot upgrade these computers to Windows 10. I was never presented the notification for the free windows update. I searched google a few times over the past year when I had some free time (a rarity), but everything I read pointed me
 in the direction of contacting my network administrator. Well, that's me, and I don't know what the heck to do. This has been a rather cyclical endeavor for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure I'm now past the free windows update window, but I'm not entirely sure. I just want these computers (I have two or three) to be on the same OS as every other computer in my pharmacy-- Windows 10 Pro Anniversary Edition. I really would have
 taken care of this sooner if I had the time. Owning your own business can suck sometimes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? I mean, ya, I'm the network admin, but I'm more of a hobbyist than a professional in this realm. I manage my own domain, and got everything setup and all of that. I just have severe pitfalls when it comes to my skill set.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The free upgrade to 10 ended on the 29th July, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You never qualified for this offer via the path/offer that was used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Enterprise editions upgraded through Software Assurance/Volume License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Enterprise/Volume License is for companies/Corporations, not for private use.</p>

            Hi <span>StevieG74</span>,<br />
<br />
What do you mean by removing all save email address on Hotmail? Are you trying to delete contacts? To delete all&nbsp;contacts in Windows Live Mail, press Ctrl A on your keyboard to select all contacts, then press the delete button on the top.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks,<br />
Windows Live Edmond A.<br />

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
I have already deleted all contacts which removed everyone from live messenger, but i mean when i open a new email and then start typing in the address bar the email address such as start typing joe it then comes up with all the email address i saved and so
 would suggest an email address such as joe.bloggs@hotmail......... (as in an address i had saved). I want to have to type the email address in every time as just last week my account was hacked and emails sent to all the addresses in my address book this then
 hacking their computers, which is what I hope to stop happening again.

            Hi <span>StevieG74</span>,<br />
<br />
To better settle your concern, please answer the questions below:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Is your account connected to other websites (e.g social networking sites like Facebook)? If it is, you need to disconnect that service to your account to totally removed those email addresses or contacts to your account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- What are the detailed steps that you did in deleting those contacts?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Same problem...trying to get rid of incorrect emails that come up when you start to type in an email in the TO bar. Why are answers to easy questions so hard to come by with Microsoft. Hotmail was so easy until Microsoft took over !

            <p>Couldn't agree more about Hotmail being less easy and reliable since Microsoft took over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still trying to find an answer to problem of deleting the drop down window when you log in containing all previous email addresses you sent to.</p>
<p>Why isn't there any easy facility to manage and control settings?</p>
<p>Progress is about making things easier for the consumer - not harder!</p>
<p>Any help from anyone on solving this would be appreciated. (End of rant)</p>

            <p>Possible solution to eliminate those address that appear but ARE NOT in your address book. These show up even though they are not in your address book to begin with. Possible quick when Hotmail transitioned to email. Only Microsoft can answer that......Good
 Luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much digging and trial by error I fixed my problem with the email addresses that appear in the "TO" drop down that I wanted to delete. This occurred when sending an email via Outlook Web. I have Windows 7 and it worked for me.&nbsp; To eliminate the email
 addresses that appear and DO NOT have an X to delete because they ARE NOT in your address book...&nbsp; I hit the Gear icon to get to the Options. In Options and under "Customizing Outlook"&nbsp; I selected Advanced Privacy.&nbsp; In the Advanced Privacy setting I selected
 " Only Suggest People In My Contact List". That got rid of all email addresses that show when you hit "TO" with the exception of the addresses in your Address book Contact list.&nbsp; Now ONLY email addresses from my contact list appear any any of these&nbsp; can easily
 be edited, changed or deleted in the address book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still hate Microsoft and how they screwed up Hotmail !</p>

            Only works on emails that are IN your contact list to begin with . I had old email addresses that were not in my Contact list or&nbsp; Address book. See my prior email solution for those that are not in your address book to begin with.

            HI Donna.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That message normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated by free Upgrade or a retail Product Key, and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.  
<br />
<br />In your case if it's certified Refurbished then that's licensed by Micrrosoft and they must meet standards including the licenses they sell or they will have their license pulled and can even be prosecuted.  
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install, the factory key embedded in the UEFI/BIOS firmware chip, a refurbisher key you were provided on a sticker or insert,  or a retail key you used. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for your licensed version from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:
<br />
<br />If it doesn't activate after going online and you originally had factory installed Windows, read the Product Key embedded in the UEFI firmware chip at the factory by running ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>,  copy and paste the OEM-BIOS key (only) into Settings&gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation.  
<br />
<br /> If you were sold a Volume license product key or the PC came from seller activated with one, then It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it.  You can report this to Microsoft here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>.  In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.  
<br />
<br />You can also contact the seller and let him/her know you are taking these actions and that they need to make the activation good.  Many will comply rather than risk investigation or prosecution.
<br />
<br />For further assistance restoring the original legal activation you can contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having all possible options helps.
<br />
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I’ve sent the company an email. &nbsp;Its no the first time I’ve sent this back with other issues. They sell second hand cheap goods and I wouldn’t be surprised if they are arn’t genuine. They will not give my money back as they usually say send it in to be
 repaired. If they do not solve this or give me my money back i will make a formal complaint. I start one degree next week and this is the last thing i need.&nbsp;

            Donna, the irony is that about half the time we see this (every day almost) here, there actually is an underlying Windows 10 Product Key embedded in the factory or Free Upgrade or other Digital LIcense.  For some reason repair shops and sellers don't take the time to properly restore the Factory or Digital License but instead slap in a Volume License key (which generates the "organization" message, the giveaway) that expires. 
<br />
<br />A refurbisher must be certified by Microsoft to sell it's products which is a special refurbished license that comes with a sticker or certificate.  If not then they are pirates and subject to prosecution internationally for felony piracy by reporting them to Microsoft.  A certified refurbisher likely wouldn't do this because their license is too valuable and MS would yank it quickly.  
<br />
<br />So you have some leverage if you politely let them know that you're dealing with an MVP activation expert in forums who's guiding you to report it as piracy if it's not made right.  
<br />
<br />Here's information about certified refurbishers who (again ) are the only ones allowed to call themselves that and sell refurbished Windows licenses:  <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Microsoft_Refurbisher_Program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Microsoft_Refurbish...</a>
<br />
<br />And here's where to report piracy to Microsoft:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>
<br />
<br />They have a history of rewarding those who report and cooperate wwith the investigation.

<p>Problem came to light when the system would no longer connect to the internet.</p>
<p>I found that the WAN Miniport (IPX) device was yellowed out.&nbsp; I have tried to update drivers using the Windows XP disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot remove the device&nbsp;becuase it indicates it may be necessary to boot the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;*original title - WAN MiniPort (IPX) gets this error in device manager. The device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for the device (CODE 31) __*</p>

<h2>            Where is the cheapest place to buy games online in the UK&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>And &nbsp;have them shipped to Ireland. I'm sick of paying 75 euro for new releases. Sometimes they are 69.99, but that's ridiculous when the same game is only 60 dollars.
</p>
<p>So far I found Zavvi.com to be the cheapest. <br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> jeremy mullin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying files from sd card that already exists sits at 0&#37; never prompting &#34;replace, skip keep&#34; menu&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi I do a lot of photography and copying from sd cards. I run into the situation where I copy a folder from an sd card to my local harddrive in the situation where the file already exists there. Instead of being prompted with the "skip, replace all files,
 keep" the progress just sits at 0 % continually? Folder is 250mb. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Tried this from multiple sd cards with similar sized folders and got the same result.</p>
<p>

</p><p>The issue is when I copy files from the sd card to my hd, instead of windows prompting me that the files already exist on my hd the progress just sits at 0% when it should immediately be able to tell me there is a a problem and ask if i want to overwrite
 the files. It's just stuck in limbo.</p>

                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to add a iCloud account in this stupid People App. Under "Settings" I see the account but something went wrong.
</p>
<p>- Error: Attention required / Something went wrong.. 0x801901f5</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I delete or change the account details?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no options. Nothing! <br />
- If I click the account button, nothing comes up.. Only the error message i have described.
</p>
<p>
Thanks a lot!<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

            <p>Thats the Answer.. Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solved as followed:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Configure Apple TWO-STEP VERIFICATION<br />
2. Configure APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORDS<br />
3. Change to Calendar<br />
4. Settings &gt; Manage Accounts<br />
5. Here you can delete the accounts<br />
<br />
6. Add iCloud Account whit the APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORDS</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In my opinion, that's a bug in the People App.</strong></p>

<p>Attempted to use the media creation tools update, as well as the Windows 10 update installer.</p>
<p>But my laptop keeps restoring to a previous version upon restarting. I got an error code: 0x8007001F - 0x20006, The Installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during REPLICATE_OC operation.</p>

<br />Recommend you check the "Windows Modules Installer" service and Trusted Installer is started on the system and set to automatic start, reboot and try the update again.

            That might or I should say probably be the root cause.

</p><p>I may be getting into programming territory that's a little beyond me now though, if this keeps up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I honestly think that I got a dodgy version of Windows 10 home installed somehow when I ordered thus laptop. Don't have an actual replacement copy to try a corruption repair from a system other than that windows update line, which of course doesn't work

<br />No need to buy a new license. Just do a clean install using these instructions:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

    <title>Turning off Windows Defender and Turning on 3rd party issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Turning off Windows Defender and Turning on 3rd party issue</h2>
                    I only recently noticed this. But Windows Defender has turned on and my antivirus (according to System and Maintance) is off. And it will not allow me to take action and turn it on... HOWEVER according to Avast! Premiere it's on. In the past, Windows Defender
 was off and I was using Avast! for antivirus and Zonealarm for firewall and it always serves me well. But now I'm getting annoyed by Windows, any ideas how to set Avast! antivirus to On and as the primary virus protection on my PC? Thanks<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb0e4f5b-7243-4bcb-bb8b-445902503531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb0e4f5b-7243-4bcb-bb8b-445902503531" /></a>

            <p>Uninstall Avast Completely with Avast Removal tool (in safe mode)&nbsp; Reinstall Avast and if it works properly should disable Defender properly after that,&nbsp; (long time Avast user since 2006)&nbsp;&nbsp; So this solution should work properly, Avast might've gotten onto
 Passive mode somehow</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Second Option if don't wanna uninstall Avast is Try Avast Repair, then see if it fixes properly</p>

<h3> mathewgies  say:</h3>
<h2>            My sticky notes keep moving</h2>
                    So i use sticky notes a lot as I need them to keep data for scale and position and such for commonly used assets for my youtube videos (kind of like a bookmark so I dont forget the values everytime I edit). and for about 3 weeks I've noticed that everytime
 I log off my user account/shut down my computer, all my sticky notes are moved to a horizanal position roughly 2 inches from the side of the screen (vertical positons are not affected), and whats even weirder is that since I have 2 columns of sticky notes,
 they overlap. I havent knowingly changed any of my settings or anything either. If anyone knows whats going on, I'd really appreciate it since its been getting pretty annoying having to move them back in place everytime I log on.

I have this problem and your solution is not helpful at all. I have a brand new computer and my sticky will not stay at the top right corner where I want them. Next answer?

            Sticky notes for windows 7 is like this. You need to always do it manually every time you turn on your PC. It will not stay on the same place.

            <p>Sticky notes will move when there is a screen resolution change, very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some full screen programs will change the screen resolution on start, then change it back on close down of the program.
</p>
<p>The sticky notes will move in relation to the screen resolution change, the lower the resolution, the greater distance apart they will be.</p>

<p>I have put up with the shifting Sticky Notes for the better part of a year, and now I've given up on them. It seems a small thing to ask for -- getting those notes to stay put on a screen, but the first few annoying minutes of each startup means pushing
 those notes back into place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have become more of a nuisance than a help.</p>
<p>It's a shame because this could be a helpful little app.</p>
<p>I am now using a OneNote file with separate pages for the different tasks I want to organize, and I include Notes on startup and keep the doc minimized on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They drive me insane, at first I thought this is great but then I've got about 6-10 now and they just move all the time. I work alot with spreadsheets and graphics, I find myself using show windows side by side which moves them all over the screen randomly
 dumping them, then that means I'm stuck moving them all back.&nbsp; I would prefer them not to be affected by this and other issues posted above, because they are moveable you can already lay them out side by side so really they could be made exempt from show windows
 side by side. I have tried and tried to find a work around but have failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sticky notes would be would be awesome and helpful if it wasnt for this major flaw, why couldn't Microsoft develop them so they are movable like they are now but where there is an option on each note to allow it to be locked into place. Each note has&nbsp; its
 own 3 dots allowing you to change the colours individually why couldnt the lock be there also to lock / unlock each one individually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Reggie for suggesting Onenote I think I am going to try that at least it's all under one and the whole thing will move when I show windows side by side but it's better than having to move 10 notes and them having to move them back several times
 a day.&nbsp;</p>
