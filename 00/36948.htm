<p>i know they do take longer to start up with Kinect,but thats mad,is there much spare memory? if your 4GB is full that could slow it down,delete any unnecessary items and clear your cache as well,also try starting your Xbox without Kinect</p>

<h2>            Windows Security Update with error code Oxc190011f</h2>
                    <p>The recent forced update of Windows 10 Security Upgrade is running with error code 190011f.&nbsp; Each time when it installs the upgrade, it end with a blue screen and then reboots.&nbsp; Then, every couple days it restarts the download of the upgrade and goes through
 the same cycle.&nbsp; Is there any way to disable the upgrade ?&nbsp; Or if any body knows what the error code means.</p>
<p>I am currently on a hp Proboor 4535s, AMD chip set, with MS Windows Version 1607 build 14393.2007.</p>

            Hi Vincent.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there.
<br />
<br />Next immediately hide the Update(s) with the Hide Updates tool downloaded and run from here:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this is Fall Creators Update Version 1709, which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About, you can also roll it back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide it using the same tool above until it matures.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />And if this is the CPU protection Update, this is being sorted out right now with new Updates.  Until then you can run this tool to see what it advises are your options:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>

            Hi Toddman, 
<br />
<br />I’m sure you’ve already done some (if not all) of these, but I’ll list them in case. While the speakers are plugged in:
<br />
<br />Let's click start, and type troubleshoot, and then launch the troubleshooter. Select "playing audio" and see if windows can fix the problem. 
<br />
<br />Right click on the volume icon on the taskbar, and look at your options. You should have volume mixer, and about 3/4 others. Go into these, and make sure none are disabled or muted. 
<br />
<br />Click start - settings - windows &amp; updates - Windows Updates - Let’s see if there are any pending updates that can be installed. If so, install those and we’ll check the audio again. 
<br />
<br />If this doesn’t fix the sound issue. Click start, and type “device manager” - find “sound” and expand it. Right click on high def audio driver, and uninstall. Reboot, and see if you have sound.
<br />
<br />Let’s start there, and we’ll keep troubleshooting. 
<br />- C

            Thanks for the reply, Charlie.&nbsp; I have tried all of those already.&nbsp; I have also updated the bios (legacy) and ensured the integrated peripherals (sound) is enabled.&nbsp; Another odd thing though, I hear system sounds.

            Wait... you hear system sounds via the speakers, but not other sounds (Ex. YouTube video)? 
<br />
<br />What’s the make and model of your PC? Click start, and type “system” and open system information. Next to system model you should see the model we need.

            Well that also says something. If it were software related, theoretically that would of helped the problem. The sound card could have died... been on its way out when you had vista, and no matter what OS you put on there it won’t work. <br /><br />There is another test, do you have a spare usb? If you feel like making a Linux boot USB, we can boot your machine to it, and if no sound on that as well, we can definitively say that it’s the hardware. <br /><br />Let me know!<br />- C

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal

<h2>            Fast User Switching in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have just installed Windows 10 Pro, replacing my previous Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; Now when I switch user the applications running on the old user cease to run.&nbsp; Is this because I need to activate fast user switching, and if so how do I do this?&nbsp; If not, is there
 any other way to ensure apps on the switched from user keep running?

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As per my understanding, whenever you switch from one user to the other user your programs in the prior account stops running.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Before I can provide assistance, there are a few questions I would like you to answer:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>How many accounts do you have in your computer?</span></li><li><span>Since when have you been facing this issue?</span></li><li><span>Have you perform any troubleshooting steps to fix this issue?</span></li></ol>
I would like to inform you that the apps will not stop if you&nbsp;are just switching the user accounts.&nbsp; You can try the following steps and check if it helps resolve your issue.
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method1:</strong></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have more than one user account</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have more than one account on your PC, you can switch to a different account without signing out or closing apps. To switch to a different account,

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Tap or click your account picture, and then choose another account from the menu</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Fast User Switching is an easy way for another person to log on to the computer without logging you off or closing your programs and files. Follow the steps below to for Fast Switch User.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. To begin, make sure that you have logged in as Administrator or have required administrative rights to change local group policies.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;</span>2. Press the Windows +R button. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. Run dialog box will pop-up,type <em><span>gpedit.msc</span></em>..This will open Local Group Policy Editor.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4. Now, go to the following location and look for Local Computer Policy in the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>5. Click on Local Computer Policy/Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/System/Logon.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>6. Just double-click <em><span>Hide Entry Points for Fast User Switching</span></em> to bring up a dialog box to change Fast User Switching policy setting.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>7. At the top, there are Not Configured, Enabled and Disabled options available. Selecting each setting will let you read its affect in Help section. To disable
<em><span>Hide Entry Points for Fast User Switching</span></em>, just select<em><strong><span>Enabled</span></strong></em> from the list and click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;8. Once done, you will have to enforce the change made to Fast User Switching policy setting. To do so, close the Local Group Policy Editor and open the Run dialog box (Windows +R button). Enter the command “<strong><span>gpupdate
 /force</span></strong>“ and click OK. The policy will be updated and applied on all user accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>9. To re-enable Fast User Switching, just choose Not Configured in its policy setting dialog and apply the changes via
<em><span>gpupdate /force</span></em> command.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would also suggest you to&nbsp;stop and restart <strong>

<p>Please let me know if you get this resolved. I'm having the same problem and have had no luck determining if Fast user Switching has been removed from Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi again Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggested method 2.&nbsp; After having completed all steps 1 to 9 I attempted to follow your suggestion to stop and restart Fast User Switching Compatibility in Services, but could not find any mention of this facility within services.&nbsp; Am I looking
 in the correct place?&nbsp; Anyway, as I could not stop and restart as you suggested, I just re-booted the PC which I assume would have the same affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cut a long story short.&nbsp; The problem has not been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be worth mentioning that the only way to get a "switch user" button is by using alt-cntl-del keys.&nbsp; The Method 1 you outlined above shows all available user accounts, and I am assuming that it is intended by selecting one of those accounts the same
 fast user switching takes place.&nbsp; As I have highlighted in the previous post this does not work in the manner it used to in Windows 7 Pro (nor as it worked in Windows XP Pro for that matter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers&nbsp; Paul</p>

            <p>Yes, the instructions given previously were confusing. Not Configured also should allow Fast User Switching options (though it doesn't for me in Ctrl+Alt+Del).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the real problem for the OP and myself is that when you switch user you get logged out and your running applications are terminated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why a few of us have this problem and no one else does. But I can't believe Microsoft is going to spend much effort fixing it for a small number of people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to try reinstalling Windows 10 to see what happens.</p>

    <title>Skype Manager Subscriptions are priced differently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karlgrimm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Manager Subscriptions are priced differently</h2>
                    <p>The costs for Subscriptions within Skype Manager appear to be different to normal Subscription costs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; US Unlimited within Skype Manager costs AUD$7.99 per month</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; US Unlimited when you login to skype.com costs AUD$4.40 per month</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why? Is it a mistake?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to assign Subscriptions within Skype Manager, for convenience and management. But not if they are double the price!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Does your headphones have audio capability? Windows should start detecting that headphone automatically once you plugged it in unless you have some software conflict. try booting to clean boot and check if it will work in that state.</p>

            Hello,<br />    I haven't had the opportunity to personally try this, but the general consensus is to use USB for external microphones with the Surface Hub. I've heard of mixed success with analog microphone input, but using USB microphone input seems to yield the best results, especially in environments like meeting rooms. If you're limited to analog microphone input then it's certainly possible, but my recommendation is use either a USB microphone or a converter to USB simply because it's been tested to work in a lot of situations and will give you the best control over your audio. <br /><br />Hope this helps!

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<h2>            Laptop when extended to use over a projector have reddish tint</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>Laptop, extended desktop reddish?</span></p>
<p>We have been using a laptop w/vista for several months,&nbsp; this Sunday when we connected it, when the ext desktop came up on the projector, it was reddish (almost looked masked) You could see the picture and everything but with a strong reddish tint. I tried
 displaying the same on both but with the same result. The laptop screen is alright, I tried duplicating the screen with no luck. I tried changing the resolution on the extended desktop with no luck, just changed the aspect. We use powerpoint, but no matter
 what we drag over it looks the same. The dvd works ok on the projector, and when it starts up colors are ok. I am going to try a 2nd laptop on it this afternoon, but I don't believe it is the projector. I think&nbsp;a setting probably got changed. Any help would
 be appreciated. Thanks Bruce</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 1809 start menu tiles only showing down arrows</h2>
                    I've tried EVERY fix posted/available and NOTHING works. The only thing I haven't tried is doing a fresh install because I don't feel I should have to considering the previous versions (1709 and 1803) were both clean installs and I never had a problem
 with the start menu. I've only had a problem since the 1809 update and first it was only a few tiles showing up, now it's all tiles are there but they're just blank or showing a down arrow.&nbsp;

            Hi, MervinWilliams12
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Do you really mean you see a message like this:<br />
<br />
Can't Collect Information<br />
Cannot access the Windows Management Instrumentation software.&nbsp; Windows Management files may be moved or missing.<br />
<br />
Could be easy, could take a few minutes so let's start with the easy:<br />
<br />
Reregister the msinfo32.dll as follows, assuming your XP drive is C: <br />
<br />
Click, Start, Run and in the box enter the following - Include the double quotes":
<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<br />
Click OK and you should see a message similar to:<br />
<br />
DllRegisterServer in C:\WINDOWS\PCHealth\HelpCtr\Binaries\msinfo.dll succeeded.<br />
<br />
Now click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK to see your system information. <br />
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, do this:<br />
<br />
Either the Windows Management Instrumentation Service is not running and/or your Windows Management Instrumentation information files are missing or corrupted. It is easy to rebuild the WMI information files and replace any corrupted or suspicious files.<br />
<br />
To resolve your issue, stop the Windows Management Instrumentation service, rename the suspicious or afflicted WMI folder, then restart your system.&nbsp; When the system restarts, the WMI service will start automatically and rebuild the WMI folder and it's contents
 automatically.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Here is the process:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
services.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Services applet.<br />
<br />
Locate the Windows Management Instrumentation Service.&nbsp; If the Status column says the WMI Service is Started (running), right click the WMI Service and choose to Stop The WMI Service.
<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to stop the Security Center and Windows Firewall Services (with those services stopped your system is vulnerable to attack from the Internet so do not get on the Internet again until you restart your system).<br />
<br />
Now would be a good time to also check the Properties of the WMI Service to be sure the Startup type is set to Automatic so the WMI Service will start automatically the next time the system is rebooted.<br />
<br />
Using Explorer, navigate to the following folder (assuming your boot drive is C):<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\Wbem\<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Locate and then rename the "Repository" folder to something you can remember, such as:<br />
<br />
Repository.old<br />
<br />
Restart the computer and then check the Services again to be sure that the WMI service has restarted automatically and that a new Repository folder has been created to replace the one that was renamed.&nbsp; It may take some time to completely rebuild the Repository
 folder (several seconds or minutes) so wait for it to complete.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
After rebooting, you will notice the wmiprvse.exe Service running in Task Manager and it will keep running until it finishes rebuilding the Repository (this could take a little while).
<br />
<br />
This rebuilding process could take several minutes depending on your system but eventually the wmiprvse.exe Service will complete and should disappear
<br />
from Task Manager.<br />
<br />
If you then look in the Event Viewer Application log, there may be some error messages like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WinMgmt<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
Description:<br />
Failed to load MOF C:\WINDOWS\MICROSOFT.NET\FRAMEWORK\V4.0.30319\MOF\SERVICEMODEL.MOF while recovering repository file.<br />
<br />
This is normal because when the system restarts, the wmiprvse.exe process must rebuild those parts of the repository as well. It is a sequencing error as indicated below. You should not see these errors again after the system has been rebooted and catches up
 with itself and finishes rebuilding the WMI Repository.<br />
<br />
Explanations for the errors seen in the Event Viewer Application log while the WMI repository is rebuilt:<br />
<br />
Explanation<br />
Windows Management Instrumentation might have tried to compile (mofcomp) a .mof file marked for autorecover, but the compilation failed. This failure is probably caused by a sequencing issue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
User Action<br />
To correct the problem, try to compile the .mof file again. If this does not correct the problem, contact the support provider for the program in question.<br />
<br />
You should not have to do anything about these error messages and should not see them again after XP has finished rebuilding the WMI Repository.<br />
<br />
I cannot say how long this rebuilding will take... maybe 10-15 minutes until it settles down completely.<br />

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message occurs if the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service is not started. This can occur if the service is disabled, if a dependent service is not started,
 or if a problem is preventing the WMI service from starting. The System Information utility will be able to collect information after the WMI service is started.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Permanent solution to &#61;&#62; Wi-Fi doesn&#8217;t have valid IP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Permanent solution to &#61;&#62; Wi-Fi doesn&#8217;t have valid IP configuration</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend has a new Lenovo laptop which was working fine until a couple of weeks ago, without any apparent cause, WLAN stopped working.</p>
<p>When I looked at it 2 weeks ago, Troubleshooting identified '"Wi-Fi'' doesn't have valid IP configuration' as the problem. In the same network, my laptop connected with no issue and a smartphone has no problem with the same credentials. So a problem with
 the router is out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a solution on Youtube ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekBhV5VeIt4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekBhV5VeIt4</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/ekBhV5VeIt4?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/ekBhV5VeIt4?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<div>

</div>
), which provided a solution involving using the following settings for TCP/IPv4:
<p>
</p><p>IP adress - 192.168.1.101<br />
subnet mask - 255.255.255.0<br />
default gateway - 192.168.1.1<br />
<br />
Preferd dns server - 8.8.8.8<br />
alternate - 8.8.4.4</p>
<p>
</p><p>[The DEFAULT settings are getting the IP &amp; DNS Server address automatically.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened to restore internet after months.</p>
<p>The problem is 2, 3 weeks down the road, the exact problem is back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that time, I tried to connect it directly to the router with an Ethernet cable &amp; got the same problem, although the same cable delivers internet to another old XP-PC. I did not have time to test if the above problem works for the Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The questions: exactly what triggers this problem on this specific computer?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like a solution that is permanent &amp; does not require this restoration every now &amp; then as I cannot always go to the old lady friend, when the connection she needs for her job fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what's behind this and how can it be permanently dealt with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently to use WIFI, which I urgently needed, this time I used the first solution
<em>&lt;Removed link&gt;</em> which involved using the commands</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>netsh winsock reset ... and then</strong></li><li><strong>netsh int ip reset</strong></li></ul>
<p>After restarting, WIFI was back. </p>
<p><strong>The question, though is, is this a permanent solution? And ... what causes this problem in the first place so it can be avoided?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I never have it for example on the many different desktop computers I use, including on my laptop I use in different networks.
</p>
Thank you in advance.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the problem recurs when connected to WiFi. One thing that is evident here is that the wireless adapter could be having an issue keeping the IP settings. Looking at your post, you've assigned a static DNS to the device which does work, but not
 all the time. We suggest that you set the IP address and DNS servers to obtain automatically so the laptop will automatically receive the settings from the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you update the driver for the laptop's wireless network adapter. Follow the steps
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned above, <strong>the DEFAULT settings were what you are suggesting, of getting the IP &amp; DNS automatically.</strong></p>
<p>At the time the problem originally came up, those settings were not helping.</p>
<p>That's how i came to that solution from the Youtube video with the static values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also mentioned yesterday, I subsequently ...</p>
<p>used the following commands</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>netsh winsock reset ... and then</strong></li><li><strong>netsh int ip reset</strong></li></ul>
<p>After restarting, WIFI was back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I am using the laptop in yet another network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, what originally made the default automatic settings for obtaining the IP &amp; DNS from the router not function? NO ONE changed them!
</p>
<p>What can change the IP &amp; DNS settings? Can a program do so, though the owner would not even know how to install one. ;)</p>
<p>Once again, the static values came LATER as I tried to solve the problem, so they did not cause the original problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, what about the&nbsp;<strong>netsh winsock reset</strong>&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; <strong>netsh int ip reset
</strong>commands? Are/aren't they sufficient? As I said, WIFI &amp; Ethernet were restored, but will this stay so? Currently, the IP &amp; DNS for TCP/IPv4 &amp; v6 are set to be obtained automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; rergards</p>

            Thanks for the feedback. The IP address your computer receives from the network changes or refreshes depending on the DHCP lease time set on the router.&nbsp; With regard to the DNS servers, this also refreshes when there are updates performed by the Internet
 Service Provider. <br />
<br />
If the laptop keeps on losing this information or having a hard time keeping the IP settings, then we suggest that you update the driver for your laptop's wireless network adapter. For more information about updating the driver, check out Update drivers in
 Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further information.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the feedback.</p>
<p>I'm quite aware of the need for drivers to be up-to-date. All available Windows updates &amp; gadget drivers for the specific model from the Lenovo support page had been installed the second time this came up. Since the last post, I know this has come up again
 at least once and the person had to use </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>netsh winsock reset ... and then</strong></li><li><strong>netsh int ip reset</strong></li></ul>
<p>to get back internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really strange. The 1 year old netbook has caused a lot of issues, at one time the sound driver was faulty &amp; microphone did not work, even after sending it back to manufacturer &amp; supposedly resetting it &amp; not even the newest driver then from Lenovo helped.
 They assumed after resetting, it worked, but right in the store, after opening the package &amp; testing it, it worked ONLY at times like before. At the time when a lot of very angry exchanges between owner, the store she bought it &amp; Lenovo support were flying
 around, Microsoft update got an apparently new driver released just around that time, mid-January that was just the right one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network issue is new &amp; unrelated issue, but affecting a gadget with a checkered history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this somehow goes away, by somehow having the right driver released if it is there. One can only install a right driver if it is availed by Windows-Updates or the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you &amp; regards</p>

</div>
<div>At first I thought the media I was using was the issue, but it wasn't as I burnt it onto another brand's DVD as I got the same error, again at around 80% !</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then created <u>another</u> image from the original using ImgBurn, but this time I stored it onto an external HDD which is always connected to my computer. I now tried to burn the iso from this
<u>new</u> copy, and it worked fine, with no errors !</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I want to know why the error shows up when I try to burn it from my C:\ copy of this iso file. I also tried restarting my system to see if this cures it, but it does not ... The error shows up again and again, and always at the same 80% location
 for this file.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried burning it today after 3-4 days from the C:\ location, and again I got this error. So it's definitely something persistent.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I further debug the scenario to see what the problem is, and then how do I solve it ?</div>
                </div>

            <p>ImgBurn is a third party application.</p>
<p>Good call on trying other media.</p>
<p>Could also be the drive.&nbsp; Could be ImgBurn on that machine conflicting with something else.</p>
<p>My bet - the drive.</p>

            Its definitely not ImgBurn because I've used the software for years (from the days when its original parent software 'DVD Decrypter' was considered hot), and have never encountered this error ..
<div><br />
<div>Also, the fact that I was able to burn the file from another location indicates that both the media, burner, and ImgBurn are not responsible in my opinion ... Its the internal HDD, most likely ..</div>
<div><br />
<div>So how can I further determine if the HDD is really at fault or not ... ?</div>

            <p>Have you used it for years on this computer with Windows 7 and the combination of otrher software packages (in the version they are right now - including patches and updates and the likes)?&nbsp; Unlikely.&nbsp; Time marching on&nbsp;- not all software stays at the same
 quality level nor do they necessarily keep up with changing times.&nbsp; Not saying it is bad - but don't throw out thje possibility because of past history unless no other variable has changed (and that isn't going to happen.)</p>
<p>If it is the hard drive - the best way to test it is the drive manufacturer's own diagnostics utilities.&nbsp; You would get them from their web page whomever they are.&nbsp; If it is a decent brand HD - there will be a diagnostics utility.</p>
<p>Could also be <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
bad memory</a> - as that would be the first place the data would go in either direction - and could be corrupted there.</p>

            Well even on my current system, I have used ImgBurn to burn like 100+ DVDs so far at least, as I burn a lot .. and have never had this error before even within the current Windows installation on this system ..
<div><br />
<div>I will check out the hard drive diagnostics tool .. The HDD is a Toshiba one which came with my laptop about 6 months ago ..</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I actually wanted was, is there is tool when can quickly go through a file, read its very byte, and make sure its readable and everything .... or not ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>So that before burning in the future, I can pass the ISO file through such a software, which then gives me the go ahead that this file is readable by the system, so that I know it won't generate a coaster (i.e. failed burn) .. ?</div>

            <p>Even if you wasted the time doing that every single time - the chances of getting a coaster are no higher.</p>
<p>My bet is that the ISO file you have - if moved to another computer - would probably burn fine.</p>
<p>In my decades of burning media like that - i usually first try a different burner then a different system and sometimes have even had to resort to changing the location on the system so that it had plenty of space for temprary files on the disk from which
 it was burning (early days - not so much of a problem now.)</p>
<p>The lasers in todays CD/DVD drives just are not as carefully aligned/manufacturered as they used to be when your choices were really only the big producers of the product (used to swear by Plextor).&nbsp; It is possible as well - given the hit and miss nature
 of the problem after a given amount of time and how many CDs/DVDs you said you have burned on this drive - that it needs cleaning and/or it will need to be replaced soon.</p>

            Shenan, I understand your points but consider this:
<div><br />
<div>I burn the C:\ location file 4 times, and everytime I get the error precisely at the exact same location (at 80%) ...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then, without restarting or doing any system changes, I make a new image, put it on an external HDD, and then make 2 burns of this newly created image ... Both not only burn fine, they are also verified by ImgBurn that the burns were successful ...</div>
<div><br />
<div>So its pretty obvious here that the cause is something related to the C:\ copy of this image which I'm trying to burn, because burning it repeatedly from the external HDD location has always been a success ..</div>
<div><br />
<div>And by the way, I didn't waster blank media on all this testing .. I used rewritables ..</div>
<div><br />
<div>And something which I just tried now ... I tried copying the C:\ file back into C:\ .... so that Windows starts creating 'DVD - copy.iso' .... I did not expect this, but it happened ... The copy progress bar went fine uptill the 80% point, at which point
 is stopped moving forward ... I kept monitoring it for 7-8 minutes, and the progress bar didn't budge .. The system also became insanely slow for some reason (I tried opening MS Paint to take a picture, and the program took 3-4 minutes to open!) ... I had
 to end the copy process to restore the sanity ..</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I'm currently repeating the above experiment to verify its result .</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: Just did the above test again ... Same thing happened .. Got stuck at 80% .. Had to abandon the copy process .... So its confirmed to me now the issue is with this C:\ copy of this image ..</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT 2: I had to hard reset my system because WIndows had completely freaked out at the 80% mark problem, despite having cancelled the process like before ..</div>

<p><span>Hi Alex,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to your description,
</span>I notice the issue you are experiencing is that <span>
of the Skype for Business 2016 client on your organization crash when trying to open. If yes, I suggest you firstly clear the Skype for Business cache and then check if same issue occurs again.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this go to:
</span></p>
<p><span>- Navigate to&nbsp;<strong><em>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync&nbsp;</em></strong><em>folder.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span>- Delete your sip profile folder.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>- Open&nbsp;<strong>Tracing</strong>&nbsp;folder, delete all the contents inside, but not the Tracing folder itself.</span></em></p>
<p><span>- restart the computer to refresh.</span></p>
<p><span>If the method above doesn't work, I suggest you update the version of Office suite to the latest version to see if same issue still exist. Please refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>could you please provide the following information for troubleshooting?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make some changes such as update the version of Office client when the issue occur?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 48px"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are the log you provided Windows Event Log? If yes, please provide us with the entire log.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If not, I suggest you do the following troubleshooting steps:</span></p>

<h2>            How do I fix Windows Media Player 12&#63;</h2>
                    Okay I have been having some issues with windows media player. I have music and playlists under "My Music" and sometimes windows media player will "forget" some of the files I have and only display some of them in the media player. This requires me to
 rebuild the media library by going into app data. My question is this:<br />
<br />
If there is another way to fix my problem with windows media player in regards to not displaying all media files properly?

<h2>            Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection.</h2>
                    I have been using this account and have had problems before and it was linked to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
All settings and ports are correct.<br />
<br />
There is no firewall problem.<br />
<br />
I have uninstalled and reinstalled and this does nothing.<br />
<br />
The email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** linked to my website with GO DADDY and I am able to make everything work with GO DADDY. I also get a message when signing in that the email address is wrong or the password is incorrect.<br />
<br />
When having no success signing in and getting the above messages that the email address or password is wrong I then try SYNCING and SENDING ALL EMAILS ACCOUNTS and I get the below message:&nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">We apologize for the inconvenience this matter may have caused you.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">There&nbsp;are&nbsp;2 possible reasons why you experienced that error message:</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><font color="#000000">
<p><span>1. Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so</span></p>
</font></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If this is the case, I suggest that you reconfigure your account. You may refer to
