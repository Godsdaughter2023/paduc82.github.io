<h2>            Nokia e72, gmail setup &#43; syncing contacts and calendar with gmail</h2>
                    
<p>My objective was to</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) get my contacts into the phone from this account, as I had on my old windows mobile device</p>
<p>2) set up my gmail account on my new nokia e72</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) getting contacts from gmail into the phone.</p>
<p>Go here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=147951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=147951</a></p>
<p>and carefully do whatever is instructed.</p>
<p>*This works for calendar also (I assume you will want your google calendar to come into the phone, and sync thereafter. But all-day entries on google become 24 hour entries, modified by your timezone (eg xyz birthday, 15 mar 2010 5.00 am to 16 mar 2010 5.00
 am). Otherwise the calendars seem to sync ok therafter (didn't spend much time there).</p>
<p>*<strong>This does not work for tasks</strong>. (read the google sync instructions carefully for nokia. but not for tasks, or for email bodies (though email headers sync, and you can probably create and send, and delete etc your email on the phone)</p>
<p>*<strong>This does not work email either</strong>, ie you can see the message headers, but can't see the bodies of emails on the phone.</p>
<p>The explanation for this I found after much digging is that Mail for Exchange on Nokia is actually meant for Microsoft ActiveSync servers, and Google is providing limited sync facilities using this ....system. (correct me if I'm wrong). See the datasheets
 on Nokia Europe websites about Mail for Exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over all, a pity, but you can't blame Nokia. As for Google (in whose hands further improvement lies for MFE playing nice with google mail), I hope, and believe they will make things better here (unless they lose their interest in it like they did with google
 gears).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)Now getting your <strong>email</strong> from gmail into your nokia E72: Here
<strong>Nokia is at fault, and a serious deficiency. </strong>I went to email setup in the menu's and started the wizard to create a new account. It seemed to have preconfigured setups for common email providers like gmail, yahoo etc. I started the gmail set
 up wizard, keyed in my username and password, then waited 5 seconds, and the screen went back to the previous one. This kept repeating, every time I tried. Tried everything: checked internet connectivity (wifi), closed all other apps including the MFE I had
 set up earlier, switched off and on the phone, everything short of standing on my head. So what works? How do you set up a personal gmail account on your nokia e72? go here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techniqx.com/2010/02/workaround-for-configuring-gmail.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techniqx.com/2010/02/workaround-for-configuring-gmail.html</a></p>
<p>(I paste that text here in case that page is removed:</p>
<p>"<span>The email software in Nokia E72 still has lots of bugs. To configure your Gmail account, it’s not as easy as selecting Gmail and entering the credentials. That simply won’t work as there is a bug. Instead, workaround is to select “Other” and enter
 a false id like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, this will take you to the next page to select the type. Select “POP/IMAP”. Now, you will get an option to enter your credentials and modify advanced settings. Here
 change your email id back to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and enter the credentials as mentioned here&gt; (the gmail site for imap manual setup):</span></p>

<p>")</p>
<p>And you have gmail set up. Quite inelegant process of setting up gmail on this nokia phone, I would say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia, please iron out the bugs and inconsistencies in your flagship models' primary functions. Otherwise the phone functions very well, the interface is nice and attractive. And while the bugs are still there, please put up the limitations and&nbsp; the workarounds
 if any prominently. Nobody expects 100 % perfection.</p>

<p>I setup my gmail on E72 a few days ago. It used to work fine. But today it gets really slow. It takes forever to connect and disconnect. If I delete an email on the phone, it doesn't sync on the server. It is still there next time I open email. So frustrated.
 Seriously, this is the last Nokia phone I am going to buy.</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My email has been set up correctly but can anyone tell me how I can sync my Gmail contacts and Gmail calendar on an Nokia E72?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: I have also tried to export my Gmail contacts on to a csv file then import them into Nokia PC Suite and it doesn't recognise most of my entries in the csv file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I have exactly the same issue. Have to wipe account from E72 and start again.&nbsp; Then after a couple weeks phone starts to grind to a halt when checking email. Have gone through the manual Gmail setup as described above but now the phone keeps asking which
 connection to use when checking email?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I need to setup something else so that the mailbox is checked automatically without being asked what connection to use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia please sort this out. You are forcing people to migrate to Android! Don't let a Nokia fan have to move for the sake of a stable email platform. E72 was purchased on the back of it's messaging strengh!</p>

<p>First of all i am so glad the new firmware is out, but too bad&nbsp;its still dont solve this problem. Setup mail just dont work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, I was hoping&nbsp;for a solutions&nbsp;on this issues, and yet found out there is still&nbsp;alot&nbsp;of bugs even the mail is successfully setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an business phone, if the mail fuctions dont works for a&nbsp;well known&nbsp;email provider (gmail). Cant imagine&nbsp;if come to&nbsp;coorporate wise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia please do something. The user dnt wana caught in situations where&nbsp;people asking "why your e-72 cant get through the mail setup?"&nbsp;Beliave us,&nbsp;its really make us looks very bad.</p>

<h2>            Can text flow from wide column to narrow column&#63;</h2>
                    A newsletter has two columns - they are not the same width for good reasons - on page 1. Pages 2 through N have two equal-width columns. Pages O through X do not have columns - just ordinary pages. Is it possible for text to naturally (be made to) flow
 from Page 1, Column 2 to Page 2 Column 1? The rest is drop-dead easy.

            With ordinary text, no. Changing the number or widths of columns requires a section break, and text can't flow across a section break.<br />
<br />
A workaround is to use text boxes. Insert one text box in the first column of page 1, then another text box in the second column, and a third and fourth text box on page 2, and so on. With the cursor in the first text box, click the Create Link button in the
 Text group of the Drawing Tools tab, and then click in the second text box. From there, create a link to the third text box, and so on.<br />
<br />
You can chain together up to 32 text boxes in one story.<br />
<br />
If your newsletter has more than one story, it would be best to use the text boxes only for the story that starts on page 1, and then use regular columns for the rest.<br />
<br />
Something you may not need for this project but that might come in handy elsewhere: you can start two or three stories on page 1, and have separate chains of text boxes that lead to different inside pages.<br />

<h2>            how do I remove my name and picture for the upper right corner of Word, Excel and PPT&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was just upgraded to 2013.&nbsp; Now all of the products display my name and picture in the upper right corner.&nbsp; It bothers me to have to look at my name and picture on every window that is open!&nbsp; I know who I am and what I look like.&nbsp; More practically, when
 the ribbon is minimized, the down arrow to open the ribbon is now hidden by the name and picture.&nbsp; There must be some setting to not display this.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to simply not display the account name and picture?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the responses.&nbsp; Signing out is not really a solution as this will sign me out of all office applications and have multiple consequences (as noted in the nice dialog box that pops up when I try to do this).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'm surprised to hear that the arrow that was previously available to unhide the ribbon via one click now requires multiple clicks or a multi-key sequence.&nbsp; The up-arrow to hide the ribbon is still available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The down-arrow was a nice feature.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Star_Lord♂,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no way to restore a Distribution Group or Security Group in Office 365. Because DG and SG don't have attached mailbox, they're just a collection of email addresses. Only deleted Office 365 groups can appear in the deleted group page. In this scenario,
 you can just create the new DG or SG with the same name of the deleted one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the Azure AD module, did you install the General Availability version of Azure AD Module before? If so, you cannot install the preview version.</p>
<p>

            2011 is re-write of sorts. its cross between Office2007 and Office 2010&nbsp; with changes for feature that will work on a Mac and changing of commands key combos and others to what will work on the Mac. Unfortunate they left a bit of PC code in. This code
 cause the problem you run into. unfortunately the code is embedded so deep if it was remove the entire Office Suite would blow up. So we have to deal with an issue we've never had sinc Mac has been on the scene.<br />
<br />
2011 has a bit of accidental PC code in that does not allow certain forbidden Characters. However; it so deep in code if they can't take it out without the whole application suite blowing up.
<br />
<br />
Some of the forbidden Characters are:<br />
Numbers before names, Superscript/Subscripts, "&nbsp; '&nbsp; \ | / &lt; &gt; { } [ ] &lt;&lt;&nbsp; &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Numbers after Names are okay.&nbsp; None of these character can be used in name of Hard Drive, Directory Names, and any File Names.<br />
<br />
And on servers no names can have the name File or Fileserver&nbsp; in any path names. <br />
<br />
You can use _ (underscores).<br />
<br />
in addition to those Macs have never allowed :: . <br />

    <title>Update user logins to SSO UPN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexander v sapozhkov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update user logins to SSO UPN</h2>
                    <p>Hello colleagues,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are installing SSO for existing O365 tenant. Existing user accounts are like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. We have configured own domain and configured ADFS for UPN like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Now in SharePoint we need to merge the existing
 user information data with a new accounts so that all the authoring information and permissions point to the new accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, user *** Email address is removed for privacy *** has created some document. He also changed permissions on the document so that only this account has write permissions and other users can only read. Now when we configure SSO we need to ensure that the new
 account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** will be specified as "Created By" and take editor permissions from the existing account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to do it in SharePoint Online for site collections, OneDrive, profiles, etc.? Is there a more common way of doing it in Office 365?</p>

<p>We tried to use this approach but when we look at office 365 user in admin center, there is no such thing as SMTP address. These users do not have Exchange Online license, they only have SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also tried to add &lt;user&gt;@&lt;tenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com account&nbsp;to AD&nbsp;proxyAddresses and then sync but this just created a new duplicate account in Office 365 so both old onmicrosoft and new SSO account coexisted. Perhaps it did not match because users in Office
 365 do not have Exchange Online license and did not have SMTP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We decided to leave this attempt&nbsp;and we will manually handle all the permissions and other matters I've described earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for helping me out.</p>

<h2>            Word doc changes to asterisk - How to get data back from the series of asterisk&#63; Can see momentarily in TextEdit, but disappears before I can copy</h2>
                    <p>I had been working for the last 90 mins on a doc and suddenly it just changed to asterisk. Having faced this problem earlier, I immediately copied the series of asterisks to my gmail and mailed it to myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed the process described here in other discussions, but somehow there is no autorecovery file of that available at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, when I copy-paste the series of asterisks to a google doc, it remains as asterisks. When I copy in text-edit, legible words, hopefully, my file, appears for less than a sec and then changes to asterisks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way I can recover the data from that?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Chatchan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As file restoring or recovering are not options in our forum, you may need to search for some third-party method to recover that file. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For "cannot update" issue, you can firstly click Help&gt;Check for Updates&gt;and then click Microsoft AutoUpdate on the top bar&gt;About Microsoft AutoUpdate to check its version. If it's not 3.9.17060300, you may download the latest autoupdate version
<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. And then check if you can update Office 2011 for Mac. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another method is firstly <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2011-for-Mac-4bfcd230-0ea1-4656-bf30-dbfa44d358fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstalling the Office suite</a>, and then directly download and install the latest version of Office 2011 for Mac from
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>. To use this method, please make sure you can activate Office 2011 for Mac after reinstalling.</p>

<p>If the "cannot update Office 2011 for Mac" issue persists, I suggest you post a new thread in our forum as it's not the initial issue in the thread. Our engineers will troubleshoot the issue with you in the new thread. Meanwhile, other members who encounter

            That step was successful in registering ole32 but didnt change the behavior of the syncing.WMDC says it ssyncing but the PPC sits there trying to sync with nothing happening forever. If I stop the sync in WMDC, the PPC still sits there trying to sync.
 I press stop on the pPC but it doesnt stop for a very long time. Also, the notes sync item is always unchecked everytime I look, I recheck it, but then when I reopen WMDC, its unchecked again. Also, why does WMDC alsways take me to add/remove programs when
 I first start it, I always just clcik on OK because there is nothing to do there.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is part of the problem:<br />
<br />
I have 3 items listed inthe PPC activesync. the first is MS Exchange, then home-PC, then Work PC. It syncs with Excahnge then stops. It doesnt go on to the Home PC. I often get a message saying cannot obtain a servier assigned IP address.

<br />
I forgot to mention that you need to reboot your computer after running the Regsvr32 command. Do that and let us know if that fixes the issue.<br />

            Just to followup, did Linley's suggestion to reboot fix the issue?&nbsp; if not, just to verify ... everything is syncing at Work fine but&nbsp;at home notes do not sync (either by Exchange or by Outlook sync)?

            I'll give this a try and get back to you. Sync at work or home with MS Exchange works fine, I just can sync anything at home now using the usb cable, earlier it was notes as I described above. I can sync everyhting but notes at home thru bluetooth connecttion.
 Also can you comment on why whenever I connect at home, I get the add-remove programs dialog.

<blockquote>&nbsp;I just can sync anything at home now using the usb cable, earlier it was notes as I described above. I can sync everyhting but notes at home thru bluetooth connecttion.</blockquote>
So, using the cable, Notes will sync?&nbsp; Usually if it is just Notes that do not sync (cable or bluetooth), the issue can occur if your Personal Folders Store (.pst) file is damaged.
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also can you comment on why whenever I connect at home, I get the add-remove programs dialog.</blockquote>
My first thought on this is that somehow the PC thinks you installed a new program for your device and it was not connected at the time of the install.&nbsp; So now when you connect, that dialog comes up for the install.&nbsp; Have you recently installed something without
 the device connected?&nbsp; Is there something on that list that you wanted on the device but is NOT checked?<br />

            Using the cable, nothing syncs. I get a connection and the PC says its syncing but nothing is happeniong on the smartphone. Wehn I connect via bluetooth, both exchange and the desktop PC sync fine except notes dont sync. EIther cable of bluetooth connection
 starts out with the add-remove programs. I dont have anything that it needs to install, all the chekced items have 0 Mb meaning they are already installed. I have repaired the .pst folder already. Still looking for ideas.<br />

    <title>Messages sync hangs on certain SMS&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Messages sync hangs on certain SMS&#39;s</h2>
                    I've just found that My Phone message sync will hang over if there are any "[no sender]"&nbsp; texts in device database. Maybe it is wise to skip those faulty elements (because it is impossible to delete them using "delete" option)?<br />
<br />
I didn't know where the problem is, My phone stopped at about 402 messege from end and... kept freezing on that one so I started looking around (IMO My Phone should tell on which item sync was stopped/interrupted etc) and finally found that my phone had lost
 sender informations in three texts. After some googling I've found nice app to edit device cemail.vol and I've fially deleted that faulty items.<br />
<br />
My Phone finished successfully :)<br />
<br />
PS. Really nice service!<br />

Hopefully you saved your file, but if you have an application freeze you can usually close it using the 'task manager'. Hit your Ctrl+Alt+Delete keys all at once. This should open the Task Manager &gt; Applications tab and select Publisher and 'end task'. This
 should shut down Pubisher.</p>

    <title>Outlook profile does not start with cache mode on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook profile does not start with cache mode on</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a PC I am struggling to fix Outlook for, but nothing worked so far. I tried repairing, reinstalling Office and also OS re-installation, but I get to the same point. Outlook profiles start only for a few seconds when the cache mode is on, then they
 close. There is no error message displayed on the screen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is fine when the cache mode is off. The profile starts normally&nbsp;and Outlook can be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the local drive could be faulty, but before engaging the service provider I was thinking to ask for support here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Van,
<br />Can you start outlook in safe mode with cached mode on? To open Outlook in Safe mode: Close Outlook then hold Ctrl as you click on the Outlook icon. You'll get a message asking if you want to start in Safe mode. Click Ok.  
<br />
<br />Do you have a second drive? You could change the location of the data file and see if it works.  I have steps here - <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/exchange/moving-outlook-ost-file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/exchange/moving-outlo...</a> - you may need to make a new profile to test it.

            Hi Van,
<br />You have come to the Microsoft community for web version of outlook for support. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a>
<br />It seems you are having problems with your mail application lets see what we can do to get that fixed for you. 
<br />One of the first troubleshooting steps I always take is to do a restart of device. Shutdown does not sometimes release the memory so go to the power setting and restart. Once backup try opening outlook again and see if it has resolved anything. If not then let's gather some details 
<br />What type of account are you using is it a personal email account such as hotmail or gmail or a business account? No email addresses please just what is after the @ sign 
<br />What Outlook version are you using? 
<br />What type of file is it OST or PST? 
<br />It may be the size of the actual file that is causing problems. 
<br />Knowing what you are using for outlook version I can help you navigate if you don't know where to go to look for the above information. 
<br />This may be a place to start
<br />Create a new profile for your account

<br />Let me know and we can continue to solve the problem.

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. Outlook does not start even in safe mode if the cache mode is enabled for that profile.</p>
<p>The laptop only has one drive and USB ports are blocked (Infosec).</p>

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. Below you can find my replies to your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have tried the restart repeatedly.</p>
<p>The account is a business account.</p>
<p>Outlook version is o365 Pro Plus 64 bit.</p>
<p>There is no PST mapped to the Outlook profile which does not start, only the OST file that was generated initially is linked to it. The OST size should not be an issue - it is below 5GB.</p>
<p>I tried creating a new profile and it only worked for a few hours, then the behavior was the same as for the previous profile.</p>
<p>

            Hi Van,
<br />You may want to check with your IT department as the Size of the Exchange mailbox size for your account would be set on the exchange server. If when you create a new profile it works then it is usually because it takes time for all the emails to download again so that would make sense. 
<br />The OST file could also be corrupted.
<br /><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/e5a23fb2-0007-4aa3-9ab0-b2664c06b821/outlook-cached-mode-not-updating-folders-from-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/...</a>
<br />I would suggest talking with your IT department or trying to find a solution on 
<br />Technet the site that I sent you to. 
<br />You can always try to log into outlook online With your business email and see what storage is available for your email if you company webmail is set up. Click on the link below and sign in. If it doesn't take you directly to the storage setting then while logged in click on the link again.
<br /><a href="https://outlook.office.com/mail/options/general/storage/mailboxStorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office.com/mail/options/general...</a>

<br />Since its a business account, run SaRA and see if that finds any problem.

<p>Yes, I'm in the slow ring. But surely slow ring isn't on a month+ old build for this long? 17692 came out on like June 11th. It has a lot of issues that I hoped would be fixed with the next build like 17704. Why haven't I been moved up yet? I wish another
 slow ring user could chime in.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried sharing my Office Home 365 subscription with a brand new home computer, and logged in on this Microsoft account (different to the account used to buy Office). When I click the link from the email asking me to accept the invitation, it shows the 'you
 are invited' screen. Pressing get started takes me to a log in step, which is fine, but after that it asks for a 'little more info to set up your account'. After I enter the first and last name associated with the account, it gives me an error and I cannot
 get any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error says 'There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later.'</p>

            Hi Jack.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to repair the store:
<br /> 
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Do you need to download Powershell? I only have a very small computer, with a max. storage limit of 28 gigabits. I think probably deleted one of the files for windows store to function properly to free up space, so I think I kind of deleted on of them, I
 cannot get it back, as all the window's system take up like 20 gigabits on my computer, and it is very uncontrollable of whether the storage will change or not.</p>

            Power shell should not be affected by tight storage so I'd continue with all steps to repair store.
<br />
<br />
<br />I will also give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  You need to update to a newer version in order to be safe and this is the way to go as it doesn't take any space and along with all other steps actually saves space.
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest version since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>I just tried out the top link, and I managed to delete some Temp files, but I am still having trouble with the WSReset method which I haven't tried, it said the store will automatically open, when the program finishes commanding, but for me the windows store
 will open right when the WSReset was open, I don't know if this is suppose to happen, or it's just my computer needs like some real legit fixing to do.</p>

            Jack, I'd follow the latest steps I gave over the next few days as you hve time to learn how to make space on a really tight drive, then do the Version Upgrade by the method I gave which takes no space to do, and since it reinstalls Windows will solve almost all problems and get you to a newer and therefore safer version.

            Hello JackMeng,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<h2>            Excel features disabled because it hasn&#39;t been activated.</h2>
                    <p>I have Excel 2010 installed on my desktop. &nbsp;This morning a spreadsheet I had left opened was closed. &nbsp;When I opened it, I got the error message that excel features had been disabled because it hadn't been activated. &nbsp;I noticed that it was opened as excel
 2016, which I don't have. &nbsp;Excel 2016 is set as default. &nbsp;I selected free trial so that I could retrieve the info in my spreadsheets. &nbsp;The error message went away but I am unable to make any changes within the spreadsheet. &nbsp;Why was my spreadsheet tampered
 with? &nbsp;How do I fix this mess? &nbsp;How do I prevent it from happening again? &nbsp;This looks like some underhanded trick on MS's part to get me to upgrade. &nbsp;Open as Excel 2010 is not shown as an option even though it is installed on my computer.</p>

            Office 2010 is already activated and has been for several years. &nbsp;It's asking me to activate Office 2016, which I do not want. &nbsp;Respectfully, I do need to do something because my docs will only open in 2016, which I have no interest in purchasing. &nbsp;There
 is no option in default for 2010, only 2016 and search for apps in the store. &nbsp;MS had no business changing my default to 2016 without my knowledge or permission and, as a result costing me hours of my precious time trying to reset my computer the way I want
 it set. &nbsp;

<p>You said you didn't have Excel 2016.&nbsp; Then you said you do have Excel 2016 because you downloaded it as a free trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; You seemed to indicate that you did that after&nbsp;you received the activate message.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that is the case, then regardless of how long excel
 2010 has been activated, the message appears to refer to excel 2010 because as you said you don't have excel 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to remove Excel 2016, you can do it&nbsp;using the control panel. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regardless of the situation, you should be able to open Excel 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; By selecting it in the start menu.&nbsp;Then you can use file open (in Excel 2010)&nbsp;to open your excel file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several versions of excel installed and I am to do this with each version regardless of which version is marked as the default.

<p>I did not download 2016. &nbsp;When I closed down 2 days ago, I only had 2010. &nbsp;When I started the day yesterday, everything was in 2016 and all of my defaults were changed to 2016. &nbsp;I was unable to open any existing excel or word doc in 2010. &nbsp;When I clicked
 on open as, only 2016 was a listed option. &nbsp;When I selected whatever the choice was for other options, it took me to the MS store to choose another app. &nbsp;I didn't want another app to install. &nbsp;I wanted 2010, which was already installed on my computer, activated
 and in proper working order for several years right up through my last use 2 days ago. &nbsp;I was unable to change the defaults back to 2010 because they were not available as options, another underhanded trick by MS that requires hours of searching forums to
 resolve. &nbsp;I only activated the 2016 because it was the only way I could access my docs. &nbsp;It was not asking me to activate 2010. &nbsp;The doc was opened in 2016. &nbsp;The message said that parts of excel were disabled because the product had never been activated. &nbsp;When
 I clicked on activate, it gave me 3 choices: &nbsp;free trial of 365, paid subscription and log in/enter product key. &nbsp;When I logged in, it said that that product was not registered to me. &nbsp;When I entered product key - 2010, which was the only one I have since
 I have never purchased or downloaded 2016 - it said that that product key was not for a 2016 product. &nbsp;I could open a blank excel or word doc but could not access the existing ones. &nbsp;This is the third time in the past few months that MS has changed things
 on my computer during their updates. &nbsp;And it's not an issue just with me and it's not just with office. &nbsp;It's been widely documented on forums. &nbsp;It ranges from changing installed programs like office to disabling security software that is in competition with
 MS. &nbsp;I spent several hours yesterday working on undoing this change that was done in the middle of the night, not by me. &nbsp;I was afraid to uninstall 2016 because I didn't know whether it would completely prevent me from being able to access these essential
 documents. &nbsp;Now that my Sunday was ruined, I have uninstalled the unwanted, uninvited program. &nbsp;There should be some way we can prevent MS takeover of our personal property. &nbsp;I know that there is software out there that claims to be able to do that - another
 indication that this is not simply user error on my part. &nbsp;However, after I was finally able to get access to my docs, set 2010 as default and was able to access my existing docs, I uninstalled 2016 and went to the start menu, right clicked on excel to access
 my existing docs, I got the error message: &nbsp;The item you selected is unavailable. &nbsp;It might have been moved, renamed or removed. &nbsp;I accessed the folder for one of the files and clicked on the file. &nbsp;I got this error message: &nbsp;This file does not have a program
 associated with it for performing this action. &nbsp;Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create and association in the Default Programs control panel. &nbsp;When I went to the control panel, I found this message next to several programs, including
 word and excel: &nbsp;Unknown application. &nbsp;When I clicked on that, I got this message: &nbsp;You'll need a new app to open this .xls file. &nbsp;I went to the office 2010 link and clicked on install. &nbsp;It had never been uninstalled. &nbsp;Instead of installing it showed this
 message: &nbsp;Configuring Microsoft Office Home and Business 2010. &nbsp;For the moment, I am able to access word and excel docs.</p>

            <p>This time I used the Outlook internal app (using denim) and put the accounts into it, in denim they work FINE, mail updates as the messages arrive, whereas in the 10 preview the system just sits and as I stated. Having to re-install the accounts to update
 the mail is just dumb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still holding onto denim until a fix of the problem in 10 has been posted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Denim has it;s own problems, like dropping bluetooth connections within 5 minutes, the 10 version dropped bluetooth in about 1/2 hour so you are getting there on that problem.</p>

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm using Skype iOS ver. 8.18.0.8(2018.11.01.10).</p>
<p>I want to make a call from Japan(+81) to China(+86).</p>
<p>When I call likes +862081234567 by Skype, but the called number is changed to +81862081234567.</p>
<p>Anyone knows what happen about it?</p>
<p>I think there have a function likes "calling assistant" that if wrong number, it can be changed to correct number.</p>

<p>Hi! E for Excel!</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I dial to Japan, China and Hong Kong, no any problem by normal phone or mobile.</p>
<p>But some phone number dialed and connect correctly, the number will be changed to shown from +86234567890 to +8186234567890.</p>
<p>The point is, I can dial and speak to the phone normally at the moment,, but I cannot redial from dial history.</p>
<p>Since the dial history is shown the changed number +8186234567890 but not +86234567890 what I dialed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it any likes dial assistant for correct the dial number automatic?</p>
<p>But I don't need this function...</p>

            I would suggest you should chat with a live agent from Skype Support to check the status of your account. If chat support is not able to solve your problem, ask him to create a support ticket.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options in chat support allow you to chat with a live agent. When you click on above link, choose following to reach out to a live agent as per your problem category.
<br />
<br />Choose a help topic - Account &amp; sign-in
<br />Choose a related problem - Can not access paid services OR Account is blocked
<br />Next
<br />
<br />Now you will the get the option of - Text chat support
