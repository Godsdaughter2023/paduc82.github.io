<h3> larry bridglal  say:</h3>
<h2>            365 Business Domain Setup</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Office 365 Business Plan E1, the basic plan and it came with a web domain and email address for business.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called microsoft and only got gangsters, who told me that they will call me back and did not or non english speaking people who can't comprehend or answer any questions, who only created a case number after bouncing me around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Questions? are;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Can the domain name I received with the subscription be merged with my Wix site?</p>
<p>2) Can I create a web page on microsoft and do I have to? to be able to use this domain name and email address?</p>
<p>3) Can I receive emails for business from the email address that was given with my purchase of Office 365 Business?.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Hello Larry. I'm Rey, a Community Expert willing to help the users.
<br />
<br />1. The domain name that Microsoft assigned to you should en in "onmicrosft.com" cannot be merged with your Wix site.
<br />
<br />2. There is no option to create a web page with this domain. 
<br />
<br />3. Yes you can receive emails to this domain that was given to you.
<br />
<br />The recommendation is not to use this given domain, instead of that you should add your domain to Office 365 and configure the emails account with that.
<br />
<br />
<br />Best Regards

    <title>EMPTY &#39;UnreadMail&#39; folder in Outlook &#40;Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            EMPTY &#39;UnreadMail&#39; folder in Outlook &#40;Office 365 Personal&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All..</p>
<p>I recently installed Office 365 Personal, and added 4 email accounts to Outlook.</p>
<p>I can see <strong>unread</strong> emails in all of the individual accounts, but nothing is showing up in the pre-configured
<strong>unread mail</strong> folder in the favorites box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched and experimented with several settings, and the only folder I can see linked to
<strong>unread mail</strong> is <strong>personal folders</strong>&nbsp;I have looked to see how to link my email's inbox to both of these folders, but as yet am unable to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had this same problem on Outlook 2007 when I was looking for an alternative program to Windows Live Mail. (WLM worked perfectly and should never have been dropped)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Roy</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Update 8.24pm (16-7-2016)</p>
<p>Just spent an hour and 40 minutes with a Microsoft 'Tec' driving my laptop to correct this issue...</p>
<p>(Ref Number:<strong>1347485715</strong>) if Microsoft bother to read this)</p>
<p>
</p><p>She tried for about 30 mins in total silence, then asked a few more questions, then spent another 40 mins restoring outlook, creating new accounts and basically hopping back in and out of folder options (that I had already tried) and continued to try adding
 search folders 1 after another to the list, all of which got no further..</p>
<p>I finally got to the point where it wasn't as entertaining anymore, so I asked her politely to give up.</p>
<p>She tried for a few more minutes and I asked her to give up, and said "This is why you should never have stopped supporting Windows Live Mail"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>She then clicked CLOSE on the chat box and closed the pc share app before I even had chance to grab my mouse and save the chat..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft help !!!!! &nbsp;haha .. ok, if thats what you call it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS.. still unresolved, but if I fix it, i'll post it here.. Pointless asking Microsoft to do anything..</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks Hal</p>
<p>I had already listed each of my inboxes in favourites, and after watching Microsoft struggle for nearly 2 hours yesterday I figured out I could add individual unread folders like in your suggestion above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad you mentioned it, because it's not the fix I was looking for, so I would probably not have thought to write it as a suggestion for others that may be in the same situation. It is a good workaround that may be of use to many people. I have a version
 of it that i'm using now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I currently have, is an <strong>unread</strong> folder for each of my accounts listed one above the other
<strong>in favourites</strong>, and under that I have added <strong>outbox</strong> (Just in case I miss a sent mail that's got stuck), then under these I have separate folders for each of my
<strong>inboxes</strong> so that I have easy access to unread mail, and also quick access to inboxes without needing to scroll through unwanted folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does make for an excellent '<em>meet me half way</em>' compromise, but I would still rather have the ability to combine all those unread folders into 1.</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail managed it as a standard feature without and user input even needed to set it up, it was just there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows of an alternative solution or even a different mail client that has this feature, to share JUST unread emails from many accounts into one folder, I would be interested to hear about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Sparky</p>

            That's not the case. For example, the Photo beamer app is now available for all Lumia phones. Though it will take some time but atleast all the Nokia &amp; Microsoft apps compatible with Wp 7.8 will get there. As for the applications from other sources, you
 need to contact the developers in this regard.

            Time and technology move on if you want the latest features sometimes you just have to buy a new phone. More features are coming to WP7.8, just be patient, moaning about it here will not achieve anything at all.

            I am just saying that you must include the maximum features it can support<br />
<br />
I am not intended to have wp8 on Lumia 1st generation devices<br />
<br />
For example<br />
<br />
Xbox music instead of Zune<br />
<br />
Marking of messages for deletion of multiple messages<br />
<br />
<br />
like wp8<br />
<br />
you know that these features will be supported to 1 st generation devices

psychomania<br />
<br />
but I think Nokia should request / ask for the above features to Microsoft to make their customers happy<br />
<br />
and above Zune was just an example ,,,, okay<br />

            They probably already have asked. All you can do is wait and see as posting here will not change things.

<p>HERE Maps is not available on Windows 10 Mobile devices. What you are using is Windows Maps. Make sure the app is up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your problem, Map searches also start with alphabets rather than numbers. There's no setting to change the keyboard layout for that, however you can suggest it via the Feedback Hub app from your phone.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>cannot purchase music in MixRadio&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muzica---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot purchase music in MixRadio&#33;</h2>
                    I get the error message "cannot connect to the payment service" every time I try to buy a song or album in Nokia Mixradio.<br />
I checked in Settings/email&amp;accounts and it appears that I am logged in.<br />
On my old android, anything I bought just went through AT&amp;T (my carrier) and appeared on my cell phone bill.<br />
I called AT&amp;T and they were clueless. The rep couldn't even figure out how to get onto Nokia's support section.<br />
Why is it such a mystery? Why does it seem like Nokia no longer has any kind of tech support? All the "help links" just take you in circles or give idiot blanket answers at best.<br />
<br />
Anyway, does anyone know how to purchase music on Nokia Mixradio on AT&amp;T in the U.S., California???<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    <title>Peripheral support on Windows 10 on an iMac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew hill&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Peripheral support on Windows 10 on an iMac</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Windows 10 insider program on my iMac (2014) over the weekend. Apologies that the feedback is via forum rather than using the tool - but it had to be uninstalled again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally it does look to be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, having done the upgrade from Windows update, I found two immediate show-stoppers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly the Magic Mouse which behaves fine under Windows 7 lost the ability to scroll by touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the peripherals (I presume it is the mouse) showed up as 'unknown peripheral'. This does surprise me since on Windows 7 there is no such problem, and it is a very common hardware peripheral.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was surprised that I couldn't find anywhere to look at the Bluetooth settings - I had originally intended to unpair and re-pair Bluetooth devices to see if I could confirm it was the mouse, but couldn't see anywhere to control Bluetooth. I did find that
 frustrating when compared to using Yosemite where both Bluetooth and wifi are controllable from the menu bar, and yet I couldn't find any equivalent in settings. I haven't tried Windows 10 on my laptop, but that would be quite an important thing to be able
 to control easily on there both for battery life and security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I have a USB Mad Catz joystick. The peripheral is also common (purchased from PC World only 2-3 months ago), and again works fine on Windows 7. The peripheral was identified correctly. However, loading Elite Dangerous showed that it was not recognising
 various button presses, and treating other button presses as continually down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the primary usage for Windows on my Mac is for using Office (where the Windows version remains light years ahead of Office for Mac and inconsistencies are very much evident in advanced use), and for playing the occasional game, unfortunately it failed
 at both and I've reverted it. The copy of Windows 7 on there is pretty pristine as it undergoes semi-regular use in very defined patterns so there shouldn't be lots of detritus from old installs etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was pleased to see that the rollback worked 100% as intended (a backup was on standby) and was painless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope the feedback is useful, that the issues raised are considered and resolved as possible. I'm happy to attempt again if they have been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew Hill</p>

<p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could have occurred if appropriate drivers are not installed on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to install the Wireless mouse drivers available for your device and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do get back to us if you need further assistance with Windows. </p>

            <p>I am a bit afraid to install Windows 10 on my iMac. &nbsp;I would also like to use Office on my Mac (the PC version). &nbsp;However, my brother simply upgraded his PC (Toshiba) laptop from Windows 8.1. &nbsp;It was not obvious immediately, but something went awry corrupting
 his registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He lost bluetooth connectivity (completely).</p>
<p>He also kept losing Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally he started getting random application errors. &nbsp;Once again, this was an upgrade from a PC laptop from one version to the next version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now, the only real solution is to scrub the hard drive and do a complete, fresh install of Windows 10 (which he does not want to do) and restore all his data, documents etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not willing to go through that kind of thing on my Mac. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS X has its problems also, but in five years I have yet to see either of my Macs ever crash (operating system itself) get a virus or anything of that "Windows" sort. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best advice is to run (cheap) Windows clone system and leave your Mac to be a Mac. &nbsp;You can still port files back and forth as needed without screwing up your Macintosh in the process.</p>

 sharing has been removed. I created and own them both. Anyway, I want to delete the current 'primary' calendar. How can I make the second calendar primary???

            No, that didn't work for me; but I discovered that if I copied/pasted into Paint it worked better. I found out this morning that I could copy the picture right off the internet and pasted it into Pictures, it was an even better quality photo. Thank you
 for your suggestion!

<h2>            Re-installing Microsoft Office -- The Ultimate Steal</h2>
                    I purchased the Ultimate Steal back in, I believe, 2007 when I was a student at Penn State University.&nbsp; Now, in 2011, I am in law school at American University.&nbsp; My undergrad laptop just broke recently, and now I am having trouble re-downloading the office
 package.&nbsp; I went to the order search website that was in some of my archived email and attempted to use two keys (one in parenthesis in the email subject, and the other listed as the product key) they gave me for the order number along with the password I
 have written down, but with no avail.&nbsp; Is it too late to reinstall the product?&nbsp; Is there another way to get the download.&nbsp; I assume since I have the product key I should be able to activate the product still.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any help and if this is
 in the wrong forum please feel free to move it or let me know so I can ask the right people.

<p>This is the "right" place.</p>
<p>"Ultimate Steel" is just a label. Which version of office did you have, ie which apps? Since you have the product key, you have the option of downloading again, but you have to download and install the right version for th it ot work.&nbsp; Try these download
 sites, they may work with your product key. If they don't you'll have to go back to the original vendor for the download:</p>

<p>For the PDF problem you have to recreate the file association.</p>
<p>In Adobe, look around for an option to "Make it Default"</p>
<p>Or you could install a different PDF reader and make it default during install</p>
<p>take a look at this tip: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/vistafiles/thread/24BDB109-125E-408A-988F-BB131317CE21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Restore Outlook-Ost-File&#58; Correct Process - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Restore Outlook-Ost-File&#58; Correct Process</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the correct process when Windows System must be restored, or an old System-Image will be loaded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a full backup available for the ost-outlook-file. But it is impossible to enforce Outlook to use
<strong>this</strong> backup-file. Outlook will automatically create a <strong>new</strong> ost-file!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>All saved emails in the outlook-folders will be downloaded again into the inbox. At a blow you will have 1000 of emails in the inbox.</li><li>All saved contact-picures are missed.</li><li>etc.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody any idea how to deal with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>how can I automatically save Word documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surfing69  say:</h3>
<h2>            how can I automatically save Word documents</h2>
                    <div>I would like to automatically save my work every X mins to ensure no data is lost in the case of shutting down the doc without 'saving' manually.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I have set autorecover to 1 min but despite this, when i close a document without saving after this period or use task manager to close Microsoft word without saving, NOTHING is saved.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have on occasions, clicked the 'dont save' button in my rush and when I reopened the document, I have found that recent data had not been saved.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How does the autorecovery function actually work?? &nbsp;It doesn't seem to be working for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have had to tick the 'always create backup copy' &nbsp;which DOES save the info but it involves the creation of another document.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Have I misunderstood this facility ??</div>

            There is no "autosave" in Word 2003. The AutoRecover feature saves data to *.asd files which can be retrieved after a crash. If you exit Word normally, without saving your work, these files won't be retained. You need a macro solution. See

            Note that Word 2010 is the first version that (somewhat) protects you from your own negligence. In that version, if you have "Keep the last autosaved version if I close without saving" checked, then those&nbsp;*.asd files are available for a limited time thereafter
 using "Recover Unsaved Documents" on the File tab. I'm not sure what the time limit is, but I'm seeing a document autosaved last Wednesday evening, June 12. I tend to get a small accumulation of these because I use an open document as a scratchpad for testing
 Word 2010 solutions for users; if I don't Undo back to an empty file before closing, then my experiments are saved.

            The files in the UnsavedFiles folder are supposed to be deleted after four days. If you don't start any of the Office programs by then, the older files will still be there (I have a rarely-used laptop that has four files there from last October). Running
 any Office program will then remove them.<br />

            I have used Gregs tool (gmayor) and liked it. Here are a collection of similar tools and macros I've collected.&nbsp; At one point I had taken those macros and frankensteined my own version of an autosave as macro that added date and timestamps to the end of
 the file name<br />
<br />
There are some Excel specific macros at the bottom of the collection:<br />
<br />
<b>True Autosave Macros for Office</b>
<p><span>This file you are working on is HIGH VALUE (to you). You MUST take extra steps to protect the time and creativity you have invested in this file. You MUST make frequent backups.
</span></p>
<p><span>A good general rule for backups is:</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Remember 3-2-1 to have good backups --
</span></i></b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b><i><span>at least 3 copies of any file, </span></i></b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b><i><span>on at least 2 different storage mediums (say on a hard drive, thumb drive, DVD or the cloud),
</span></i></b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b><i><span>at least 1 copy offsite -- in case of fire!&nbsp; (say thumb drive or DVD moved to different location, or the cloud)</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Gibson </span></i></b></p>
<p><span>PS: yes “correct” the plural of medium is media, but I don’t speak latin! &lt;grin&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>You can do your backups manually or make use of automated tools.&nbsp; A strategy I have used is timed backups during the editing session (5 minute). Then the final end of day save is copied to second medium. I rotate the "second"
 medium with an Offsite copy.&nbsp; Once a week I go in and clean up the 5 minute incremental backups to keep just the end of day copy (to free up space!)</span></p>
<p><span>I have used the "autohistory" tool at codeplex. It is easy to use, but like any automated process it uses up a lot of space.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, although Office apps have been around since the the mid 1980’s, MS has not figured out that we need a good “Autosave” backup feature. In the past there was a “versions” feature in some office apps, but it only kept incremental
 copies of files, not full files. Win7 has a file “versions” feature, but it is tied into “System Recovery Points”. Not very useful.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following links tell how to setup macros that run automatically and use SAVEAS to save full copies of the file with the date/time included in the file name. You have to manually delete the “extra” backup files, but you control the process rather
 than Windows or Office. It is a bit more work, but I find it worth it for very important files that are changing frequently.</p>

<p><span><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Contrary to popular opinion, Word has no integral means of automatically saving the current document, nor of backing-up the current document. What it does have is an option to save
<b>AutoRecover</b> information after a specific and configurable interval and an option to save a backup copy of the
<b>previously saved</b> version of the document with the default file extension of
<b>WBK</b> (and although there is no reason to do so, Word also allows the option to change this extension to the user's choice). This is not a true backup in as much as it is not a copy of the
<b>current version</b> of the document.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A function to create a true automatic backup is provided by the

<p>In the last issue of WordTips there were a number of readers that got the idea that I was suggesting that people should use the FastSave feature. In fact, I got quite a bit of feedback on that tip, some of it quite pointed. (According
 to one reader, I was even “irresponsible.” Another stated that I was doing a disservice to readers.)</p>
<p>I am sorry if I gave the impression that I thought FastSave is a great idea. That is far from the truth; I do not. There are several other “features” of Word that I think are ill conceived or totally unnecessary, as well. It doesn’t change
 the fact that they are features and people can use them, if they desire. WordTips are not designed to promote one method of doing something over another, but to provide alternative ideas that people can incorporate into their Word use, if they so desire.</p>
<p>With that being said, let me point out specifically why you should
<b><i>not</i></b> use the FastSave feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other word processors may not be able to open Word documents saved with the FastSave feature enabled. For instance, WordPerfect says it can open Word documents, yet some versions of WordPerfect cannot open FastSaved Word documents.</li><li>Third-party software designed to work with Word documents (such as some grammar checkers, document management programs, and desktop publishing software) will not work correctly with FastSaved Word documents.</li><li>Find File (either in Word or in Windows) may not work correctly with FastSaved Word documents.</li><li>FastSave results in more complex files being saved on disk. Any time you increase complexity, you run the risk of corrupting the files easier.</li><li>FastSaved files take up more disk space.</li><li>There have been reports of macro viruses “living on” in FastSaved documents, even though you thought you had them removed.</li></ul>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The list could go on and on, but you get the idea. In short, unless you have a specific need to use FastSave (such as if you are only creating simple documents using Word 6 on a slow 286 machine), it is probably a good idea to turn it off.
 The FastSave feature is turned on by default in all versions of Word, even in the original Word 97. Only if you are using Word 97 SR-1 is it turned off by default.</p>
<p>As a side note, according to the Microsoft Knowledge Base there are several circumstances under which a FastSave is not done by Word, even if you have enabled the feature. These circumstances include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you save a document for the first time. (This makes sense, right?) This includes when you choose Save As to save under a new name or in a new location.</li><li>When your document is saved on a network server or remote volume. (Word only performs a FastSave to a local volume.)</li><li>When Word reaches the limit of how much information it can save using the FastSave option. In this case Word does a normal save, and then again starts using FastSave for future saves.</li></ul>
<p>Nuff said? (I hate it when I’m irresponsible.)</p>

 it will create a backup of the last saved version on the disk and then will save the existing file. You can either create a single backup file or multiple sequential backups. The add-in does not delete any presentation nor does it change the original presentation

<h2>            Formatting cells using formulas</h2>
                    I'm using Excel 2016 as a spreadsheet to track my profits/loss. For some reason one of my columns is off from where it should be. What is the formula to add an amount to one cell to make the next cell 500 higher? Example is add $500 to column L so that
 column M = L+$500

            You would put the formula in a cell in column M. For example, if you want cell M2 to be $500 more than cell L2, enter this formula in cell M2:
<br />
<br />=L2+500

            You would need to do it to each cell in the column that you want that result in. You can enter it in one cell and then copy and paste, or click the AutoFill handle in the bottom right corner of the cell and drag up or down the column.

            Hi Patrick, to enter that formula into a whole column:
<br />Click the column Header
<br />Type =L1+500
<br />Then press Ctrl + Enter
<br />
<br />That will fill that whole column for you with the appropriate formula . . .

<p>I didn't say that it won't be on PCs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I was trying to say was that MSFT has always treated Publisher which is not an Office core progam like a neglected adoptee. They have been stripping functionality with each version since Pub 2007. Given this history and how buggy 2016 is without any
 real effort to fix it, I would not be surprised if MSFT dropped Publisher entirely in the future let alone them devoting any resources to coming up with a MAC version. Sorry...</p>

                    Microsoft Exchange e-mail was working, up until about a week ago.&nbsp; The Sophos AV software had found and removed some malware. Further Av/Malware scans don't show anything. Can get to Internet and Network resources (mapped drives). E-mail still coming to
 Blackberry.<br />
Tried uninstalling and re-installing Ms-Office 2007 Professional. Same problem. Didn't get to update Ms-Office security/critical patches, so, the patch that can cause problems, isn't there yet. Checked the Tcp/Ip settings.. Default Gateway IP is there. Checked
 settings on other people, in the office, with Office 2007. Can't find difference yet.<br />
Looked at the RPC settings in Registry (hkey_current_user\software\microsoft\office\12.0\outlook\rpc). Copied values from a working desk. Still same problem.<br />
Anywhere else, in Registry I can check?&nbsp; The Microsoft FixIt doesn't seem to have anything for Outlook (or Office).<br />

            If you have Sophos scanning your email, strongly suspect it. Outlook doesn't get along with email scanners at all well and email scanners, in general, are more trouble than they're worth:\<br />

            Sophos has been installed for over a 1/2 year, and Outlook has been working. Just started having this problem 2 weeks ago.<br />
Was wondering if one of the pieces of Malware that were "caught" and cleaned, may have left something behind, that didn't get fixed.<br />
Outlook 2007 Prof was uninstalled (re-boot), reinstalled. Same problem. Normal.dot was renamed. Saw a Normal.dotm.&nbsp; Is that the new extension for Office 2007?<br />
Now, I need to find a way to let Outlook know that it IS connected to an Exchange Server, where it can send/receive e-mail.<br />

            Hi JCTechAdmin,<br />
<br />
Yes, it will affect the license status. <br />
<br />
Once you've changed the computer name, you need to login with your account on your Office client to activate it again. In Office 365 portal &gt; Office 365 settings &gt; Install status, the new computer name will replace the old one.<br />
<br />

Jim

<br />
I guess neither of them work. <br />
The live tile shows nothing about last played even if it is a double sized tile.<br />
Neither does the lockscreen, it just gives a red hue or something of that sort.<br />

I have spent hours trying to fix this album art situation. There are workarounds (like this app called MPA tool) which can give you album art but the whole album art as well as artist art&nbsp;tile thing support for music is just plain hopeless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see you have done a whole lot of region changing tricks but that might interfere with your standard phone usage like apps and marketplace.</p>

            <p>Hello Anubhav:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum.&nbsp; I would like to first address the issue with local scout.&nbsp; This seems to be an issue with your region.&nbsp; You mention you are in India, local scout is not available in India.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;review this document for what services
 are available in which regions, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/feature-and-service-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/feature-and-service-availability</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next the issue with your album art.&nbsp; There are a couple things that typically cause and issue like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes this is as simple as verifying your phone is set-up properly.&nbsp; On the phone tap settings &gt; go to applications &gt; select music + videos &gt; make sure "connect with Zune" is set to ON.</li><li>The other common cause for this is the meta data associated with the music.&nbsp; The best way to take care of this is with the Zune software.&nbsp; Take all the music on your phone and copy it to a computer with the Zune software.&nbsp; Perform the steps in this article
 to get the content on the phone copied, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media</a>.&nbsp; Once you have done this, go to settings &gt; software &gt; metadata &gt; check the second box &gt; fill in the first radio button.&nbsp; After these settings are set, go to your collection and locate a track you
 have been having issues with.&nbsp; Right click that song and select edit.&nbsp; You will now be able to edit or add information important to the track.&nbsp; Specifically look at the artist name, track title and album name.</li><li>The final thing you will want to look at is the file on the computer itself.&nbsp; Search your computer for the music you are having troubles with.&nbsp; When you locate the file verify that an album art file is included in the album folder.
</li><li>Once you have tried all of the above, sync your collection to the phone and check to see if your experience has differed.</li></ol>
<p>If you continue to have troubles please detail the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you acquire this content, burned from CD's/purchased from 3rd party marketplaces/downloaded from the internet/purchased through Zune?</li><li>Do you have any content that is displaying the art in the lockscreen?&nbsp; If you do, where did you get that content?</li><li>Please provide some specific examples of albums/artists/tracks that are failing to provide art?</li></ul>

<br />
You can check and set it in the ribbon though<br />

If Application.CommandBars.GetPressedMso("MoviePlayFullScreen") = False Then _<br />

<h2>            Cannot search email folders in outlook app on iphone</h2>
                    <p>We use Microsoft Office 365 Business and have outlook app installed on the iPhone.</p>
<p>On my laptop I have folders in my inbox where I file emails.</p>
<p>The problem I am experiencing is with the outlook app not allowing me to search for emails from my iPhone with a search function.&nbsp; This is being done manually and makes finding emails problematic and time consuming.</p>
<p>It would also be great if you could collapse the folders and not have to scroll through 100's of emails to get to the next folder</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Outlook for iOS, as far as I know there is a search bar on the bottom of the Outlook App. It between email and calendar icons on the bottom of your screen, if you don't see it, please try to upgrade your Outlook App to the latest and then check if you
 could find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, the search feature in the Outlook for iOS can be used to search emails and contacts, however, it seems that you just can enter some keywords into the search bar to find related emails, but it cannot be used to search specific folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps for you.</p>

    <title>Excel 2007 delayed response time entering numbers and copying data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devilishblueyes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007 delayed response time entering numbers and copying data</h2>
                    When I try working with data that was created in Excel 2003, Excel 2007 performs VERY slow.&nbsp; I have a fast computer and have little else open.&nbsp; And it definitely appears that the size of the file is not the issue.&nbsp; If I try to copy or reformat the cells
 of data that was created in Excel 2003 I'll have a delay of at least 10-20 seconds or longer.&nbsp; Sometimes it is several minutes.&nbsp; Manipulating the same amount of data from a file created in Excel 2007 happens in a fraction of a second.&nbsp; I have tried several
 things to correct the issue.&nbsp; I resaved the file as an Excel 2007 file then closed the file and re-opened it.&nbsp; I still had the same problems.&nbsp; I even closed the program and restarted it and I still had the same problems.&nbsp; Even if I just copy the data from
 a file created in Excel 2003 I have the problems.&nbsp; But that same data if it was entered in Excel 2007 works fine and fast.&nbsp; If I type in data in a new cell with the Excel 2003 data I found that Excel 2007 will run fast if it is text.&nbsp; If it is a number it
 will run slow.&nbsp; Just typing in the number 5 and hitting enter takes about 20 seconds before it allows me to enter in something else in anotehr cell.&nbsp; But I checked my theory, and when I formated the cell to a text format and entered in the number 5 it didn't
 take the normal 20 seconds.&nbsp; It entered it in a flash.&nbsp; I've tried turning the AutoCalc off so that it only manually calcs with the F9 button but it still runs slow when I hit Enter after typing a number.<br />
<br />
Does Microsoft have a solution for this?&nbsp; This problem seems to be specific to working with data&nbsp;created in&nbsp;Excel 2003 in Excel 2007.&nbsp; And more specifically dealing with numbers, formatting and copying.&nbsp; I've scoured the web and there seems to be plenty of
 people with this problem but no one seems to have a true answer or fix for it that truly works.&nbsp; This appears to be a MAJOR glitch with Excel 2007 that Microsoft needs to create an update for if they haven't already.<br />
<br />
It should not take me 20 seconds to be able to move to the next cell even with a big file.&nbsp; Excel 2003 never did this.&nbsp; And it should not take me 2-3 minutes to copy a small worksheet.&nbsp; There are not even any formulas or equations in the data I'm working with.&nbsp;
 Please let me know if there is a solution for this.&nbsp; Some of my co-workers are using Excel 2003 and entering data into a workbook created in Excel 2003.&nbsp; The Excel 2003 user are experiencing no delays.&nbsp; All of the Excel 2007 users are experiencing major delays.&nbsp;
 Even after the file has been converted to the Excel 2007 format, saved, closed, then re-opened the problems still persist.<br />
<br />
I cannot keep on spending several hours trying to enter two rows of data.&nbsp; That is ridiculous.&nbsp; This is a major glitch that I'm surprised wasn't caught before Excel 2007 hit the market for sale.

<p>I have an on premise exchange 2013 cu10 that I am setting up&nbsp;as part of&nbsp;the hybrid&nbsp;&nbsp;Configuration. I have gone through the wizard and it completes but at the end I get the HCW8057. unable to communicate with the on- premise autodiscover.</p>
<p>I have ran the Remote connectivity analyzer, it pass with the one waning about &nbsp;root updates needing to be turned on, on some windows dns systems.</p>
<p>The internal domain and host is and same as the eternal domain&nbsp; "server.domain.com" internal is also server.domain.com.</p>
<p>A record for autodiscover is the same internally and externally</p>
<p>Port 443 is being passed through the firewall</p>
<p>Just did a test from outside using outlook 2016 to the on premise exchange server outlook setup with no issues</p>
<p>Has me scratching my head.</p>
<p>hoping for a pointer :)</p>

<p>Hi Randall,</p>
<p>Please share with us a screenshot of the complete error information for further investigation. To upload the screenshot in the forum, click&nbsp;<b>Use rich formatting</b> and then the<b> Insert/Edit Media</b> icon.</p>
<p>In addition, click <b>Expand all</b> and share with us the whole RCA (Remote Connectivity Analyzer) information via Private Message:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.</p>
<p>We also suggest you add an A record for the Autodiscover URL (for example, Autodiscover.contoso.com) to the internal DNS record, and then point that record to the on-premises Client Access server.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi Randall,</p>
<p>Thanks for the information in Private Message.</p>
<p>RCA test checks your external AutoDiscover. I have checked the log and found that there’s no obvious error information. Usually, this issue is caused by firewall and network. We have a KB stating this:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3087170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3087170</a>.</p>
<p>Please check whether one of the causes meet your scenario.</p>
<p>If not, I understand that you have confirmed the port 443 has been passed through the firewall. However, to identity this, we suggest you shut down the firewall temporarily to check the issue.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<p>A bit more info, I had replaced the firewall as well with a newer model and brand went from an asa to a sonicwall, no difference. Today I bypassed the firewall and went right to the server also turned off its firewall for long enough to run the &nbsp;test in
 both case got the same error. </p>

<p>Hi Randall,</p>
<p>Based on the email address suffix (epic***.com) in the RCA test, we haven’t found the public Autodiscove record. Could you please share with us two screenshot of the AutoDiscover records of this domain in your external DNS host and internal DNS host? Since
 they’re your privacy. I have created a workspace to collect them. Please access your Private Message for detailed information:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the AutoDiscover test you performed last time is ActiveSync test. In RCA &gt; Office 365 &gt; Microsoft Office Outlook Connectivity Test, please also do a Outlook AutoDiscover test and share with us the detailed results in Private Message by clicking
 Expand All.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Brook</p>

<p>hi randall,</p>
<p>thanks for the information.</p>
<p>i notice you have add the a record for the <i>autodisocover.contoso.com</i>. could you please add a cname for it?</p>

<p>per checking the rca test, we found that it’s still an activesync autodiscover test, which is performed in your internal network. because the office 365 use the external network to connect to your on premise exchange, could you please use external network
 to run a <b>outlook autodiscover</b> test as the following screenshot shows?</p>

<h2>            How can I find the number of a call I missed&#63;</h2>
                    When I opened Skype a notice that I had missed a call from a certain number flashed but then disappeared. How can I find numbers of calls I have missed?

            When you click Chats which is also default view, you will be able to see all calls. Any missed call will be listed as missed call.
