    <title>Windows 7 RC1 blank screen when restarting monitor, with sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fingledingle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 RC1 blank screen when restarting monitor, with sleep mode disabled.</h2>
                    Issue: Windows 7 RC1 displays a blank screen when restarting the monitor after it has been powered off, even though sleep mode is disabled.<br />
<br />
Symptoms: After the display device (DLP TV) has been off for a period of time, turning it on again results in a blank screen. Moving or clicking the mouse, or hitting Esc, Break, Ctrl-Alt-Del, WinKey, Space, or Enter on the keyboard do not restore the desktop.
 The only remedy is to power down the computer using the On/Off button, and restart.
<br />
<br />
System: 3GHz Intel P4, Asus P4C800-E deluxe motherboard, 2GB Ram, ATI Radeon 9800 AIW video board, DVI output to Samsung DLP TV, USB based wireless keyboard (Gyration), USB wired mouse (Logitech). All drivers as installed by Windows 7 and reported to be latest
 versions by Windows Update. Latest Avast AntiVirus.<br />
<br />
OS version: Windows 7 RC1, build 7100<br />
<br />
Power Options: New plan based on High Performance settings template, display set to never turn off, computer set to never sleep, hard disk set to never turn off, hybrid sleep off, hybernate set to never, wake timers enabled or disabled, USB selective suspend
 set to never, screensaver disabled.<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting: I've checked this forum and the TechNet forums, and found many other postings with similar problems waking from sleep mode. After reading these, I turned off every setting related to sleep mode that I could find, set my bios to allow PCI devices,
 mice, and keyboards to wake the system from sleep (there is no specific setting for USB devices though), and verified my video drivers were up to date. Windows 7 is installed in a dual boot configuration on a system already running Windows XP, and I do not
 have the problem in XP. I still don't know exactly how long the monitor needs to be off for this to happen. A few minutes seems to be OK, but over an hour is not. If the computer is idle for several hours while the monitor is left on, I don't have a problem.
 Switching the monitor to a different input (ie: watching TV for several&nbsp; hours) doesn't seem to be a problem either. I haven't tried plugging a standard mouse into the dedicated mouse port yet (mainly because I don't have one that will do this right now),
 but even if this solves it, the fact remains that I'm having no problems using XP with the same hardware, and as far as I can see, Windows 7 shouldn't be going to sleep at all, so why should I need to wake it?<br />
<br />
Current Status: Since the computer is an HTPC, and needs to be on all of the time to record shows, this is a major problem. I will continue to check for solutions, but until one can be found, I can no longer even test RC1. If not fixed, it will also be a deal-breaker
 as far as my adopting Windows 7 when it is released, much as I like the rest of it.<br />

<p><span>Thank you for using the Answers Forum and for your interest in Windows 7!</span></p>
<p><span>If this just happens when the TV is turned off, there may be a setting in the video driver software that needs to be changed, or perhaps there is a conflict between the Windows
 7 driver and your TV. If you have two outputs on your card, try the other port.</span></p>
<p><span>You might be able to find others with a similar problem on the Windows 7 Support forum on TechNet:

            Hello David.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick response. I've done more tests on the time the monitor needs to be off, and it seems to support your idea. When I turn off the TV, it goes through a shutdown&nbsp;cycle,&nbsp;during which the fan stays on to cool the lamp, after which a relay clicks,
 and the TV is completely off. If I restart it during this period, I don't have a problem, but if I wait until after the relay clicks, I get a blank screen. I can switch to TV mode, or to other external sources, and they all work fine, but the video from the
 computer is still blank. Once again, this only happens with Windows 7. Using the exact same hardware, but booting into XP instead, I&nbsp; have no problems.<br />
<br />
If there is a setting in my Windows 7 video driver that would account for this, I can't find it. I'm using the generic ATI drivers installed by Windows at this point, rather than the full Catalyst suite from ATI. What should I be looking for? There doesn't
 appear to be&nbsp;a setting&nbsp;that says&nbsp;"don't turn the video card output off when the monitor is turned off", or anything else that looks remotely useful. Other than the power options I've already tried, what video driver specific settings might cause this? I can&nbsp;try
 to find a version of Catalyst that works with Windows 7 if it will give me access to any relevant additional settings.
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the card only has one video output - a DVI port. I can put an adapter on it to convert it to VGA, and use the VGA input on the TV, but this would degrade my picture a bit, and if I have to downgrade my picture to use Windows 7, I just won't use it,
 at least not until I can get a whole new setup that is more Windows 7 friendly. <br />
<br />
As for the Technet link, I've been through it with no real luck. I've found lots of other black screen issues, but none that seemed to match mine, and no new directions to look for answers.

            I've been monitoring this site, and a Technet Windows 7 thread at <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprogeneral/thread/d1966ef0-5111-4c82-94a7-dcf14c502fc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums</a> since posting my original question, but haven't seen anything useful. I've seen several other posts from people with the same or similar problems though, so you're not the only one waiting for an answer. For my part,
 I've pretty much discontinued using the Windows 7 RC, since having to reboot all the time just doesn't work for me. I did find an alternative to using the power button, though. The windows keyboard shortcuts to power down are:
<br />
<br />
Windows Key -&gt; Right Arrow -&gt; Enter (Full Shutdown), or<br />
<br />
Windows Key -&gt; Right Arrow -&gt; Right Arrow -&gt; R (Restart).<br />
<br />
You can type them in blind when the screen is blank, and they should allow you to shut down or restart without a hard power-down.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone at Microsoft is still monitoring these boards, and this issue gets fixed before the general release. I passed on buying Vista for my home systems, mainly because it didn't seem like enough of an improvement to justify the time and expense
 of upgrading. Windows 7, on the other hand,&nbsp; probably is, so I'd hate to miss out because of this.<br />

how is the issue now? Any updates?<br />
<br />
What is your cabling to the TV monitor like? Any conversion plugs used there?

I&nbsp;have this same issue, on a asus m3n78-vm using the onboard nvidia 8200 video to a sony 3LCD tv via hdmi.<br />
I've played with the bios,&nbsp;a couple of different video drivers all the settings I can find for power, stopped hibernation<br />
completely, power options are set to never, no screen blanker. <br />
<br />
still cannot find a solution to the issue if I boot the pc into vista I don't have this problem!

            I solved this issue this morning at least on my hardware by changing the video out from HDMI-HDMI to DVI-HDMI and<br />
HDCP is still locked in. since I send audio out via SPDIF to the amp&nbsp;this is a viable solution for me.<br />

hope this helps

            Hi.<br />
<br />
No new developments here. I still get a black screen after turning my TV/monitor off and back on. I use an ATI AIW 9800 video card connected to my Samsung DLP TV via a DVI cable. Since the native output of the video card is DVI, and the TV has a DVI input,
 no converters are needed. While several people have suggested trying a different monitor or type of video cable, neither of these solutions would really solve my problem, since I'm not about to buy another TV, and this is the cable system that gives me the
 best picture. I don't want to downgrade just to get Windows 7 to work, especially when Windows XP works just fine. . The only possibility I can see is to upgrade to a newer video card that has Windows 7 driver support and hope for the best, but I'm not prepared
 to do this until after Windows 7 has been released, since things can still change at this point. As it stands, I've had to pretty much abandon further testing with Windows 7, since too much of what I do with my computer requires 24 hour operation, and I can't
 leave the TV on all the time.

<p>I have a very similar issue with Win7 64 but RC&nbsp;as well.&nbsp; Have an ATI4850 video card with a Gigabyte MB and latest Catalyst Drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My black screen issue sometimes seems to be very sporadic, but it always will occur after watching a DVD via Media Center
 and then powering off my Sony XBR LCD TV.&nbsp; Upon power on of the TV, the screen is blank.&nbsp; Fortunately if I unplug the HDMI connector from my TV and plug it back in the display will resume (and a note, when I unplug the TV, Windows makes the sound that acknowledges
 the device is unplugged, so it knows it's there but for some reason it's not transmitting video properly to it).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>MS Security Baseline Help. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Security Baseline Help.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>Under the recommendation of a friend, I installed the MS Security Baseline (From the official security baseline guide) to secure my computer and reduce the surface of attack..</p>
<p>I read the documentation, pretty interesting stuff, however I encountered a problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Home OEM and I cannot longer install software as an user or update certain programs. I can install them from the Admin account (Both local accounts) but my user account cannot access them. It says that a security policy is not allowing
 "this or that" program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did create a restoration point before applying the guideline using LGPO, however I do not wish to undo all the changes made by the Guideline as I did notice a better performance in my computer from a security point of view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here are my questions:</p>
<p>A) From a Home version, is it possible to tinker with the registry to allow a secondary, local user account to be able to install software as an administrator (The default state of windows I guess) or better yet, install software from the admin account and
 have those available to other users? To be honest I am not sure what is exactly interfering but the reason I am asking is because I would like to enable and disable this state at will. I do not often install software and enabling a state in which no program
 can escalate privileges is really helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) In case I have to go back to a restoration point, what would be the best way to harden windows home? I have read into the ways Windows already creates a secure environment with DEP and ASRL, but I would like a more hands on approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I really wish to know more about security and I am really just learning about this, so if anyone has a recommended reading suggestion I would appreciate it.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>
<p>

    <title>Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic SB0460 Works CPU 100&#37; when using - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic SB0460 Works CPU 100&#37; when using Windows Media Player 12</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 Ultimate running on a 32bit platform. I just bought a Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic SB0460 Audio Card. I have been having trouble using Windows Media Player 12 with it. Before I start using the Media Player I started up my Windows Task
 Manager and selected the Performance Tab to monitor the processor,&nbsp;then started the Media Player 12 and noticed that the CPU Usage slams up to 100% and stays there (Freezes Up)&nbsp;for at least&nbsp;6 minutes WHILE PLAYING THE MUSIC I SELECTED before it came down to
 10-29%.</p>
<p>I called Creative Labs Tech Support and installed the card to their specifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable the onboard sound card VIA BIOS upon startup (F2) </li><li>Uninstalled X-FI Driver VIA DEVICE MANAGER w/right click and UNINSTALL </li><li>Select the CHECK BOX to completely remove </li><li>Downloaded the current driver for Windows 7 from Creative Labs website for the SB0460 and saved it on the desktop</li><li>Shut PC and removed soundcard for 20 seconds. </li><li>Reinserted the soundcard and started PC </li><li>Installed Latest Driver for Windows 7 from Creative Labs website for the SB0460 that I saved on the desktop previously</li></ol>
<p>I am still having problems with the CPU running 100% for at least 6 minutes when I play a song using Windows Media Player 12. I even UPDATED the BIOS from&nbsp;my PC manufacture website and the same thing.</p>
<p>I decided to try a different media player and used Real Player and my CPU is running at 18 - 32%. I love the sound of the card and love the way Media Player 12 is set up for me to select the music I want to play so easily but, I am having issues.</p>

<p>I saw this issue a lot online and thought I would help. Windows 7 won't recognize Sound Blaster SB0460 card. This is because it is not set as the default sound device.</p>
<p>I called Creative Labs Tech Support and installed the card to their specifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable the onboard sound card VIA BIOS upon startup (F2) </li><li>Uninstalled X-FI Driver VIA DEVICE MANAGER w/right click and UNINSTALL </li><li>Select the CHECK BOX to completely remove </li><li>Downloaded the current driver for Windows 7 from Creative Labs website for the SB0460 and saved it on the desktop</li><li>Shut PC and removed soundcard for 20 seconds. </li><li>Reinserted the soundcard and started PC </li><li>Installed Latest Driver for Windows 7 from Creative Labs website for the SB0460 that I saved on the desktop previously</li></ol>

    <title>Missing Points - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flbarguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Points</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi.. I just checked my points balance today, and it looks like I'm missing a bunch of points. &nbsp;The only thing I can see that was downloaded recently (on 12/28/12) was The Walking Dead (Full game -episode
 1).</span></p>
<p>This was supposed to be a free download - see below:</p>
<p><span>http://slickdeals.net/permadeal/86982/xbox-live-marketplace-xbox-live-marketplace-the-walking-dead-full-game?utm_campaign=twitter&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter</span></p>
<p><span>Episodes 2 - 5 have not been downloaded, so they are not the cause.</span></p>
<p><span>Can you please tell me if I was charged for this? If so, how can I get this fixed and points credited back to my account? &nbsp;If this wasn't the cause, can you please tell me what the points were used
 on?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you very much for your help!</span></p>

    <title>OpenVPN TAP binding order issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardn.  say:</h3>
<h2>            OpenVPN TAP binding order issue</h2>
                    I am running a 64bit Windows 7/8 AD environment using OpenVPN on remote computers to access our network/servers in our main office.<br />
<br />
Typically, once we install OpenVPN on a new machine and configure the binding order (advanced setting in the network connections) so that OpenVPN TAP adapter is at the top of the binding order on a machine everything is fine. The issue I am having is some how
 the binding order is changing periodically. I am not sure what is causing the binding order to change, but it is causing quite a few issues with my machines, one being that it's no longer communicating with my WSUS server.<br />
<br />
If I manually change the binding order so that the TAP is at the top, everything if fine again.<br />
<br />
My question is how can I statically set the binding order so that the OpenVPN TAP adapter is always at the top of the binding order. I have tried messing with the "interface metric" but that does not seem to have any effect on the binding order.<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Rich

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro failed</h2>
                    Windows Update keeps failing to install Windows 10. :(<br />
<br />
First I got Code 80240020<br />
<br />
Then I followed a reddit post that said to delete everything inside C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download<br />
<br />
Then I got Code 80246010<br />
<br />
Could someone help me out?<br />

<p>I followed this method:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<span>1. Go into "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" and&nbsp;</span><span>delete everything</span><span>&nbsp;in that folder.</span><br />
<span>2. Now, run the command prompt as an administrator. Type in "wuauclt.exe /updatenow".</span><br />
<span>3. Go to your Control Panel &gt; Windows Update and your Windows 10 should start re-downloading from scratch, hopefully without flaws this time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to do this method several times, but in the end, it worked out. I'm now happily using Windows 10 Pro.</p>

<h2>            Scrolling not working appropriately, whenever office apps opened</h2>
                    <p>Scrolling in some application are not working correctly, I encounter this problem in apps like Line, IntelliJ platform (Android Studio, &nbsp;Intellij IDEA, PhpStorm) and some others. The problem is scrolling on apps like Android Studio wouldn't work whenever
 I opened mostly Excel, and Excel apps is scrolled instead.</p>
<p>This problem is kind of frustrating, because it's worked just fine if I haven't opened any Office Apps. This problem only happened when I'm using touchpad on my Lenovo G4045. &nbsp;I'm on windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver said it's up to date, I don't know what else to do. </p>
<p>

<h2>            Incorrect Drive Usage Size being displayed in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello there !</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS : Windows 10 (64 bit) - version 1809 (OS build 17763.404)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I faced a very peculiar issue with my Laptop. I noticed that the size statistics of Volume A: of Hard disk are incorrectly displayed. If I check for usage by right clicking drive A: directly, it shows 15.9 GB used and if I select all files inside
 and check their size, it shows 23.3 GB. (Pictures attached below).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38fbe973-9657-4071-800c-4f115275ad6a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38fbe973-9657-4071-800c-4f115275ad6a?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>There are no hidden files in Drive A.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>Does this pose any kind of risk to my laptop? If yes, how to rectify this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, recently my PC abruptly ran onto the Blue Screen saying "Your PC has ran into problems" and then it switched off. Later when I tried switching it back ON, a black screen appeared saying "<strong>The
 SMART Hard Disk check has detected an imminent failure. To ensure not&nbsp;</strong><strong>data
 loss, please backup the content immediately and run the hard disk test in system diagnostic. Hard Disk 1 (301)"</strong></p>
<p>and when I pressed Enter to continue Startup, it shows no Hard disk detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After few hours when I tried switching it back ON again, it worked normally as though nothing had happened. Can the above mentioned issue be due to a faulty HDD?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>
<p>

<h3> thor411  say:</h3>
<h2>            Completly Random shutdown of windows 7 Professional. no BSOD, no Error Code upon restart. </h2>
                    I'm trying to narrow down a problem with my system, it is a custom built computer, running Windows 7 Professional. Every now and then the computer will just black screen and restart. with no error codes, no BSOD, NOTHING. i have done ram checks, HD checks,
 every possible check i can. I believe it is software, however none of the system checks can identify it.
<br />
<br />
any help would be appreciated here.

<p>*** Problem solved !!!!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I had the motherboard replaced (previously Gigabyte EXA 58, i920 chip) with an ASUS P6T motherboard.&nbsp; NO OTHER CHANGES.&nbsp; Same RAM, all peripherials, all drivers, video card, power supply, etc.&nbsp; I didn't change security software, any&nbsp;Windows 7 Professional settings
 or anything else.&nbsp;Only the MoBo&nbsp;swapped.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
PC has been stable ever since.&nbsp; It appears there was some incompatibility with the motherboard (or settings) that caused random restarts.&nbsp; These restarts would occur anytime the PC was on - idle or being used.&nbsp; However the frequency of restarts appeared to
 be increasing - once per day to&nbsp;several per hour - eventually going into that start-up/shut loop cycle that I've read others are reporting.&nbsp; Couldn't interrupt to access BIOS, etc. It was stuffed!<br />
<br />
They swapped the MoBo and no problems since.<br />
<br />
Good luck !<br />

            Don't worry about them.&nbsp; <br />
I, and many other technicians, advise against using registry cleaners.&nbsp; They rarely do any good and can be seriously harmful.&nbsp; An invalid COM reference is not a problem unless called by a program in which case an error would be reported.&nbsp; These are probably
 remnant's of previously installed software and very unlikely to be of any importance.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Store App vanished - only the tile remaines.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Short version:</span></p>
</span><span>
<p>Windows 10 Store App crashed whilst being updated. It couldn't be opened and I found that it disappeared from the list of apps in Settings as if it was uninstalled (or self-destroyed?). I tried what I could from Microsoft forum short of resetting the PC
 but got nowhere. </p>
<p>Is there any way of re-installing the Store without resetting the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Long version:</span></p>
</span>
<p>I have changed to Windows 10 (from 8.1) on my PC on 9th August and until 20th September haven't had any serious problems, except for some notifications not working and many things loading slower than in the previous version. It may be helpful if I give an
 account of how the Store App crashed.</p>
<p>On 20.9. I opened the start screen and found the News tile (which was turned on as live tile) stuck on one picture which was misted over with a grey veil. I clicked on it hoping that opening the News App might get it back to "live" mode (a thing which did
 the trick sometimes in the past) but instead of the News the Store App opened. Not on the home page, but instead showing the page with 18 updates in various stages of progress: pending, downloading, installing. After a while it became reasonably clear that
 the screen is "frozen" and updates are not progressing. At this point I should add that the PC was set for automatic updates since I installed Windows 10. I couldn't make sense of what was going on and tried first restarting the computer.
</p>
<p>After the restart the 18 updates were still shown as before with no progress and no movement. The News App was at the top of the updating list, stuck on installing. The News tile on the start screen didn't respond. Having layman's thoughts about a bottle-neck
 because of too many updates I put 11 of them on pause and left only 7 that I use regularly. This resulted (to my surprise) in commencement of the installation of the 7 updates. The News App got completed along with 4 others. Two remained. The Store App and
 one more. The Store App was showing "installing" in progress when the screen lost part of the display and froze. After a while I close the Store App and that was it. I couldn't open it again. Neither by clicking the Store tile on the start screen nor through
 Search. </p>
<p>I read up and tried what I could from Microsoft forum, short of resetting the computer, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>At one point I noticed that the Store App disappeared from the list of apps in Settings (System&gt;Apps and features) as if it was uninstalled. After that I gave up and hoped that Microsoft will somehow discover the mishap and correct it. A month passed and
 there is no Store. I can live without it but it would be nice to have it back even just for the sake of completness.</p>
<p>Is there any way of re-installing the Store without resetting the computer? </p>

<p>
</p><p>I had tried the first three methods back in September but without success. Now I have set up a local account as you advised and the Store app was there, working alright. But it didn't fix the Store on the Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way this could be fixed or if not, can the downloads from the Store on the&nbsp;local account be transferred to Microsoft account? Or more generally, how can the files be shared between the two accounts?</p>

<p><span>If Store app is working fine in new user profile it means there is some corruption with the old account. So, try to switch local account to Microsoft account and see if it helps.
</span><span><span>Follow these steps to switch local account to “Microsoft account”.</span></span></p>

<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows key +W”.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Ramesh Kumar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. I have&nbsp;a Microsoft account and I&nbsp;had created a local account only in order to get the Windows Store app back. I now have&nbsp;the app&nbsp;working on the local account but can't restore it on the MS account where I would prefer to have it.
 I don't want to switch the local account to Microsoft account because of the work involved with customising settings and transferring the files etc. For just getting the Store app back the effort needed seems not worth it. And, I don't know whether&nbsp;the switch
 you suggest could be done this way&nbsp;as I already have a MS account. So, unfortunately, your answer didn't help me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the meantime I found out that since I am set for automatic updates (and don't need the&nbsp;Store app for managing updates) I could do without the Store app simply&nbsp;by viewing and downloading Windows apps, games etc.&nbsp;from Microsoft Store online.&nbsp;It seems
 to have the same content as the Store app.&nbsp;I haven't seen this as a possible&nbsp;answer to many questions&nbsp;I looked at which were&nbsp;dealing with&nbsp;lost access to the Store app&nbsp;, so perhaps it may help someone to by-pass the issue. Seems too simple to be true. Or did
 I overlook something? Quite possible, I&nbsp;haven't got much experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again. </p>

</p><p>The new skype v8.11 minimized to background task, how to turn back the older ones that the skype minimized only beside start menu?</p>
<p>or can the notification keep showing right side window only close when the user already viewed?</p>

Hi<br />
<br />
Please see the following article.<br />
<br />
<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978610/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>The system memory reported as (usable) in the System Information box in 64-bit Windows 7 may
 be less than the amount of installed RAM</span></span></a></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span><span><span>
