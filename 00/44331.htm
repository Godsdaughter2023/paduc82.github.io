<h2>            Issue with the USB mouse not connecting on the computer.</h2>
                    I have a USB Logitech mouse that I've been using for a few years. All of a sudden, the movement sensitivity is very slow, so I went into the control panel to adjust it. I don't know if I did anything because it's still very slow. After a little troubleshooting,
 it says it's not connected. I changed the batteries in the mouse, but that didn't make any difference. I don't really know how to troubleshoot this further. Any ideas?

    <title>Windows 10 Pro - keyboard and mouse do not respond, my PC is a BRICK - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ppsmtl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - keyboard and mouse do not respond, my PC is a BRICK</h2>
                    <p>I have Win10 Pro and this problem happened today. I was using my pc, stepped out for a while and when I came back my mouse and keyboard didn't work. As if they were completely dead, no power indicators, no reaction to caps/num lock presses. PC clearly was
 NOT stuck, time was updating and everything looked normal. I rebooted and I have the same problem - PC is a brick, keyboard absolutely does not respond to any key presses. I tried obvious things like moving kb or mouse to another usb port, all I can say -
 kb and mouse are ok, they just stop working in Win10.</p>
<p>There is actually more to it: when pc boots up during post I can use mouse and kb (in bios they work as usual), but the moment it reaches multiboot screen (similar to this one:&nbsp;https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/xwindows-10-dual-boot-boot-menu.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.wPQ5yVO6K3.png
 ) mouse and kb simply die and completely stop responding as if they get disconnected.</p>
<p>More over, I actually had two versions on win10 installed (on both of my drives) and for some reason somehow another version of windows became default one (from wrong drive) and when it starts up it has exactly the same problem with mouse and kb and I cannot
 even select the other version of windows during multiboot load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had that exact problem happen a few month ago when that creators' update was released when many people had issues with the update. I ended up totally reinstalling windows back then, as I wasn't able to repair it. While reinstalling it back then I installed
 another version of win10 on the other drive to be able to recover files from installation that got bricked. Since that day I had two win10 installs and somehow this problem happened again and the most surprising part is that the other version of windows is
 equally affected by that. Just to give quick background so that nobody tries to give grandma advises on what to click: I'm software engineer with 15+ years of experience and I'm very familiar with windows inside out. I don't run any shady/unusual stuff (except
 I run vbox as a service to run ubuntu in the background, but I had that for years and never had any issues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does feel like it's some kind of rootkit that simply replaces keyboard drivers on all windows installs that it can find on all drives (win10 was downloaded from microsoft just in case), or as if some kind of bios/hardware fault or killswitch in windows.
 When the problem happened the only things that I was running were visual studio, tortoise git and chrome, that's all</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem seems similar to this cases where people also had the same issue with kb/mouse:</p>

<h2>            Turning Surface Pro into Kiosk</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro on Surface Pro 4. &nbsp;I want to set up my surface pro as a kiosk. &nbsp;I get how to restrict the access. &nbsp;What I want to do in Kiosk mode is to have two titled buttons on the first "home screen." &nbsp;When anyone touches one of the buttons a short mp4
 video plays (a separate video for each button). &nbsp;When the video is over I want it to automatically go back to the home screen so the next person walking by can select either of the buttons then watch the corresponding video. &nbsp;This would all be done off-line,
 no internet access would be needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need a separate ap to create the buttons and video play? &nbsp;Can anyone recommend one? &nbsp;Thanks,</p>

            You'd either have to write a custom application or get someone to do that for you. You can use your favorite search engine to search for "kiosk software", but this really sounds like a custom application.

    <title>Windows 10 59.94 refresh rate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pandafromuganda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 59.94 refresh rate</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've recently upgraded from windows 7 professional x64 to windows 10 and now I am facing problems with refresh rate in games. I've got newest stable amd drivers installed (my gr. card is radeon 7950 OC from gigabyte) and my screen is asus pb238q connected
 via DVI cable. The problem that is driving me nuts is that I can not choose 1920x1080@60hz resolution in ANY game, the highest possible is 1920x1080@59.93-94hz. That wouldn't bother me, but my desktop refresh rate is 60 hz and that is what I've got chosen
 in Catalyst Control Center, so whenever I switch from game to desktop, it takes about 5-6 seconds of black screen because of the difference in refreshing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I writing on this forum? Because the problem never occured in windows 7 and I think this is caused by the update of the os. Any ideas on how to resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your interest in Windows 10. Let me help you out with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you installed the Windows 10 version drivers for AMD Graphic card? If no,
I suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the latest display drivers in the Computer. If Windows 10 drivers aren't available, then we suggest you to download the Windows 7/8 drivers to install them in the compatibility mode. Refer to the following article
 for help to do the same:</span></p>

            Hey, thanks for the reply. As soon as I updated to Windows 10, I uninstalled the drivers via control panel --&gt; uninstall programs, then i launched my pc in a safe mode and using driver sweeper I deleted all left overs from display drivers. Then I installed
 they newest drivers avaiable for my gr. Card, which are compatible with Windows 10. So I dont think that may be the problem, but I am willing to try your method, that is uninstall drivers via device manager, the only thing that is kinda bothering me is that
 won't it cause any issues with the drivers I ve already got installed?

<br />
<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Yes often a restart will fix the issue.

            Hi Alain,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />Windows update 1809 amd64 is correct also for your processor, because x64 architecture was registered as amd64.
<br />I think the problem is with Windows Update, so please follow this procedure:
<br />
<br />1. Type "Powershell" in Windows search bar
<br />2. Right click on "Powershell"
<br />3. Click on "Run as Administrator"
<br />4. Type :
<br />
<br /> "net stop wuauserv" without quotes and press ENTER.
<br /> "net stop cryptSvc" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net stop bits" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net stop msiserver" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net start wuauserv" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net start cryptSvc" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net start bits" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net start msiserver" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br />
<br />Then perform a disk clean-up:
<br />
<br />1. Open "File Explorer"
<br />2. Click on "This PC"
<br />3. Right click on "C:"
<br />4. Click on "Proprieties"
<br />5. Click on "Clean-up disk"
<br />6. Click on "Clean up system files"
<br />7. Select every option in the list, but not "Download"
<br />8. Click on "OK"
<br />
<br />Now search again for updates.
<br />Please let me know if that solves your issue.       
        </p>

            Hi, Alain
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />If this does not work, you can try to update manually

            Hi Alain 
<br />
<br />Don't worry about that being labelled AMD64, that update is still applicable to your PC 
<br />
<br />AMD invented and owns the 64bit architecture, so even if your system is Intel based, as long as it is 64bit, that update will be applicable . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1809 and bring your PC right up to date 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If the above link does not result in a successful installation, with these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO 
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading 
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet 
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed 
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade by choosing 'Upgrade' not install . . .

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />After doing some research, I found that other users have had the same issue as you and have found a way to manually install XPS viewer. Here is a link to the solution:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/install-xps-viewer-windows-10-version-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/install-xps-viewer-win...</a>
<br />
<br />You'll need to follow the steps under the subheading "Install XPS Viewer in Windows 10 using DISM".
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            <p>Hi there Wesley,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are trying to connect Surface to an HD TV and the image on the screen looks wrong, then:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>If you're using an HDMI extension cable or converter, try removing it and using just the Surface HD Digital AV adapter if possible.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Check the resolution of your TV and change it if necessary. Surface supports a minimum output resolution of 1366 × 768 and a maximum output resolution of 1920 × 1080.</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<h2>            Fallout&#58; where it should be and its history.</h2>
                    
<p>I was on fallout wiki known as the vault for five hours and i learned a lot more about everything fallout. Its amazing how much info and history of fallout is on there. With all information i read i have a totally diffrent idea for the next game. The Enclave
 where the first faction i read along with all its attachments, they might appear in the next game, but a small chance. Ceasars legion was the next, now they are the most intereting faction ever, i already knew a lot about them but now i know way more. I think
 they have a big chance of bieng in the next game because of how much territory the control, they controll 3 states, Arizona, Colorado, and New mexico. Even if it takes after the story of the courier helping the NCR at the dam and crosing the colorado to the
 east side, its not the last of the legion. And i learned more about the midwestern BOS, they left after the master destruction in fallout 1 and went on airships east and got taking down by storms and now live on the outskirts of chicago. So who knows if they
 fought the enclave there if they are, and who put that license plate on E-DE, and also they never heard about the enclave back in cali because they left way before the conflict. I think the next game has a strong chance of bieng there and would be really cool,
 mabey youre charcter is born into the BOS there or if there is another vault in the area or mabey just a person that lives in one of the town there. It would be a cool place to have it in because of the big urban and rural areas and story behind the place.
 So those are my places i think it will be in, tell me what you think? Oh and head on over to fallout wiki to find out more in the&nbsp;fallout stories and factions.</p>

<p>You clearly missed the whole Dr. Curling dialogue file about preventing the Enclave from ever returning to power.&nbsp; Also, the Midwestern BOS never fought the Enclave in
<em>Tactics</em>, they fought against this supercomputer thing and its robots (also, your player character in
<em>Tactics</em> is part of that BOS).&nbsp; The only vault around there that is mentioned is Vault 0, and no one is there anymore.&nbsp; I don't think the Enclave base in Chicago would be around anymore, considering that even if the Midwestern BOS had no reason to mess
 with the Enclave, the Enclave would have a reason to mess with the BOS, and considering it was probably a small outpost, they wouldn't fare too well.&nbsp; The license plate was also put on by some kid in Illinois from what I remember of
<em>Lonesome Road</em></p>

<p>Oh i remember the kid on the logs from lonesome road, i never said that the BOS &nbsp;there fought the Enclave there but it would be cool to find out what is going on there and if they ever made contact there with the Enclave or if they are fighting them there.
 I hope the next game is in Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico and mabey some parts in Texas, i just want the legion to have a big part in it, and that it contniues after the courier beat the legion at Hoover dam along side with the NCR and Ceasar escaped, but
 legate lanius was killed by him. it should be a little time after those events and the NCR is going to push further east. Hey have you noticed that we and a few others are the only ones that actually care about this stuff, everyone else just put dum post or
 threads that are useless. Im going to go on fallout wiki again and find out more on fallout.</p>

<p>I mean, I wouldn't generalize every thread like that, and the only reason I care is because I'm an original<em> Fallout</em> fan/canon snob.&nbsp; You also said "if" the BOS was fighting them there; I'm saying they probably wouldn't be.&nbsp; There isn't/shouldn't
 be much left of the Enclave, so if they ever did come in contact with the Midwestern BOS, they would be dealt with quickly.&nbsp; I don't know if
<em>Fallout </em>should return to Texas; bad memories of FOBOS there, might actually give...canon status to some of that game.&nbsp; Ugh, just the thought of that makes me sick<br />
<br />
I would like to see some of the locations in Arizona and Colorado that were supposed to be in
<em>Van Buren</em>, but not if it means another NCR vs. Legion plot, because then you're just rehashing
<em>New Vegas</em>.&nbsp; And a couple of good articles I'd suggest reading on the Vault are the timeline article and any article on one of the major factions like the Enclave, the super mutants, and the Brotherhood of Steel (I actually wrote or rewrote a good portion
 of the history section for that).&nbsp; I'd say read the plots of the first two games in the series as well, but you should really just play through them instead or watch

<p>Ya because its been so long since they left and crashed there. If the game is going to be in Arizona or Colorado its going to have the legion in if, i just hope they dont go with the story of van buren for the next game. If it is another story of the NCR
 and legion fighting i would not be mad at all, i mean because of the game engine would be new and the brotherhood could be involved in it. Ceasar hates all the hightech weapons and gear, i think he would really hate the BOS a lot, and i would like to see how
 he could go up against them. I remember in fallout 3 after you beat the enclave at adams airforce base, Elder Lyons said that they might come back in following years, and youre charcter asked why and he said this is not the last we have seen of the Enclave.
 I took those words that bethesda would put the enclave in the another game. The only way that the Enclave shouled reapear again they should come with lots of troops and use brutal force. In fallout 3 the Enclave were fun to fight, but the thing is that they
 were not in any towns, they just had little bases in the wasteland, the thing that was cool was the vertibirds flying and landing and doing bomb runs on areas. If they would return they actually need to make a impact on the game and there should be the choice
 to be in whatever faction you wanted to be in, like in new vegas. And if they would return to the next game everyone would be happy and exited to see them, mabey we will see a trailer for the next game at 2012 E3.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who crashed when and where? </li><li>There are a few NCR-controlled areas of Arizona (like Baja), but yeah, probably
</li><li>Why not?&nbsp; <em>Van Buren</em> had a great story with a new and original player character, new factions, new locations, a new villain, and a sense of urgency and impending doom
</li><li>The BOS should not be that involved in anything.&nbsp; That's the role they play in the
<em>Fallout </em>series...or are supposed to play anyway </li><li>Caesar orders you to destroy the Mojave chapter of the BOS.&nbsp; That's how he feels about them
</li><li>Honestly, Bethesda couldn't even justify the Enclave's appearance in <em>Fallout 3</em>, so I don't see how they could justify resurrecting them a second time.&nbsp; And what, it'd just be another "Enclave uses a modified strand of FEV to kill everyone that
 isn't them" plot?&nbsp; Even though Dr. Curling said that the destruction of the Oil Rig would prevent that from ever happening again?&nbsp; So I just take that as Elder Lyons getting drunk to celebrate the BOS's victory and talking out of his haughty-taughty a**
</li><li>No, the ONLY way that they should appear again is how <em>New Vegas</em> did them: a dwindling shadow of the power they once were, old and just trying to move on with their lives, AND out of the way of the plot.&nbsp; You know, consistent with canon?&nbsp; Yeah,
 give them an optional sidequest that develops a companion's background, let them fight in Hoover Dam with whatever side you choose, and then give them a slide in the ending showing the consequences of your actions, but that's all optional.&nbsp; They should NOT
 be a major power ever, EVER again </li><li>The "little bases in the wasteland" is kind of how the Enclave operates </li><li>No, not everyone would be happy to see them.&nbsp; Most original <em>Fallout </em>
fans didn't like their inclusion in <em>Fallout 3</em>, only newer fans liked it because they didn't know any better (no offense).&nbsp; Hell, I wasn't even that happy to see them in
<em>New Vegas</em> initially. I eventually came around to not minding much since it was consistent with canon,
<em>New Vegas</em> handled them well, and I got to run around in the actual advanced power armor for the first time since
<em>Fallout 2</em> (not that useless, stupid-looking variant from <em>Fallout 3</em>), but I still didn't feel like they had to be included
</li><li>I'd guess E3 2013 as the earliest we will see a trailer for <em>Fallout 4</em>

<p>Baha goes straight down from California and a little of of Arizona and the NCR has controll of that, and none of Ceasars men have been down there. Baha is part of Mexico. Most of these people on these forums make up there own story of stuff that has not
 even happend yet and they take it like it has already hapend. I meant the Enclave in fallout 3 were not like i thought they would have been. On the enclave radio they said that they were in towns and other places but you never got to go there. fallout 3 was
 cool and fun but there was not many people and towns. Why would the destruction of the oil rig from fallout 2 be the Enclave never retuning to power? And out of all the states its not the last of the enclave, but it depends on who makes it, if bethesda makes
 the game there is a good chance that they will play big part in it. if obsidian makes it mabey they will play a little part in it like in new vegas, but now with tim cain in the works who knows what will hapen. with skyrim about to release behtesda will need
 to work on something big, mabet a new fallout game on the way, we will probaly get the first hint around 2012 or mabey in this years Video Game Awards like a little teaser that would get everybody talking and pumed.</p>

<p>[/quote]Why would that stop the Enclave from returning?&nbsp; A couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Oil Rig was their main base, and the majority of their resources (i.e. the vertibirds they would need to travel great distances) were on that base and destroyed along with it, as well as their entire leadership and the majority of their forces
</li><li>Any forces on the ground would be killed by the NCR (which <em>New Vegas </em>
confirmed), and the NCR overran Navarro, the Enclave's main base </li><li>The Enclave is a horribly exclusive group who isn't going to EVER recruit wastelanders, and in order to repopulate their numbers, they would need to have one massive orgy.&nbsp; Why? Because by the time of
<em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em>, most Enclave members who were stationed on the West Coast would be between their 60s and 80s (if not older), so they'd be dying off.&nbsp; And it's not like all of them had children, and even then, that'd just make it harder
 for them to cross coasts </li><li>The Enclave isn't that big that they could be spread throughout several states.&nbsp; When they first started coming off the Oil RIg, that was when they first came onto the mainland.&nbsp; Before that, they weren't.&nbsp; All the personnel at Raven Rock are from the West
 Coast (somehow), and they probably (somehow) built the outpost in Chicago on their way to D.C
</li><li>But most importantly, Dr. Curling states that killing everyone on board the Oil Rig (i.e. by blowing it up) is the only way to insure that the Enclave will never come to power and resume their research again.&nbsp; And being the leader of the Chemical Corps,
 he knows what he is talking about </li></ul>

<p>[/quote]Really?&nbsp; With those little beady eyes and mini "horns"?&nbsp; Not at all; the
<em>New Vegas</em> version was the same as the one in <em>Fallout 2</em> anyway.&nbsp; Not to mention that the power armor in
<em>Fallout 3</em> didn't do anything, where as the power armor in <em>New Vegas </em>
was actually somewhat worth a damn</p>

<h2>            PC crashed has my free Windows 10 Pro on it, how do I transfer license to new PC&#63;</h2>
                    My PC crashed, it powers on and the hard drives work, but nothing will boot onto the screen (and no it's not the monitor, I'm using it for the new pc.). I have a free Windows 10 Pro license on the crashed PC and from what I read it is transferrable. I
 can see my old PC on my Microsoft Account "devices" and it shows that I have a Windows 10 Pro license on that PC. I want to transfer the license to the new PC, but I do not have access to the product key or digital license from the crashed PC.

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license: 
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />You could try chatting with support agent and explain the situation in detail and they might be able to activate it. We were able to confirm with Microsoft under some circumstances, OEM licenses can be reactivated even under the free upgrade offer. Its not guaranteed every support agent will do it though, but you can try your luck.
<br />
<br />Microsoft's view is, as long as you are not abusing the license, you should get a pass. 
<br />
<br />Activate Your Windows 10 License via Microsoft Chat Support
<br />Use the following link to directly reach a live agent who can assist you:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>

<br />
<br />If its a retail key, you will need to try either of the following:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Scroll down, click 'Troubleshoot'
<br />Sign in with your MIcrosoft Account
<br />
<br />Select the machine you previously had it on in the activation wizard then click Next.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, change the machine name to the one you have listed in the activation window, restart then see if it reactivates automatically.

<h2>            What files are safe to move from my C drive to another drive</h2>
                    
<p>I understand that Vista partitions the hard disk into 2 drives. On mine it seems to be C (Vista) and E (data). My C drive is now 90% full while the E drive is (90%) free. I've been told I should move some files from the C drive to the E drive to free up
 space. Have I been given the correct advice? If so, which files are safe to move over as I really don't want to lose anything important. As you can see my computer knowledge is very basic and any help would be very appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Quick access page is the shortest route to files you've been working on and folders you often use. These are your frequent folders and recent files.</p>
<div>&nbsp;Windows 10 introduces to be able to "Pin to Quick access" and "Unpin from Quick access" locations now. These locations include local and network folders, drives, libraries, Recycle Bin, etc..., but files and apps cannot be pinned to home. Pinned folders
 replace favorites in the new File Explorer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Select one or more folders, click/tap on the Home tab, and click/tap on the Pin to Quick access button in the ribbon. (see screenshot below)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>or </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Right click or press and hold on a location, and click/tap on Pin to Quick access</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If the issue persists then place the computer in&nbsp;a Clean Boot and then try this step. (Provide steps and disclaimer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Reply us back with any issues with windows.</p>
<p>We are glad to help.</p>

            <p>THANK YOU for this!&nbsp; I have been beating my head against the wall with the typical MS "Boot into Safemode, Run this or that diagnostic, try as a different user, recreate your user profile (like that is ever a good option!)", and on and on.&nbsp; This worked like
 a charm, although I'm not certain what would have caused the problem in the first place - any ideas on that?&nbsp; I have a feeling it will pop up again as more of my users are upgraded to Win10.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

</p><p>Just what I needed! Thank you. I guess its a bug from running Reset. The first folder was empty for my case but clearing the second two folders solved the problem! Thanks for the post!</p>

            That's not something Xbox can fix as that is done through the internet and not Live itself. You can file a complaint on the users you believe are doing it and the enforcement team can investigate it, but otherwise, you would need to work with your ISP
 to help keep you online.
