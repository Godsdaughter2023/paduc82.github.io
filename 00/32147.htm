    <title>thumbcache.dll on my windows 10 machine memory usage out of sight - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t r berta  say:</h3>
<h2>            thumbcache.dll on my windows 10 machine memory usage out of sight</h2>
                    <p>On my Windows 10 desktop machine, there are several instances of<strong> dllhost.exe</strong> running.&nbsp; Only one has a memory issue.&nbsp; According to my Process Explorer display it is the one running
<strong>thumbcache.dll.&nbsp; </strong>It is common within a few days of rebooting my machine for the "Working Set" measurement to top 10-12 Gb, and the "Private Bytes" measurement to top 4-5Gb.&nbsp; A few days ago this dll hit a record Working Set of over 23Gb (Process
 Explorer shows it as 23,000,000 K).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open a directory with lots of photos or videos, I can watch Process Explorer and observe the memory usage pop up for that process.&nbsp; When I close File Explorer, the usage never goes down.&nbsp; Clearly there's a background process that uses thumbcache.dll
 because occasionally its memory usage will explode overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at my thumbcache*.db files in C:\Users\%my user name%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer, but all of them are in the 0-5 Mb range.&nbsp; Nothing exessive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can kill that instance of dllhost,.exe and the system will restart it small and begin building excessive levels of memory usage all over again.&nbsp; Rebooting has the same effect of course.&nbsp; This is a fairly recent development (in the last six months or so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched the forums and see a lot of generic information about dllhost, but none if it helpful, and almost none of it current and nothing specifically related to thumbcache.dll&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It genuinely looks like some kind of garbage collection issue or a memory leak but that's just guesswork.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize I'm quoting "virtual" memory measurements, but eventually it uses up all the physical memory on my 8Gb machine.&nbsp; Then it starts to slow things down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any hard information about problems with <strong>thumbcache.dll</strong>?</p>
<p />

            Hi,  T
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />The System File Checker tool built into Windows can scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a file has been modified, it will automatically replace that file with the correct version. Here’s how to use it.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/running-dismexe-online-cleanup-image-restorehealth/65d252cb-f361-4872-906f-ea8febf51686">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Kathleen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp; Yes, I've run sfc /scannow several times in the last month or two, the most recent about 15 minutes ago.&nbsp; I haven't run the others, but since my CMD window is still open, they're running right now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>...and...&nbsp; they're done.</p>

<p><strong>I have seen a few posts about this but non have been very helpful.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My computer (Dell Inspiron 2200) was running relatively slow and I decided to reformat the machine. &nbsp;After doing so it appears the hard drive was fried in the process as I was unable to get the machine to start properly after

    <title>Microsoft Game Room &#40; Windows PC version &#41; Stuck On Loading - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Game Room &#40; Windows PC version &#41; Stuck On Loading Screen</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried playing Microsoft Game Room on my PC since I bought my current PC back in November 2014. When I start the game, I get prompted to log into Games For Windows Live. It logs me sucessfully and then I hit "Enter" or the "A" button to continue.
 Then it starts loading and a progress bar appears on the screen underneath "loading". The progress bar gets up to the 25% mark and then stops and hangs indefinitely. The only way out is to sign out of the Games For Windows Live service, and then I can exit
 the game. Or try to log in again but then the problem will repeat. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now bear in mind that Microsoft officially discontinued the Games For Windows Live program on Windows PC's. See this URL for details :<br />
</p>
<p>http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/pc-marketplace-closing<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that on this web page I listed above, it says :<br />
</p>
<div>
"Frequently asked questions
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What happens to the games and downloaded content that I purchased?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>You can continue to enjoy previously purchased games and downloadable content in your catalog by downloading it through the
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/Live/PC/DownloadClient" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Games for Windows Live client.</a> Although the purchase functionality will be discontinued, the Games for Windows Live service will continue to operate as usual."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried launching Game Room from the Games For Windows Live Marketplace client and also straight out of Windows Explorer. The result is the same. I tried uninstalling Game Room and all of the downloadable content for it and then reinstalled it.
 The result was the same. ( Note that you can still download Game Room and all of its DLC through the Games For Windows Marketplace client and that this client can still be downloaded from this page : http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/PC/DownloadClient ).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the question is, can Game Room still be played with Games For Windows Live being discontinued? Do we have to wait until Microsoft makes a new version of the software that removes the Games For Windows Live authentication from the game? I invested
 a lot of money in the DLC for Game Room which I value a lot so I don't want to find out that this game is just inoperable for the indefinite future. I payed good money for the DLC and I feel ripped off.

            <p>The Key here is a COA_SLP Key - which CANNOT be legally bought and sold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a COA attached to the computer? (other than the one which should have come with this disk)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the Key in the report match the Key on the computer? - if not, then&nbsp;this Key is&nbsp;a counterfeit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at your suplier's site.....</p>
<p>.It's almost certainly stuff-full of counterfeits.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update Assistant repeat failure Security update 1709 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> floretharoberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Assistant repeat failure Security update 1709</h2>
                    <p>I have the Windows 10 Update Assistant.&nbsp; The assistant is doing auto updating; and repeatedly trying to install an update that fails to install.&nbsp; I has begun to occur so often, it disrupts my work and occasionally turns off some features/functions or freezes
 apps or programs that are running.&nbsp; It stops my Cortona audio, and search functions.&nbsp; Plus, it stops my Windows start button functions.&nbsp; I end up having to use the Task Manager to stop the Update Assistant from running just to continue my work.&nbsp; It is preventing&nbsp;
 me from accessing the start menu apps or using the Power, Shutdown, Restart functions to logoff or restart the system so it can run diagnostics and try to repair the issue.&nbsp; I do admit I have a older model of HP laptops, and my Windows 10 was issued to me
 as a Beta Tester free about 2 years ago.&nbsp; It has been working wonderfully; and I enjoy my Cortona and the latest features added to Windows 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had begun to feel the New Windows 10 was made just for me.&nbsp; The HP originally installed over XP, then Windows
 7.&nbsp; It was a "hand-me-down" device; but it has continued to served me well for the past 3 years.&nbsp; I have to admit that the HP is a great device and has been with me for about 3 years now without serious issues that couldn't be maintenanced.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was working
 great with new OS installs and all types of updates and app installs.&nbsp; It took the "upgrade" smoothly.&nbsp; I had to give a "big ups" to HP and my new Windows 10.&nbsp; The device and programs have allowed me to do a lot of great things.&nbsp; I am even surprised sometimes;
 when I see the cool things I could do with my good old buddy HP device and my latest and greatest Windows apps and features that downloaded with the upgrade and updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a student and I am often required to access and install different resources required by the school site to access online learning and collaboration apps and software from the school software store as learning resource tools provided by the school.&nbsp;
 I wasn't sure if the Anytime Upgrade expires after a specific time; but I didn't think that would prevent the OS continued updates or use. It has a pretty recent update.&nbsp; Service Pack 1&nbsp; is installed, as well.&nbsp; I wonder if RAM memory is running out.&nbsp; I have
 put the HP to the test.&nbsp; I use it for all types of things...streaming, video conferencing, music, occasional gaming, photo storage, everything.&nbsp; I do clean the drive here and there by cleaning my browsers, clear my storage by using online cyber space storages
 (i.e., Google Drive, Onedrive and flash drives).&nbsp; I store a lot of Homework assignments, presentations, occasional Excel workbooks and spreadsheets; and lots of needed collaboration resource apps from the Microsoft Store.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although some of the Windows Assistant update successfully install; the Failed security updates 1709 keeps failing and filing the update cache.&nbsp; I am actually not really sure of how I got the Windows Update Assistant in the first place.&nbsp; I didn't know if
 it came with a Windows </p>
<p>system Automatic Update; or if it downloaded with some of the school's resource apps when I install new apps and programs.&nbsp; I have what appears to be a least a hundred or so failed updates--give or take a few.&nbsp; Can or should I uninstall them; delete or hide
 them?&nbsp; I have waited for the issue to resolve itself by allowing the&nbsp; repeating updates to keep installing and report the issue to Windows itself.&nbsp; I keep getting a message after the update fails from the Assistant stating that it "We keeps getting better",
 when each install fails; or successful.&nbsp; I was under the impression that the Assistant will keep trying until it has figures out a resolution; and then resolve what's reporting back to Windows.&nbsp; I think I read somewhere that you should not delete failed updates
 so that they are logged to the system error logs for error reporting and resolutions usage.&nbsp; So far, it has been 4 or 5 months with the issue.&nbsp; I have checked the forums; and I see that there are others that come to the forum area with the same issue.&nbsp; Now
 I have stopped thinking it might be my current security programs (Trend Micro); or my HP device having problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!&nbsp; Is this an issue Windows is already working on; or can I find a work around until the issue has been solved? I need the interruptions to stop.&nbsp; They are occurring too often now.&nbsp; It interrupts during final exams and test that are on timers.&nbsp; That
 affects my grades.&nbsp; If I get thrown out of an exam; it will grade me only on info that was saved or completed.&nbsp; I can't reset or get back into the work--so I lose the grade; or fail the exam or quiz.&nbsp; The Assistant will sometimes not allow me to turn it off
 or exit out of anything.&nbsp; I have tried to uninstall the Assistant all together.&nbsp; When I shutdown and reboot; there it is again--without fail.&nbsp; It reloads itself; so I thought it may have been downloaded by Windows 10 service pack 1 to aid Systems resources.&nbsp;
 I am reluctant to keep trying to remove it; or uninstall updates until there is a resolution from Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that my HP finally got too old, and/or is running out of RAM or DRAM memory?&nbsp; I don't like to us those non-preferred registry cleaners.&nbsp; They make me have to do a lot of troubleshooting afterwards and restore necessary files and drivers.&nbsp; Those
 things tend to remove or delete a lot from the registry just to make the startup fun faster.&nbsp; Problem with that it's a temporary fix that is bandaged and comes back to haunt you like a "Ghost in the Machine".&nbsp; I avoid them like the plague.&nbsp; If they are not
 Microsoft or Windows preferred or recommended; I tend to not want to use them.&nbsp; Can my "Happy Lap" be saved at all; or am I due to get another one all together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Floretha.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Presence of the Update Assistant means it is trying to install a version Update which is apparently choking and unable to proceed.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>flash drive, error message, backup, shadow volume - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            flash drive, error message, backup, shadow volume </h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I bought an 8gb flash drive to perform a backup. I kept getting a can't access message and tried a few troubleshooting tools to no avail.
<br />
<br />
my other flash drives work fine (not for back up). <br />
<br />
bought a new 8gb flash drive (in case the issue was with the other) and now the backup stops mid-way stating there is not enough space on the flash drive (the backup data is about 5.5gb) on a 8gb flash drive. i have to cancel because if i try and click either
 button option on the "insert a new disc" prompt, the pop up gets stuck and I have to force shut down. The error report stated: "Error returned while creating the volume shadow copy:80042301"<br />
<br />
I don't know if it is the backup utility, the driver utility, a registry problem, something else, or all of the above.<br />
<br />
thanks for the help!

<p>This evening, as part of monthly scheduled maintenance, on 7 XP Pro machines, all with the same software configuration, the monthly backup failed on 5 of the 7 machines with the error 80042301 using Windows Backup.</p>
<p><strong>"Error returned while creating the volume shadow copy:80042301"<br />
<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The machines all go through the same monthly procedure, in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows update </li><li>Microsoft Security Essentials update and quickscan </li><li>CCleaner update </li><li>Java Update (no update needed) </li><li>Adobe flash update (no update needed) </li><li>Adobe Reader update (all machines updated) </li><li>Quickbooks update (no update needed) </li><li>CCleaner cleanup (only trash files, no registry cleaning (ever)) </li><li>Disk cleanup (removed all except most recent restore point) </li><li>Disk defrag </li><li>And then the windows backup, to a second dedicated drive on each machine. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, the same procedure is used for all machines, regardless, every month following patch Tuesday.</p>
<p>Five of the Seven machines all failed with the error 80042301.&nbsp; The other two completed their backups as they always have.</p>
<p>All machines have the same administrator rights.</p>
<p>Question:&nbsp; What is the common link?&nbsp; What is the problem? Why 5 of 7 failures, or why 2 of 7 successes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>Doc</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; Yes, I know this thread is a year old.&nbsp; But, it was the only one with the same error.</p>
<p>Also, no blaming the procedure, as 2 of the 7 machines had no problem.&nbsp; And, this procedure has been in place for a year, with backups every month.&nbsp; Never before today has a failure occurred.</p>

<p>The flash drive is formated FAT32 and as such it is limited to a maximum file size of 4GB.&nbsp; NTFS does not have this 4GB file size limit, format the flash drive to NTFS and you will be able to use it to store the backup.</p>
<p>You will not be able to format the flash drive to NTFS if it is "Optimized for quick removal", to be able to format it NTFS it must be set to "Optimize for performance", see here:</p>

<p>John, my post is for XP, and I am not using flash drives, and I stated that all machines had a dedicated backup drive.&nbsp; I posted here because the problem is with XP, and the error is the same as I am experiencing with Windows Backup, on XP pro.&nbsp; The "7"
 that you see is the number of machines in my configuration - ALL ARE XP PRO.&nbsp; And, all drives are NTFS.</p>
<p>Please read carefully, and help if you can.</p>

<p>Ok, I now understand the problem and have an answer.</p>
<p>Of the 7 workstations, 6 are running a LOB app.&nbsp; The 7th workstation does not have this app.</p>
<p>Of the 5 workstations that failed the backup, all had the same LOB app.</p>
<p>So, why would one workstation with the LOB app, and one without the LOB app, succeed with the backup?</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the vendor of the LOB app did a massive update to their app.&nbsp; All seems to have worked correctly.</p>
<p>Last week, one of the office personnel was trying to email a portion of an Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; It failed.&nbsp; I looked up the error from the email attempt, quickly found the answer, and continued on thinking it was just a fluke.&nbsp; The fix I applied was to the
 one workstation where the backup <strong>succeeded</strong> last night<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Surfing today for the backup error, I stumbled across one posting where they happened to solve their backup problem, rather simply.&nbsp; I noticed that their solution to the backup error was the same fix I did for the Excel email problem last week.</p>
<p>So, I applied the same fix to the remaining 5 workstations with the backup error, and voila!&nbsp;&nbsp; The backup now runs as it should.</p>
<p>It seems the LOB app upgrade somehow corrupted COM+ so that it could not be started, which interferred with VSS and Windows Backup.</p>
<p>Without knowing a deeper explanation of the problem, the simple solution was to "<strong>REGSVR32 OLE32.DLL</strong>", which is the same command I did last week to fix the Excel email error.</p>
<p>So, this explains why one workstation with the LOB app (and OLE32.dll re-registered last week), and the other workstation without the LOB app, both succeeded with the backup last night.&nbsp; It also explains why the other 5 workstations with the LOB app failed
 last night.</p>
<p>The other five workstations ran the backup successfully today, after the fix was applied.</p>
<p>I hope this is valuable to others experiencing the error.</p>

<h2>            see history of history of missed phone-to-Skype-based phone</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Recently Skype required to update it to a newer version and I complied. My current Skype version I use is Skype_</span><span>
</span><span>8.38.0.138<br />
However, I noticed that the updated version of Skype lacks one important feature – it does not show the history of missed phone-to-Skype-based phone calls.<br />
(I have a Skype-based telephone&nbsp; and it's important for me to see who tried to reach me when Skype was off .</span></p>
<p><span>IN previous SKype versions I used to receive messages of MISSED PHONE CALLS and, most importantly,&nbsp; could see the history of missed phone to skype base number .<br />
Now this feature is unavailable with new version. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The new version <span>&nbsp;</span>only shows a brief notice for 1 sec after switching on Skype and then it disappears. This is not convenient.<br />
<br />
As a result I tired to uninstall the newer version of Skype and re-installed the older version<span>&nbsp;
</span>(like 6.14) which had much better functional., but now Skype does not allow that.</span></p>
<p><span>Please help me see the<span>&nbsp; </span>
history of MISSED PHONE CALLS<span>&nbsp; </span>to my Skype-based telephone <br />
Please add this feature to your new Skype version. I am sure I am<span>&nbsp;
</span>not the only one who needs it.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you in advance for your help.</span></p>
<p><span>Dmitriy</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>missed calls should be shown in the list of recent chats and calls, but it might be a bit difficult to spot them.</p>
<p>However, there is another option: you can go to skype.com, login with your account and see list of all calls (incoming and outgoing) in the
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/usage?display=skypein&amp;date=2019-02-01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"My Usage" section</a> and you can even download CSV file.</p>

<h2>            Installed Windows 10, all downloads folders empty</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell inspiron 15-R and after experiencing windows 8.1 for a year and a half I jumped at the chance to upgrade to Windows 10. It seems the notice that said your files won't be affected only applied to programs, because although my programs remain
 unchanged, every downloads folder I have in here was emptied. I don't know how that could have happened, because they were under "This PC &gt; Downloads"</p>
<p>Are they gone for good? Is there a tool to get them back? I've not emptied my Recycle Bin but it doesn't appear to be in there.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply, Neha! I went that route and found the downloads folder was also empty, and just to be sure I went to My PC and did a search for any .mp3 files or anything with a word I know would only be in the downloads (Bob Marley, Apashe,
 etc.) and, sadly, yielded no results. I'll be rolling it back to 8.1 (sadly, haha) and then I'll offload my downloads onto a USB, reinstall windows 10 if the free upgrade applies twice, then I'll bring it back from the USB. Are there any flaws with my plan?
 I'm not sure if I'm forgetting or not considering anything.</p>

            Have you tried resetting your NIC in command prompt? Try opening CMD and using the command "IPCONFIG /RELEASE" and then "IPCONFIG /RENEW"<br />
<br />
Also try IPCONFIG /ALL and go through and make sure you have an appropriate IP address for your network. You may have to manually configure your IPv4 settings to something that is within your router's addressing capabilities.<br />

            Had the same problem in win 10 with error
<ol>
<li>website (www.microsoft.com) is online but isn't responding to connection attempts.</li><li>Ping came back everything good.</li><li>Network adapter working perfect.</li><li>ISP phoned and tried all the clearing DNS cache etc etc</li></ol>
<p>Uninstaled driver for NIC and restarted windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 installed driver and everything worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference between the old and new drivers..... Old driver signed by Realtec inc</p>
<p>new driver signed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems ISP hardware has been updated to expect Microsoft signed driver.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this saves someone sitting on the phone to ISP premium helpline for over an hour.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Lexmark x2670 printer, scanner will not communicate with Windows 7&#40;32&#41;</h2>
                    I am using microsoft security essentials. I am trying to install Lexmark x2670 on my laptop (win 7(32)). &nbsp;After running all the diagnostic and uninstalling and reinstalling using several different methods i still get message that firewall blocking lxdncoms.exe
 and lxdnwbgw.exe. &nbsp;I cannot see how this happening. What am I missing? what should I do?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Toshiba M505-S4972 laptop. I run windows 7 32 bit. &nbsp;It has an Intel T4300 processor. I use microsoft security essentials. &nbsp;I have run malware programs and found nothing. There are a number of administrative errors but none that I can link to this
 problem. &nbsp;Windows 7 recognizes the printer and it allows me to scan. &nbsp;So it is definitely a printer execute file problem. &nbsp;Lexmark software says that it is a communication problem between the computer and printer.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Palcouk,&nbsp; I used CCleaner and a third party malware program. My machine was clean for viruses.&nbsp; Ran CCleaner's registry fix.&nbsp; I tried installing and reinstalling the printer using different methods.&nbsp; Printer is compatible with Windows 7(32) but there seems
 to be a problem with the installation program.&nbsp; I spent two plus hours with a first level Microsoft technician who ran into the same problems I was running into.&nbsp;&nbsp; The printer communication shows an error.&nbsp; The Lexmark diagnosis says the problem is with the
 firewall blocking the application but the firewall (Microsoft's) has the Lexmark printer communication application as excepted from blocking.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft tech was nice and elevated me to a next level tech -- jedi in training? and will be getting a second session with Microsoft support at 6pm EST.&nbsp; I will do a follow up report.

<p>thank you for your response. </p>

<p>A very bad thing to do, and that could be responsible for your<br />
problems. Here's my standard post on registry cleaners:</p>
<p>Registry cleaning programs are <strong>all</strong> snake oil. Cleaning of the<br />
registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and<br />
don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many people think, and<br />
what vendors of registry cleaning software try to convince you of,<br />
having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you.</p>
<p>The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously<br />
removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit<br />
it may have.</p>

<p>Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the<br />
use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause<br />
problems. If they always caused problems, they would disappear from<br />
the market almost immediately. Many people have used a registry<br />
cleaner and never had a problem with it.</p>
<p>Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it<br />
the substantial <strong>risk</strong> of having a problem. And since there is no<br />
benefit to using a registry cleaner, running that risk is a very bad<br />
bargain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>REGISTRY CLEAN WAS DONE AFTER PROBLEM STARTED. SO DID NOT CAUSE PROBLEM.&nbsp; PROBLEM IDENTIFIED EACH TIME THE SAME.&nbsp; CONFIRM PROBLEM 4 TIMES.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried installing and reinstalling the printer using different methods.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What methods?</p>
<p>"ADD PRINTER" THROUGH DEVICE AND PRINTERS PROGRAM. USING THAT THAT APPLICATION LEADS YOU TO LEXMARK FOR THE DOWNLOAD.
</p>
<p>DID NOT PROPERLY INSTALL BUT WINDOWS 7 FAILED TO IDENTIFY PROBLEM; IT SHOWED DRIVERS AND SOFTWARE PROPERLY INSTALLED AND WORKING.
</p>
<p>UNINSTALLED AND DOWNLOAD DRIVER FROM LEXMARK.&nbsp; SAME RESULT. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALSO TRIED UNIVERSAL LEXMARK PRINTER DRIVER.&nbsp; DID NOT WORK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALSO TRIED MICROSOFT UPGRADE PAGE. DID NOT WORK. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you installed the correct Windows 7 driver for the printer?</p>

            <p>No one had a real solution to this problem. I decided that it had something to do with my profile. I tried to find solutions how to fix a profile but could not find any fixes. Then I decided the best is to restore the system to the factory settings which
 I did. It re-installed Windows 8.1 and then I received the Windows 10 free install.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but you can't install that Backup on another computer as it is an OEM License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will explain&nbsp;the Rules&nbsp;for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>And Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>___________________________________________________</p>

<p>My Aiptek DV4500 cannot be used in "live mode" with windows 7. I used it last night with a computer running windows xp, so it is not a fault with the camera. I can transfer files from the camera to the computer (video, pictures) but I cannot use the built
 in webcam with windows 7, It will not detect the driver. I downloaded the driver from the manufacturer's website, and also from the cd that came with the camera, and still, I cannot use it. The Windows 7 compatibility website says that the DV4500 is&nbsp;fully
 compatible with Windows 7. How can I get my webcam working?</p>

    <title>Screen Orientation Problems with Projector - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dankilts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Orientation Problems with Projector</h2>
                    Friends, When I am using my Surface Pro 3, the screen orientation&nbsp;works well whether it is landscape or portrait.&nbsp; It also worked well when I plugged in a computer projector.&nbsp; The orientation stayed in the position that I was using it.&nbsp; However, now, all
 of a sudden when I plug in the computer projector the orientation of the screen goes from landscape to portrait and all my info (pictures and/or fonts) is sideways.&nbsp; As long as the projector is plugged in it is that way.&nbsp; The moment I pull off the projector
 the screen orientation goes back to where it is supposed to be---landscape.&nbsp; What in the world happened that may have changed that?

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community </p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since when are you facing this issue? </p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you make any recent changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As in this case since the issue appears even before starting Windows, most probably this appears to be issue with graphics card driver, so may advise to update graphics card driver and check.The issue could be related to drivers and could be resolved by
 updating the same. Firstly I’d suggest you to update the graphics drivers by visiting the manufacturer’s website. Download and install the latest drivers for Windows 7 and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Refer the links below for more details on updating drivers:</div>
<div>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></div>
<div>Update drivers: recommended links</div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also try to&nbsp;check if the issue appears in safe mode as well. If problem does not appear in safe mode, try disabling graphics card driver and check restarting the computer in normal mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 1: Perform safe mode</div>
<div>Follow this below provided link to start your computer in safe mode.</div>
<div>Advanced startup options including safe mode</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 2: I would recommend you to perform clean boot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></div>
<div><br />
Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</div>
<div>Hope this help </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If problem does not appear in normal mode after disabling graphics card, update graphics card driver first.
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<p><strong>Thanks </strong></p>

<h3> jackeldridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            No password prompt on startup</h2>
                    After restarting Windows 10, there is no password prompt displayed.&nbsp; After holding the power button to restart, I can still access the BIOS setup options by pressing F10.&nbsp; I can navigate so I know the mouse and keyboard are working, and run SMART support
 (with no errors).&nbsp; However, after trying to restart, everything appears to be booting/loading as normal, but there is no password prompt displayed, and it does not appear the mouse or keyboard work either.&nbsp; The wallpaper and clock show as you would expect,
 just no password prompt to be able to move ahead further.

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, as a first troubleshooting option, please try pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL to see if something changes. As a second option, try to drag up with your mouse pointer the welcome screen (lucky way :-D).
<br />
<br />If the lucky way doesn't work, please do the below:
<br />
<br />ENTER WINRE
<br />Power on and off your computer three times. On the third time, your computer will boot into WinRE
<br />
<br />SAFE MODE
<br />Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart
<br />
<br />In safe mode, you should receive a password request. 
<br />
<br />UNCHECK SAFE BOOT
<br />Log in, THEN WIN+R &gt; MSCONFIG + ENTER &gt; BOOT (TAB) &gt;UNCHECK SAFE BOOT &gt; APPLY &gt; OK
<br />
<br />Then restart. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped somehow. 
<br />
<br />Ciao 
<br />Ugo       
        </p>

<p>The keyboard and mouse are unresponsive, so the CRL-ALT-DEL option does not work...and the 'lucky way' didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I power off/on three times, the system comes up with a screen "Choose your keyboard layout".&nbsp; Unfortunately, the keyboard and mouse still are unresponsive, so I'm stuck again.</p>

            Ok, fully got your problem now.
<br />
<br />As this can be to driver conflict after upgrading, please unplug all Windows external devices but mouse and keyboard, restart, and then try again.
<br />
<br />If the above doesn't work, please try the below:
<br />
<br />- Boot up your PC and wait until it fully loads to the windows 10 start menu.
<br />- Hold down the power button and wait until the computer fully turns off.
<br />- Quickly move to the back of the computer and unplug / replug the power cord.
<br />- Press the power button, and as quickly as you can move to hold the DELETE key.
<br />- Windows 10 will boot saying "Please wait" instead of normal booting this time.
<br />- When it boots, you will be presented with options which will take you to the ability to refresh your PC.
<br />- Refresh your PC

<p>It seems Microsoft has pushed a Windows update which apparently disables the USB ports.&nbsp; Nothing I'm doing is getting any response from the keyboard or mouse, which interface via a USB port (I don't have a separate keyboard or mouse connector).&nbsp; I took the
 machine to a PC repair place and they indicated they are seeing a number of machines with the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like I'm waiting on Microsoft to provide an update which will fix.

            Can you please try the below, before giving up (I don't like giving up :-D)?
<br />
<br />1) PERFORM A SYSTEM RESTORE OR A STARTUP REPAIR
<br />
<br />Boot to recovery media.
<br />
<br />THEN
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions below under "System Restore" or, if unable, under "Startup Repair":

<br />
<br />2) If the above doesn't work, go again in WinRE
<br />
<br />a) Click on Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced options -&gt; Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />b) At the command prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />- bootrec /FixMbr and + ENTER

<p>Currently I have Windows 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1; both are/were 64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under personalization within Windows 7 I chose Screensaver and I had folders that had pictures in em; basically I labeled the Folder Screensavers. So choosing a set of Photos to use and act as my Windows 7 Screensaver I
<em>selected a folder </em>and called it good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However randomly I've been getting a "An Error has prevented this slide show from playing" So instead of viewing my pictures during the screensaver I'm getting a black page with the words appearing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways yes I did an online search:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the so called "Microsoft Fix it" program for Photo problems</p>
<p>I have ran a command prompt for sfc/scannow it didnt find any problems</p>
<p>I have checked to make sure my Power Options was set to Balanced</p>
<p>I have also checked that I didnt want my monitor to turn off after X amount of time; I have also unchecked the option to go into sleep mode as well.</p>
<p>I have tried doing a search for some PD4? or PD5 file format; nothing on my hard drive</p>
<p>I have tried searching for that one folder? Containing Photos? Within the AppData/Microsoft/UserProfile thingy? Yeah I cant find it</p>
<p>Oh and another I have unchecked the current folder that I want to have being played and went to properties and unchecked "Read Only"</p>
<p>I have also selected a different folder thinking that maybe the earlier folder has issues. However 2 different folders of 2 I have tried has had errors; maybe another?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my problem only occurs randomly.&nbsp; I think I have my Screensaver set for maybe 3minutes but&nbsp;the error&nbsp;may only happen like once every other day or few days or whatever; perhaps I can post here when it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im writing this right now because I saw the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I dont know what else to do; any ideas? Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate the effort made towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you;</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the link for Microsoft FixIt that you tried?</li><li>What is the format of the pictures that are used in the slideshow? Are they different formats or in a single format?</li><li>What is the complete error message?</li><li>Are you using Windows Live Phone Gallery?</li></ol>
<p>As of now, I would recommend installing all the available updates through Windows updates. Also, if the formats are different then try using the same format of pictures and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to update the display/chipset drivers from the manufacturer's website and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly revert with answers to questions asked, we'll be glad to assist you further.</p>
        </p>

            <p>#1- Link that I used: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938818</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded it; ran it; I tried both methods (tell me the problems so I can fix it; AND Fix the darn problems immediately) both failed...no problems detected</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2- Format of Pictures are all JPEG</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3- Complete Error Message "An Error is preventing this Slide Show from playing" (that's all)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4- Am I using Window Live Photo Gallery???? I don't think so for one I tried searching in the Start Menu for "Photo Gallery" no application shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just using the basic Photos/Screensaver Method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7&gt;Control Panel&gt;Personalization&gt;Screensaver&gt; (none, 3dtext, blank, bubbles, msn photo show, mystify, photos, ribbons) Of that list I chose "Photos" then I chose settings to "select my folder of choice"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when screensaver activates, it randomly gives an error. I got the error just prior to me posting :) lol</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would request you to move those photos to different location (may be different partition if available) and test the issue.</p>

            <p>Okay so I have 2 Hard Drives attached; a 4tb HD and a 2.5tb HD as a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 4tb is primary; Windows, Programs, Games</p>
<p>The 2.5tb is well as I just said; a place where I've stored backups of documents, pics, etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate as I mentioned previously I had transferred/copied the Pictures folder from Windows Vista into my Windows 7 'Pictures' I went into Control Panel&gt;Personalization&gt;Screensaver&gt;Pictures and selected my folder of choice. However I have came across
 errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned...I then went back to Control Panel&gt;Personalization&gt;Screensaver and edited the location of the Pictures I chose:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup&gt;My Pictures&gt;Screensavers&gt;foldername (pretty much the exact path of my Windows 7 Hard Drive); and since they are an exact replica........well needless to say its working......for the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dont suppose you know the exact reason?&nbsp; I guess I can easily delete the folder 'Screensavers' off My Pictures via Windows 7 Hard Drive and Copy it back from 'Backup' and test that out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know</p>
