    <title>How do I show the &#34;Search Tools&#34; drop-down menu in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I show the &#34;Search Tools&#34; drop-down menu in Windows Desktop Search</h2>
                    I need to explain in documentation how to disable Windows Desktop Search for a specific program. To do that, I need to tell users to click the "Search Tools" menu and then click "Modify Index Locations". But the only way I can find to make this menu appear
 in WDS is to type a character into the Search text box. As soon as I type a character, the menu appears in WDS that includes "Organize", Views", "Save Search", and "Search Tools".
<br />
<br />
I'm basically trying to find a simple way to display the Indexing Options dialog box, and want to avoid telling the user to type some random character in the Search text box, because that's just plain idiotic. There must be some way of getting to this dialog
 box from Control Panel, but I sure can't find it.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

    <title>Terrible Technical Support By Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Terrible Technical Support By Microsoft</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I wanted to share my recent
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">TERRIBLE</span></span><span> experience with a Microsoft Windows 10 update and my subsequent interaction with Microsoft technical support.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
On Friday, May 11<sup>th</sup>, I was notified that I needed to do an update to Windows 10 (update Version 1803).&nbsp; I installed the update and immediately started having problems with my internet connection.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Monday, May 14<sup>th</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I called Microsoft technical support (<span>800-642-7676</span>).&nbsp;
 After going through the phone tree and sitting on hold I was finally connected to an agent.&nbsp; He took down my e-mail address and phone number.&nbsp; We were just starting to discuss the problem when we got disconnected.&nbsp; Even though he had my phone number he did
 not call back and I was forced to start over.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I called back and spoke to someone named Dhiraj.&nbsp; He was not interested in my suggestion that we try uninstalling the update.&nbsp; He had me perform a “network restore”.&nbsp; As a result my internet connection went from problematic to nonexistent.&nbsp; He informed me that
 this issue needed to be raised to a “level 2”.&nbsp; A case number was assigned and he scheduled a call back for the following day between 9 and 11 AM U.S. central time.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
So, at this point Windows Technical Support had made my problem worse and indicated that I had to wait another day for resolution.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Tuesday, May 15<sup>th</sup>, I got a call back at approx. 10:45 AM from Aman.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
After reviewing several things he indicates that we needed to do a system restore but that I needed to run a full back-up first as the system restore might cause me to lose data / programs.&nbsp;
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I asked him how to do a back-up and he said that he could not tell me.&nbsp; He encouraged me to watch tutorial videos on the internet (which I don’t have access to on this computer).&nbsp; I was very frustrated but he said this was the only option.&nbsp; I do have another
 computer so I went through an online tutorial and performed the back-up.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Aman indicated that the back up would take time and that we would need to schedule a follow-up call for the following day.&nbsp; We scheduled the follow-up call for between 9 and 11 AM the following day.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Wednesday, May 16<sup>th</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I waited for the call from Aman that was supposed to occur between 9 and 11 AM.&nbsp; I never got the call.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
While waiting I started thinking that I couldn’t imagine uninstalling the update would cause any harm since I had a back-up and Microsoft was planning to perform a system restore anyway.&nbsp; So, I uninstalled the 1803 update and the problem with my internet connection
 vanished!&nbsp; I fixed the problem myself but I was now concerned about whether I could accept any future updates and how I could avoid having this problem in the future.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
At 3:30 PM (almost 5 hours late) Aman called back.&nbsp; I explained what I had done and that it appeared to address the immediate problem.&nbsp; However, I did have additional concerns to go through but was not available to review them at the time he had finally called
 back.&nbsp; Aman apologized for the delayed call back and we rescheduled a call for 8:30 AM the following morning.&nbsp; I specifically asked him to commit to a time rather than a 2 hour window.&nbsp; Aman promised that he would call me at 8:30 AM sharp.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Thursday, May 17<sup>th</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I doubt you will be surprised to find out that Aman did not call me at 8:30.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
At 11:15 AM I decided that I was going to call Microsoft technical support back and file a complaint with a supervisor.&nbsp; After sitting on hold I finally got connected to an individual named Sumeet.&nbsp; I told him that I had a complaint and wanted to speak with
 a supervisor.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
At 11:30 AM I was connected to a supervisor named Mohammed.&nbsp; I shared my whole saga.&nbsp; He said that he wanted to have a level 2 support person call me back to review my case and that this call would be within 30 minutes.&nbsp; I have no idea why a supervisor wasn’t
 skilled enough to address my needs but I agreed to the call back.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
It is now 1:30 PM and, big surprise, no call back.</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I can't even find a e-mail address where I can lodge a complaint.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

 Confirm you have access to this file'. or words to that effect with trying to install different programmes.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>I've checked the windows file structure and this folder does not exists and Vista won't let me add it.</span></strong><br />
<br />
I've been advised to check if they are compatible (they are) and to changed permissions so I have full control, which I have but still no good.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Any ideas?</span></span></span></p>

<div>Hi Mal619,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for the update. Try the following steps and check the result.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>Try installing the programs in a different folder and check the result.<br />
a. Right click on the program's setup file and click "Run as administrator"<br />
b. Follow the setup menus until you see the Change button.<br />
c. Click Change.<br />
d. In the Path box, delete the existing path, and then type the following text: <br />
&lt;drive&gt;:\Program Name<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> In this example, &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk where you want to install the program.<br />
e. Click OK when you are finished.<br />
f. Follow the directions that appear on the screen to install the program.<br />
g. Once the program is installed successfully, restart the computer for the changes to take effect.<br />
h. Check if this makes any difference.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> If the issue persists, perform in-place upgrade i.e. repair install of Windows and check the result</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important:</strong> Performing in-place upgrade will restore the computer to a state when you installed Windows the first time. The installed programs on the computer will not be affected. You'll be prompted again to install all the updates you
 installed earlier. We strongly recommend you to backup all the data before you proceed with the steps, as executing the steps incorrectly will remove data from the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Close all the applications, insert the Windows 7 DVD in the computer's DVD drive.<br />
b. On the Setup window, click Install Now.<br />
c. Click Go online to obtain the latest updates for installation (recommended). <br />
d. Type the CD key if you are prompted to do this. <br />
e. Click Yes to accept the Microsoft Software License Terms. <br />
f. On the Which kind of installation do you want? screen, click Upgrade. <br />

<p>Dear Syed</p>
<p>Tried both methods but no luck.&nbsp; Method 1 has the same responce as normal.&nbsp; When trying method 2 I get to the 'Which type of installation' prompt but then another message saying that I can only do the Custom installation as the&nbsp;Upgrade is disabled.&nbsp; I have
 ran the System Update Readiness Tool but I still cannot upgrade the system.&nbsp; BTW I am running Vista, not Windows 7.</p>

            Hi  bsigal5127, this is a very common error when running a major update on Windows 10
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Epxlorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to :
<br />
<br />c:\windows\system32\drivers
<br />
<br />Check for this file in that folder - avipbb.sys
<br />
<br />If you find it, delete it
<br />
<br />Try the update again

 can change volume with F6, F7 &amp; F8 and turn off/on touch-pad with F5 as previously. fn lock key also works perfectly. I can change brightness, switch projectors manually from action center.

            Yes, but in both cases when brightness is 0%, it almost turns off my display, can't see anything. Previously i could do that with keyboard F2 and F3 keys and it didn't (almost) turns off my display.

            <p>Most of the secondary functions of the F keys are non standard because the Fn key itself is not a standardly mapped key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With some systems the function is controlled by the motherboard and will still work even if using an unsupported (non Windows) operating system. It can be a setting within the BIOS as to the Fn key being needed for those secondary roles or the Fn enables
 the standard F key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With other systems a dedicated application from the system manufacturer is needed in order for the special role to work. One obvious clue is does the volume keys track the Windows Volume bar or does a separate BIOS generated slider appear. Whereas Volume
 has a matching Windows function to hook into contrast and brightness do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the Samsung Website for applications to add functions to the O/S. The two problems are do they work in Windows 10 because manufacturers are limiting which systems they support and it may be part of a larger Windows integration package so may not be
 obvious.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on your machine? Include all you ever
<br />
had including those you uninstalled. (These can leave remnants which can cause strange issues.)<br />
<br />
Do a search for all .cpl files most will be in "C:\Windows\System32" however you can have others.
<br />
Click on each one at a time and see if one does not start - if so Right Click on it and rename it using
<br />
cpZ as the extension so it is east to find. Retry Control Panel - if no joy keep trying all your .cpl files.
<br />
(Note the others found under other Folders under C:\Windows should not be tried as they are not
<br />
active.)<br />
<br />
<br />
A few of these are appwiz.cpl, firewall.cpl, desk.cpl, powercfg.cpl, inetcpl.cpl, timedate.cpl and
<br />
others.<br />
<br />
Try these in case general corruption has a role :<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

<h2>            XBOX One external usb 3 hard drive not powering up after Oct 2018 update</h2>
                    <p>After the October 2018 update to my XBOX One Console, my external usb 3 hard disk(where I have lots of games installed to) is not powering up from a soft power-on with the controller.&nbsp; I have to then power the console right off and back on again, to get
 the hard disk to work again.&nbsp; This happens every time I power off the console with the controller.</p>

            Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power
 cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

<h2>            Turn off MAC address filtering</h2>
                    Hi, I recently got WIFI for my home. I want to use wifi on my ipod touch but even when I add and connect to my network with the correct password. I cannot use the wifi and applications that require a connection. Most people say that I should turn off my
 MAC address filter so that my ipod touch can access the internet. Thank you.

            MAC address filtering is enabled or disabled in your wireless router.&nbsp; It's disabled by default, and would only be enabled if you've explicitly configured the router that way.&nbsp; See your router's User Manual for more information, or tell us the router's
 make and model number.

            I'm assuming&nbsp;jinyuzhang isnt going to reply to this thread but i am having the same issue and so answering your previous questions:<br />
<br />
I blue screened the other day and upon rebooting, my pc attempted repairs but was stuck on this screen for hours and nothing happened.<br />
i created a USB recovery drive to access trouble shooting (was originally planning on restoring to a previous point but i have non of these saved annoyingly) and so selected recover from a drive, and then i get the error message "unable to recover your PC.
 The system drive is too small."

    <title>Windows 10 Activation - Re-Image After Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dj_361  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation - Re-Image After Upgrade</h2>
                    <p><span>I just had an extremely frustrating series of chats and a call with the off-shore Microsoft support center.</span></p>
<p><span>Background:</span></p>
<p><span>I purchased a Windows 8.1 Pro license directly from Microsoft. I recently did the upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;That worked fine and I had a valid license for Windows
 10. &nbsp;Shortly after I had to replace the hard drive with the OS so I did a clean Windows 10 install. &nbsp;I used the Windows 8.1 license - which was purchased directly from Microsoft. &nbsp;At that point I noticed that Windows 10 was not activated. &nbsp;I tried several
 times to input the valid Windows 8.1 key (remember that it was purchased directly from Microsoft). &nbsp;There was an error message that this key could not be used. &nbsp;I used the chat the support line - I actually used the chat twice and called their support once
 that day. &nbsp;The first support person looked in their system and informed me that is was a "pirate" key because it had been used more than once. &nbsp;I did tell him I had installed Windows 8.1 twice because I had upgraded the motherboard and installed a new OS HDD,
 then upgraded to Windows 10, then had to do a clean install due to a HDD crash. &nbsp;He said I would have to purchase a new license. &nbsp;I asked why I would have to pay twice for the same license (assuming the Windows 10 upgrade was no charge). &nbsp;He could not answer
 and said that was all he could do and disconnected the chat. &nbsp;I connected again to chat. &nbsp;I referenced the ticket number - the second support person could find the incident so I went through the whole explanation again. &nbsp;Same result was that this license was
 not valid because of being used "too often". &nbsp;I asked what is "too often". &nbsp;The answer this gentleman gave was a license can only be used one time - no more. &nbsp;If your hard drive fails you have to purchase another license. &nbsp;He then said that I was a pirate
 because this happened frequently. &nbsp;I made a comment that if I was a pirate I would not be contacting&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;support. &nbsp;I asked to&nbsp;speak to a supervisor and then he disconnected the chat. &nbsp;So I called the support number. &nbsp;Again they could not find the ticket
 number so I went through the same explanation again. &nbsp;This support person said that the license had been used "too many times". Again I got the answer that a license can only be used once no matter the circumstances. &nbsp;Again I was told that I was a pirate.
 &nbsp;This lady went further to say that Microsoft does not want business from people like me and that I should go use Linux. &nbsp;I asked to speak to a supervisor. Her answer was that her supervisor was in a meeting and could not be bothered by a customer issue. &nbsp;I
 asked if there was anyone else - her answer was no. &nbsp;At this point I was a bit frustrated and asked if there was only supervisor in the entire Microsoft corporation? &nbsp;Her answer was yes -there is only one supervisor in the entire corporation that could handle
 this type of escalation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So - my question to the community is: &nbsp;what are my options? &nbsp;I am going to take several different paths to escalate this. &nbsp;I am part owner of a small company
 and I know if my customer support folks treated customers like this they would be replaced on the spot. &nbsp;Apparently Microsoft is too big to care about individuals or small companies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Perhaps you are needlessly using the Windows 8.1 Pro Product Key for Windows 10, when your device already has Digital Entitlement to run Windows 10 Pro without entering any Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a reasonably quick way to test this:</p>
<p>Use Disk Management to shrink your C: drive by 64GB or so, if you have the space. &nbsp;Create a Windows 10 install on a bootable USB and boot with that. &nbsp;Step through the screens and choose to install Windows 10 to the unused 64GB space you have created. &nbsp;A
 clean install like this does not take nearly as long as an upgrade. &nbsp;When it asks for Product Key, choose that you do not have a Product Key. &nbsp;If it later asks for one again, choose to skip this too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will end up with a dual-boot scenario, but the default will be the new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows is installed to this small partition, it should just auto-activate because your device has digital entitlement to run Windows 10, due to having been at one time upgraded from an activated Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion Don - that worked. &nbsp; &nbsp;It would have been nice if the Microsoft support folks could have answered this question - but I set my expectations way too high. &nbsp;May I suggest Sir that you could replace the entire Microsoft offshore support
 team by yourself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still intend to escalate this in some fashion. &nbsp;My company is going toward implementing cloud services as part of our service business. Since the Microsoft offshore support technician told me that they do not want my business I intend on having my engineering
 team pull out of Azure and go with AWS - we are not too far along and can switch fairly easily. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They just lost some cloud business and I hope this message can get to some execs at Microsoft but they probably could not care anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the help.</p>

    <title>Infineon TPM Professional Package - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerseybill_111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Infineon TPM Professional Package</h2>
                    Whenever I attempt to a Windows 10 upgrade, it fails and I am instructed to remove the "Infineon TPM Professional Package" app (this is always listed twice in the dialog box).&nbsp; I cannot locate any Infineon app (have searched "Infineon" and "Infineon TPM").&nbsp;
 How can I resolve this?

            Hi JerseyBill_111,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor and will assist you.
<br />
<br />Look for Infineon folder here C:\SWSETUP\App\Security.
<br />You can move it to a different location, rename it .old or delete it.
<br />
<br />On various devices you may find it elsewhere. 
<br />Asus - C:\eSupport
<br />HP -  C:\SWsetup (Protect Tools)
<br />C:\SWSETUP\App\Security.

<p>Since I have an HP, I went to C:\SWsetup and after drilling down through several folders and files I found and deleted files marked 'Infineon' and 'TPM'.&nbsp; I then attempted to download the Windows 10 update but received the same error message.&nbsp; I did search
 "C:\SWSETUP\App\Security" but did not find any Infineon/TPM files.</p>

            <p>That error is telling you that some program/application on your system is trying to find the function BN_bin2bin in the dynamic link library file called avgntopensslx.dll and can't find it.&nbsp; It could be that the DLL file is somehow mismatched, missing or
 corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the file name starts with avg it looks like an AVG file, so you don't have an XP problem...&nbsp; you have an AVG problem.&nbsp; There is no DLL (Dynamic Link Library) in XP called
<em>avgntopensslx.dll</em> but there is such a thing in the AVG software that it sounds like you may have installed on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you updated, installed, reinstalled, uninstalled anything to do with AVG lately?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you boot into Safe Mode, XP only loads a subset of the things that it would load when you boot normally, and AVG doesn't load in Safe Mode so that is why your system will boot in Safe Mode and not normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore will not help you since SR doesn't know or care about any AVG files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this problem has nothing to do with Windows XP, you would probably find the best advice in the AVG forums that are here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://community.avg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.avg.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You should tell them your system make and model, your XP version and Service Pack, what version of AVG you are running and if the system used to work properly what you think happened since the last time it did work properly (maybe an update, reinstall/uninstall
 of AVG, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you should <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span></em> do is pay any attention to any of the other advice you might find in Internet searches about quick or instant fixes, free downloads, etc. from untrusted sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stick with the AVG community and the ideas you get from there.</p>

            <p>Hi Rakesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur because of power management improvements that are introduced in Windows 8.1. These improvements help reduce power consumption and extend the battery life of mobile computers. If the USB device presents itself as a Human Interface Device
 (HID)&nbsp;and there is no app accessing the device, Windows suspends the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps Mentioned in the Microsoft help article to resolve the issue:</p>

<h2>            problem connecting Bose qc 35 ii headphones to Dell XPS 13, win 8.1 64 bit</h2>
                    Lots of people seem to be having trouble connecting bluetooth headphones to laptops.&nbsp; I have read and completed the troubleshooting steps both with my headphones (which connect easily to my phone) and with the drivers in Win 8.1 64-bit on my Dell XPS 13.&nbsp;
 The last step: the windows pgm compatibility troubleshooter.&nbsp; After accepting Win 8 settings as suggested in the troubleshooter, I observed that the Bose headphones could be paired *and* connected.&nbsp; However, the sound still issued through the laptop's speakers.&nbsp;
 What now?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I suppose, there is no universal answer for your question since the performance of your PC depends on many factors (not only on hard disks). In general, if your drive is new and up-to-date, you should
<strong>not</strong> face the decreased processing speed. So, I would recommend you to have one or more partitions to protect your data better. By the way, if you finally decide to increase their number, make sure you know how to

            <p>Reducing the size of the windows partition will often save time when doing various manual scans and indexing&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;automatic maintenance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than&nbsp;mostly reducing scan times per partition, I cant imagine any performance benefits&nbsp;of more, or less partitions.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;You can have as many partitions as you want excpt when you have an older computer with MBR type bios which has a limit of 4 basic partitions.</p>

</p><p>If you're planning on having more than 4 partitions, you should be using a GPT partitioning system. A MBR partitioning system uses a 'trick' to create more then 4 partitions, which is not as stable as a GPT partitioning system, although in practice problems

            <p>It does not affect performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why do you want to do this? For most people it's a mistake. Here's my standard post on this subject:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div><span>There is a wide variety of different ways people set up multiple partitions these days. Some of these uses are reasonable, some are questionable, some are outright bad. I’ll discuss a number of common partition types in what follows:<br />
<br />
1. A partition for just Windows<br />
<br />
Most people who create such a partition do so because they believe that if they ever have to reinstall Windows cleanly, at least they won’t lose their data and won’t have to reinstall their applications, because both are safe on other partitions.<br />
<br />
In fact the first of those thoughts is a false comfort, and the second is downright wrong. See the discussion of&nbsp; partition types 2 and 4 below to find out why.<br />
<br />
Also note that as time passes, many people find that their Windows partition that started out to be the right size turns out to be too small. For example, if you have such a Windows partition, and later upgrade to a newer version of Windows, you may find that
 your Windows partition is too small.<br />
<br />
2. A partition for installed programs<br />
<br />
This normally goes hand-in-hand with partition type 1, a partition for just Windows. The thought that if you reinstall Windows, your installed application programs are safe if they are in a separate partitions is simply wrong. That’s because all installed programs
 (except for an occasional trivial one) have pointers to them within Windows, in the registry and elsewhere, as well as associated files buried within the Windows folder. So if Windows goes, the pointers and files go with it. Since programs have to be reinstalled
 if Windows does, this rationale for a separate partition for programs doesn't work. In fact, there is hardly ever a good reason for separating Windows from application software in separate partitions.<br />
<br />
3. A partition for the swap file.<br />
<br />
Some people erroneously think that having the page file on a separate partition will improve performance. That is also false; it doesn’t help, and often hurts, performance, because it increases head movement to get back and forth from the page file to the other
 frequently-used data on the<br />
drive. For best performance, the page file should normally be on the most-used partition of the least-used physical drive. For almost everyone with a single physical drive, that’s the same drive Windows is on, C:.<br />
<br />
4. A partition for backup of other partitions.<br />
<br />
Some people make a separate partition to store backups of their other partition(s). People who rely on such a "backup" are just kidding themselves. It's only very slightly better than no backup at all, because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss
 of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: head crashes and other kinds of drive failure, severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, even theft of the computer.&nbsp; In my view, secure backup needs to be on removable media,
 and not kept in the computer.<br />
<br />
5. A partition for data files<br />
<br />
Above, when I discussed separating Windows on a partition of its own, I pointed out that separating data from Windows is a false comfort if it’s done with the thought that the data will be safe if Windows ever has to be reinstalled. The reason I call it a false
 comfort is because I fear that many people will rely on that separation, think that their data is safe there, and therefore do not take appropriate steps to back it up. In truth the data is not safe there. Having to reinstall Windows is only one of the dangers
 to someone’s hard drive, and not even the most likely one. This kind of “safeguard” falls into the same category as a partition for backup of other partitions; it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common
 dangers that affect the entire physical drive, not just the particular partition. Safety comes from a strong backup regimen, not from how you partition.<br />
<br />
However for some people it can be a good idea to separate Windows and programs on the one hand from data on the other, putting each of the two types into separate partitions. I think that most people’s partitioning scheme should be based on their backup scheme,
 and backup schemes generally fall into two types: imaging the entire hard drive or backup of data only. If you backup data only, that backup is usually facilitated by having a separate partition with data only; that permits backing up just that partition easily,
 without having to collect bits and pieces from here and there. On the other hand, for those who backup by creating an image of the entire drive, there is usually little, if any, benefit to separating data in a partition of its own.<br />
<br />
By the way, in all fairness, I should point out that there are many well-respected people who recommend a separate partition for Windows, regardless of your backup scheme.&nbsp; Their arguments haven’t convinced me, but there are clearly two different views here.<br />
<br />
6. A partition for picture files<br />
<br />
Some people like to treat pictures and videos as something separate from other data files, and create a separate partition for them. To my mind, a picture is simply another kind of data, and there is no advantage in doing this.<br />
<br />
7. A partition for music files.<br />
<br />
The comments above pertaining to picture files apply equally to music files. They are just another kind of data and should be treated the same way as other data.<br />
<br />
8. A partition for a second operating system to dual-boot to.<br />
<br />
For those who run multiple operating systems (Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 98,&nbsp; Linux, etc.), a separate partition for each operating system is essential. The issues here are beyond the scope of this article,&nbsp; but it’s sufficient to note that I have no
 objection at all to such partitions<br />
<br />
*Performance*<br />
<br />
Some people have multiple partitions because they believe that it somehow improves performance. That’s not correct. The effect is probably small on modern computers with modern hard drives, but if anything, the opposite is true: more partitions mean poorer
 performance. That’s because normally no partition is full and there are therefore gaps between them. It takes time for the drive’s read/write heads to traverse those gaps. The closer together files are, the faster access to them will be.<br />
<br />
*Organization*<br />
<br />
I think many people overpartition because they use partitions as an organizational structure. They have a strong sense of order and want to separate apples from oranges on their drives.<br />
<br />
Yes, separating different kinds of files on partitions is an organizational technique, but so is separating different kinds of files in folders. The difference is that partitions are static and fixed in size, while folders are dynamic, changing size automatically
 as necessary to meet your changing needs. That generally makes folders a much better way to organize, in my view.<br />
<br />
True, partitions can be resized when necessary, but except with recent versions of Windows, doing so requires third-party software (and the ability to do it in Windows &nbsp;is primitive, compared to the third-party solutions). Such third-party software normally
 costs money, and, no matter how good and how stable it is, affects the entire drive, entailing a risk of losing everything. Plan your partitions well in the first place, and no repartitioning should be necessary.&nbsp; The need to repartition usually comes about
 as a result of overpartitioning in the first place.<br />
<br />
What frequently happens when people organize with partitions instead of folders is that they miscalculate how much room they need on each such partition, and then when they run out of room on the partition where a file logically belongs, while still having
 lots of space left<br />
on the other, they simply store the file in the "wrong" partition. Paradoxically, therefore, that kind of partition structure results in less organization rather than more.<br />
<br />
*So How Should I Partition My Drive*<br />
<br />
If you've read what came before, my conclusions won't come as a surprise:<br />
<br />
1. if your backup scheme is to image the entire drive, have just a single partition (usually C:);<br />
<br />
2. if you just backup data, have two partitions–one for Windows and installed application programs (usually C:), the other for data (usually D:).<br />
<br />
Except for those running multiple operating systems, there is seldom&nbsp; any benefit to having more than two partitions.</span></div>

<h2>            Update error -  0x80070643 Windows Defender</h2>
                    <p>Checked update on my Surface Pro 3. Update reports that its having problems installing the latest definition updates with the above error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I'm not using Defender, supposedly its disabled? So why am I getting updates for a program that's not my default AV - I've seen a few solutions relating to other programs with this error code but not where its defender and not where Defender is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest please how I tell my machine not to download updates for Defender and overcome this error message?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would like to inform you that this error occurs when Windows Update file under goes corruption. To rectify the issue I</span></span><span> recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will
 fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press <strong><span>Windows Key + X</span></strong> on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Stop the <strong><span>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer </span>
</strong>and the <strong><span>Windows Update Services</span></strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>3. Now rename the <strong><span>SoftwareDistribution</span></strong> and
<strong><span>Catroot2</span></strong> folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong><span>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</span></strong> and the
<strong><span>Windows Update Services</span></strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong><span>ENTER</span></strong> key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
