<h2>            Pages being interrupted while I type</h2>
                    <p>For the past week or so, my computer at work has been having this irritating issue: While I'm typing - no matter what program; Chrome, Word, Outlook, ect. - the windows are being interrupted while I type, and I have to click my cursor to begin again. This
 leads me to believe that this is not a connectivity issue. Sometimes it only happens a few times per minute, and sometimes (like right now) I cannot get more than a few keystrokes in before having to click back to my work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated my mouse and keyboard drivers, as suggested in other forums, and also booted in safemode before. It clears up for a few hours, and then begins again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do occasionally get messages regarding scripts running too long while I have a webpage open, but I stop them, and even restart the machine, and still return to this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can try? It has taken me much longer to write this post than it should, and my work involves a lot of typing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Mail</h2>
                    <p>Recently updated from Win7 to 10 and found a few disappointing things:</p>
<p>MAIL - contacts did not make the journey.&nbsp; I hate the thought of manually </p>
<p>adding all those addresses (and to what program?)&nbsp; My other mail accounts have</p>
<p>relatively few contacts listed, so synching isn't much good to resolve this.&nbsp; I'll</p>
<p>leave it at this one for now and pick them off one at a time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I really liked WIN7 a lot - it was the most stable Win platform I have ever used and
</p>
<p>would like to get past the regret I am now feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; "sigh"</p>

    <title>Computer crashes when switching to full screen during a streaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h0vval2d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer crashes when switching to full screen during a streaming video.</h2>
                    
<p>Recently bought a new computer running windows 7 and its wonderful except for an annoying little problem of crashing occasionally whenever I&nbsp;switch a&nbsp;streaming video online to full screen.&nbsp; What would happen is the video would start streaming and I would
 full screen it and the screen would go black and the audio would stop playing and just hum.&nbsp; The computer is then unresponsive and the only way to fix it is to restart the computer.&nbsp; This doesn't happen every time I try to full screen a video just sometimes.&nbsp;
 My computer is completely updated and all the drivers are updated.&nbsp; I also rolled back the driver to one previously installed and I am still experiencing the same problem.&nbsp; Any idea what's wrong?</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi H0vval2d,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the problem affects all or most of the video files you play (as opposed to just a few
 specific files), the driver software for your video card (also known as a display adapter, video adapter, graphics adapter, or graphics board) might be out-of-date. Check for updates for the driver software for your video card and for updates to Microsoft
 DirectX by doing the following.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Windows Update by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button. In the search box, type <strong>Update</strong>, and then, in the list of results, click
<strong>Windows Update</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the left pane, click
<strong>Check for updates</strong>, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If any updates are found, click
<strong>Install updates</strong>.&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In some cases, you might need to download the driver software directly from the website of your computer manufacturer or video card manufacturer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If updating your driver software doesn't solve the problem, try reducing (or turning off) video hardware acceleration by doing the following.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Screen Resolution by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then, under
<strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong>, clicking <strong>Adjust screen resolution</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, click the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> tab, and then click
<strong>Change settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Note that some video card drivers do not permit you to change settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Move the
<strong>Hardware acceleration</strong> slider toward <strong>None</strong> to reduce or turn off video hardware acceleration.</span></p>

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>Did you make any recent hardware or software changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Let's try the following steps and check.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Step 1: </span></b><span>You may also temporarily disable security software's and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable those security software's on the computer after checking.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />

<p>
<span>If disabling the security software resolves the issue then, please contact the specific security software manufacturer to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<b><i><span>Important</span></i></b><i><span>: These steps may increase your security risk. These steps may also make the computer or the network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such
 as viruses. We recommend the process that this article describes to enable programs to operate as they are designed to or to implement specific program capabilities. Before you make these changes, we recommend that you evaluate the risks that are associated
 with implementing this process in your particular environment. If you decide to implement this process, take any appropriate additional steps to help protect the system. We recommend that you use this process only if you really require this process.</span></i></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span>Step 2: </span></b><span>Perform clean boot on the computer.<br />
Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."</span></p>

<span>5. If the Shell hardware detection service is already in start mode, please right click on that service and select “stop” and again start the service.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6. Now <b>restart</b> your computer. </span></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span><strong>Xbox One Chat Headset</strong></span></p>
<p>You don't need the adapter in order to use the wired Xbox One Chat Headset. This headset comes included with the Xbox One console. All you have to do is plug it straight into the bottom of the controller, and play! The headset's connector includes volume
 controls and a mute button. There are a few things you can do if you run into issues with this headset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your Kinect Chat settings. Press the Menu button and select Settings. Navigate to Kinect, and uncheck the box that enables Chat through Kinect.
</li><li>From the Home screen, Navigate to the sign-in screen (top left corner next to notifications) and select your profile, even if you're already signed in. This will re-assign your profile to your controller.
</li><li>Disconnect the headset by pulling firmly on the body of the connector (never pull on the cable!), and then reconnect it firmly.
</li><li>Make sure the headset is not muted. The mute button should not be lit up. </li><li>Try using a different headset or controller - this isn't a permanent solution, it's just to check for hardware issues!
</li><li>If these don't solve the issue, then&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">please try the solutions listed here</a>, including how to test the headset for party chat.

    <title>Windows 10 metered network setting not stopping windows updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sian.01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 metered network setting not stopping windows updates</h2>
                    I set my wifi as metered connection over a year ago, as we have very slow broadband speed where we live and the windows update running in the background uses it all. Yesterday i connected to a new ethernet connection in the home office, without realising
 that windows does not enable ethernet connections to be set as metered. Eventually found this out and went back to the wifi connection in the house, but have had ongoing problems since then. Outlook wouldn't sync the inbox, but have hopefully resolved that
 by trial and error. But this evening windows doesn't seem to recognise the wifi as being a metered connection, even though it is set to that. The moment i connect to the wifi service host :local system (18, or 20...) starts running and consumes our entire
 bandwidth. Ive uninstalled the ethernet settings and drivers in case that was the cause, but to no avail. As far as i can see all the settings are as they were pre-ethernet episode. Any help much appreciated.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Sian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help you resolve your concern, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the <strong>Network troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Network troubleshooter</strong>, and then select
<strong>Identify and repair network problems</strong> from the list of results.</li><li>Follow the steps in the troubleshooter and see if that fixes the problem.</li></ol>
<p>Method 2: <strong>Update the network adapter driver</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and then select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the list of results.</li><li>In Device Manager, select <strong>Network adapters</strong> &gt; the network adapter name.</li><li>Press and hold (or right-click)&nbsp;the network adapter, and then select <strong>
Update Driver Software</strong> &gt;<strong> Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>. Follow the steps, then select
<strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>After installing the updated driver, select the <strong>Start</strong> button &gt;
<strong>Power</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart</strong> if you're asked to restart, and see if that fixes the connection issue.</li></ol>
<p>If Windows can’t find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer’s website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your PC can't connect to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver on a different PC and save
 it to a USB flash drive, so you can manually install the driver on your PC. You’ll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Update the <strong>Wi-Fi drivers and settings</strong>. Follow the steps on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000460/windows-10-check-wifi-drivers-settings-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing these 3 steps, set your Wi-Fi connection to Metered connection again.

<p>Since you have a Case Number you must have talked to someone in Customer Support.</p>
<p>I would suggest to try again at some later stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for XP.</p>
<p>Are you trying to install XP so to run some older software and or games as there is no longer any support for it ?</p>
<p>If you have a legitimate Disk it should have the Activation Product Key sticker with it.</p>
<p>These XP disks came in a plastic wrapped booklet with the disk or in a boxed package which included a Activation Product Key Sticker that one would generally stick on the computer case or on the bottom of the laptop.</p>
<p>The Product Key Sticker consists of 25 mixed numbers and letters.</p>
<p>This is asked for within the installation process.</p>
<p>This is what you put into the field when asked for to activate.</p>

<p>We don't work for Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disregard that reply that you can't activate XP.</p>
<p>Vista is no longer supported.</p>
<p>Windows 8 is no longer supported, not just XP.</p>
<p>You can still activate any of those&nbsp;non-supported Windows operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I believe&nbsp;is their Tech Support staff know very little, if anything, about XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a Case Number; get in touch with them again:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft ended support for XP, they were quick to&nbsp; say we will continue to re-activate XP if you have to reinstall, etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>But over the last few years they seem to&nbsp;have dodged the issue and deleted the links about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact them by one of these methods if you have no luck with the method you used&nbsp;and keep&nbsp;contacting them until they&nbsp;do sort it out for you.</p>

</strong>I suggest you to run<strong> System File Checker</strong>, which will check your system for missing, corrupt or damaged files and attempt to fix them.<br />
<strong>a.</strong> Press<strong> “Windows Key + Q” </strong>to open Charms Bar. </p>
<div><strong>b.</strong> Type <strong>“cmd”</strong> without quotes in the search box.</div>
<div><strong>c. </strong>On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select<strong> “Run as Administrator”.</strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Type <strong>‘sfc /scannow’ </strong>without quotes and hit enter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer the article on<strong> “How to run System File Checker”</strong> and check if that helps.</p>

<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
I would also suggest you to Run <strong>DISM or System Update Readiness tool<br />
</strong>&nbsp;the System update readiness command. It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available. Follow the steps.<br />
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong><br />
<strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Click <strong>command prompt (Run as administrator).</strong><br />
<strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press Enter key after each command:<br />
<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong><br />
<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong><br />
To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.</div>

    <title>Windows 7 taskbar pinned items disappear after every - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaysonxild  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 taskbar pinned items disappear after every restart&#47;shutdown.. Also my desktop files and folders aren&#39;t where i left them..</h2>
                    <p>Out of the blue this happened to me... After a restart/shutdown All my taskbar pins disappeared and my desktop files, folders, and widgets reset to their default position ie.. sorted by top left and not where I keep them...
</p>
<br />
<p>The pins will come right back if I just add one new pin to the taskbar but it's a Very annoying thing to deal with...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way the desktop icons keep resetting is almost like what happens when the screen resolution changes such as adding a monitor or installing chipset and other updates... ( IDK if it's an explorer.exe issue but when I reset it there is no change and the
 problem keeps coming back...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All updates were installed and updated for a while before this issue happened...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find any info on how to fix this so I ended up going through the lengthy process of reinstalling the os (win 7 ult)...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reinstall, updates, and setting things back up the way I want them, Everything was working perfectly for about two weeks then out of the blue that issue comes right back...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible cause I kinda think is causing the issue is the battery, as it's pretty much dead and I have to stay connected to the power cable as it will only last a few minutes on battery alone... My pc has the option of swithching graphic card to a lesser
 one to save battery when low but I don't use that cause I can just go grab the pwr cable... So my thinking is that the battery is so low that even when plugged in it causes bugs and issues... I ordered a new battery but thought I would post this in case the
 problem persist after I get it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Help is appreciated but remember that I do not have win 8 or 10 as I can't stand them and they are less customizable...

            <p>Hi Jayson, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To further isolate this concern, we'd like to know if you have made any changes to your computer prior to this issue. One possible cause of this issue is a corrupted components to your computer. To sort it, we recommend running a
<strong>System File Checker scan</strong> to your computer. For instructions, follow the instructions in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response. </p>

            <p>After your reinstall and things worked for about 2 weeks - what video drivers did you use and did you get them from AMD, a driver CD you had already ,etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when things became afflicted could it be that you accepted a video driver update offered from Windows Update (never a good idea) and now you don't have the driver you did weeks ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check Device Manager and see what you have now (write it down) and if you can Roll Back to the previous version and then see if things work - something like this example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Device Manager from the Start button:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8372a0f5-4e49-4d37-a29a-51b12b203c3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8372a0f5-4e49-4d37-a29a-51b12b203c3a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then expand the Display Adapter section, right click your display adapter and make a note of the currently installed version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also heck your Windows Update history to see if a video driver update was applied and on what date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there has been a driver update you can Roll Back the video driver to the previous version.&nbsp; If there is no previous version that button will not be clickable:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa00b6c7-dbbb-463b-85be-d70c5366f1bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa00b6c7-dbbb-463b-85be-d70c5366f1bf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you rolled back the driver restart your system and check the video driver version again to see what version it is now and make a note of that and see how things look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If things are worse or no change I would visit the AMD site and get their latest driver for your Radeon R9.</p>

            <p>After install I used the Alienware resource install disk with a list of drivers.... I installed all that applied... Vid drivers are AMD Radion R9&nbsp; X290X....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing drivers from disk I used win update manager to update any and all things listed till it notified me that all is to date... After completing win update I used 'driver booster 4 free' to further apply any updates... I didn't go to amd and
 DL their updated driver as I wasn't sure if that update caused the problem in the first place...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I clean installed I went through this same process but after all that I went to their site to apply any updates...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My win updater is set to auto and sometimes I don't catch what it's installing or am paying attention when it says it's going to restart and in the middle ow what ever work I was doing it would seem to randomly restart when I didn't want it to...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present when I go to DM I don't have the option to roll back...</p>

            <p>The whole thing sounds like a video driver problem - especially if it used to work 2 week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I offer two warnings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is never a good idea to blindly accept and install everything that you see offered by Windows Update since WU is notorious for offering hardware drivers that are incompatible or out of date with your system.&nbsp; This is one reason why there are so many topics
 in the community with a subject line of "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having WU set to Auto is also risky since you can't tell what kinds of things WU is going to offer you that you don't need, don't want like driver updates or lately...&nbsp; Microsoft spyware through their intelligence gathering programs where they assure us
 that they do not collect any personal information about <em>you</em>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also not a good idea to use the free or paid programs to scan your system and offer driver updates for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On most systems you there are usually just about 3 things to worry about - audio, video, network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should only get driver updates from the WWW site of the manufacturer of the hardware - either the computer manufacturer or if you know the device (video, audio, network) manufacturer get the drivers from their site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager you can see the driver version you have now so that would be the "suspicious" one.&nbsp; It is important to know the driver you have now so if you update you can be sure the update works when the version changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Alienware is from Dell your system has a Service Tag number (I think) so you can go to the Dell Support site and enter your Service Tag number and download install the drivers they say you need or let their WWW site detect your system and suggest a
 driver for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without knowing the Service Tag number it looks like some Alienware have NVIDIAI components but yours may be different - that's why you enter the tag number:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/?~ck=mn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/?~ck=mn</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But sometimes those drivers from Dell may be out of date too but you can/should start there, update, check Device Manager for the version again restart and see how things look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have AMD Radeon you can also visit their site and see what driver version the recommend and install it and/or use their Auto Detect program and let it look at your system and install what it recommends:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't figure any of this out do this so we can see what you have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have a Dell system what is the Service Tag number?<br />
<br />
Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>

</p><p>I probably should've mention earlier&nbsp; that the deciding factor as to why I did a clean install was that my pc would hang on shut down/restart and I would always have to manually force pwr down... I think this started after an auto win update that tried to
 install and restart but got hanged up and never stopped hanging on shutdown/restart...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the latest video driver update was causing it... I've done AMD's auto detect and their recomended driver but the one they list causes my pc to hang... I think that driver version was like a 400mb file where there is another version of that
 driver but a 200mb version and that one doesn't cause my pc to hang up... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm considering doing another&nbsp; clean os install but without all those win updates as like you mentioned... When I did win updates I got a feeling that it might cause issues but I Hate seeing pop up nags or reminders about updates...

            <p>I think you are on the right track - video drivers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system has a Dell Service Tag number what it is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not send this requested information from msinfo32:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you see if the driver suggested by Dell is better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already had the latest AMD driver from their site and it didn't work right you might be able to get the version before that and see how that works.&nbsp; The latest AMD driver is just a day or two old.&nbsp; Either the one from Dell or AMD - whichever one seems
 to work the best is about all we can suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to see pop-ups and nags about Windows Updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in July Windows Updates became afflicted and then we learned how to fix it.&nbsp; Part of that solution was to set Windows Update to Never check for updates (or install them).&nbsp; That puts you in control of the updates instead of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folks started to see all the updates that were related to what Microsoft calls "telemetry" which are updates and adjustments Microsoft wants to install to gather information about your system (nothing about YOU of course) so people thought it was a big invasion
 of their privacy and spying so setting WU to never check for updates means you will have to check yourself once in a while and then you can look at the updates and decide which things you want to install or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a little extra work so it is up to you but still I would not accept install any hardware driver updates from MS which means you will need to look at what they send and decide to install it or not.</p>

            <p>Problem FIXED...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install then used dell support drivers install/ update for all needed including the video driver... After installing and updating needed drivers I restored all my files and set everything up the way I like it...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did everything slowly step by step instead of multi taking things to speed up the process... After all that was finished I installed bitdefender my security software... I saved it for last as I didn't want any trouble with my installs, updates, and setting...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went step by step in adjusting the settings to where I had them before and restarted after ever change... In the end I discovered that the Ransomware Protection setting when set on boot was causing this issue of missing taskbar pins and desktop icons resetting
 after every reboot... </p>
<p>
</p><p>When setting up ransomware protection you don't notice any changes until you restart or have an issue associated with its protected files listings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in the end problem solved my unchecking a box... I should've restated after changing that setting; it would've saved me a big headache...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate all the help and suggestions as going through this process and following the feed back, I discovered that one of the video driver updates I did was the cause of my pc hanging on startup/restart before... Again I currently am running the
 video driver update through dell's site... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have win updater set to inform me of updates but not to download or install them as I will now be more cautious about what it updates... As I have had problems with them before...</p>
<p>
</p><p>IDK if these postings will help other ppl with a similar issue but it's what worked for me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

    <title>New Skype Online Status - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesmickley  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype Online Status</h2>
                    I have recently donloaded the latest version of Skype, I have the 3 status options of: Online, Do Not Disturb and Invisible. However when I am online with Skype running in the background it is showing me as offline to all of my contacts. Whenever I have
 googled the answer it says to go onto tools and change the settings so that "don't show offline until after X minutes" but I can't seem to find how to do this on new Skype??? any feedback would be appreciated&nbsp;

            Go to the upper left corner of the new hideous dumbed down version of Skype (Skype stable release 3 July 2018), left click on the area where you profile picture medallion (little circle with your pic) and name are. This opens up a big box and under your
 profile picture medallion is an long horizontal oval, click on this and you get the 3 choices of "status" we now have, and click on what you want it to list. This is the new way to change status now that they have removed the Tool Bar and all its myriad choices.

I am sorry I have such a bitter tone, but I am simply gobsmacked by this latest Microsoft blunder. Sigh...<br />

            Thanks for this, are you aware of anyway of setting a time limit or something from when it shows active to offline as I will be working on one screen with skype on the other screen but still showing as offline.

<p>there is no "offline" status, only: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Online</p>
<p>2. Do not disturb</p>
<p>3. Invisible</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have observed, if you put your status as one of those three, it just stays that way until you go into that box from your profile medallion area and change it manually. As to the splitting off of the contact list sidebar thingie and the skype
 screen, they took that away. In the upper right of the skype call screen, when making a call there is an icon, a box with three horizontal lines, if I remember correctly, and you click on that to get the contact list sidebar. But my last skype call, yesterday,
 every time I hung up, Skype would completely close and I would have to boot it up and sign in again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The call was unstable and skype crashed a couple of times while we were talking.&nbsp; Each time, open skype, log in, but my status was always in "online" as I had last set it. To change it you have to be logged onto an open Skype, not like before where we could
 just close and then right click the icon to change the status. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. My friend and I clicked on all the little icons possible to see what there was, it is so so reduced now, such a fail. Anyway, I downloaded the old "Classic Skype" for now, first I uninstalled new skype then downloaded the old skype from
 a link provided by this Serge_P guy from Microsoft, took all of 5 minutes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if just until Sept, still worth it. Hoping the backlash and number of folks downloaded Classic Skype with force Microsoft to seriously rethink this blunder.

    <title>Why does microphone activity mute normal audio output&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> squilliamr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does microphone activity mute normal audio output&#63;</h2>
                    The Surface Headphones are great for listening to music, and they're great for calls, but god forbid you try doing both at the same time. It seems as though when the input device "Surface Headphones Hands-Free" is in use (like when you open the "Recording"
 tab of the Sound control panel), any output from the device "Surface Headphones Stereo" is muted, and only audio from the "Surface Headphones Hands-Free" playback device will still play. I understand using two different output devices within the Surface Headphones
 to enable individual control of sound from normal audio and call audio, but why would the "Stereo" device be muted in this situation? This prevents the headphones from being usable in multiplayer games that make use of the microphone for communication, or
 from hearing anything from other sources while in a phone call.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested this on my Surface Laptop as well as my desktop computer with an ASUS Z390-E motherboard, both running Windows 10 1809. This issue emerges in essentially any application that uses the microphone. I've seen it happen by opening the "Recording"
 tab of the Sound Control Panel (because this activates the microphone), as well as the Microsoft Voice Recorder app, Discord, and the game Destiny 2 when I turn in-game voice chat on. Microphone use in all of these will cause any other audio to be blocked
 out, whether that's music from Spotify, YouTube videos, or game sounds. </p>

            I am also having same issue and none of steps suggested are helping. This seems to be a design issue as there are others with same problem and no solution to this. Are engineers aware of this issue and is there anything in terms of a firmware update coming
 to fix this? Not being able to have audio from another source while mic is in use is not an acceptable design choice.

            Exactly. I wish instead of just getting a canned response about running a Windows troubleshooter (which in my experience never helps with anything), I wish Support would just acknowledge that this is how the headphones were designed.

<h2>            Missing Events in Event Log</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to do a complete system recovery. It comprised of formatting/reinstalling windows 7 than installed windows 8 upgraded. everything is running fine. Today it took longer than usual to get to the log in screen. I decided to look into the event
 log only to find there where no listings for today under performance monitoring. I than ran the resource and performance app an it's first entry is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Severity:</td>

Informational</td>

<tr>
<td>Symptom:</td>
<td>Missing Events in Event Log</td>

<tr>

<td>
<p>Investigate why 59% (24,477) events were lost during data collection. The settings for Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) maximum buffers and buffer size may not be optimal depending on which data sets are being collected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone guide my to fixing this. Thank you!!</p>

            <p>John, Thank you so much for your help. tried all above and ended up nowhere. So I dumped a backup a formatted/restored windows. The event log is now working. Still need to squash some bugs though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It all started with an updated driver that erased my profile. Since than the system has been running wonky.I reloaded my Norton internet security and it kept coming up with two icons in the system tray. So this time I'm running using just windows defender
 as I'm afraid to try Norton again. just hope defender does the job.&nbsp; it still not a perky at it was before the video driver fiasco.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again thanks</p>

Windows Live Photo Gallery is just a middleman. It does not store your pictures.<br />
Go to the folder where you initially saved the pictures to. That is the location of your actual pictures.<br />
<br />
Right click at the desktop &gt; Personalize &gt; bottom, Screensaver &gt; under Screen saver heading, click the pointer and select Photos &gt; click OK when done.</p>
<p>" rotated the right way " ?<br />
You mean the sequence the pitures are shown in screensaver mode ?<br />
They are shown based on alphabetcal order.</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue., has happened twice in 12 hours. Both times I was playing destiny and I'd get kicked and I'd check network settings and apparently my xbox deleted my wifi network, and when I'd try to put the password In it would tell me it was
 wrong.</p>
<p>both times a hard reset worked, I just had to set up the network again but it took the password.</p>
<p>My brother doesn't have this issue on his, he was watching Netflix each time it happened, &nbsp;but the only thing I can think of is he doesn't do the early update previews but I do, so I'm assuming it has something to do with an update I probably don't even
 know I have </p>

<p>Hard Reset worked for me. And another person who replied. I uninstalled the "Early Update Preview" and my connection has been 10x better. &nbsp;Oddly enough, when I called Xbox Support they said "a wall can interfere with connection on Wifi with the Xbox One".
 &nbsp;Apparently people don't have walls where the Xbox One was designed. </p>

<p>The same exact issue MetalHeadChiyo experienced is happening to me. I tried 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, happened on both eventually. Nothing else on my network is dropping a connection. Not downloading or streaming anything anywhere when it happens. Destiny will
 just boot me with one of their 5 million networking error codes, I'll lose connectivity, and won't allow me to connect back to my wifi b/c it tells me the password is invalid. A hard reboot works every time (don't just power console off, pull the plug) but
 this is complete BS. </p>

<p>This has been happening to me on and off, usually a hard reset works. Not today however, while playing Destiny it randomly disconnected from xbox live(as destiny likes to do) but now when i go to connect it wont accept my wifi password. All my other devices
 are connecting fine, even the old 360. No passwords have been changed and the right password has been entered multiple times into the Xbox one to no avail, the XB1 can even see my wifi network but just decides it has to create a problem by being all "nope
 even though i've connected to this *** 1000 times, i'm gona screw you over" the proper ports are open, there is nothing wrong with my router. so what Xbox live team, am i suppose to sacrifice the connectivity of all my other devices by resetting everything
 in my wifi network. Also your customer service team(phone wise) seems to be completely useless, do you pull these guys out of the slums of Delhi? and tell them just to repeat to people that they need to move their xbox closer to their router? or that i have
 to do a hard reset? its embarrassing and offensive to anyone with even basic computer literacy. Alright /end rant &nbsp; this is a serious problem and while im happy to go back to my PC its making me mothball my Xbox and seriously question my purchase.</p>

<p>@TomMcD01</p>
<p>You are right there is nothing wrong with your network. No need to mess around with your router.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is a bug in Destiny that breaks the wifi adaptor.</p>
<p>The only fix is either a hard reset or to clear the alternate mac address then restart.</p>
<p>Other than that the only thing you can do until either Microsoft or bungie fix it is to use wired because the bug doesn't seem to break the Ethernet port.
</p>
<p>I've currently wired my xbox up to a wifi bridge and am no longer getting the disconnections.</p>
<p>The problem is definitely with either Destiny itself or the xbox one system software and only Microsoft or bungie can fix it. Unfortunately though I have no idea on whether they are actually working on a fix.</p>

<p>This is an old thread, but I've seen this problem a lot while playing Iron Banner/Trials of Osiris/Crucible in Destiny on my Xbox One. This guy found and caught some cheaters that seem to cause these symptoms here:

<p>Bungie acknowledged this issue and should be dealing with the cheaters swiftly in this weeks updated published 5/29/15 here:

<p>As some other members mention above, clearing your MAC Address may be a resolution to getting back online, but it's always worked for me to just hard restart my Xbox One by holding the power button until it restarts</p>

<h2>            How to disable Auto playback device detection. or lock it to my optical out &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a few audio devices for playback. </p>
<p>The big problem with windows is that it thinks that you need to switch </p>
<p>default playback automatic when you turn for exampel hdmi monitor on.</p>
<p>The hdmi i have killed by disable it in the hardware&nbsp; (This device is disabled. (Code 22))</p>
<p>So that annoying problem is for now killed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows seems to have the mood to switch audio back to default speakers sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that windows still change default devices, </p>
<p>sometimes it's steam that not revert it back when i close it. yes steam is only active when needed)</p>
<p>But the problem start get appear now on startup of windows to, </p>
<p>and the system where shutdown with the right output device, my optical-out.</p>
<p>This problem did seems to get worse since windows i use the windows creator </p>
<p>version. but it where already frustrating before.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can i deactivate auto detecting of the playback device on all sound cards ?</strong></p>
<p>So windows will always see my optical-out on my creative x-fi pci-e card as default playback ?</p>
<p>Playback device only need to change on request from software. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, disable sounds cards does not work or is unwanted in the playback sound menu.</p>
<p>Besides it did happen that i disabled HDMI on the monitors and windows </p>
<p>later or nvidia did put them back or activated them again.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>To help you resolve this issue, we recommend to switch off AutPlay on your Windows 10 by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Devices</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>AutoPlay</strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Switch off <strong>AutoPlay</strong>.</span></li></ol>

            <p>That did not help. I also do not see how that autoplay setting that is for media you insert would solve my audio playback device change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know some porgram changes the playback device and not set it back. i Reported that. But i just noticed again a change to the wrong playback device in audio. And not sure why it changed this time. Mabye because uninstall of 3DFX space navigator driver and
 that Plug and Play screwed things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it still seems to change to the wrong one at times.</p>

            <p>It looks stable for now. I keep eye on it.</p>
<p>The last change where again because the program, but after a new update. it seems to work. not sure for how long because i do not think that update would have a fix.

<p>Just done a complete clean install of the creator update. Still putting trhings back.</p>
<p>But short after the clean install the porblem already kciked back in. </p>
<p>I turned autoplay off. That did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon windows detected the secondary monitor, the default playback device already changed.</p>
<p>I solved that again by disable the whole nvidia HDMI audio device. Ugkly solution but that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What micorosft best could do is stop switching audio playback devices at all.</p>
<p>Let the user switch it manual when needed, </p>
<p>that's more easy and friendly then How it's implemented now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, no correct solution. </p>

<p>Windows is making a garbage at time from settings with there Plug and Pray. That term is never been so correct as with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just started my system, it already started with the main screen. weird stripes. and black screen.</p>
<p>First turned the other screen on. nothing. So the main screen off and on fixed that,</p>
<p>After that spontanic my audio device where changed to the wrong one again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ADD: Hmm, whole sound is gone. Need a restart and hope that fix it.</p>
<p>Creator update is the worse windows 10 so far.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be a configuration issues between Windows 10 and your audio devices. We suggest running the troubleshooter for sound problems on this

<p>Not a problem with audio devices. It complains only about disabled nvidia audio device. And that is turned off hard in hardware by disable it to fix lot's of problems with auto detecting. It also start to complain that there's no speaker connected. That's
 correct because i use optical out only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that windows need to stop switching my optical default playback device to something else. Or stop switching audio playback devices automatic at all. If that could be disabled it would solve i think all problems. I have btw 3 audio playback
 devices if we do not count the monitors.</p>
