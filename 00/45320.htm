<h2>            Windows 7 Pro 64 bit Backup to One Drive</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting error messages telling me my back up isn't working properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had it set to back up on my 4TB WD Book (4TB).&nbsp; I get an error code 0x8078002A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I can't afford to buy any new storage hardware right now.</p>
<p>It really makes no sense for me to backup to the 4TB since I have been moving the bulk of my data to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I keep very little on my C drive other than software (which is also stored on CD's) and in work documents.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I would like to back up the data from my 4TB and my C drive to the cloud using my One Drive account, but I 'm not given that option.&nbsp; I have roughly 200 - 250TB total data for my initial backup.&nbsp; Is there a way to set backup to go to my OneDrive account?

            <p>Windows 7 Backup reporting error 0x8078002A is a known issue with WD drives and you can read about it here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.wdc.com/KnowledgeBase/answer.aspx?ID=6618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.wdc.com/KnowledgeBase/answer.aspx?ID=6618</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to perform a Google search on that error you would see that it is not just a WD issue - other storage manufacturers with large capacity drive see the same thing and have their own solutions/workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your issue is not exactly with the Windows 7 Backup program...&nbsp; lots of HD manufacturers have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you have a 4TB drive and your initial backup is 200-250TB?&nbsp; That's a pretty large backup and there are limits to what you can store on OneDrive that you can read about here and there:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think OneDrive was designed for collaboration and sharing files - I don't think it was designed to be Cloud backup receptacle and as you can read there are limitations to the capacity that are in the GB range (up to 1TB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to backup to the Cloud I would not use Windows Backup or OneDrive.&nbsp; Microsoft is not in the cloud backup and restore business so you might end up with something that might work sometimes maybe and who is going to help you if you have a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would look at companies that know how cloud backups work and have already developed the tools and software needed to perform Cloud backup and restore operations and figured out all the ins and outs...&nbsp; companies where that is all they do all day long and
 are good at it and have technical support available when you need it.</p>

            <p>Yea I'm not sure why people bother with devices like you have,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally just get a Icy dock enclosure with 4 slots for 4 different hdd's 2tb max so loss is at least limited</p>
<p>usually I get 1tb drives and swap them out as needed never leaving them connected unless being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Devices like you have are destined to fail and at 4tb fail hard.</p>

<h2>            SteelSeries Merc Stealth Keyboard and Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>I think after 10 years Steelseries has a right to change thier formula for keyboards but why oh why do Microsoft then have to break trust?</p>
<p>Why is it that Microsoft have chosen to distrust the Alpham driver that has worked flawless with Windows for 10 years?</p>
<p>Give us back our keyboards...... This will not force me buy a new keyboard.....&nbsp; &nbsp;I paid for a software licence for my OS&nbsp; &nbsp;I didnt pay for it in order for you to break my equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know I'm not alone in my grievances.</p>

<p>Thats the point&nbsp; &nbsp;NOTHING is wrong with my Keyboard Hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read I'm inquiring as to the reason the Alpham driver for the Merc Stealth keyboard has been distrusted by Microsoft after 10 years of flawless operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As every update since Creators fall update breaks the trust for the Alpham driver forcing me in to having to remake&nbsp; .cat&nbsp; .sys .ini files to get it running again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What reason is this driver now deemed as unsafe when it has been safe for the last 10 years?</p>

            I understand, I just was wondering if this was causing any issues with the functionality of your keyboard. Have you tried simply downloading the driver again from the manufacturer's website?

<p>Yes i have tried reinstalling the driver direct from Steelseries website this now fails to install. I can install it fine on windows 7 and on windows 10 only if it does not have Creators update. It is only after i update my windows 10 to latest cumulative
 update breaks 'trust' with the Merc Stealth Alpham Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is crazy&nbsp; &nbsp; its a keyboard&nbsp; why break it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many other people with this keyboard also have enquired as to what has happened and if there are any work arounds but not many are asking why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>cant be too hard to add the Alpham driver back since it was removed after 10 years for no reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues the update causes is for Win10 to distrust the Alpham driver for the Merc Stealth keyboard. It breaks the functionality of the keyboard's custom keyset that sits on the left side of the board.&nbsp; After messing with the original driver (changing
 the file name from Alpham to Merc) and disabling driver signing it reinstalls and works until you guessed it Windows updates again. I dont want to disable Windows update service and leave my PC without updates but at the same time i dont want to have to change
 a perfectly good keyboard for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>Malik that actually doesn't work anymore.<br />
<br />
The Steelseries software allowed users to map any button on the keyboard, however, since fall creators, and previous updates. It no longer works properly.<br />
<br />
I have tried the above, and it breaks the functionality of the numpad, as well as mapping abilities.<br />
<br />
I finally had to give up and doing the above because of subsequent updates breaking the fix, and having to do it all over again. Forcing the driver to work by allowing untrusted drivers, will open the software but not mapping, and of course the numpad issues
 where they are not mapped correctly at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gotta side with Law Sayer on this one. This issue has been around now for over a year, and uninstalling and hiding updates is not a solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;All MS need to do is retrust the Alpham driver that was never broken or malware in the first place.</p>
<p>Spookyjones if you would like a copy of the driver files i altered for use (I have 100% functionality) they are unsigned but do work&nbsp; or if you would like me to share with you the method to change Alpham driver yourself please let me know.</p>

</p><p>Does anyone have working drivers or a work around since the June 2018 update? The old method of changing the file names and allowing untrusted drivers seems to get the icon turning green for me but I cannot use any of my mods. The zboard is stuck using the
 default settings only. Does anyone know how to get it working with custom mods? Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Difference between Windows 7 Product Key and Product I.D. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> douglas9x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Difference between Windows 7 Product Key and Product I.D.</h2>
                    
<p>Purchased new HP laptop with Win7 Home Premium installed. During initial installation checked box for authenticate when online. Never entered my Product key and now two weeks later curious as to whether my windows has been authenticated. Went to Computer/system/properties
 to enter my key and found under Windows Activation:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows is Activated<br />
Product I.D. xxxxx-oem-xxxxxxx xxx xx<br />
<br />
The product I.D. number is different than my Windows Key tag on my pc.<br />
<br />
My question is whether my Win7 has been authenticated or do i need to do something else to avoid problems after 30 days. Thanks in advnce.</p>

            Nothing to worry about.&nbsp; Major computer manufacturers install a Windows 7 image using a special product key that is tied to the motherboard's BIOS. The Certificate of Authenticity (COA) affixed to your computer is there to certify that the Windows 7 operating
 system is installed.

<h2>            Slow, stupid and unresponsive Xbox Live Servers</h2>
                    
<p>I create a party and a minute later get the message "Something went wrong with your party. Try again later. [0x89231804]". My friend and I just get dropped over and over, heck; I can't even stay in the party by myself without getting dropped. I have a good
 internet connection and my Xbox One is plugged in via ethernet so I am 100 percent sure it's the Xbox Live servers taking a dump on everyone, yet there's no server status alert for this? Really?!</p>
<p>Microsoft, I do not pay money to a subscription service for it run like garbage. I can't even play the Elder Scrolls Online because I just get dropped so often from the servers. This service "Xbox Live" is becoming pathetic and is completely unacceptable.
 Fire the code monkeys that are *** up the servers or get out of the console market. What a terrible experience just to play a game...</p>
<p>Something's wrong here Microsoft! Hey, can you FIX your servers please?</p>

            Hello tynaskos, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />I’ve seen that error on accounts which have two-factor/step authentication where the user requires an app specific password which is entered in place of the account password. 
<br />Does the AOL account use this security feature?
<br />If not then check the usual ‘suspects’: username &amp; password, whether the account uses SSL &amp; whether the port numbers are set correctly.
<br />AOL Mail IMAP Settings
<br />The IMAP settings for AOL mail are as follows:
<br />
<br />AOL Mail IMAP server address: imap.aol.com
<br />AOL Mail IMAP user name: Your full AOL Mail email address. For AOL email, this is your AOL screen name plus "@aol.com," such as "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" (or @love.com, @games.com 
<br />AOL Mail IMAP password: Your AOL Mail password
<br />AOL Mail IMAP port: 993
<br />AOL Mail IMAP TLS/SSL required: yes
<br />
<br />Enter these SMTP settings to send outgoing email through to your AOL Mail account from any email program.
<br />Incoming Mail Server: imap.aol.com
<br />SMTP Outgoing Server Address: smtp.aol.com. Set the port to 587
<br />SMTP Username: "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" (or @love.com, @games.com or @verizon.net)
<br />SMTP password. The password you use to log in to AOL Mail

<p><span>As far as know, this issue is related to the new <strong>Tablet Mode</strong> introduced in Windows 10. Sometimes, it makes the main program appear as only a small picture on your screen, because all the modern apps automatically open in full screen

<p><span>Hi refugecountryclub,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. What version of Windows 7 are you trying to upgrade from Windows Vista 32-bit? Is it 32-bit or 64-bit Windows 7?</span></p>
<p><span>b. What’s the edition of Windows Vista you’re running?
</span></p>
<p><span>c. What’s the edition of Windows 7 you’re trying to upgrade to? Is it Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional or any other edition?
</span></p>
<p><span>d. Are you trying to upgrade using an upgrade DVD or did you download a digital copy of Windows 7?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Upgrading from 32-bit Vista to a 64-bit version of Windows 7 isn’t a valid path. You may have to do a custom (clean) install in that case.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before upgrading to Windows 7, it is highly advisable to run Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.
</span><span>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor scans your PC for potential compatibility issues and lets you know about your Windows 7 upgrade options. Within minutes, you'll get a report that tells you if your
 PC meets the system requirements, if any known compatibility issues with your hardware, devices, and installed programs are found, and gives guidance on what to do to before installing Windows 7 on your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Free Theme and Gamerpics</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone found out how to unlock the free theme and 2 gamerpics? I was looking at installed content and it shows that you can unlock 1 theme, 2 gamerpics and 3 avatar items.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I got the Steve gamerpic when I killed a skeleton for the first time.</p>

</p><p>I have a 'virus', I think. I have a folder on my desktop that use to be a problem Microsoft Edge program. It found a malignant website and said I had a virus. Well, I had quarantined it in a folder on the desktop and named the folder ‘A Virus’. Some nice
 lady up here Vanessa Suhtun, helped me re-install Edge and everything was honky dory. Then I decided to remove the folder. I put it in the recycle bin. Cleared the bin and was happy as can be. Until I saw the folder on my desktop. Well, I’m 72 years old and
 maybe I had a senior moment. So I deleted it again. A few minutes later, there it was. So I McAfee shredded it. It came back. I renamed it, deleted it and rebooted. It came back with the rename. I opened the folder and there was another folder in it. It was
 named ‘History’. In it was a file named Desktop.ini. In the file was:</p>

</p><p>Does anyone have any idea? It doesn’t seem to do any damage, it just aggravates me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I want to thank you for your help. It didn't get rid of it, but I thought, what the hay, it is not doing any harm. Then a couple of hours ago, I thought, what about the registry? So I renamed the folder to Virus. I went into the registry and did a Ctl-F
 to find "Virus". That was a poor choice for a name. Lots and lots of "Virus" in the registry. I forgot about McAfee! :-)&nbsp; Fortunately somewhere in the top of the registry were two pointers to that folder. I deleted them, McAfee shredded the folder, rebooted
 and lo-and-behold. No more folder named Virus. I should have done that first. Again, thanks for your help. I don't know how you guys and gals do it.</p>

    <title>How can I start DHCP when I always get &#39;Access Denied&#39;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boweasie  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I start DHCP when I always get &#39;Access Denied&#39;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running 32 bit Vista Home Basic SP1.<br />
<br />
I cannot get online. When I hover the mouse over the network icon in the notification area, it reads, "Connection status unknown. The dependency service or group failed to start". When I try to diagnose the problem, I can't because the Diagnostics Policy Service
 is not running. When I try to Start the service, access is denied (Error 5). Same scenario for the service DHCP Client.
<br />
<br />
When I click on Start/Connect To - I get the msg Windows Cannot Find Any Networks<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I keep getting warnings that my firewall is not enabled. When I try to enable it, I get a message that the Security Center can't turn it on. Windows Firewall is not listed in services.msc.<br />
<br />
I ran a full Malwarebytes scan and it found nothing wrong. <br />
<br />
I did a system restore to several days before the problem, but even though the restore completed successfully, it didn't change my (non)results.<br />
<br />
The Network and Sharing Center does not display the familiar PC monitor icon with a line to the Network and another line going from the Network to the Internet. Instead it just has the word Unknown with the caption the depencency or groiup failed to start<br />
<br />
I am at a loss. </p>
<p>I have heard that this might be due to a permissions issue, but when I use regedit and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services and right click on Dhcp, select Permissions, I get an error when I try to add anything (either Local Service
 or Network Service). The msg is<br />
c:\Windows\system32\adsldp.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again... yadda yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
I have run sfc /scannow as well as chkdsk /f. Scannow reported that it found some problems but was unable to fix all of them. Chkdsk found and corrected about 10 errors, but neither of these programs helped with the issue.<br />
<br />
Additionally I have downloaded and installed Process Monitor on the PC, but the amount of information displayed is overwhelming, and I'm not sure what to check. Every time I try to start DHCP I get about 200 lines of info on the screen.
<br />
<br />
When I open a command prompt and run ipconfig /all, I get that DHCP is enabled (although it's obviously not running). &nbsp;I get the bogus ip address of 169.254.... I get a default gateway of zeroes.<br />
<br />

            <p>I really have a hard time comprehending the lack of support I receive on this issue.</p>
<p>You give me a link to a similar problem and say 'it was fixed'.&nbsp; Where in the link does it indicate that
<strong>ANY</strong> resolution was made?&nbsp; It's a post from over two years ago in which the best answer was provided by Sean Zhu - MSFT.&nbsp; He wants the original poster to recreate the problem and send him screen captures and log files.&nbsp; Is that what you're expecting
 ME to do?&nbsp; Just up and start emailing info to someone who may or may not be at the same address?&nbsp; Who has no direct connection with my issue, however similar?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the 'answers' are full of people saying that this fix or that Microsoft KB atricle didn't work.</p>
<p>There is no 'fix' contained in the link you supplied.</p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, PCs fail to recognize the External Hard Drive even after confirming a successful connection. This is usually due to a corrupted or outdated device driver. However, for us to isolate the issue, we need additional information. Kindly answer the
 questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tired to plug your external hard drive to another port or to another device to make sure that it is working properly?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages when you plug in your external hard drive?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run the Hardware and Device Troubleshooter. This automated tool will check the hardware/USB connected to your PC for any known issue and resolve it automatically. Refer to this link to access the troubleshooter:
<a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with devices and hardware</a>.</p>
<p>

<h3> bronsonbradley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second monitor &#40;HDMI port&#41; has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an Asus laptop:</p>
<p>i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.59 GHZ, 8 GB RAM, 64-bit OS, Nvidia GeForce GTX 950 M, Windows 10 version 1709 (OS Build 16299.309)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have been using a second monitor since I've owned the laptop through an HDMI cable. Now, for reasons unknown, it has stopped working. The monitor doesn't seem to detect the computer. Although, the computer flickers (as usual) when I plug the cable
 in which seems that the laptop does detect the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>- Different monitors and HDMI cables with no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Downgrading to version 1703 of windows 10 with no results.</p>
<p>- Reinstalling windows 10 more than once to see if it works, but no.</p>
<p>- Updating both Nvidia and Intel graphics card drivers. Plus uninstalling and reinstalling processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit guttered and unable to figure out what is wrong. I have used a second monitor for my work for ages across multiple systems and have never had this issue occur. I was wondering if it has something to do with the Generic Pnp Monitor driver?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any feedback and help!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

            Hi BronsonBradley,<br /><br />Seems like you’ve done a ton of troubleshooting already! Any other video out ports (vga, display port) you could try and test? Of course it could be a driver issue, but it’s possible the video card is failing on you given everything you’ve already done. <br /><br />Let me know about the other video outputs. <br /><br />- Charlie

            Wireless display would be a solid test. A couple of things I would try next. HDMI to TV. Theoretically it’ll be the same result as a monitor, but you never know. I’d download the latest driver for your video card. Uninstall your current one, reboot and install the freshly downloaded driver. <br /><br />Hit me up tomorrow and we’ll keep attacking it! <br />- Charlie

            I have actually tried the TV eh, to no avail. And I have recently done the video driver install, uninstall and reinstall steps in various combinations. For both the intel card and the Nvidia one. But, I suppose, doesn't hurt to try again!&nbsp;<br />

            Ok... here’s something out there, but it would be a good test if you have the time. You could boot a Linux distro on your PC using a disc or USB (you don’t need to install it, it’ll just boot from the media in case you have never done it before) and try to hook up the second monitor. If it works, we know it’s a Win10 issue. If it doesn’t, we can almost guarantee it’s an issue with the card. You seem advanced enough for this so I figured I’d lob it out there. <br />- C

<h2>            Error Code 0x8007007B</h2>
                    Went to do a system restore but keep getting this error code 0x8007007B.&nbsp; The reason why I wanted to do a system restore is because the USB ports on the front panel of computer suddenly became unrecognised by the system, hence I was going to restore back
 to early date when everything was o.k.&nbsp; please help.&nbsp; I don't have the Vista software as the tower came preloaded and I don't have a restore back-up disc.

<p><span>Hi MAVERICKMOORE,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p><span>Since you are getting an error message at the time of doing System restore, first you may try the steps to resolve the System Restore
 issue and later try the steps provided to trouble shoot on USB device issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>
 Try creating a new restore point and try to restore to that point. If you can restore, then we can conclude that your previous restore points are damaged</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Creating system restore point manually:</span></strong><span><br />
<span>1. Open System by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking System.
</span><br />
<span>2. In the left pane, click System Protection&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the&nbsp;password or provide confirmation.</span><br />
<span>3. Click the System Protection tab, and then click Create.</span><br />
<span>4. In the System Protection dialog box, type a description, and then click Create</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try to boot in Safe mode and try doing a System restore.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2: To boot to Safe Mode</span></strong><span> you can follow the below given
 steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start button</strong>, click the <strong>arrow next to the Lock button</strong>, and then click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need
 to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start
 in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER.
<br />
<br />
For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).<br />
<span><br />

</span></span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information, you may refer the following links for more information:</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Regarding the USB related issue; you may try the following steps:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to plug in another USB port and check whether the device is getting detected.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First of all you can check Disk Management to see if the drive is detected there:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.
<strong>Right-click</strong> on <strong>Computer</strong>, select <strong>Manage,</strong> select
<strong>Disk Management</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Check the
<strong>upper and lower</strong> windows to find whether the drive is detected. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If the drive is detected, then
<strong>right click</strong> on the flash drive or thumb drive and then choose <strong>
change drive letter and paths</strong> to assign a new path. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the external drive is not detected, please try connecting the external drive to another PC to check if the device is working
 there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information, you may refer the following link and try the Fixit:<br />

<br />
This bug check (</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL)</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
Typically, this error occurs when a driver uses an incorrect memory address. Other possible causes of this error include an incompatible device driver, a general hardware problem, or incompatible software</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
First, I would suggest you to install the latest hardware drivers from the manufacture’s website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
<br />
<br />
Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps.</font></span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
<br />
<font color="#000000">Method 1:<br />
</font></span></b></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
I would suggest you to </font><span>Run Memory diagnostics tool and check if it helps.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
The Memory diagnostic tool will check and fix any issues with the computer’s memory. You can refer these steps to run this tool.</span></p>

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><b><font>Method 2:</font></b></font></span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to Update BIOS and chipset drivers and check if it helps.<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
This issue could also be caused due to outdated Basic Input Output system (BIOS) or chipset drivers. I would suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website to download and install the latest BIOS and chipset drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<font color="#000000"><b><font>Method 3:</font></b></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<h2>            I will be switching to playstation.</h2>
                    I will be moving to playstation because of the sole fact that xbox has no loyalty to their customers I am not going to pay full price to have a pain in my next. I was sitting on the fence before this and now I have picked a side. My only regret is that
 I bought a couple of new games for the xbox recently but such is life. By the way I know of 4 other xbox users that are joining me in the move. thanks for ruining a good thing Microsoft.

<p><strong>[Mod removed].<br />
</strong>That's not true. Many of us that liked the 360 but aren't happy with the way MS has totally screwed the pooch with their marketing and PR. &nbsp;I wasn't a MS console fan until the 360. I couldn't stand the original Xbox.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Time will tell with the X1. I plan on getting it eventually, but for now I still have a sour taste in my mouth and think MS has a bit more to prove until I feel like I am making a worthy investment.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I do think the X1 will be a good console in time. I still have one 360 left in the house and will continue to get games for that, but for next gen the PS4 fits me better.</p>

<p>I'm ditching Playstation for Xbox, as are most of my friends. It all balances out. Try not to kid yourself with companies caring though. You will mean no more to Sony than you do to Microsoft. You're a customer, nothing more. Profit comes first, remember
 that and you'll be happier. Just enjoy the games for the games, ignore the politics.</p>

<p>I have gotten tired of posting problems and no one fixing it so I just quit posting.</p>
<p>Still suffering from random dissconects from the Xbox 360 dashboard beta.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on, but I think the thing that really blew the lid off the whole problem jar was when I recently purchased a ps3 and when hooked up to my modem the light flashes blue which means dosis 3.0 is in effect, I get the old orange light with
 the drag box 360.</p>
<p>It's over boys and girls, attention Xbox and Microsoft your flight is going down so all you can do now is strap on your seatbelt and prepare for the ride down and look around at all your coworkers and hope your not a statistic.</p>

<p>To sevendust, it would be great to stay out of the politics if it wasn't hitting me in the pocket so hard. I think what this post may have been started for was the 140% hike in price for people on the Family Plan. When talking to a rep of LIVE about a year
 and a half ago, she made me aware of the "Family Pack". This was the answer for a father with three kids each wanting their own Xbox 360. So, I went and slowly bought two more 360's. A year later, I start getting rumors of it going away and having to pay full
 price for each individual box. This is not something you can just ignore or each of the other accounts will simply shut down. Parents are now faced with a choice to make. Pay the equivalent of $60.00 every three months to keep everything from being interrupted,
 or, start trading it all in on the PS3's and buy a new game that comes out every three months for the same price as Xbox LIVE? It sure seems to be an easy decision. Yet, I've been a loyal LIVE member for about six and a half years now and I find it hard to
 leave what I know without speaking out how I feel about this. I already own one PS3. It's not a bad system. Very good graphics. If the Xbox One doesn't offer me more than just an expensive score keeper, I'm afraid my family's LIVE days are over. LIVE does
 not give us any free TV channels. It doesn't give us the internet connection. It does not give me my Netflix or Hulu Plus. I have to pay extra for all these things. I rent movies from LIVE and buy other things from them. Having four accounts allows me to buy
 more than one copy of the same games for others in the house to play together online, in our own rooms, on our own TV's. So, with all that said, they are making money in all kinds of ways by making it more affordable for families to have LIVE. 140% hike will
 drive families away, not all, but a lot.</p>

    <title>Language Bar &#40;Japanese&#41; Switching between input modes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hujis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language Bar &#40;Japanese&#41; Switching between input modes.</h2>
                    Some time ago when using Japanese IME I could hot key (Shift+Caps for me) beween hiragana/Kanji and halfwidth alphanumeric, for some reason this has now changed to fullwidth alphanumeric. I can still type in halfwidth if I hot key back to English (CTRL+Shift
 for me) but it would be much faster if it toggled between hiragana and halfwidth alphanumeric while in Japanese input mode for the reason that I can do this by starting a sentance with a capital letter, this automatically switches it to the alphanumeric input.
 How can I change it so that it automatically goes into halfwidth alphanumeric rather than fullwidth alphanumeric when I'm in Japanese input mode?

<p><span>Hi Hujis,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which keyboard are you using, the regular one or Japanese?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Before, were you able to go into half width alphanumeric
 automatically rather than full width alphanumeric?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can remove the language form the keyboard layout and again assign it.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on Start menu and select Control Panel</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the Control Panel search box type ‘Region and Language’ and click enter</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select Keyboards and Language tab and click on Change Keyboard button</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on Japanese and remove from the list and again click on Add button and locate the
 language (Japanese) and add it to the list and check whether it works</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you were able to automatically go into half width alphanumeric before then, you can do a system restore and check. Check the article mentioned below.</span></p>
