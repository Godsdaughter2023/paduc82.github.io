            If you want to sync to your google calendar you can just add your google account on all of your devices. If you have a hotmail account you can do the same thing. then your devices will stay in sync with each other. For iCal take a look at
<a href="http://www.google.com/sync/mac.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a> to see how to sync it with your google account.&nbsp;

            <p>One of the nice features abourt Windows Phone is that you have an aggregated calendar and can see appointments from all your sync'd calendars in one location. I've truly enjoyed this as I can now see all my appointments side-by-side (e.g., work, personal,
 user group, etc.) without having to load personal appointments on my work account or work appointments on my personal account.</p>
<p>When you set up an account from Outlook or Windows Live, the calendar associated with that account will be synced to your phone and will automatically stay in sync. To learn how to set up email accounts, see
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/people/set-up-an-email-account.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Set up or delete an email account</span></a>.
</p>
<p>When you set up an account from another service such as Google, you might be able to sync the calendar associated with that account by doing the following:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>On <span>Start</span>, flick left to the
<span>App</span> list, tap <span>Settings</span>, and then tap
<span>Email &amp; accounts</span>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Tap the account name, and then tap the <span>
Calendar</span> check box to sync its contents to the phone.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Tap <span>Done</span>.</div>
</li></ul>
<p>I hope this helps!<br />

<h2>            Transplanted old HDD into a new computer, now can&#39;t access Users directories.</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was running really really slowly, and the computer shop said my RAM was defective and my hard drive was dying (it has some bad sectors, but they can't tell me how many). So I got the RAM replaced and got Windows installed on a new hard drive,
 but also got my old hard drive plugged into my motherboard so that I could try and retrieve files off of it. So far, my old hard drive is running slow as heck, but I have managed to access it and copy all the files off my data partition (which does not have
 any special permissions settings) without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where I am running into issues is trying to retrieve stuff from the Users directory of the OS partition on my old hard drive. When I try clicking on any of the user folders, it says "You don't currently have permission to access this folder. Click Continue
 to permanently get access to this folder." I click Continue, and the progress bar slowly progresses, and then it hangs near the end. I even left it for a few hours (since my old hard drive is running incredibly slow), but the process to grant me permission
 just will not finish. It doesn't completely lock my computer or outright seem to freeze, though. It just sits there without progressing to the end, until I give up and close Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried mucking around with the settings on the Properties---&gt;Security tab, and according to those settings I should have permissions for the user folder. I changed ownership to the administrator of my new computer setup and everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran into a similar problem with a Google Drive folder on a data partition, but I mucked around with the settings on the Properties----&gt;Security tab and it eventually did grant me access to those files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried going in through Command Prompt, but it said "Access is denied."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any ideas on how I can access those files?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Windows 7 Starter is not replaceable. If you didn't make the recovery disks, it is game over.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can buy Windows 7 Home Premium for your machine, but it may be hard to find in your locality, and if you do find it, ensure that you have the 32-bit installation DVD because there are no 64-bit drivers..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To install, you will need a USB DVD drive or copy the contents. to a bootable USB stick..

            <p>Hi ALL, </p>
<p><br />
Good information Greg, Thanks!<br />
<br />
Some added tips which might help some :<br />
</p>
<p>The new Media Creation Tool does allow you to select the 32 or 64 bit as<br />
needed and will download both the Home and Pro version. The one you<br />
are entitled to will be install and activated.<br />
<br />
Although the upgrade does fix some Windows issues those most likely to<br />
be driver, BIOS, or even hardware related should be corrected before <br />
trying to apply the new version. However if someone has an issue they <br />
can't otherwise resolve and are willing, if needed, to totally re-install Windows<br />
and programs as well as restore data from backups then they could try <br />
applying the upgrade.<br />
<br />
Of course 1511 does have some very nice feature additions.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How do you delete corrupt data from the Cloud&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do you delete data from the Cloud storage?&nbsp;I&nbsp;have a digital copy of dark souls, which has worked well without any issues until&nbsp;corrupt data was saved to my Cloud, which I am unsure as to why the data became corrupt as I always quit the game properly. Since, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, I have deleted all my internal data for the game but it no longer lets me play and the game will not allow me to save over the corrupt data or fix it or anything! It is very frustrating.&nbsp; The only storage device the game allows me to use is the Cloud which brings me to believe that is where the issue needs to be fixed. Will someone please help me with this?</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>I&nbsp;chatted with the support team for awhile and the only option we could come up with is adding a new profile to the console and play the game through game sharing.&nbsp; It is inconvenient because&nbsp;I&nbsp;will have to create a new email but they politely said&nbsp;I was out of luck.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            No Wifi on a Windows 10 machine - Was working, then all of a sudden it&#39;s gone &#40;not upgrade or VPN related&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Dell Latitude E6420 on Windows 10 (x64) version 10.0.14393 Build 14393. My wireless card is an Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced - N 6205 on version 15.18.0.1. I upgraded this machine from Windows 7 some months ago. Up until yesterday, the Wi-Fi
 worked more or less fine (had some issues, but nothing very serious). Yesterday I started my PC and learned my computer simply cannot connect to the Internet wirelessly anymore. I do not even get a list of potential networks. I literally cannot turn the Wi-Fi
 on. There are no error messages of any sort displayed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently operating via ethernet cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted simply opening the network settings window and moving the Wi-Fi slider from off to on, but the slider automatically reverts to the off position.

<p>
</p><p>I have read a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3084164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
few threads</a> in which MS claims that this issue stems from upgrades to 10 where the PC in question had third-party VPN software installed which was causing the issue. I did not and still do not have any software of the sort, but I downloaded their troubleshooter
 and tried anyway to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can of is that perhaps a Windows update caused the problem. Yesterday (8/23/2016) two updates installed themselves onto my machine (I really hate this auto-update stuff). One update was&nbsp;KB3176934 (Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version
 1607 for x64-based Systems) and the other was&nbsp;KB3176936 (Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems). I believe one of these updates caused the problem. However, I cannot uninstall both of them. Of the two, I can uninstall&nbsp;KB3176934 via the Uninstall
 an Update window, but selecting&nbsp;KB3176936 presents no such option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some other things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Numerous restarts</p>
<p>- ensuring all my drivers are up to date (they are)</p>
<p>- Trying old versions of my wireless card drivers</p>
<p>- Microsoft's troubleshooting tool (identifies no issues)</p>
<p>- Uninstalling update&nbsp;KB3176934 &nbsp;(doesn't solve issue)</p>
<p>- Doing a 'netsh winsock reset' from the command prompt</p>
<p>- Completely uninstalling the wireless card and reinstalling it (no dice)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use numerous other devices on the wireless without issue, so I am positive it is not any modem/router problem. My Xbox 360, Wii U, Samsung Galaxy S3, iPhone 6, iPad and Windows 7 work laptop all work totally fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I fixed the issue. I had gone back a couple versions on my wireless adapter driver software, but I didn't try all the really old ones. I put in a version from a few years ago and that worked. I guess the most current versions don't play nice with Microsoft's
 newest updates.</p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with Wi-Fi connection on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
</span><span><span>
<p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your effort towards resolving it.
</p>
</span></span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could be because of one of the following problems.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Your PC is too far from the wireless router or access point.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Your router and the network adapter in your PC might not work together.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> There's interference from other devices or due to software conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>The router or access point is busy if several PCs or devices using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following troubleshooting methods and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the Internet Connection troubleshooter</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Internet connection. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your Internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Right click on <strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>
Control Panel</strong>.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Change the <strong>view by </strong>option on the top right to
<strong>Large icons</strong>.<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and click on the<strong> view all
</strong>option on the left panel.<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Internet Connection </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Run Networking commands </p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, try resetting the TCP/IP stack, Release the IP address, Renew the IP address and Flush and
</p>
<p>reset the DNS client resolver cache. To do this, try below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Command prompt</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prompt</strong>, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;<strong>Yes</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixes your connection problem: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Type <strong>netsh winsock reset</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. </p>
<p>Type <strong>netsh int ip reset</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. </p>
<p>Type <strong>ipconfig /release</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. </p>
<p>Type <strong>ipconfig /renew</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. </p>
<p>Type <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

            <p>Vinodh_Kumar V, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the reply and I understand that you probably get similar questions frequently. However, I stated in my original post that I had already tried a netsh winsock reset (however I did leave out the subsequent commands - I was trying to be brief).
 I also stated that I ran Microsoft's troubleshooter, which claimed not to find any issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your other points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My PC is in the same room as my router.</p>
<p>2. The router and PC do in fact work together, as I upgraded to Windows 10 months ago and wireless connectivity was fine up until 8/23, which I also stated in my original post.</p>
<p>3. There shouldn't be any interference. I don't have cordless phones or baby monitors or anything like that which would cause interference. I also stated that I have plenty of other devices which connect without issue. The problem isn't just that I can't
 connect, it's that my PC cannot even identify that there are available networks. I have not installed any new software (apart from Microsoft updates).</p>
<p>4. Again, I ran this. Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to be patient about this issue, but it is difficult when I try to be thorough in my original post about what I have already tried and the first response is try those things.</p>

<p>The network interface disappeared from the PC running Windows 10 after a mandatory downloaded upgrade.</p>
<p>The driver reports that it failed to start. How does resetting a far away wifi router got to do with this?</p>

            <p>Possibly a similar problem??</p>
<p>
</p><p>After recent windows 10 update the usb ethernet adapter does work (I'm not sure if it was KB3173428 or KB3152599).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no wifi entries in settings. The wifi adapter does not appear in Device manager.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the USB adapter and replacing it installs the adapter and it works! This has to be done at each reboot. I have tried several makes of adapter and both give the same result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it is not</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) the infamous VPN software issue. Checked and not there<br />
2) an adapter problem. Tried several adapters. And by removing and reinstalling it works fine until the next reboot<br />
3) a problem with the router. Same answer as 2) and anyway my iPad continues to work ok. Also reset the router to no avail.<br />
4) IP address issue. Release and renew does not help<br />
5) a Winsock issue. Tried a reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that there is a wider Windows&nbsp;issue here? I'm starting to get annoyed with removing and replacing my adapter each day and would appreciate any guidance given.</p>

<h2>            Notification area constantly moving</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in windows 10 the notification area constantly moves (an example can be seen <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=536A1351F350BD93!5056&amp;authkey=!AL6vkrDbZ_E9cuo&amp;ithint=folder%2cmp4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>), which is really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Omen laptop and this bug occured after upgrading from windows 8.1 to windows 10.
</p>
<p>I also did a windows 10 reset and installed it by formatting the primary partition, but the bug was still present.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help at how can i get rid of this annoying bug will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>with the help of the HP support, we found out that the issue was caused by the touchscreen (hardware problem).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deactivating the touchscreen from the Device Manager-&gt; Input Devices (Human Interface Devices) -&gt; HID compliant Touchscreen fixed the issue and ofcourse at the same time disabled the touch capabilities of the touchscreen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point i sent my laptop to HP and they repaired the faulty component and the issue was gone even with activated HID compliant Touchscreen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Unable to Install Skype for Business&#40; we have Office 365 Business Essential licenses&#41; with Office Home and Business 2013</h2>
                    
They also have Office 365 Business Essentials licenses and when downloading the Skype for Business client from the user portal, we receive the message "We need to remove Office 2013 Homeand Office Bussiness. Some old apps don't work
 with Office 2016. Before installing the new Office, we need to remove: Microsoft Office Home and Business 2013 - en-us. Important: Once we've removed these apps, you won't be able to install the old version again. Remove and Continue or Cancel" Obviously,
 uninstalling all other Office 2013 applications is not an option. How do we install Skype for Business with Office 2013 Home and Business?

<p>I found the link to 2015 Lync downloader , i downloaded it works BUT It keep asking me to enter office license? Need solution ASAP my CEO is very furious, we spent a lot of money in past month.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Scott.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this is Office Outlook then you can set it as default Email app in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />If not and this is Outlook.com then add it to Windows 10 Mail app along with your other web and Office Mail accounts, set it as Default.  Here's a complete guide to WIndows 10 Mail app:  <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also try Outlook Mail app.  
<br />
<br />These are presently the only mail apps that will set as default, after which you should be able to Send To from the right click Context menu for files, or send Email from other apps.  
<br />
<br />If you'd also like to express your opinion about this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. You can even click the Share button there to generate a link to your Feedback to post back here for others to vote up or add to it. But Microsoft will not see it here as this is a mostly volunteer-staffed forums where we try to solve your problems. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear that, next thing to try is to uninstall the driver from device manager and get the latest driver from the manufacturer website.
<br />
<br />Do that and let me know how it goes.

            Hi  PratikSingh95
<br />
<br />Try with this option&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R Key
<br />And type&nbsp;
<br />
<br />regedit&nbsp;
<br />
<br />and we give enter.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />In the left panel we look for the following folder:&nbsp;
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ ControlSet001 \ Control \ Class \ {4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318} \ 0000&nbsp;
<br />
<br />(Sometimes the final folder can be 0001)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Located in this folder look for the following record:&nbsp;
<br />Feature Test Control&nbsp;
<br />Open and give a value of fb20 in hexadecimal and Accept.&nbsp;
<br />It will then appear as 0x0000fb20 (64288) in the right panel.&nbsp;
<br />Additionally, place the following record in the same folder:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />KMD_EnableBrightnessInterface2&nbsp;
<br />Open and give a value of 0 and accept.&nbsp;
<br />After these steps, restart the computer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Please Keep me informed of your progress

            Hello,
<br />Please see the below options:

<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version.

<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.

<h2>            Please please let us turn off automatic updates that doesn&#39;t involve something so convoluted &#40;based on other people asking this&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>This is about the 20th time your updates have ruined work. From not saving things, to not properly opening up everything after, to whatever else. I leave my PC on for a reason during the week, because I need to. It saves me so much time, and patients and
 its a convenience that I paid for by owning my PC and paying for this annoying OS. There isn't a single simple answer to stopping these, and that is just clearly on purpose and lazy scripting. I do not want your update. If I do, I will do it when it is better
 for me. Not in the middle of the night, closing everything and ruining a couple hours of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to mention I had to log into Microsoft to write this. Oh and your Feedback Hub is garbage too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid for this, and having an option to not update automatically is not a lot to ask for. Can't wait for the replies that suggest some convulated way rather than it just being, hmmmm I don't know, in the updates section of the settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just awful. I'm actually looking up Linux right now.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Account got banned and I can&#39;t play my games&#33;</h2>
                    <p>April 5th my account RaG3 Logiic got banned for about a week, because I had added gamerscore to my account. I have since deleted Horizen and not modified anything since. When I got banned for a week my gamerscore was around 4500, and I only had a few achievements. Then I logged on when I got unbanned, and my gamerscore was back to 1.6m+ gamerscore again, but I still didn't have the achievements. Then June 6th I had not hacked my account at all ever since the April ban then I get randomly permanently banned for adding gamerscore to my account when I hadn't that time. Now with my account being permanently banned and them upholding it, I can't access any of my games or my pre-order. I had bought Friday the 13th and had White Noise 2, CoD: Black Ops 2, CoD: WaW, Zombi, and Emily Wants to Play 2. I am hoping that Microsoft or whoever could like transfer my games' licence or something to my new account "YA&nbsp;BOI&nbsp;XMC" or somehow allow me to play them in some way. I hope I get a respons

<h2>            Can&#39;t search for PDF files in mapped network drives</h2>
                    <p>I've been having issues&nbsp;trying to search through Windows Explorer for contents within a PDF file on mapped drives. I have tried almost everything but&nbsp;nothing has worked so far. I installed Adobe PDF iFilter and it worked for the files&nbsp;that are in my&nbsp;"Documents"
 (non mapped) but it didn't work on my mapped network drives. I am able to search for contents within other&nbsp;formats such as Excel, but not PDF's. I can only search for&nbsp;them by their file name. This is a huge inconvenience as most of our files are in PDF format.
 We have had to resort to naming the PDF with certain keywords so we can find them later on but is still not always helpful.&nbsp;I have Helpdesk trying to figure it out but they haven't been able to do so yet. This is an issue that&nbsp;has been affecting me at two
 different companies already, there should be a solution to this as most companies use mapped drives and is affecting everyone company wide.&nbsp;Is this something that can be resolved?</p>

    <title>Is it safe to create and&#47;or shrink partitions on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is it safe to create and&#47;or shrink partitions on Windows 8.1 without damaging the recovery files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question that has been eating me, and I'm afraid I might have messed up something on my very own personal computer. So I thought I'd ask for some guidance here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing: I'm a avid supporter of Partitions. They have made things easier for me in the past by allowing me to perform a clean installation of Windows if needed (Previous versions to 8) while keeping all my important data safe in the good ole' Disk
 D. Because of this I created a partition D in my personal laptop, a low budget ASUS that came with Windows 8 and which I later updated to 8.1, as soon as I got it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I don't have my laptop with me, so I can't check this but if I remember well I used a third party software (Partition Wizard) to either reduce the Disk C beyond what the Disk Manager allowed (Around half the total size - 250/500 GB in this case),
 or to merge some other Unallocated Space to the Disk D. Before doing all this I defragmented the disk, and my laptop kept working just fine to this day -that's not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The reason why I'm taking the time to explain all this is because I recently received my new laptop at work, which I'm setting as suits me better, and that includes creating a Partition D to store important files. As happened with my personal laptop
 I could not shrink the Disk C beyond around 50% of the total HDD size (460 GB out of 1 TB in this case). I remind you that before creating partition I defrag the disk, so that shouldn't be an issue.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>As I did with my personal laptop, I was going to use Partition Wizard to make a small Disk C (around 150 GB) and have a much bigger Disk D, but before I did decided to Google why couldn't I use the usual Disk Manager to shrink C to the desired size,
 and at some point I found someone in some Forum saying that </em><strong><em>"Creating partitions in Windows 8 will render the Recovery/Restart options useless"</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This person seemed dead serious and like he was talking from experience, so my question to you is:</strong><em>
<strong>Is this true, by creating a partition and using a third party software to archive a desired size, have I rendered useless the Recovery Options on Windows?</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I don't have a Windows 8 CD, so I'm assuming if anything happens then I depend entirely on what's in that hard drive. What can I do?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rodolfo.</p>

            <p>Use of the manufacturer recovery process, be it the recovery partition or a manufacturer disk set,&nbsp;will wipe out anything that you have changed, data and all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you keep your data backed up regularly to an external hard drive, your data will be protected in the event of OS failure, and more importantly, total disk failure. In this way, you don't need to mess up the way the partitions are now and you will be better
 protected against disaster. :-)</p>

<h2>            Sound Volume settings won&#39;t go below 20&#37; or higher than 70&#37;  HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After restoring my comptuer using Norton Ghost because of this issue, it's happened again after several days and I have no idea why, or how to fix this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The green display for volume will not go below 20% nor higher than 70% using various volume controls.&nbsp; This is verified by going into the Control Panel and looking at the Sound Card settings, and any and all of the Mixer controls accessed via the Entertainment
 Mixer controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of them, regardless of how I attempt to adjust my volume, will not go to zero, nor full to 100%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that I have not visited any websites that would have done anything to my system, though one is not always guaranteed.&nbsp; I also run Avast Antivirus and Malwarebyte Anti-malware constantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue first showed up a couple weeks ago, at which after struggling to set things right I restored my system, and again tonight for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to move the slider below its minimum of 20% is refuses and bounces back.&nbsp; And likewise above 70%.&nbsp; It's like some type of compression thing went on automatically that I did not turn on.&nbsp; Not that I am aware of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody hear of this problem before?&nbsp; How to fix?</p>

            <p>I thought I had discovered a solution.&nbsp; Not sure how or why this worked, or what caused this setting to begin with, but here's what I discovered:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into Windows Media Player and after perusing all the Tool Options, found under the Tab DEVICES, highlighted SPEAKERS, then clicked on PROPERTIES, that the device to use was Default Directsound Device.&nbsp; I changed it to the Creative Audigy Sound Card,
 that I have in my desktop and that seemed to do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, not sure how that changed or if it ever changed to a wrong selection, but by changing it (back) to my Creative Labs Audigy card, fixed the sound volume levels back to 0 and 100%.</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This post is almost a month after the one above.&nbsp; That solution (changing the speaker properties inside Windows Media Player) is not working for me.&nbsp; The problem I originally wrote about, came back again this evening, and the fix I thought I had discovered
 is NOT working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So everybody, if you know why the green level bar can get stuck at 20% to 70% please advise!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how to fix this.</p>

<h2>            Sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've got troubles with my win 10 reinstalled from win 7. When my PC accidentaly turned into sleep mode, i couldn't wake &nbsp;it up. Screen showed me "No video input ... entering sleep mode" and this is occuring even when i turn off and on the PC. So i can't
 get it. Computer runs when i turn it on and keyboard too, it seems that it works just in emergency mode, but there is no access to internet. &nbsp;I tried also recovery point but it didn't help. &nbsp;This problem occured earlier, so few days ago i had to reinstall
 it, but issue is still lasting. I tried some instructions frome discussions, but they didn't help so much (check out drivers, keyboard..). I don't know what to do now and i hope anybody knows how to fix it. Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Jana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help us identify the cause of the issue and then find the proper resolution for it, let us know if you made any significant hardware or software changes on your PC prior to this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, getting the <strong>No video input</strong> error message indicates that the monitor is not receiving any signal from the video card. If there is an onboard video, try using that instead of the video card. If the card is improperly installed, then
 the motherboard will default to the onboard video system. Try to use another monitor. If it doesn't work, then it is possible that the video card is not properly installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated with the results.</p>

<p>hi, thanks for tips,</p>
<p>the issue occured when i pulled out the screen cable from pc while it was still running. I connected it to another pc ,but when i plugged the screen in again, it couldn't leave sleep mode. maybe that was the mistake. before that, computer runned properly
 and i just installed few basic apps, because i recently (week ago) reinstalled it (with creatorss update was no problem). I tried another monitor with same result. My pc has just integrated video card so it might be its wrong &nbsp;installation as you said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. In this case, we suggest that you start the computer in VGA mode. This mode of Windows will allow you to diagnose a computer problem, including video card problems. When VGA mode is loaded, only the minimal video drivers are loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access VGA mode, boot up your computer while pressing the F8 key until you see a screen similar to the below example.<br />

<p>
</p><p>May we know if you have made any software or hardware changes to your device prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, if you're having trouble with a device, you may fix it by updating the driver. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>button + <strong>X</strong>, and select <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click it, and select
<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, feel free to ask us.</p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>Right click on the
<strong>Start orb(Button) </strong>and select <strong>Properties</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under the
<strong>Start Menu </strong>tab click <strong>Customize.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now find
<strong>Sort All Programs menu by name </strong>and click to clear the check mark.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>OK </strong>and then <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>OK </strong>again.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the Start menu, All Programs and drag and drop the folders as you wish to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
