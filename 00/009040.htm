<h2>            Cannot use headers and page numbers together.  After in insert one, the other blanks out entirely</h2>
                    
<p>Was able to do it long ago in the past, it is a requirement for American Psychological Association writing style.</p>
<p>You need a header on the left, parallel to a page number on the right.&nbsp; I can only do one or the other.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that you have Word 2007 -- it's important to say so, because at least in this instance it makes a difference which version you use.</p>
<p>First insert the header on the left, whatever that is. Type one or two tab characters to get to the position where you want the page number. Now this is the important part: Click the Page Number button and choose Current Position --<strong>do not</strong>
 choose Top of Page or any of the other items in the list. Select your desired page number format from the gallery.<strong>Only
</strong>the Current Position selection will insert a page number without deleting everything else in the header.</p>

<p>You don't say but it sounds you are using W2007 and trying to insert one building block on top of another, which&nbsp; means the second one displaces the first.&nbsp; Instead, after you have chosen a building block for the left side of your header and, if necessary,
 typed one or two tabs to place the cursor at the right margin, click <em>page number</em> icon (from either the Insert tab or the Header &amp; footer tools tab) &gt;<em>current position</em> and choose the page number design you prefer.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would confirm with the ISP (provider) that indeed your account settings are correct.&nbsp; If they are then check to see if you have emails stuck in your outbox.&nbsp; If they are I would remove them and then try to send an email again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally make sure all you
 have your updates installed for Office and Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Notes &#43; Recording</h2>
                    Hello, I have Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 for HP and I have been trying to view my notes while doing a recording. I know it is possible because I have seen it work on a Mac with PowerPoint 2013 in which the user simply clicked on Record Slide Show and the
 notes section with the slide were both visible during the recording. I have looked through many forums which have suggested going into presenter mode. Presenter mode allows for viewing of the notes while also looking at the PowerPoint, but does not allow me
 to actually record the content on the slide. I also tried going to Slide Show &gt;&gt; Record Slide Show but then the notes are not visible. I used right click and tried to access presenter mode, but it is grayed out and I can't click on it. Microsoft Team, please
 do not respond with another link as I have looked through all of them. I need a real response that will actually answer my question. Basically, how do I record the slides while looking at my notes????????

            Hi Stew
<br />
<br />Please keep in mind you are running a Windows Insider Preview build not intended for production and can sometimes contain bugs and broken features. I would recommend you file a bug report using the feedback hub and consider downgrading to a released version such as Windows 10 1809.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />Or, you can try resetting Windows 10 to correct the problem. I would have recommended a repair upgrade, but ISO's of the latest build are not available. 
<br />
<br />See if reinstalling all apps helps.
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</code></pre>

</p><p>I am afraid it got a LITTLE WORSE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to one of MS via chat win10 preview agents he advised me to switch off some of the Windows functions and reboot which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the laptop will not start it gives me two sign in options picture and password. Neither work now. And as you can see I am in on my media pc with the same account AND PASSWORD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CANT GET TO MY RECOVERY DISC TO TRY TO REBUILD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>have you any ideas how I can rebuild the laptop?</p>

            Wow, you are on an extremely old Insider Preview build. The Insider Previews at 18312 now. 
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Download the latest available ISO from there.
<br />
<br />After downloading the ISO file, right click it then click Open with &gt; File Explorer
<br />
<br />Launch setup then perform a repair upgrade.
<br />
<br />This should bring up to a recent build. 
<br />
<br />You can then upgrade to Windows 10 build 18312 (as of this writing).       
        </p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>it turned out to be a bad update but I could not recover the system so I created an ISO USB on another pc and had to rebuild it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the it updated and that update was also bad, lost my wifi and connection to internet, some services were not started, and the pc name was changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to rollback and wasted a couple days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is back working now .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I got complacent as I had so many uneventful updates I had not created restore point or recovery USB'S. I have now on all4 pc's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your advice&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seriously thinking of dropping out of the insider programme but that would be sad</p>
<p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am almost back to working after getting an ISO for 1809 I rejoined Insider programme and did some updates, the last of which destroyed the connections to WIFI and Internet than I found the drivers for my printers were lost and I had to download Epson's
 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do want to remain on the insider system but I do think MS have to do a minimum of regression testing before putting a build out to people, I am on the SLOW group in order to get more stable build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have still to rebuild my APPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I became complacent because SO MANY BUILDS were successful for so long (only minor problems)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks once again for your advice.</p>

    <title>When will Defender protect against adware&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikegockel  say:</h3>
<h2>            When will Defender protect against adware&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm&nbsp; being bombarded with adware loaded onto my computer without my permission.&nbsp; I finally bought one of those $30/year third party programs that detects and deletes this malware.&nbsp; It's done a good job so far, but I do worry that it contains other malware.&nbsp;
 I'm not a sophisticated-enough geek to detect that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was so glad when MS provided a security suite that keeps a lot of malware off.&nbsp; MS does not have the built-in conflicts of interests to want to keep malware alive, to protect their business interests.&nbsp; When will Defender or whatever stop these adware attacks?&nbsp;
 Is there another free software package from MS that&nbsp; I can download that will detect and remove adware?&nbsp; I don't like paying for&nbsp;such security software&nbsp;in the first place, and I don't know how to figure out if I should trust a third party that seems to have
 conflict of interest issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>[Update].&nbsp; I reviewed most of the other posts on this topic, which include answers that describe procedures to detect and remove adware.&nbsp; They all state the same thing, that no security program can find all malware.&nbsp; Most of the fixes described&nbsp;require a
 lot of work on my part, and presumably all of us other users who don't want adware.&nbsp; Some procedures look risky for the novice user.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My question is why can't Defender&nbsp;detect, then remove all malware over time?&nbsp; I'd be willing to ignore some adware I got for a while, if I knew a Defender update would&nbsp;someday (soon, I hope)&nbsp;get around to blocking it, and then removing it if it is already
 there.&nbsp; Is that a naïve hope? </p>

            <p>I'm a long-time, happy user of these forums, and understand the limits placed on MVPs.&nbsp; I do expect you to have better access to MS management than the great mass of users,&nbsp;including me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Invoking limitations imposed&nbsp; by lawyers is the last refuge for people trying to avoid more work.&nbsp; However, MS has already decided to move into the area of security for their own selfish best interests.&nbsp; They've gotten their lawyers&nbsp;to determine how MS can
 go into the security business when there are already many players there.&nbsp; I suggest they go a bit further.&nbsp; I hope the message below can be relayed to them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My main objection to adware placed on my computer is that I have to "opt out" rather than "opt in".&nbsp; "Opting out" can be a large expenditure of my time, and&nbsp;has some risk that I'll break something else in the process, or even bring&nbsp;in new malware.&nbsp; Can MS
 set up&nbsp;Windows so that NOTHING can be&nbsp;installed on my computer without asking my permission first?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When&nbsp;I talk to some of my friends about this I get responses like "since I switched to Linux I don't get any of that junk anymore."&nbsp; I hope there is a better, low-labor MS fix to this problem.</p>

            <p>Actually, there is an&nbsp;answer to your question:&nbsp; "Can MS set up&nbsp;Windows so that NOTHING can be&nbsp;installed on my computer without asking my permission first?"</p>
<p>Windows RT is such an operating system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Other than that, no. The onus is on the user to avoid the garbage that gets pushed down to the very wide user base of Windows. Adware typically arrives as sponsorware through installers and updaters for shareware. This junk "supports" or pays for the free
 downloads that people install. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know that I agree with your statement of "selfish best interests." I believe that Microsoft is providing security software with the operating system or as a free download to assist users of the most widely used operating system in the world. As such,
 Windows is the biggest target.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You've probably already seen my recommendations for Windows users:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Besides MSE, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or above (latest released version for your OS) and updated with all patches.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-In Internet Explorer use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-On Vista and later make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>and not running with elevated privileges.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible
 after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-<span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline"><font>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many
 vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</font></span></p>
<p><br />

<p><span><font color="#000000">It is good that the MVPs give us ways to delete unwanted software if we happen to let it in somehow, for the short term.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>Not to sound ungrateful, this kind of action should be reserved for new problems.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>Once they become understood old problems then Defender or some other software from MS should be available to uninstall it with low labor and risks, and to prevent more of that class from coming in.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>For the long term MS should make it difficult if not impossible for third parties to sneak in their "helpful" software.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>I have no idea how Conduit got into my browsers, or how to prevent it from getting in again.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>I have to ask that third party software I bought to delete it every time it reappears.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>The toughest job that MVPs have is also the most essential job.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>Advise MS where they need to change things so that MVP work on that aspect is no longer needed.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>When it comes to malware and all its subsets the MVPs don't have to worry about job security.<span><font>&nbsp;

<p><span><font color="#000000">Speaking of making lawyers nervous, an MS-approved list of security vendors we all can trust not to make things worse would be appreciated.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>Some of that stuff I've tried could be labeled "scare-ware".<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>They tell you about a lot of innocuous things they've discovered when scanning your computer, then offer to remove it periodically for a fee.<span><font>&nbsp;

            <p>As a retired QA-Customer Service guy it is a mistake to blame the customer for being in trouble, even when you have proof that it is all his fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;customer is always right, and if he feels he is being punished unjustly, along with snarky comments,
 he can fix the problem himself by using someone else's product.&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying that a problem is unsolvable is a cop-out.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could at least give some evidence of trying to solve it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In my case, I claim to have been careful, even if not as technically advanced as you MVPs.&nbsp; PA Bear, that backup recovery issue is months old.&nbsp; I don't remember much about it, and I don't really care any more.&nbsp; It is old news.&nbsp; I'd close that item if I could
 figure out how to do so.&nbsp; I'm keeping open the topic of "I expect MS to help me keep adware off my system".&nbsp;&nbsp; Long, involved fix-up procedures are better than nothing, but they shouldn't stop development of&nbsp;fixes that don't need the procedures.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In addition to what others said: download software only from their website (Microsoft products only from Microsoft.com, etc.). I have seen third party websites that force a user to accept offers or software before downloading something.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another thing I like to do is block software by publishers. (hypothetically speaking) I would love a website where I could download certificates, usually bundled with .exe files, and add them to my "untrusted publishers" list.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Although I, too, am against junk software,&nbsp;I fear that if Microsoft were to fight adware (whether it's with antivirus or browser security or UAC) they would end up in some lawsuits of some vendors' sponsors' software not installing, which&nbsp;could be because
 such acts would financially&nbsp;impact the computer industry.</p>

            <p>As a retired Techie I can assure you that there is a technical solution for any problem.&nbsp; Saying the lawyers might not like it is just an excuse to maintain the status quo.&nbsp; The question that needs to be answered is it worth MS's time and money to work with
 their Techies and their lawyers to meet MS's needs?&nbsp;&nbsp; The best solution now is to convert to Linux, which is not in MS's interests.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is a vote from one user that the adware guys are running amok and need some controls imposed on them.&nbsp; Some technical solutions:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Provide little scripts that remove a specific piece of adware.&nbsp; It should be available from&nbsp;an MS site.&nbsp; If&nbsp;MS is&nbsp;willing to post the techniques in long articles to remove software&nbsp;on this website&nbsp;they have already made a decision that something has to
 be done.&nbsp; They don't really evade responsibility by hiding behind MVPs. &nbsp;Make it easy for the novice user to do, not a ten-stop process that involves scary things liking messing with the registry.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Change the o/s to provide one of the warning messages of the type that you see now, with the message "you are being asked to take a step to install software on your computer.&nbsp; Do you want to continue (yes or no)?"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Those third-party sites that offer to download other people's software for you, including MS products, need to be discouraged.&nbsp; They are a source for unwanted, un-needed adware.&nbsp; I'll let some other Techie invent that solution</p>

            Hi James
<br />
<br />You posted your question in the Outlook.com forum which focuses on accessing the account via webmail so with that in mind
<br />
<br />Re: Outlook.com accessed via webmail
<br />
<br />No such option
<br />
<br />Re: Accessing emails in Outlook desktop (any version)
<br />
<br />Also no such option. Assuming that you can't change your existing app, you would need to write a VBA macro against incoming emails, identify messages from that sender and move the first line of the &lt;Body&gt; field to the &lt;Subject&gt; field

<h3> tony and carolynuzelac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails from contacts &#47; safe senders going straight to Deleted folder</h2>
                    <p>I have read several people's posts / replies on this topic, and note the following:</p>
<p>- the emails are from people in my Contacts</p>
<p>- I have also added their emails to my Safe Senders list</p>
<p>- I have previously received emails from these Contacts into my Inbox (in some cases, the day prior!)</p>
<p>- There are no potentially unsafe attachments</p>
<p>- I am not running anti-virus software or anti-spam filter</p>
<p>- I do not have any 'Rules' in place that would send their emails to the Deleted folder</p>
<p>- I have checked my 'Reply to' address and it's my (normal) email address</p>
<p>- I don't access email through a POP3 server</p>
<p>- I don't have an alias</p>
<p>- I don't look at my emails through Windows Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am using Windows 10, however the problem started prior to installing Windows 10. I also access my emails on other devices/PCs that don't use Windows 10 (iOS, Android and Windows 7) but assume this shouldn't make a difference.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Which domain you are using to access live mail? is it live.com/outlook.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest you to check the safe sender in Windows live mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open Windows live mail and click on File from the ribbon tool.</p>
<p>2) Select Options and click on Safety options.</p>
<p>3) Now click on safe sender and check the first option.</p>
<p>4) Also click on options and check High option.</p>
<p>5) Also enable the safe filtering in the live mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply to us with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I access mail at Outlook.com.</p>
<p>When you say, "Windows live mail", do you mean 'Mail' in Windows 10? I have never accessed Mail via the app in Windows 10. However I have now configured it, and there is no 'File' option (as there is no "Ribbon"). I have looked through the "Options", but
 there's nothing labelled "Safety options".</p>
<p>Can you please be more specific about what boxes I need to check, and where I might find them in Windows 10 mail?</p>
<p>However, I would like to add that SOME of the emails that are going straight to my Deleted folder are on my Safe Senders list, and in my Contacts. Some are what I would call 'Junk' - emails I have previously deleted or labelled junk.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Carolyn</p>

<h2>            Wanting to remove the parent &#40;root&#41; domain from the tenant but leave child domains intact.</h2>
                    We have our default domain in our tenant with many child domains. All of these domains were added as "managed" as opposed to federated. We want to take one of the child domains and federate it to use adfs. From what i understand this is not possible without
 federating the parent (root) domain. Unfortunately this action will federate all child domains instead of just the one that we want federated. Since we don't actually use the parent (root) domain for anything, can we remove it from the tenant and then proceed
 to federate the one child domain as planned? What will happen when we remove this root domain?

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>As we need to remove all the sub-domains if we want to remove the root domain, there is no effective way to minimize the impact to the users.</span></p>
<p><span>We need to first change users’ email addresses to another domains and then remove all the addresses with the root and sub-domains.</span></p>
<p><span>After all the sub-domains and root domains are removed, add and verify the sub-domains, then make it federated as instructed below:</span></p>

            <p>Hi Geezbill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, you can't remove a domain that has sub domains associated with it. You need to remove all the sub domains for it first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To federate a sub domain, you need to verify the sub domain first, federate it and then add the top domain.</p>
<p>If the top domain has been verified before the federation, to federate the sub domain, you need to federate the top domain and all the sub domain will be federated as you understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            It can b updated now. Found a round about. Go to <a href="http://www.umnet.com." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.umnet.com.</a> Download opera mini 6 for c3-01 from there. Its without certificate but still download it. Let it stay in the phone's games folder. Now go to m.opera.com. Download the app from there &amp; it will replace the uncertified app to certified app.
 :) the only problem that'll occur is that u'll no longer b able to set mini5 as the go to option.

            Hi Guruprasad,
<div><br />
<div>I did a bunch of trouble shooting and figured out that the issue was not with Office or any of the Mircosoft Technologies.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I use Norton 360 as my anti virus suite and the firewall within Norton had started blocking all traffic to and from the Office Suite of products.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I reset the firewall and everything magically started working again. You may want to check if other users have faced similar issues and work things out with Symantec.</div>
<div><br />
<div>regards,</div>

<p>Thank you for the information.&nbsp; The data is not in Excel.&nbsp; The data is coming from an outside relational database program.&nbsp; I'm hoping I can format the field in Word so that the data doesn't spill over into the next label.&nbsp; Trouble is the size of the data
 varies a lot, and I'd like the font to be as big as possible, since they are going on file folder labels.</p>

            <p>We suggest that you perform the steps below and see if it helps: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Perform <strong>System File Checker</strong> (SFC) scan.
<br />
<br />
<strong>System File Checker</strong> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files, and restore corrupted files. To perform the SFC Scan, you may refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/bd832f07-1420-0c14-d2a5-0a5a24ba40be/using-system-file-checker-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: <strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This will help to eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program. Please see this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            How to Select All Visio Shapes and Changes Line Width in VBA</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to change all the shape's line width&nbsp;on an ActiveWindow in Visio all at once using VBA code ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using a Loop to loop throught all of the objects and it takes a while if you have many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have some shapes that seems to be contained in a larger shape.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I loop, the top level shapes is found, but the lower levels no.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I have to ungroup everything too???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Jet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways on how you can regain access to your Microsoft account. Can you confirm if you already have gone through the steps provided in this link:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12429/microsoft-account-sign-in-cant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">When you can't sign in to your Microsoft account</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, you can still recover your account, however, this would require information that you've mentioned you forgot. Here is the link for the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account recovery form</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above links did not help, I'm afraid it would be the only way on how you can recover your Microsoft account. You would have to create a new

            It is possible that there could be damage to the SIM that the 6085 can't get past but another phone can, does any SIM work in this phone? If the phone is faulty, then with a basic model like this the most you can do is restore factory settings, which I
 suspect will not help in this case. You may have to get the phone repaired by a service centre?<br />
<br />
The only company with the legal authority to changed the lock status of a SIM-locked phone is the network to which it is locked. If the phone was factory-locked, then if the network has lost the code they can apply for it from the manufacturer (only the network
 can do this, manufacturers will never give unlocking information to the public). If Vodafone have given you incorrect codes or instructions how to enter them, and you have made several attempts, then the phone SIM-lock status could itself be locked as they
 only allow so many attempts in case of theft.<br />
<br />
Vodafone are the only people who can legitimately assist you with unlocking your phone.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue is usually caused due to Video card drivers. Once the compatible drivers are available for Windows 10 Technical Preview these issues might get fixed. In this scenario, you have two options one is to wait till the final release of Windows
 10 or else you may contact NVidia support and check if there any drivers available for this or if anyone else has reported the same issue with the NVidia graphics card and fixed the same.</span></p>

<p>What is the problem here?</p>

</p><p>Your anecdotal experience aside, you are not paying for the service (unless you have the paid version called Hotmail Plus/Outlook.com Ad-free).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have around 75,000 posts here, 30,000 on Google, and 10,000 on yahoo so I have seen a few more of the problems than I suspect you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not say Microsoft isn't making money off selling data, I did say the service was free.&nbsp; Information is going to be harvested where ever you go, it is a Huge part of the current internet business model in almost all situations.&nbsp; Thats life on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Outlook.com and didn't use Hotmail.&nbsp; My domains are hosted elsewhere, where the cost is worth the 24/7 US support I get. (GoDaddy.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too like DuckDuckGo in place of the hundreds of millions of useless hits on Google. Getting support can be just as difficult for Bing' (even the webmaster tools) as outlook.com (hence Godaddy)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I think the respectful disagreement is in terminology only.&nbsp; I use the Microsoft services that work and don't where they don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I (and my ilk) work here to help where I can and would kill to get the ability to actually FIX these stupid endless loops, but alas legal issues prevent non Microsoft employees (even those who like me have non disclosure form signed with MS) from accessing
 account information.&nbsp; It is almost as frustrating for us as it is for you</p>

<h3> jcotr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 - Can I shrink the size of my email signature if it&#39;s from a jpg&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried numerous times to create a customized signature on the emails for my non-profit. I create a nice jpg, and import it into the signature box. Then it dutifully shows up on my emails in GIANT size. I just want a normal-sized email signature,
 not one that takes up the whole darn page! I've tried shrinking the original in Word before saving it, saving at lower quality, and probably a couple of other approaches that I have long since forgotten. I've let this slide for a while because I haven't really
 been in full "launch" mode, but now I need something that looks at least somewhat professional. Any ideas?

<p>Hi Jcotr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support. Glad to reply to your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try shrinking the size of the jpg picture via the Paintbrush in Mac (as you posted this case under Mac category) firstly and then save it with the shrinked size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't got the Paintbrush tool on your mac, it is recommended that you download it. Please be noted that we are not allowed to provide any link unrelated to Office 365 for Business online service. So, you may need to contact the Paintbrush tool support
 for dedicated help if you got any concern regarding to this tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>
