<h2>            Windows Live Mail 12</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 and also I have Windows Live Mail 12.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found that I can open Windows Live Mail for quite a number of times, and then suddenly it will just not open.&nbsp; I have tried several times but each time it just does nothing.&nbsp; That is until
 I do a restart.&nbsp; Then it starts working again.&nbsp; This is becoming frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope someone can help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Carole</p>

    <title>Connecting External Hard Drive Forces Xbox to Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Connecting External Hard Drive Forces Xbox to Black Screen</h2>
                    
<p>I've been dealing with black screen issues all day, which led to an occasional white screen with a buzzing beep noise from my tv.<br />
A few hours later I realized that my External Harddrive was causing the xbox to stay in a black screen. Sometimes for over 20 minutes until I shut it down. I can boot the console now and it makes it to dashboard, but any time I connect the External Drive it
 forces the xbox to black screen limbo. When I unplug the External Drive, the xbox goes onto the Green boot up screen, and launches to the dashboard about a minute after.
<br />
<br />
I ran several scans on the External Hard Drive and they all came back Good. No issues whatsoever. (obviously something is up with it, but the tests stated it was in good condition)<br />
<br />
Last night FarCry Primal was meant to launch at midnight digitally for pre order holders. The huge XBL outage caused a lot of people to be unable to play the game at midnight. This led to me attempting to play farcry several times from midnight to 1AM. Each
 time i'd launch it, my external drive would make a reading ticking&nbsp;noise (I had pre installed farcry primal to the external HDD) and never actually let me launch the game. I am unsure if this had any affect on my drive, but it's the only weird thing I can
 recall in the 5 months I've used the thing on my xbox. <br />
<br />
How can I connect my External HDD to my xbox one without it crashing the system? I've tried all of the little power cycle tricks, and am having no luck whatsoever.
<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem, haven't played my xbox in about a week and I turn it on last night and the screen on my TV is just black. It would flash every now and then like it was trying to pick up a signal but nothing. I eventually unplugged everything
 one by one and after I had the external hdd disconnected it booted up fine. I don't remember what hdd I have off the top of my head, but I remember its a 5TB. It was working fine a week ago, not sure if there's been a recent update. I'm pretty positive its
 the HDD though cause when I am at the dashboard and I plug the HDD in the screen turns black after about 15to seconds. Its like the xbox goes into standby? When I uplifting it the xbox goes to the green screen loads up and its fine. Please help Microsoft..
 I've also tried all the different usb ports</p>

<p>I am having the same issue with a WD my book 4tb. I think the hard drives control boards are bad. I took the hard drive to another Xbox one and it causes the same issue. Black screen. Unplug and it goes to boot screen. When I plug it into my laptop it says
 it is ok. This happened after my boy unplugged the hard drive power supply from the wall but left usb cable plugged to the Xbox with Xbox power on.</p>

<p>This just happened to me too. Without the external hdd, my xbox one works fine (sans all my saved games). I plug it in and I lose signal. Unplug it again and the xbox boots up again, even though the console is powered on the whole time. I'm worried it happened
 from getting unplugged like grahams5.</p>

    <title>Using external hard drive for Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using external hard drive for Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    I can't tell from these posts if this question was ever answered.&nbsp; Is it possible to use an external hard drive for the Windows 10 upgrade?&nbsp; There is no way I can free up 8 GB of space on my laptop for the upgrade otherwise.

            Hi Bridget.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />External has not worked for Fall Creators Update Version 1709 that I have seen.  
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />Then for version Upgrades what works best is to install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files. 
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then clean out the Upgrade Assistant and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hello Bridget - 
<br />
<br />This is definitely possible. Microsoft has their own article on how to do just what you ask.

            DO NOT USE AN EXTERNAL DRIVE to perform an upgrade. You will likely end up formatting the entire thing and it does not work for booting. Instead, you can download the ISO file, double click it and start the upgrade instead.
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />
<br />Note: How to Verify If You Downloaded or Installed the Latest Version Windows 10
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />Image
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Starting the Upgrade
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:

<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.

<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1709 or 1703 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<h2>            How do I remove spaces in my gamertag &#63;  &#40;Trying to take advantage of the change gamertag 30&#37; offer&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I tried but I can't change my gamertag. I wanted to get rid of the spaces in my gamertag so that it matches my username on other services like PSN (which does not allow spaces). However when I enter the new edited gamertag without spaces I'm told the new
 gamertag is already in use... (It isn't)</p>
<p>It seems the LIVE service ignores spaces and consider my new gamertag to be identical to the old one, and won't let me change or edit it.</p>
<p>Do I have to pay double and first change my gamertag to some random name, then back to my "old" (now edited) gamertag, or is there some other way of removing the spaces from my gamertag ?</p>

<p>John Smith", "john smith", and "JohnSmith" are all the same gamertag; only one of them could exist. (I've already said that "Trance Demon" exists, which is why you can't have "Trance Demon".) However, if "John Smith" exists and you Search for "JohnSmith"
 or sent it a friend request, it will not match (because of the space difference), so you mistakenly think it doesn't exist. That's why you have to trust the gamertag system when it says you can't have a name, even though you think you've proven to yourself
 that it doesn't already exist.</p>
<p>The gamertag system effectively ignores the spaces in determining if a gamertag is unique. That's all; the fundamental reason is "that's the way the system works".</p>
<p>For one thing, it would be confusing if there were, say, a zillion "Elite Sniper" tags out there (and you know there would be): "EliteSniper", "Elite Sniper","E liteSniper", "E l i t e S n i p e r" - DannoMcK</p>
<p>I thought this answered my same question quite well. </p>

    <title>Automatic Repair loop on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnhinesjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic Repair loop on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I performed a fresh install of 8.1, ran Windows Update to make it current, and updated all the missing drivers. &nbsp;After that, I rebooted, and got the "Automatic Repair" notice. &nbsp;Automatic Repair failed, which then presented me with the two options of "Restart"
 or "Advanced" (Or whatever it's called.) &nbsp;"Restart" just takes me back through the Automatic Repair failure process. &nbsp;If I go the other route, and choose "Continue to Windows 8.1" it will eventually boot to the desktop after two or three times through the
 loop. &nbsp;But, if I have to restart for any reason, it goes back through the Automatic Repair process, which of course fails. &nbsp;And repeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The log file indicates that tcpip.sys is corrupt. &nbsp;I've tried Refresh (fails). &nbsp;I've tried Restore (doesn't help). &nbsp;And, I've tried reinstalling Windows from bare metal, which ends up right back in this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another option or a next step I can try? &nbsp;I am reluctant to reinstall Windows yet again, as I've already rebuilt this PC 4 times. &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi John ,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your response. Since your computer doesn’t open in safe mode and your start up repair is not working, I suspect that malware has
 modified this file “tcpip.sys”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tcpip.sys is one of the basic components for Windows which is nothing but Windows TCP/IP driver.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Procedure 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>First of all I would request you to check if you are able to boot to the desktop using “Continue to Windows 8.1”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are able to do so then download latest network adaptor drivers from computer manufacturer website and check if that helps</span></p>
<p><strong>Procedure 2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are able to connect to internet then then go for a complete virus scan of your system with your anti-virus program or you can do it with:-</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by
 deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss. </span>
</p>
<p><strong><span>Procedure 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you are not able to boot to the desktop then you can boot your computer in WinRE mode by inserting the Windows 8.1 disc</span></p>
<p><span>Then select Command Prompt (cmd).</span></p>
<p><span>Now once you see the cmd prompt lets
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 68, 68, 1)">run a scan for malware, cleaning your hard drive using

<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (note, there is a space between <strong>sfc </strong>
and <strong>/scannow</strong>)[Note:- you can also do this if you are able to boot to the desktop,and run cmd as administrator]</p>

            <p>Hi John Hines Jr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand how it is when you are stuck in a restart and repair loop. But before I proceed with my troubleshooting steps I would like to know a few things about your current system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better understanding on the issue that you are facing with the newly installed windows 8.1 on your system, I want you to provide me with these basic information. Such as:-</p>
<p>1. Does your computer open in safe mode?</p>
<p>If you haven’t tried booting to safe mode then you can refer to the link below in order to boot your computer in Safe Mode With Networking.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Do you have a disc or your have done the clean installation with bootable flash drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform Automatic Repair using the Windows 8.1 Installation Media and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to perform Automatic Repair using Installation Media:</p>
<p>a. Boot the computer using the Windows Installation Media such as DVD or USB.</p>
<p>b. On the ‘<strong>Windows Setup</strong>’ wizard click on ‘<strong>Next</strong>’ and click on ‘<strong>Repair your computer</strong>’.</p>
<p>c. You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose.</p>
<p>d. Click on ‘<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>’ then click on ‘<strong>Advanced Option</strong>’ and then click on ‘<strong>Automatic Repair</strong>’ and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That’s all I need for now, please let me know after you either performed the above mentioned operations or the information in relevance to my questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad &amp; up there to assist you further.</p>

                    I bought a laptop last month with Vista already installed, got the free upgrade to Windows 7 and installed it.&nbsp; Now I seem to have a graphics problem. After being on the computer for a while, some of the words and numbers&nbsp;are going blurry, they have lines
 going through them, making it impossible to read them.&nbsp; This is happening in my spider solitaire game that came with windows, and also my games from BigFish, and Spintop.&nbsp; I have downloaded all the updates for drivers etc, and tried lots of the ideas posted

            The fact that the problems occur after the computer has been on for some amount of time indicates that your laptop is overheating. This could be a straight issue of hardware failure or it could be that you haven't installed the power management software
 for your laptop that would enable the operating system to manage the fan properly. Since you say you've downloaded all applicable Windows 7 drivers and laptop-specific software, I'd look to the hardware. Since this is a laptop you can't test by swapping out
 the video card but you can try booting with a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu. Run in Linux for a while and if the same issues occur, you will know it isn't a software problem and can contact the laptop mftr.'s tech support.

    <title>Surface Book&#58; Buyer Beware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joelr.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book&#58;  Buyer Beware</h2>
                    <p>Dear Readers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Book Experience: &nbsp;I'm currently on my third Microsoft Surface Book. &nbsp;I initially paid the premium price for a Surface Book with the expectation of quality and reliability of their product. &nbsp;The first Surface Book was defective out of the box,
 with a horizontal line across the display caused by a dead pixel row (or series of rows). &nbsp;It was replaced by the retail vendor. &nbsp;Not an issue. &nbsp;The second Surface Book has been nothing but problems. &nbsp;I've owned approximately ten computers in my life, and
 this is by far the most expensive, dysfunctional and frustrating one. &nbsp;The hardware and software glitches were numerous. &nbsp;The keyboard had a very sticky left shift key. &nbsp;Thinking...not happy, but ok, maybe that will work itself out. &nbsp;Upon further use, it seemed
 as though this Microsoft Surface Book was incompatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;The irony. &nbsp;It wouldn't communicate properly with my wireless printer, looping the print queue of completed print jobs so that the printer could not print the next job. &nbsp;Reloaded drivers,
 no problem resolution. &nbsp;I eventually had to buy a new printer. &nbsp;The computer's audio driver could not recognize the difference between earbuds plugged into the jack, wireless earbuds, wireless external speaker or just plain old Surface Book internal speakers.
 &nbsp;For the computer to recognize the audio output, I had to restart the computer for it to work....sometimes. &nbsp;When detaching the tablet from the keyboard, and then trying to reattach, the computer recycled over and over is if there was a loose connection or
 something, so I didn't again use that distinguishing computer feature, fearing that it would never work as a laptop, only as a very expensive tablet. &nbsp;This occurred about a month after initial use. &nbsp;Eventually I got fed up with that frustration, and contacted
 Microsoft's technical support. &nbsp;Even after their technician took remote control of my computer and attempted to resolve the existing issues, the issues persisted. &nbsp;Eventually Microsoft was convinced to honor their warranty agreement and replace the dysfunctional
 Surface Book with a replacement computer. &nbsp;As you can likely empathize, it's a serious inconvenience to set up a new computer, reload applications and such and would rather avoid that process by buying a quality computer in the first place. Uh, refer to the
 beginning of this rant. When the replacement computer arrived, it was a "refurbished" rather than new Surface Book. &nbsp;I contacted a technical representative once again with questions such as: &nbsp;What is the history of this refurbished replacement computer and
 the status of the battery? &nbsp;You see, considering my prior experience with quality and reliability of the Microsoft Surface Book, I was a bit concerned about a refurbished unit. &nbsp;I was referred to the warranty agreement that stated replacement computers may
 be new or refurbished. &nbsp;The technician could not answer my questions, other than "the refurbished unit has been tested for quality and functionality." &nbsp;When I inquired about purchase refund for the Surface Book based upon my experience, I was referred to the
 retail vendor. &nbsp;Microsoft knows that the retail vendor will not refund the purchase of a product having a different serial number (the refurbished replacement computer). &nbsp;The technical representative implied there was no refund mechanism through Microsoft.
 &nbsp;In a nutshell, Microsoft has stuck me with an unsatisfactory experience, product, and no opportunity for refund. Am I expecting too much? &nbsp;Buyer Beware. &nbsp;It is certain my next computer will be an Apple product. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#38; HYPERLINK prefix - Wild Link Replication in Wordpad Documents&#33;</h2>

</p><p>Occassionally, I sometimes use Wordpad just for copy &amp; paste links from articles and to link to other docs. on my comp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then this; &nbsp; &amp; HYPERLINK &nbsp; - is put infront&nbsp; as Prefix to my original link ( Ex. file://C:/Etc/Dokument &amp; Artiklar/document.pdf ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I save my Wordpad doc. and reopen it again the link look like have gone wild and crazy, like this;</p>
<p>
</p><p>file://C:/Etc/Dokument&nbsp; HYPERLINK "<span>file://C:/Etc/Dokument &amp; Artiklar/document.pdf&nbsp;</span>"&amp; HYPERLINK "<span>file://C:/Etc/Dokument &amp; Artiklar/document.pdf&nbsp;</span>"

<p>
</p><p>It is like it self replicates over and over every time I save the file and I find it to fill the whole page/file !&nbsp; The file takes ages to open it up and seems to put heavy work on the CPU.&nbsp; This happens even if am not connected to the network.</p>

<p>&nbsp; In my case it seems to relate to edge, when I paste links / URLs (HP forum webdocs.) into Wordpad.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried out and saved in different file formats and the problem occurs with .docx and .odt formats not with .rtf ( I have read some notes and&nbsp; seen comments many blame .rtf to be unsecure ? ). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, an URL that is about four lines, when I open the file again (.odt or .docx ) the URL has replicated and could now be 20 lines long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this happens even if I closed the internet conn. and just copy the links into another .odt or .docx file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The peculiar suffix/prefix part that is scattered through out within the URL is;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&amp; HYPERLINK"...&nbsp; or </p>
<p>HYPERLINK "url" &amp;....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The URL seem to replicate it self in a exponentional order and each time it put more load on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this mean it is somewhat unsecure to copy &amp; paste links with Edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another surprise with edge… to drag and drop a link into a doc. one of the most obvious thing you do is just not there, is there a fix ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also W10 seems to reconfigure it self after every updates;&nbsp; even if the settings is set to not allow any background apps or to sync. or allow the location setting… is there a hard coded way instead of flip flopp the switches in W10 severy
 time an update happens… it just ridiculous.&nbsp; It was alot of concern about java applets in browers or java JVM… well now we have no control over apps running behind the scene in W10, and they are not only running local they are running from everywhere.&nbsp; So
 is there a more hard coded way to configure the system from the shell instead ?&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Idle reboot and LogonUI.exe error 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glennbruce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Idle reboot and LogonUI.exe error 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I now have two problems. First, my PC reboots on its own if left idle - usually in about 15 minutes, it seems. It closes all open programs and reboots. I have tried everything I have found online, but nothing has resolved this.<br />
</p>
<p>If I choose "Sleep," the computer won't reboot - for a longer period of time. But at some point it awakens and reboots on its own. I have no idea how long this is, usually in the night, or during a few hours away. The newest problem is that now when it does
 that, I get an error message in a box. It starts with: "LogonUI.exe Application Error. The instruction at 0x00007FFFF4C6E7AB5 referenced memory at..." And it ends with "The required data was not placed into memory because of an I/O error status of 0xc0000000e."
 It them reads "Click OK to terminate this program."</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the "OK" button doesn't work. The arrow-cursor moves around, but clicking does nothing. However, if I hit the space-bar, the screen goes black. The PC sounds like it's trying to do something, but nothing happens. If I cold boot, the message is gone and
 I can continue as usual - until I leave it idle and it reboots on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I could find, including "sfc scannow" which ran fine. But at the end it said, "errors found" but also something about not being able to fix them "offline." ****? Go through all that and get such a stupid message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent two weeks trying to fix these problems from Microsoft answer sites. I have used CCleaner, Glary, WseRegistry, MalWareByte, and Avast. I have done two boot-time scans, memory searches, et al. I have changed my power options several times. Nothing
 works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 lid issue- not closing properly</h2>
                    I recently bought a Surface Book 2 in April 2018. I am facing a problem where the lid will not close properly and will detach automatically without any force. It will not stick to its base and there is a slight space left when it closes. I have taken care
 of this laptop and haven't dropped it at all. The lid is never closed completely and it is a problem. I am not able to visit amy store right now because I am in India till September. Please help me.

<p>Hi RatulJain,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's check for possible issues with the connectors by performing the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug your Surface and detach the Cover.</li><li>Wet a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol (use 95% or stronger isopropyl alcohol if possible). Rub the cotton swab back and forth over the six circular magnets on the Type Cover's connector. After you're done, make sure the pins are dry and that no cotton
 fibers remain on the connector. Then clean the connector on your Surface.</li><li>Reattach the Cover, making sure that all the magnets touch the bottom edge of your Surface.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, check the hinges of the Surface. If there is a problem with the hinge, the lid may not stick to the keyboard when closed. Also, look for any parts of the base that may prevent the lid to not fully touch the keyboard. If you need further help,
 please contact our <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Global Customer Service</a></strong> for India.</p>

<p>As of now, this strange application isn't doing anything that I know about... but I can't find enough information to even know what it's supposed to do and why it's in my Volume Mixer. It doesn't appear to be making any noise whatsoever, so it's pretty suspect.
 I suspect it's a Rogue, but I can't tell. Usually there's some kind of documentation on these things and I can't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I made any changes? I don't inspect my&nbsp;Volume Mixer often enough to know when it started. There's no evidence of this application or applet on my computer so I have no information to go on. But it's there. Recently, the only drivers I have installed
 were for a Bluetooth Amplifier TEAC AI-101, but I have no idea if this item was there before, or how long it might have been.</p>

<p>Okay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As usual, I can't believe that Microsoft themselves don't even know their own apps, plus that they insist on giving them confusing names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the next person who asks this question, "Shell Input Application" = "Touchscreen Keyboard".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason it never makes any noise is because I almost never use it on a 27" AIO, and it only creates an item in Volume Mixer when I actually use it, so that's why it's not always there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clearly not a problem, and these lame steps suggested by "Moderator" don't really show any effort in understanding. Obviously, starting in safe mode isn't going to have any effect in identifying a Touch Keyboard application. Even if I start it in Safe
 Mode, how is that going to help me identify an application that is supposed to be there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway....&nbsp;this reminds me of all those first level support techs who ask you if you've tried re-booting your computer when that was the first thing you told them that's not working when they answered the phone.</p>

<h2>            Transfer from and close unused account</h2>
                    My son has two accounts and one was supposed to be closed when I contacted Microsoft to turn his new account into a child one as he had it as an adult. I did not realise it was still there and when I just put money on his account this morning I have put
 it into the unused account instead of the used one. I need this money transferred to the used account and other closed.

<p>I think you mean to buy what he wants as a gift for the other account. You can't buy a gift card with funds on the account. That won't work with everything on Live, but it could help.</p>

    <title>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sami_darkangel  say:</h3>
<h2>            The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to install Windows 10 on my RV511 running Windows 8.1 (Pro) since last night. But every time my laptop restarts after "Your PC will restart in a few moments", it gets stuck in the Windows logo (with no loading animation at the bottom). The
 only way to recover from this is to manually turn off my laptop and then turn it back on. Upon doing this, I get this message after logging in:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
We couldn't install Windows 10<br />
We've set your PC back to the way it was right before you started installing Windows 10.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>0xC1900101 - 0x20017</strong><br />
<strong>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the md5 checksum of the iso file and it checks out. I have also tried doing what others said in this forum (for example this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_install/the-installation-failed-in-the-safeos-phase-with/42173449-891e-48df-bbbd-33e2c835f516">
one</a>) but nothing seems to work for me. Right now I'm using a freshly installed copy of Windows 8.1 and so, there are no extra software (or apps) installed and I've also turned off Windows Defender.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing. I have disabled automatic updates and I always skip downloading and installing updates during setup because I have a poor Internet connection. Could that be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, my "<strong>setuperr</strong>" file&nbsp;is empty. So, is there any (other) way to find out what is causing Windows 10 to not install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My RV511's specs are: Intel Core i3-380M clocked at 2.53 GHz, 5.8 GB RAM, 298 GB HDD (109 GB free in C drive) and Intel GMA HD Graphics (so, no "real" graphics card). As I said earlier, I just did a clean installation of Windows 8.1, so there are no 'extra'
 drivers or programs installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The name of&nbsp;the downloaded iso file is:</p>
<p><strong>10240.16384.1507091700</strong>.TH1_CLIENTENTERPRISE_VOL_X64FRE_EN-US.iso</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really eager to use Windows 10 and I have stopped all my work and projects for this. If anyone can please help me out, it will be greatly appreciated! If there is any more info you need to know, then please tell me. Thank you!</p>

<p>Oh my. I have a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the SAME Gigabyte BRIX. A GB-BXi3-4010. That has an Intel i3 4010U CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything. A completely clean install with an ISO I took from my MSDN account. It simply would. not. boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disabling everything in the BIOS. CSM, EFI, Secure Boot, LAN, Audio, ErP, RAID/AHCI. Everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the WiFi card, I removed the drive I wanted to install it to....Nothing.</p>

</p><p>I tried installing 8.1 and doing an Upgrade. That would fail with "The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation 0xC1900101 - 0x20017". There were no logs, because apparently this is too early in the boot process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using NTLite to open up boot.wim and install.wim to insert all the latest drivers and tell the install to HALT on any BSODs....but still nothing...just a boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I found this thread: http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/373250-recent-windows-update-kb3064209-causes-windows-7-not-boot.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bunch of people complaining about their PCs going into a boot loop because of KB3064209.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB3064209 ...is an Intel CPU microcode update. It updates the file C:\Windows\system32\mcupdate_genuineintel.dll. This file runs at boot to update the microcode on your CPU to the latest before Windows fully initializes (I think).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was released in June 2015. This explains why Windows 10 builds BEFORE this date are unaffected and those after, boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and took my USB drive, copied the contents of the Windows 10 10240 ISO to it...then I tried editing the WIM files to remove the mcupdate_genuineintel.dll. It
<strong>&lt;Removed Profanity&gt;</strong> works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A brief overview of how to get this working:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Assume your USB drive is X: and your OS drive is C: and your user profile name is "User"</em></p>
<p>a) Copy the contents of the Windows 10 ISO to a USB stick X:</p>
<p>b) Open up an elevated command prompt (cmd)</p>
<p>c) Create a temporary folder on your Desktop (C:\Users\User\Desktop), call it "mount"</p>
<p>d) Mount and edit a WIM (Image file: boot.wim, Index 1):</p>
<p>d-1) dism /Mount-Image /ImageFile:X:\sources\boot.wim /index:1 /MountDir:C:\Users\User\Desktop\mount</p>
<p>d-2) In Windows Explorer, browse to&nbsp; C:\Users\User\Desktop\mount\Windows\System32\mcupdate_GenuineIntel.dll and Right-click &gt; Properties</p>
<p>d-3) Click "Security" Tab, Advanced, then "Change" the Owner to your own user account. Click OK, OK again.</p>
<p>d-4) On the Security tab, Click "Edit" then "Add" and add your user account with Full Control checked. Click OK back to Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>d-5) Now, delete mcupdate_GenuineIntel.dll</p>
<p>d-6) Close off all Explorer Windows, go back to DISM and unmount the image with: dism /Unmount-Image /MountDir:C:\Users\User\Desktop\mount /commit</p>
<p>e) Now, you have to repeat D1 through 6 for: </p>
<p>boot.wim with /index:2 (WinPE Environment)</p>
<p>install.wim /index:1 (Windows install, Pro/Enterprise I think)</p>
<p>install.wim /index:2 (Another Windows install, might be a different edition: e.g. Home on a Pro/Home ISO)</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: boot.wim with /index:1 (Recovery Environment) </p>
<p>
</p><p>f) Remove USB and boot the installer. Delete the mount folder on your Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ridiculous. How did this even get through? It is completely preventing some CPUs from installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I don't really think you should do this...because once another Windows Update comes around that touches this file...things might not end well for your install. Who knows.</p>

<h2>            Skype 8.16.0.4 Clear &#34;People you may know&#34; list</h2>
                    <p>The "<strong><em>People you may know</em></strong>" list includes <strong><em>removed</em></strong>,
<em><strong>irrelevant </strong></em>and <strong><em>inappropriate </em></strong>contacts.
<br />
<br />
We need the option to clear it, or switch it off completely.<br />

Forum responses thus far have either played down the issue or recommended downgrading to classic - No, that's not the answer we're looking for.</p>

            Hi Naing Min Oo,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
