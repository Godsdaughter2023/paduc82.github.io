            Having same problem. &nbsp;Since iPhone update data does not transfer to app, when it does it does not match. The Bluetooth works as I get phone calendar and text message notifications. It will synchronize if I forget device and re-pair. &nbsp;Although numbers don't

I have seen reports that MS will NOT be introducing a Band 3. &nbsp;This may explain the lack of effort to fix this issue. &nbsp;It is a shame since the Band has features that many of the competitors do not. &nbsp;Samsungs's Gear Fit 2 recently added iOS support and is the
 most similar product to the Band. &nbsp;I will be getting one soon.

            Garmin seems more Fitbit-like. &nbsp;But that is a superficial assessment.

<h2>            Nokia 6300 unlocking&#47;firmware and other questions</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've bought a phone Nokia 6300 locked in Orange network. I went to a GSM shop and they unlocked my phone.<br />
On the net I read that based on IMEI code they find the unlocking code but instead they have opened my phone and "read" something with a device. What kind of method is that ? Is it better ?<br />
<br />
How can I check if it's completly unlocked ?<br />
<br />
Also, if the software from the phone will be erased and written a new one, a newer firmware version, there the phone will be still locked ? Where is that locking feature ? Isn't like the motheboard bios when you flash a new one everything is changed ?<br />
<br />
I saw on Nokia web site that I can update the firmware. The phone camed with 5.00 firmware customized by Orange, if I'll update to 5.50 which is on Nokia website, the customized Orange software will be erased ? Or should I go again to that GSM shop to erase
 the phone and write the new software with that devices ?<br />
<br />
That's all for now,<br />
Thanks if anyone can answer my questions.

            If you have had the phone unlocked by any other means than obtaining the restriction code from Orange, then this is work carried out by somebody who is not an authorised Nokia technician, so you may have invalidated the warranty.<br />
<br />
Irrespective of the removal of the SIM-lock, the firmware version is based on the phone's product code which in your case will be a product code relating to Orange-version firmware, so you will get the latest version available for that phone and it will still
 be Orange-branded.

            But how is doing this unlocking ?<br />
Where is that locking based and what is happening when the unlocking is applied ? I want a more technical explanation.

            The phones original SIM lock status is dictated by the IMEI but the lock info is stored in addition to the IMEI. It can be read by "reading" the correct memory location and until recently no one had cracked the security around "writing" to that location.
 The phones warranty has been "officialy" voided by disabling the SIM lock status by another means other than the operator unlock code. However unless the service centre who flashes new firmware into it, actual looks for the status it wont affect the update
 process. If the phone ever goes for L4 repair then the original SIM lock status will be activated assuming the actually repair it under warranty, which they may not!

                    Why is my computer going "in" and "out" on windows and outlook?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
This is a continual problem and it has to be a CenturyLink problem as it shows that my computer is not staying connected to CenturyLink on CenturyLink1512 as I am wired into the internet by cable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a wireless Dell Laptop and have no issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
 has been going on for months and has to get corrected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Geek Squad at the local Best Buy has stated that this is a continual issue with CenturyLink and that I need to find a new network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Dell computers are new computers with the Dell Desktop
 only being a couple months old as Best Buy replaced the desktop thinking it was a faulty computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS MUST GET HANDLED IMMEDIATELY.

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Windows has supported this feature for some time, Windows 10 is the first time we see multiple desktops as a mainstream feature. In the Windows 10 Technical Preview, you can add unlimited number of virtual desktops quickly and easily.&nbsp;With Virtual
 desktops, you could switch to the second or third desktop, and have a completely different view. The open applications and folders from the first desktop are not shown on the second or third. This gives the user a very clean way to multitask between different
 kinds of tasks.</p>
<p>For example, a user can open all browsing related tasks or programs on Desktop 1 and do all graphic related designs on Desktop 2 and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Feedback is really valuable, please use the Feedback App on WIndows 10 Technical preview to give us feedback.</p>

<p>Windows sometimes "forgets" that Office has been activated, so you have to reactivate it. First thing to try is repairing it:</p>
<span>Repair or remove Office 2010 -</span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx?CTT=1</span></a>
<p>If that doesn't work, try reactivating it by following the prompt to enter the product key.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, run the application as adminsitrator and try to activate it again.</p>

<span><span><span>Run As Admin</span></span></span>
<p><span><span><span>Your problem is with the registry. There is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>What you need to do is "runas admin".</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>In the start menu, right click on the shortcut for any Office app, select “RunAs Admin”<br />
If runas does not appear, right click and drag the shortcut to the desktop </span>

<p><span><span><span>Activate the application/office:</span></span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Jack,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Insider Preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to use the SD card reader while using the latest build.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue you have reported usually occurs if the driver installed for SD card are not installed properly or the drivers are not compatible with the Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While checking the Lenovo’s website for the drivers, I wasn’t able to find the drivers for Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to install the drivers in compatibility mode for your device by downloading the drivers from the link below and see if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/desktops-and-all-in-ones/ideacentre-a-series-all-in-ones/ideacentre-a720?tabName=Downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/desktops-and-all-in-ones/ideacentre-a-series-all-in-ones/ideacentre-a720?tabName=Downloads</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To install the drivers in compatibility mode, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Right click</span></strong><span> on the setup file of the driver&nbsp;and select
<strong>Properties</strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Compatibility Tab</strong></span></li><li><span>Place a check mark next to Run this program in Compatibility mode and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list</span></li><li><span>Click OK and run the setup.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps, do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</span></p>

    <title>Macro to delete pages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> schenkler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro to delete pages</h2>
                    Hello Macro Universe! I have a tough challenge for you!<br />
In my documents (that can be thousands of pages long) I usually have lots of pages that only have a title to them and no other information (besides header and footer). This usually constitutes as one paragraph for the page. I would like to delete all of these
 "blank" pages based on the paragraph number. Is there any way to do such a thing? If there is a better way of deleting the pages through macros, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!<br />

            Word, on its own, does not really recognize pages as a structure. It divides text into pages in conjunction with a particular printer driver, it does this on the fly.<br />
<br />
Your question seems to imply that you are using something like a page-break-before formatting in a heading paragraph.<br />
<br />
Does each page begin with a particular heading style? That would be the "title" you mention.<br />
<br />
Are you using manual page breaks? (Bad idea usually.)<br />
<br />
Are you using section breaks?<br />
<br />
How are the paragraphs you refer to numbered? Is this part of the style?<br />
<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Each page does not start with a particular heading style. I have sections separated by breaks, but each section can be as many pages as need be.<br />
<br />
I have different sections in my document, and each one is separated by a page break. I could make it into a section break without any issue.<br />
<br />
My paragraphs aren't numbered. I basically have the title of the section, followed by any tables, pictures, or paragraphs that belong to the section.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            So, how would you propose giving paragraph numbers to a macro?<br />
<br />
I think you will spend more time trying to write your macro than simply selecting and deleting pages. How many thousand-page documents are we talking about?<br />
<br />
I would suggest applying a particular style to your titles, not for macro purposes, but as general formatting.<br />

            In principle, a macro could search for formatting (assuming that headings are consistently formatted), go to that page, select all content,&nbsp;and delete it. However, based on your description, some headings may be followed by one or more pages, which makes
 the task more complicated.

<h2>            Different Headers and Footers for each Chapter</h2>
                    Hello, I would like to use Chapter names as the header on each page of my 700 page document but I am having trouble achieving this.&nbsp; How do I modify the header for particular sections of the document?&nbsp; I may wish to do the same for the footer too.<br />
Thank you<br />

            <p>Theoretically, in order to change the content of the header and/or footer, you need to insert section breaks between chapters, and in fact you may well want to do this because you may want to omit the header on the first page of each chapter (which you do
 by enabling "Different First Page" and then leaving the First Page Header empty), but you can obviate the necessity for section breaks entirely or, even if you do include section breaks, obviate the necessity to unlink headers, by using a StyleRef field in
 the header to pick up the chapter title.</p>

Sections / Headers and Footers in Microsoft Word 2007-2013</a>. This is really the reason the StyleRef field was created, I suspect.<br />
<br />
While you can have different headers and footers for each chapter, the StyleRef field lets you look like they are different for each section, or even each page with only one header/footer.<br />

            Hello. No, it is not possible to upgrade just the IE since the IE is integrated in the OS ROM. So you would have to upgrade the OS but you have the current (last) 6.5 version.&nbsp;

<p>I am having the same issue, but none of the solutions are working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system was initially boot looping at "Preparing automatic repair" I tried to go into advanced startup with power + volume down on my Surface Pro 4 but the system would BSOD after putting in the proper bitlocker recovery key with the same error people
 are<br />
getting here (Pagefault/volsnap.sys) I then tried using a USB recovery drive, which was able to get passed the bitlocker recovery key, and copy the volsnap.sys file from the windows.old directory to the system drives system32\driver folder...But, I continue<br />
getting the volsnap.sys BSOD.</p>
<br />
<p>It also fails when trying to restore a previous version of windows.<br />
</p>
<p>The only difference now is the system is booting straight to the bitlocker recovery key page instead of bootlooping on attempting automatic repair. It still BSODs after entering the key though.<br />
</p>
<span>I even tried a system restore back to before the update, but it didn't help either.</span>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I finally fixed this problem. I had to decrypt the drive via a recovery stick, and then copy the volsnap.sys file over. The command to do so is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">manage-bde -off C:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take a long time, to check the status type manage-bde -status , when it is done copy the file over and reboot.</p>

<h2>            Office for Android cannot open onedrive files</h2>
                    <p>I have office for android in an LG G3 with Android 4.4.4 and my Onedrive files are not showing.</p>
<p>It has a button "Add a place" but it only shows "OneDrive", "OneDrive for business", Sharepoint, and "Dropbox".</p>
<p>When I choose "OneDrive" the app crash and restarts and documents still not showing.</p>
<p>If I choose OneDrive for business it says something like "Use your organization Account"</p>
<p>If I choose Dropbox I can login but when I try to access or list files the app crashes again.</p>
<p>I tried resetting the app, deleting app data, and reinstalled the app a few times. Nothing worked.</p>
<p>Any Ideas?</p>

                    <p>Hi, I'm a VA, and keep receiving my manager's calendar invitations instead of her.</p>
<p>How do we fix this so they go to her for approval, instead of my assistant account?</p>

<p>Hi Assistantftd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that you’re a Delegation of your manager. In Office 365, there’re two options for meeting requests sending to your Manager:</p>
<p>1. My delegates only, but send a copy of meeting requests and responses to me</p>
<p>2. My delegates only</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you reference the link: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-another-person-s-mail-and-calendar-items-afb79d6b-2967-43b9-a944-a6b953190af5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: althoug the article is for Outlook for Windows. The permission is the same no matter the mail clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the permission to #1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But if there’s no need for you to accept the meeting request, you can remove the Delegation permission form yourself. Instead, grant yourself the Review permission.

                    <p>Every since I installed the new build (10041)&nbsp; the audio is completely distorted.&nbsp; Seems that the Bass is set to the highest level, which makes watching tv or anything with voice not understandable.&nbsp; When I go to try an adjust it, it shows me the Maxx Audio3

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials for Antivirus&#47;Malware&#47;Spyware protection</h2>
                    one of my friend recommended the use of Microsoft Security Essentials for Antivirus/Malware/Spyware protection, all these years I have been using NOD32 Antivirus 4, but since the licence got expired and I had to renew it, my friend recommended this programme.
<div>
<p>I just wanted to check with you as to how good is this programme, will it really protect my PC or should I renew NOD32 for protection.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are both good choices. Personally, I prefer NOD32, but if you want to save money, you can stick with Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, the term "malware" means MALicious softWARE. It is not a class by itself; viruses and spyware are both kinds of malware. Both&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials &nbsp;and NOD32 are more anti-virus programs than anti-spyware, and it would be a good idea
 to also run a good anti-spyware program . I recommend the free MalwareBytes AntiMalware.</p>

<h2>            hard disk change</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>yesterday I changed the hard disk. The default is completly bullsheet.</p>
<p>I bought 64Gb SSD KingSpec 1.8". Excellent result.</p>
<p>Very Fast. Windows 7 pro only takes 8 seconds to start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the link to buy it is: <a href="http://www.memoryc.com/products/description/64GB_KingSpec_1_8-MicroSATA_SSD_Solid_State_Disk-MLC_/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.memoryc.com/products/description/64GB_KingSpec_1_8-MicroSATA_SSD_Solid_State_Disk-MLC_/index.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know, 64Gb maybe is not many memory, but for me it's enough and the usage of the booklet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it's fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the other hard, I bought a Class 10 SDHC card, to use as ReadyBoost :smileywink:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is for the default "block size" format for that unit: 4096 bytes.</p>
<p>If you format for 64Kbytes I have worst results.</p>
<p>For a 512 bytes block size format I obtain this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, under my opinion, you must format the unit according your needs, if you will put big files or small ones.</p>
<p>The drive will work in same conditions...</p>

<p>I'm getting into this. Looked for a microsata SSD and the best I found was the 32Gb KingSpec (and the 128, but a little bit out of budget).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the other hand I was wondering about the capacity for the SD Class 10 card... I've heard that since nokia booklet only has 1 Gb RAM anything more than 4Gb for ReadyBoost is a waste of money. Is this true?</p>

<p>As I understand it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4gb readyboost limit was a function of the formatting supported. Windows 7 supports exFAt and removes the 4 GB file limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Readyboost puts files that your computer would normally read from the harddrive to a medium (usb drive/ sd card) with higher read/write speeds than your HDD. That speeds up the time it takes to start up and run certain programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The performance boost from Readyboost is not directly related to CPU or the amount of RAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 16 GB ready boost file means that only 16 GBs of program files can be read by the CPU from the harddrive at the faster read/write speeds. A SDD with fast read/write speeds will mean that all files can be read faster and that will result in a significant
 performance boost.&nbsp;</p>

            Then, definitely is absurd to use a SD card with ReadyBoost having also an SSD drive with fast r/w like kingspec or intel ones...

<p>I just wanted to say, that anyone, who is deploying SSD in their Booklet should keep in mind a fact, that accordingly to an SSD specs, this kind of drives have much more shorter write/re-write cycles, than an HDD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I usually use my desktop PC as a data storage. I keep my media and important data files there and don't use to do much of daily write/re-write operations: just a few movements when I'm working in OS for paging operations and writing down some lovely media
 to keep it for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I use my laptop a completely different way - there's a whole "movement universe": endless file migrations, gigs of write/erase/re-write operations on disk during a day, copying and transferring files from and to peripheral devices, work and home usage.
 We have only 1 Gb of RAM in Booklet, so swapping operations is a normal thing to happen daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, a mobile device is much more vulnerable to static electricity and electro-magnetic fields, than a desktop PC, which in fact is grounded. But when a mobile PC, such as Booklet 3G become to own an SSD drive, that is very sensitive for this kind of
 surroundings - yeah, it is very fast, but I'm afraid it is not as lucky move, as it might seem at first.</p>
<p>At least for the people, who are using their device the way similar to mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agree with regard to write/re-write, but the reality is that unless under really really heavy work, an SSD drive is likely to last for longer than the time before you are likely to change your laptop.&nbsp; Now that laptops and netbooks are at these sort of prices,
 and with advances in technology, most users are likely to trade up to newer models within 2 years - or am I wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's face it, with constant discharge and recharge cycles of just your laptop battery, that won't last that long before you either buy a replacement battery at a ridiculous price or trade up to a newer laptop - and any performance increase in this beautiful,
 long battery life laptop is truly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you have a point. If only they would reduce these damn SSD prices quicker!</p>

<p>Paging (swapping) to SSD is not going to write to the same area you "think" file is. SSD maintain their own mapping of logical disk sectors to its own address space. The SSD controller is maintaining its own wear leveling mechanism to reduce chance you wear
 certain cell in a chip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having 100 paging operation a second is a lot. In a day you will probably will write/erase max 1.5Gb of data. With 80Gb SSD filled at 70% you'll be rewriting each SSD cell twice a month. With 5 year SSD lifetime you'll do120 rewrites with paging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SSD have couple of magnitudes higher reliability then the load we've put on it in the sample above.</p>

                    <p>I have re-installed the latest version of FB on my Lumia 650 to the phone, not the SD card. I have made sure all updates are completed and carried out a soft re-boot.</p>
<p>Every time I open up Facebook it closes again after 30 seconds. It has only been doing this for the last week. Up to then it was fine.</p>

<p>So I was experiencing a similar issue on my 950XL. I found it very frustrating but all of a sudden it began working again. I did check in the store for update and eventually got one on 4-15-2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version is: 69.663.16638.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I suggest you go into the store, click the hamburger menu in the upper left and click downloads and updates. Click Get updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no update and you have a different version, I would uninstall the app, reboot the device (power off so you see the Goodbye" message then restart. Download the app, check it and check for updates if the version is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just my thoughts Paul.</p>

    <title>Build 9879 My thoughts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 9879 My thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Just installed 9879 about 2 hours ago and so far meh. Please understand before reading this that I am well aware of the alpha status and that more things are to come this is just me thinking out loud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the whole feedback idea sounds great and as a developer myself I have used it many times. I know however that ultimately the developer gets to decide what he/she/they want to work on. I have been following the feedback through the app as well as the
 forum's since 10 was first dropped. Ive seen a lot of feedback which may appear to some as being ignored (or at least pushed back). Of course one of the larger ones is aero (see below on my take of it). It would appear that overall UI appearance in this build
 has gotten worste. So lets get on to my list of Windows 10 topics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Overall GUI</p>
<p>It looks plain flat and boring. There is very little difference from 8*. This is still a tablet OS and NOT a desktop one. I dont know anyone who has thier face burried in a tablet for 8+ hours at a time. Those devices are designed to be a quick use device
 to update some status or post a picture or maybe check some email. Most people who are playing BF or using Visual studio or photoshop are doing it on a much more powerful machine called a desktop. Please dont mistake this as a Modern look bashing because it
 isnt. In fact im all for the modern apps as ive come to use a few of them since previewing 10 (more on that below). The lack of customizations for appearance is very disturbing. You cant change even basic colors such as inactive captions, Button face, etc...
 This has all been in windows since those components have existed (well maybe not the 1 andd 2.0 versions but certainly 3.1+)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dropping aero and loosing the customizations has done nothing for speed/memory consumption on desktops. We dont care about battery life there and my 4.6Ghz cpu with 32GB of 2133Mhz memory is pretty snappy in 7, 8, 8.1, and now 10 (xp even flows like a gentle
 river) So theres no noticeable improvement there for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. New paradigm.&nbsp; Remove Remove Remove</p>
<p>Seems to me MS has removed far more than its added to Windows since 7 Rolled out. Sure we got a simple barely functional start menu back but not only does not even compete with what we had it lacks even basic abilities that Windows 95 had. Again this is
 no improvement for me. It may be one when i get a tablet but then again continuum will switch it into start screen mode anyway. Of course I miss aero because it was finally getting good like watching your favourite TV series only getting cut short 2 episodes
 of the series finally and then waiting 3 years for a movie adaptation to fill in the holes. Windows now leaves me wanting more where before it used to keep me in suspence as to what will come next (theres a difference). The latter makes you tune in later to
 find out the former makes you change the channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Aero (Here we go)</p>
<p>Ive said in the past that windows for most of its life has been the least eye candy OS ever. From windows 95 up to (not including xp) the only eye candy we got was gradient captions in windows 98. When XP came it was like an explosion (altho maybe a bit
 much). Heres the funny thing about that. YOU had the option to disable it. This carried on in later versions. Both Vista and 7 had Aero (Luna's replacement) and it was Defeatable. (i.e. you could turn it off). Again the User had the choice. Do I want aero
 back? absolutely! Do I think it will come back? Im almost 100% certain that it wont. Can we at least find a happy medium? Thats what these builds are for i guess. Even if the whole of Aero was brough back as an option even turned off by default i would simply
 soil myself. This is something that has had more votes than almost anything else and it is abundantly clear that A Lot of users want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Modern apps</p>
<p>This is where things get sticky. I used to think how dare those uppity modern apps. They should know thier place. However lately ive been using them. I still want them off&nbsp; when i want them off. Id like them to be in a folder of the start menu and not accupy
 98% of the items in it. I only use 2 (feedback tool being one of them) and a few others because I have no choice (pc settings etc..) again we dont get choice here. Appearance on these things are freakishly appauling. The caption bars are all black all the
 time. They dont follow any of the animation of desktop windows (remember were trying to integrate them into the desktop). You could use the desktop windows frame for modern apps (we can tell the difference since the rest of it is definately metro). This adds
 to the uniformity of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. OneDrive and MS account login</p>
<p>Heres the thing. I dont want to use my PC as a social media hub. Theres a plethora of other devices for that like a smart phone. So using a cloud based service to upload and share photos etc.. is pointless. Using a cloud for file sync and backup is productive.
 I was sadened to find out that OneDrive still doesnt offer in place sync. This has been offered by syncplicity and sugarsync forever. So even if i use windows 10 and have OneDrive im still forced to install thrid party software to use in place of the similar
 software thats preinstalled with the OS. If i could remove OneDrive then i save space but that lets me out of other features. Again theres no choice here (at least not a good one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. A desktop that allows modern visitors</p>
<p>My Desktop is My Desktop. When im in desktop mode thats what i want. I want to change the 4 settings that windows now has all in control panel. Ill allow some modern apps to visit me in my desktop at my disgretion but remember this is a desktop OS now right?
 If i want to use PC Settings ill switch to Windows Tiles 10 and use that. In which case I dont expect to ever see the control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Taskview and Multiple Workspaces</p>
<p>Needs heaps of work. Heaps. Deskspace nuff said. give it a looksee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry it took so long for this write up but ive been using windows since forever and ive always loved it. Even have a profound fondness for hte 9x's that i still play with in VM's from time to time. I just feel that windows should be A lot more customizable.
 It should consider everyone and not just a few devices. There was a time when MS's goal was to get a PC in every home. Why you ask? well aside from the boatload of cash from selling that many copies of windows its the home users that far far out number any
 others. far more than any company/enterprise. More than any tablet (we use them too you know). We are the ones who help keep the lights on so its not unreasonable to want to get what we pay for. Please Please add some more switches for options like aero and
 appearance controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. To those who said the new animations were "jarring" i have to call BS on this. I loved the collapse in on close it was a refreshing change that had never been done in windows.

            <p>I agree with most of that. The parts where I differ are that I don't and won't use onedrive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other line in that post I completely agree with. Particularly Aero and how older hardware is perfectly fine with it like my first gen i5 laptop with intergrated graphics. Please bring back the nice OS features that made 7 special. Make 10 special too,
 not flat and plain.</p>

            <p>I also wish there was a way to remove the apps from the Start menu (not just from the "tiles menu" on the right) without physically having to uninstall them from the PC. I
<em>might</em> some time in the distant future want to use one of them, I just don't want them cluttering up the Start&nbsp;menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And give us back the ability to make shortcuts when and where we want them. I like to have a shortcut on my desktop for the "old-fashioned" Notepad. A place where I can cut/paste things on the fly, make myself a&nbsp; quickie note etc. In this new world, Notepad
 is an app and the only thing I can do is create a tile on the Start menu or stick it to the taskbar. But I DON"T want it in either place. I want it on the DESKTOP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Microsoft taking away all the things that allowed us to customize Windows to work the way each individual wants to use it? I don't want to be assimilated into their way of thinking/doing things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I still have the same problem in 9879 as in 9860 about the Safely Remove icon failing after an SD card is ejected. There are several threads on this topic, so I won't waste more space here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When 9879 finished installing it said there was Driver Software that needed to complete&nbsp;its installation. I clicked the link and next screen said "Driver Software - No action needed".&nbsp; Huh?</p>

            <p>I totally agree! &nbsp;The ability to unpin metro apps from the start menu without uninstalling the app is a MUST! &nbsp;At least make the Metro apps a single pop out category instead of each app just flooding the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iOS users are having problems with their phones when they have over 700 apps installed. &nbsp;Can you imagine &nbsp;scrolling through 700 apps at the top of the start menu before you can even see the real desktop applications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's app store doesn't even have 700 decent apps, but the point is that a&nbsp;<span>mobile app ecosystem is completely different than the traditional desktop application ecosystem. &nbsp;Mobile apps are free to very cheap, are mostly casual games and social
 media, and a poor choice for sustained content creation (ok you can make a quick casual edit in a pinch).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Desktop applications are usually pretty expensive, you buy it as a serious productivity tool so it's absolutely worth it, and these applications have no ads, have a comprehensive feature set, and take some time to learn the full capabilities of it
 - these are not "casual use" situations - and that's been Microsoft's bread and butter. &nbsp;Unfortunately it seems like Microsoft is more interested in MineRaft and Candy Crunch Sage users than productivity users. &nbsp;This giant advertising deal with the NFL is
 directed at who? &nbsp;It's not to attract developers - it's just more consumer marketing, like Dr. Prepper or Moster Energy Drinks.</span></p>
<p>Why is Microsoft making a concerted effort to abandon Windows desktop PC as a productivity platform and turn it into the least ergonomic iPad in the world?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The real reason for this was the idea of a unified OS. MS wants one OS for every device. That sounds nice in theory but heres the real problem with that. Not every device has the same capabilities. For example Ive never seen a tablet that had Titan grade
 gaming graphics. So the only real solution here is to choose the lowest common denominator (i.e. lowest hardware for the device you plan to support) and build the OS around that. No need for Aero because on a 8" tablet or 4" phone it would indeed shorten the
 battery life a very noticeable amount. (please note im one of those kinds that bought the 10,000 mah battery for my note 3 lol).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Understand why they did all this in the first place when it was windows 8. Hey they gave it a shot. It blew and pretty much the entire world said so. Again you have the few (maybe slightly larger) folks who have only used a computing device for facebook
 and twitter so they didnt care either way. They also werent there for windows from 95 to xp (maybe jumped on during xp's final lap) so they dont understand how we had all this **** before and while it was awsome at the time (when we had **** hardware you
 cant even find anymore) nowadays we can do a lot more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the things i get sick over is how i hear people say 7 looks dated. Ok 7 isnt really that old not when you consider OS lifespans. Even 8 is what 3 years old now so isnt that dated? Thing is the whole modern look was done long ago in the mid to late
 80's and now i suppose whats old is new again? How is that not dated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were comparing picaso to kindergarten art class here. i cant understand how anyone else can not look at "More" abilities (weather graphical or otherwise) and say no to it. Just shut it off dont remove it. I get tired sometimes and so i take a nap. I shut
 off my light i dont take the buld out and wait 3 years to put a new one in. thats not innovation (weel it will be 10 years from now when MS brings back the stuff old is new again and we all **** about how we had all that in 7 lol)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the start menu (read flat square boring item) i agree it should have the basic features. Modern apps should be in a folder. Open the menu in 7 and look for items there. Everything was classified. You had a system folder that had communication, tools,
 etc... you had an entertainment folder (wmp and wmc would be found here notice how that just makes sense?) and so on. Why cant we create our own shortcuts and folders? Even software has a hard time doing it. I shouldnt have to reboot everytime i install something
 new so the start menu can be updated to reflect it (logout/login is no better btw).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently Windows (8* mostly) is the single most uncustomizable OS in the history of computing devices. They didnt just turn things off they removed them (presumably so we cant just turn it back on again remember 8 DevPrev?). Everything is flat, square,
 color washed. Reminds me of the paper mario of the OS world. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However The OS itself is very stable fast and clean. Thats another reason im upset.&nbsp; I really really want to use 10 Gimmie a reason MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for OneDrive I do agree it should be optional software. I use file sync for my projects (so i could code-on-the-go) if i ever do lol. It does make it easy to code on a laptop while im away (inspiration hits me everywhere) and then come home and just have
 it ready to go. Since im already doing this and onedrive already exists then why not just make it work?</p>

            <p>Technically, "Aero" still exists. It's Aero transparency that's missing, isn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a desktop productivity app user, many of the comments above are insightful. On a mobile device a flat look simplifies. On a 27 inch monitor with multiple programs and windows open, the shading round the edge, that we had in Windows 7, helped the eye to
 focus on the top window. The colours and shadings facilitated eye guidance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A flat plain landscape doesn't help the eye at all. Big problem. Hence why for me, user theming was one dealbreaker on Windows 8.&nbsp; Not to get pretty colours, but to get shading round my desktop windows, and UI colour setup, that helps my eyes to work productively.</p>

            <p>If I'm not mistaken it also had curves on corners of windows and menus. I use firefox so I have nice flowing curvy lines on my tabs... inside a dull flat panel of a main window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read something about MS supporting a third party app that will put aero back in tho I worry that will not have the same fine tuning an actual system feature would have. I don't get it... they have the code already from 7. Surely they haven't made it that
 much different that it isn't easy to tweak that same code to work on the 10 desktop windows? Even if it were exactly the same as it was in 7 I don't think anyone who wants aero would complain about that. It was and is still good.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Re onedrive: Yes it was the disable startup option in the one drive settings menu that I used. And it's gone properly.</p>
