</p><blockquote>
<p>In Word 2010, don't even think about using any of the built-in TOC building blocks. Instead, in References | Table of Contents | Table of Contents, choose Insert Table of Contents..., which will open the classic Table of Contents dialog, where you can click
 on Options.</p>

</p><p>Can you describe how to insert multiple TOCs into a document using this method in Word 2010?

            <p>Can you provide information on what it is that you want to appear in each Table of Contents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, here is a simple example of two TC fields that identify the text to be inserted into the table of contents, and the level using the \l switch at which each entry is to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of the TOC fields, the \l switch dictates the levels that are to appear in each table of contents</p>

            <p>I had this error message on 5th Dec 2016&nbsp;and have managed to repair it myself, having tried using Microsoft's repair kits etc. It was scary, but here is what I did, cutting out the bits which simply got me nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started on the MS support page </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Outlook-not-responding-stuck-at-Processing-stopped-working-freezes-or-hangs-5c313d04-64af-4441-82d2-44e5a43eee5a?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Outlook-not-responding-stuck-at-Processing-stopped-working-freezes-or-hangs-5c313d04-64af-4441-82d2-44e5a43eee5a?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having worked my way through the suggestions I arrived at Step 5 - Repair your Outlook data files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seemed logical as my 'hang' seemed to be being caused by Outlook having problems in downloading e-mail from my server. The link&nbsp;at step 5&nbsp;takes you here
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, I didn't know if I was trying to repair a file - but if it was a .pst file, I am so unclear about what it could be and where it could be that I chose the option '</span>Re-create an offline Outlook Data File (.ost)'. When
 taking the action suggested it looked simplest and least risky, but&nbsp;I was concerned when I reached the very last bullet point -
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)"><span>4. In the file explorer window, right-click the Exchange data file and then click
<strong>Delete</strong>. The next time you start Outlook, a new .ost file is created for the account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem was that when a solution suggests that you delete a folder, what happens should the solution not work and you have a bigger problem to fix.&nbsp;And sure enough, having deleted the folder, and when I tried to re-start Outlook, the&nbsp;program wouldn't
 even open! However, rather than panicking, I simply went to my 'Recycle Bin', found the deleted folder and re-instated it. Then, and without first being tempted to open Outlook and check if it was working again, I re-started Windows. When I opened Outlook,
 voila!, it was working properly&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this may have worked for reasons only down to my PC configuration - I boot from a SSD - Drive C -&nbsp;but keep data etc on a standard HDD - Drive E. When I couldn't open Outlook, as mentioned above, it suggested a problem in reading files from my E drive,
 which are the data folders, whereas the system program would be run from my C drive. I also run Office 2016&nbsp;Professional&nbsp;on Windows 10. I'm a (retired) home user and my e-mail/ISP is BT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to give this a try, I wish you well. I understand why you may not trust to try this, and I did get seriously worried at one point myself, but basically I just followed the Microsoft actions to the point where it seemed to&nbsp;fail and&nbsp;I couldn't
 open Outlook,&nbsp;restored the deleted&nbsp;folder and Bob's your uncle.&nbsp;I'm merely adding another potential action on to the MS fix.</p>

            Did you do a search for this error? as most of the time is due to that the system has a 3rd party Virus/Malware program installed even if it's not running. When posting it is important that you include info about your system and what fixes you have tried.

                    I am an older user who would appreciate guidance on the following issue. I have a low end laptop with windows 10 on it. I am licensed to use office 365. How do i download just word and excel to my pc instead of the whole suite due to space limitations.
 If someone could give step by step instructions i would be extremely appreciative.

<h3> jeffwe26  say:</h3>
<h2>            cell reference problem</h2>
                    When I type the '=' sign in a cell, then select an other sheet, then select a cell of which I want the value displace, the last active cell on this sheet is selected and the reference is putt there.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Example:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want the value of cell b4 of sheet1 linked in cell a1 of sheet2<br />
<ul>
<li>I type '=' in sheet2.a1</li><li>then select sheet1</li><li>then select sheet1.b4</li><li>then 'enter'</li></ul>
<div>The value of sheet1.b4 is not shown in sheet2.a1 but in the last active cell of sheet1.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem occurs most of the time, not always.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I use the undo function to correct it, the action before the above is undone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried every restart and shutdown options. I even have deleted and replaced traceable Excel files in the library directory. It all didn't help.</div>

            The 1st test indicates that it isn't the Excel Preferences file causing the behavior. That's why deleting your old prefs had no effect.<br />
<br />
The 2nd test suggests that there is some other process being launched on login that is interfering with Excel's operation. the Safe Login bypasses the Login Items.<br />
<br />
The 3rd test confirms the findings of the 2nd &amp; further indicates that the culprit is specific to the original user account. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that using a Guest account is conclusive because it doesn't retain any user information. It would be better
 to create a new Standard User Account to confirm, but it isn't necessary.<br />
<br />
Check the LogIn Items for the problem account for anything you don't recognize... It could be some sort of utility, OS 'enhancement', a haxie or even antivirus software. You may have to disable them all, then add them back one at a time to find out which is
 causing the problem. The Activity Monitor may also give you some clues.<br />

            The problem seems to be solved! A few month ago I've bought an app that logs the usage (time) of programs and files: Time Track Pro. This app was launched at startup. I've disabled it and now the problem doesn't occur anymore. Strange though that it didn't
 cause problems right away.

<div>Thank you very much for your help! You've not only solved the problem but also taught me some insides of OSX.</div>

            <p>Is this a VBA question? Also, I'm assuming you mean sheet when you say "tab", right?&nbsp;Even if the answer to both questions is yes, there is still a question raised by the shortness of your question... are you looking for the total number of sheets in the
 workbook...<br />
<br />
NumberOfSheets = Sheets.Count<br />
<br />
Or are you looking for the number of visible sheet tabs in the workbook...<br />
<br />
For Each SH In Sheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not SH.Hidden Then NumberOfVisibleSheets = NumberOfVisibleSheets + 1<br />
Next</p>

    <title>Why Nokia integrated into phones GPS with poor quality&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonfreeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Nokia integrated into phones GPS with poor quality&#63;</h2>
                    1) To have the final buyer overpay money for phones that supposedly support the navigation, and then realized that it was impossible to use build-in GPS receiver and had to buy a good external bluetooth at the same Nokia?<br />
2) To have done a good marketing move and deceive buyers wash their hands saying that it was not promised a good quality of GPS receiver?<br />
3) Or as Nokia wanted to get better and as always?<br />
<br />
End users connects! All who had the problems with the quality of receive of signals from satellites write here, let Nokia than to see how many people have a problems with get normal navigation!<br />
I think if gather enough votes that might be able to claim compensation from Nokia for having spent that money, but never received an application function GPS positioning!

            Just to share my experience.<br />
<br />
I have N78 and been using this model for a month.<br />
<br />
I live in Malaysia where there's always clouds over our head.<br />
<br />
I have difficulty of getting the first fix. The time varies but usually its no less that 5 minutes. That if I have a clear sky. If its cloudy, consider it good luck if you get the fix.<br />
<br />
The A-GPS capability is just lousy either as compared to GMap. In GMap, it take no more than a minute to get a fix to the nearest cellular tower. This I notice when I was at home and I knew where the cellular tower is. Map 2.0 seems doesn't make use of the
 A-GPS and will always wait for the applicable satellite before giving the fix.<br />
<br />
However, GPS tagging for the camera works very well, be it rain or shine.<br />
<br />
Thus, for now, I use both Gmail for fix and Map 2 for route planning until I find a good Navigation application that I can rely on.

            In December 2007 ( it's 8 months ago ) i purchcase for my N95-1 850$ but event now i can't use build-in GPS in my N95-1. I live in Russia Federation in St.Petersbug ( about 5 millions people), and when i try use 'GPS posiotion' application the GPS data
 write only 'Wait GPS Data' and i see available sattelites but receiving only one sattelite signals or nothing always ( any sky clear or not ). It's not enoth for fix GPS position and i can use navigation with build-in GPS receiver.<br />
I try to fix GPS position from out city, but situation not good - the build-in GPS receiver get two or one sattelite signals and can't fix my positions too...<br />
As result i can't use buil-in GPS in my Nokia N95 for Navigation.<br />
I don't known any other (not Nokia) smartphone, that have so poor quality like N95!!!<br />
<br />
I try to use Google maps, Yandex maps, and Garmin Mobile, but i still can't get fix my position, and still get one or no one sattelite signals... But with the external bluetooth GPS work very well!<br />
<br />
But my friend purchcase 800$ for other Sartphone (WM6.0 and buil-in GPS too), and him can use Navigation very well!!! to fix GPS him need only 15 seconds ( and about 1minute in from another city)...<br />
<br />
This situation very very bad and i can only one think about Nokia, i can trust to Nokia! :(<br />
Very nice N95 device with very bad GPS!!! :(

            My 6210 Navigator is superb. The first fix took several minutes. However, it now takes a matter of 10-15 seconds with A-GPS enabled.<br />
<br />
Even better the satnav works perfectly even with the handset positioned on the centre console in the middle of my car. I don't even need to buy a window mount.<br />

            Maybe Your government restricted using of GPS because of "security".<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you aren't live in democratic and modern country :(<br />

I have N95 for 2 years and it works greatly, I'm ovversatisfied with additional functions and usebility.<br />

"security"? that do you meen that say it?<br />
<br />
I live in democratic and modern country but also i live in big city Saint-Petersbug ( ~5 millions people!!! ) and we have big building and also North region and quality of GPS receiver that build-in in N95 not enoth for us!! Also seems problems have and other
 countries... But we dos not have a problems with other devices that has build-in GPS receiver too. Only Nokia devices!!! And if i purchcase for external bluetooth GPS receiver and use it - it's will work good too!!!<br />
Many people in Russia and Saint-Petersburg bay the Garmin GPS Navigation devices (USA) and other like Qstarz, GlobalSat (Taiwain), also ASUS, HTC smartphones with build-in GPS and it's all work very well ( but not build-in GPS that in Nokia devices ).!!!<br />
So... what you say about modern countries???

            I seriously doubt any government is blocking GPS signals - you might want to do it if you were at war with the Americans, but otherwise it would a heck of a big effort for zero gain.<br />
<br />
I'd also be surprised if cloud made much difference to reception: GPS is military system used by all the US (and other NATO) forces including aircraft, missiles and grunts on the ground. I don't recall hearing about the two currents wars grinding to a halt
 coz it was a bit overcast out .. ;)<br />
<br />
The GPS on my N85 8GB works remarkably well - at least as well as the external bluetooth GPS receiver I used with my N80. I had planned on continuing to use the external GPS after reading the comments about internal GPS reception on this board, but in fact,
 so far I've never needed to.

            Weather conditions are known to make a difference, but most devices nowadays are good enough to work in most conditions.<br />
<br />
The only effective way to really block it would be to ban it from being sold (like the absence of WLAN in phones sold in China), but there is equally no reason to do this because phones have only a receiver, they do not report their location back to the satellites
 - so there can be no use of a GPS phone that could be against anybody's national interest.<br />
<br />
Back to the original post, there are issues specific to the location of the GPS receiver in the N95, other than that it is also the case that more modern software versions and Maps versions do handle GPS better than older ones.

            I am from Australia, I've been crazy to get N95 8GB dreaming to be able to use GPS handy, but I am now very much upset with that N95 8GB, I am not suggest anyone to use Nokia anymore.<br />
<br />
N95 8GB is really bad for GPS. I never get any connection I believed my phone setup is correct. I cann't even get GPS connection in the middle of football field during sunny day.<br />
<br />
Also map is problem I try too many famous places but it come out "No result" I feel that I have been cheated or I am stupid to trust their ad.<br />
<br />
Now I bought new GPS today.<br />
<br />
Thanks Nokia and good bye.

The GPS satellites are owned and managed by the USA. Only the US government/military can do something to the signal (no other country/government, without shooting down the satellites, and few countries have such ability, or ability to make the USA do what they
 want). The EU has tried to kick its own positioning satellite infrastructure (Galileo), but I don't think it has progressed very far yet.

<p>Your advice has is premature.</p>
<p>You don't know how many aliases Richard has.&nbsp; Only 10 aliases can be created each year and the account can only have 10 aliases.&nbsp; Richard may already be at an alias limit.&nbsp; Removing the alias could result in not being able to add the alias back for one year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you should be referring to alias 'address'.</p>

<p>Andria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me.&nbsp; To answer your questions:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I access Outlook.com via a web browser (Firefox on Linux-Mint 17.1)</p>
<p>2. Yes.&nbsp; Several times!!</p>
<p>3. Not that I am aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of the help files on aliases on Microsoft.com, and the answer/post from 2012 doesn't really help, sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did wonder whether the email account I was trying to set up as an alias might be unusual for some reason (it's a work-based account) so I tried to set up my gmail.com email also as an alias, and that doesn't work either for receiving emails in Outlook,com;
 but again, it works fine for sending emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not at my alias limit, though I might be close, as I did try removing the alias and reinstating it before I posted my original question (it didn't work, clearly!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, I set up the alias using my existing hotmail.co.uk address, so that might explain why it doesn't receive emails from my aliases - though, in my view, that "feature" makes aliases rather less useful, wouldn't you say!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your other suggestion, I already have an outlook.com email address (set up some time ago) and I don't really want to create another one.&nbsp; I've already been completely unable to add my outlook.com email address as an alias to my primary hotmail
 account, so I am really struggling (in Outlook.com) to keep all my email accounts conveniently together.&nbsp; You probably don't want to hear this, but on my iPad, this all works very smoothly and the set-up was very straightforward (and there was no 5-in-one-year
 limit either!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to be able to aggregate all my emails on Outlook.com as this is my preferred webmail account when I am on my PC at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help, or is it that "When you create an alias using an existing address, you will be able to send emails using the alias address, but the alias will not receive emails."a showstopper?</p>

<p>Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I sounds like I won't be able to aggregate all my emails (sending and receiving) in Outlook.com without proliferating another outlook.com email address.&nbsp; I still think the ability to add existing email addresses would be good, and
 also, more importantly the ability to receive emails from an alias address without having to set up a new email address (FYI, I have discovered that this can be done in Gmail!).&nbsp; So, unless you can offer any suggestions other than me creating a new outlook.com
 email address, I think this thread is probably at an end.&nbsp; Thank you for your help anyway.</p>

<p>Yes, I could do, but then replying from the right email address (especially as I am trying to aggregate a work email account) becomes more complicated and prone to error.&nbsp; I was trying to avoid having to do this by using aliases, but it doesn't look like
 that will work for me - at least not in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion though!</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 920 - Not connecting on MAC OSX 10.6.8</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have this problem that alot of people are encounting but it seems having no solutions yet.</p>
<p>I bought my Nokia Lumia 920 a couple days ago, made all the updates alvaible but still I can't connect my phone to my MacBook Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The funny part is that my dropbox application on my mac detect my phone and tries to import my pictures where neither iTunes or Finder are able to recognize my Nokia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The all support we got is to download a app which is not working for the OSX 10.6.8 and they seem to force us to upgrade to the 10.7 OSX.</p>
<p>It is my right, as a consummer, to choose to OS I want for my laptop and it is to both Windows and Nokia to make their devices compatible to their customers computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here is my call to all Nokia and Windows developpers: Do not ignore us, there is a problem and the first step in order to solve it is to recognize this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The least you can do is to tell us that you are currently working on it because I feel all alone in the dark but I am pretty sure I am not alone and you might loose some clients that are delighted with your phone but really "**bleep**" off the way that they
 are treated in the process of solving this important problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and comprehension,</p>
<p>I am looking forward some advices from any developpers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JyCey</p>

<p>It's your right to choose and stay with an outdated and no longer supported OS yes, but you can't expect development of new apps to continue to support an 3 year old OS which received it's last update some 18 months ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple expects developers and users &nbsp;to update their OS much more then Microsoft does. You can choose to stay on an older OS but you can't expect anyone else to stay behind with you.</p>

<p>You may well have your reasons for not updating your Macbook Pro perhaps because can't access SMB shares in OSX Lion, but at least if you Macbook Pro was built from Mid/Late 2007 onwards you could install 10.7 if you so wanted:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/specs/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As essentially a Mac user I have to accept that it is not unreasonable that my five year old device is no longer compatible.</p>

<p>I have to raise a different view point. Many users of macs are ordinary, non-techie people, who simply want a machine to do basic things. I know people with very old macs, and they are happily using them for simple purposes. I have 10.6.8, and any upgrade
 would cost me some money to upgrade parallels. Macs can run for years, and I believe that it is important for equipment to be able to be used for long periods of time, if the user wishes. Also, earlier OS are very commonly unsed in coutries where money and
 internet is not as available as to many of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also use a mac with XP as I need a small install base for only one PC based software that I occasionally use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a developer, I would expect them to look at the actual installed back of OS, and realise that some simple functionality should be backward to existing users. The ability for a phone to connect to earlier OS is something which I did not even think about
 - I thought it would be automatic. Its also not that difficult to develop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The forums are awash with frustrated new pruchasers of Lumia phones, suddenly realising that their expected functionality with PC Suite, etc has now gone. Many of those people are very frustrated, and they will pass on their frustrations to others, and sales
 will be affected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been a Nokia user now for about six years, and I have watched the same frustrations of users, requesting Nolia to develop expected connection, integration, and sync software that other phone manufacturers seem to be able to do. Finally, a reasonable
 PC Suite version is now developed, but not compatible with Lumia?? Do we have to go through the whole waiting thing again? Why cannot Nokia look at this not as a software problem, but an expected functionality feature.</p>

<p>thanks for telling him what he already knew. it IS a choice. i have the same issue and am literally stuck since i have CHOSEN to remain "behind" as you put it with a quite capable G4 12" Powerbook. it's maxed to 10.5.8 Leopard so can't even up my software
 to get the Windows Phone working for my iTunes to get to my new Lumia 920. I love my laptop. it is old by today's standards, yes. i use a 23 Cinema Display with it and have the great old isight camera available when i need it. I love my old stuff. it works
 great and I take care of it. it is kinda sad that system requirements don't match up more broadly overall. i suppose the limitations ultimately help competition more than anything esle. it's all about the bottom line.</p>

<p>Thank you for your message. I also wanted to buy a Lumia 920. I was very happy with my old Nokia, especially for the free navigation possibilities without internet connection. My Windows 7 computer was a drama. So I bought an Apple. Now I know my OSX 10.6.8
 won't work with this device, I have to look for another.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change the settings in the following file: /system/libary/coreservices/systemversion.plist</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First you have to set new rights for the folder "coreservices" and the file, so you can save the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the file with texedit (app on your mac)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change settings from 10.6.8 (or 10.6) to 10.7.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>save the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then download windows phone app from mac app store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change the settings in systemversion.plist back to 10.6.8 (10.6).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the application folder on your mac. search for "windows phone app"</p>
<p>click with the right mouse button. click "show package contents". There you find a file named "info.plist".</p>
<p><br />
Open it with text edit an look for "minimum system requirements" (almost at the end). Change the settings from 10.7 to your system version</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>save the file! Maybe you have to set new rights for the file before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats it. Works fine on my macbook 1.83 with mac os 10.6.8. I use a lumia 820 with wp 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Considering that WP8 came out long after OSX 10.6 I'd say it's not surprising if there is a problem getting your MacBook to recognize your Lumia. Microsoft and Apple are under NO obligation to make their systems work together. They're competitors so it's
 almost MORE surprising when they DO work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have every right to refuse to upgrade your version of OSX. But knowingly sticking with an older operating system means you accept the possibility that new devices and new technology might not work with your MacBook. It's a choice you made.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> erict.viking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update from Win7 Home Premium to Win 10 fails with error code 0x800703F1 - 0x2000A</h2>
                    <p>When I realised that Win10 would allow me to upgrade my RAM from the 16GB I have now I thought I'd give it a go but there have been issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first attempt at loading Win10 from the ISO failed quite quickly with an error message saying "We couldn't update the System Reserved Partition". (My system runs a Samsung 256Gb pro SSD and "Magician" labelled this partition as "DATA") I had a look and
 it was very nearly full with only 6.5MB left. So I used "Mini Tool Partition Wizard" to increase the size of "Data" (system reserved) from 100MB&nbsp;to 371MB which was the nearest to the 350MB target &nbsp;I could get with the slider on the UI.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That done I had another go and all seemed to go well as it seemed to install, restart but before actually coming back on again it restarted again and came back as Win7 with the message "The installation failed in the safe OS phase with an error during</p>
<p>Prepare- first-boot-Operation&nbsp;&nbsp;0x800703F1 - 0x2000A " so I'm assuming it rolled back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anything be done? My installation is huge and complicated and works just fine so a clean install is out of the question really.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates work fine and always have. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I supposed to turn off any of the "Samsung Magician" optimisations before install?&nbsp; One online post said that the error code referred to "System Restore" which is turn off on my system as it is SSD.

<h2>            So, you need Help &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Open Windows Explorer and there is a button with white ? on a blue background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 7, click on it and a 'Help and Support' panel will open with information directly related to what you are doing and further links if required. Very useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on this same button in Win 10 and there in no Help and Support. What you do get is 'How do I get help in Windows 10' as a search item in Bing. (ummm ..... isn't that why I pushed the button?).&nbsp; What you do get is 53,900,000 search results which MAY
 contain what you really wanted to know. As a bonus though, you can get 50% off new Windows from a double glazing company. Very useful alternative to W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really Microsoft, is this really helping the customer. Or is it just to match what you are doing to the rest of the OS.</p>

<h2>            Printing a mirror image</h2>
                    I would like to create a T-Shirt transfer in either Popwerpoint, Word or Publisher. How do I reverse the image onto a transfer sheet?

<p>You may not need to.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>Go to print your file from Powerpoint.&nbsp; In the print dialog box, choose your printer, click Properties and in your printer's properties dialog box, you may find an option for choosing the paper type.&nbsp; See if there's a choice for transfer material there.&nbsp;
 If so, choose it.&nbsp; Then print a test page (you can use regular paper for this if you like).</p>
<p>On the two inkjets I've used that support transfers, both automatically mirror the image for me when I select transfer material.</p>
<p>Naturally, I didn't find this out until I'd spent a silly amount of time working out how to mirror the graphic before printing... whereupon it came out a mirror image of a mirror image and was a waste of paper.&nbsp; &lt;g&gt;</p>
<p>If your printer won't help, try this:</p>
<p>Select everything on your PPT slide, copy it (Ctrl+C), insert a new blank slide, then use Paste Special | as EMF to paste in a graphic version of your slides' contents.</p>
<p>Rightclick, choose Size and Position.&nbsp; Note the width of the graphic.</p>
<p>Then grab the selection handle in the middle of the left side and drag it to the right ... keep dragging PAST the right side and you'll see that you're flipping the graphic ... mirror image city.</p>
<p>Now go back into Size and Position and set the width to match the original (this ensures that the graphic isn't distorted).</p>
<p>Try pasting as PNG also.&nbsp; See which gives better results.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You can probably do this via your printer settings - for example my printer has a 't-shirt transfer' paper type which automatically reverses the image. Test on some plain paper first!</p>

<h3> pastorico  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does deleting pics from Camera Roll on Windows Phone automatically delete them from Sky Drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Salutations,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to free up some space on my device by only having 'favourites' stored on it. However I want to retain on my SkyDrive all the pics I have taken for later/remote access. I am getting mixed messages from existing threads around this circumstance. Are
 you able to confirm</p>
<p>
</p><p>- that deleting pictures from my device does not delete them automatically from the SkyDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- there any auto sync functionality that I need to be wary of?</p>
<p>- that deleting items from SkyDrive requires manual process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help and guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

 They light up when I reboot, but after a few seconds the lights on the keyboard and wireless mouse go out. I have tried to use an external keyboard but having the problem. I also realize that there can be bugs with the insider program. But as of this writing

<p>You really need to give us some info.&nbsp; The latest Insider Build does not really give much help.&nbsp;&nbsp; Search and run winver if in doubt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are downloading 18317 right now.&nbsp; We got an update last night that moved us to 18312.1007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem is not all that uncommon in prior builds.&nbsp; Are you saying that you have no control of the PC now?&nbsp; If no control, then this leads you off in one direction.&nbsp; If control, you have other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might look through other threads for your problem and how they got fixed.&nbsp; Based on your expertise, we can now create our ISO files and this has solved many issues.&nbsp; In my own case, I used the ISO of the current&nbsp; build to get up and running.</p>

<p>As you are not giving any more info to help, as mentioned, you will have to do a total clean install and boot from a usb flash card or dvd. You could try with a bootable flash card to do a system repair. This can happen with Insider builds and searching
 through the threads in this Forum will give you many suggestions.</p>

</p><blockquote>Thanks for replying to me. No i have no control of the computer at this time.

<p>You now appear to have a fried W10 O/S.&nbsp; This should be as simple as re-installing W10 on your PC.&nbsp; This is how you install an O/S on a PC you built in the garage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now your level of knowledge comes into play. The option I go with is the install of an O/S using BIOS.&nbsp; I go to MS and download the Media Creation Tool on another PC stating you want to use on another PC and you will get a 'Bootable" USB stick.&nbsp; The stick
 should be at least 4 GB, 8 is better and it will be erased.&nbsp; This will get you the Home and Pro editions of Public Build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start the PC.&nbsp; Very early in the load and before the "Logo" appears you must enter a "Key" to signal you want to load BIOS.&nbsp; On my HP, it is the ESC key but is manufacturer specific.&nbsp; Now you change load order to USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shut PC off, insert USB, start PC and this time you should see USB activity.&nbsp; I go default for partitions.&nbsp; Later on you will be asked to remove the USB.&nbsp; At this point, I go back into BIOS and change the load order back to Drive C.&nbsp; Re-Start PC and select
 Set UP and enjoy W10 Public Release.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This will cause loss of your apps and date but you will have a working PC and a very clean PC because you have just done a Clean Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be other options once you get into BIOS.&nbsp; You may get better advice on this from some one else.&nbsp; There might be a Repair option.&nbsp; There is another option where I believe if you do 3 re-starts in a row, you may kick into repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it almost comes down to your data.&nbsp; If your data is not important, then my approach is the less painful.&nbsp; If your data is important, then you can see if you can trigger a Repair via BIOS or other means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.&nbsp; Post back as to your desired option.&nbsp; First off, you need to get a responsive PC without using an O/S either through BIOS and triggering through multiple re-starts.&nbsp; I have never tried any thing other than BIOS on a PC with a fried O/S.&nbsp; Post
 back or search other threads if you are not familiar with BIOS.</p>
<p>

            I've been trying to get to the new build 10149, but it doesn't show up.&nbsp; Instead I have a slew of updates that it says are available.&nbsp; Only 5 appear until I click on details, only then can I see the rest.&nbsp; I install them.&nbsp; Check for updates, it finds them
 again.&nbsp; It whips through appearing to download them and install them.&nbsp; The list dwindles to nothing. I check for updates, they all appear again and the cycle starts anew.&nbsp; And I can't see the 10158 update.<br />

<h2>            document is in use by another user</h2>
                    I have Word for Mac 2008 latest version. When I try to open some of my own files, I get an error message that says the document is being used by another user and asks if I want to open a copy. I say yes, and then it says the document is in use by another
 user or it might not be a valid Word document. Neither of these things is true. What is wrong and is there an easy way to fix it or should I call Word support?

<h3> d00gknees  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runtime Error 32809</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with a workbook that is not working in a Citrix environment. The file works correctly on my Desktop environment. Note that I'm running Excel 2010 in both environments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the following test to try and determine the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open a copy of the file on my Desktop and another on the Citrix Desktop. In the VBA Editor I open the Immediate Window and enter the following code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>?Thisworkbook.Worksheets("Setup").Range("F9").Text</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my desktop, I get the text of the cell, but on the Citrix Desktop, I get Runtime Error 32809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen references that suggest re-building the workbook, but given 20 sheets, several hundred defined names(both at workbook and worksheet level) 2,500 lines of code and a bunch of buttons and other controls, this would take days and would be very likely
 to introduce bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to this issue that doesn't require a complete rebuild of the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to grant permissions AND automap a calendar through powershell&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I am trying to set calendar permissions through powershell and enable auto mapping so I don't have to go to every user and manually open the calendar I just gave them access to. I'm wondering if this is possible through powershell.</p>
<p>I know this is the command to grant editor access to a calendar.</p>
<pre>Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\Calendar -User *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -AccessRights Editor<br /><br />When I added "-AutoMap $true" to the end of the command it returned an error.<br /><br /></pre>
<p>Note: I am aware I can go to OWA, open the user's mailbox, share the calendar and set permissions in there as well. I am trying to achieve this in powershell because when I share the calendar through OWA the message comes from me on behalf of the "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"
 so it causes confusion for "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" as they are wondering why I want to share my calendar with them. Also it takes them opening the message and clicking on "open this calendar" which is a lot harder for some people than I would have initially thought.</p>

<p>I understand that you want to make it easy for the users to access your calendar, but there is no PowerShell command that can set up auto-mapping for a shared calendar.</p>
<p>AutoMapping Parameter is used when giving other users full access permission of a mailbox, but it’s not available for Add-MailboxFolderPermission paremeter.</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if we can set up auto-mapping for the shared calendar through PowerShell. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature to our related team:

<p>We welcome any comments from our customers so as to ensure that we can continually develop/improve products to meet our customers’ needs.</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Quickbooks won&#39;t export to Excel once I upgraded to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10. Once I did so I was no longer able to export budget reports from my Quickbooks Premiere 2016 program to excel. Quickbooks freezes every time I try to export; I have to restart the program in order for it to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a fix for this?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Placing navigation links on every page in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephanlewis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Placing navigation links on every page in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I'm looking for a way to place navigation links on every page. Both internal links (TOC) and an external link (to a master list of docs). Basically I want to create a text box containing a hypertext link and copy and paste it on every page in the same location.
 Ctrl V always shifts the text box over and down if I try to do it manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Word 2003 I had a friend write macros to not only do a "Special" cut, copy &amp; paste (in the same position)&nbsp;but to also do a "Delete" where he would search every page and if he found the same object (in the same position) he could delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that my friend (deservedly so) has become extremely popular and doesn't have time to help me out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping that Word 2010 would have created this feature - I can't have been the only one asking for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephan</p>

            What do you mean paste "shifts the box over and down"?<br />
<br />
Rather than a macro, you can insert a "Hyperlink" to a specific heading, ie TOC, or to specific files.<br />
<br />
Personally, I never liked text boxes. So I used a table instead.&nbsp; I inserted a hyperlink to the first Heading 1 in my test document and a hyperlink to a file on my drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I can select the table and paste it at the top of each page.&nbsp; I tried putting the
 hyperlinks in the Header, but they are not immediately accessible there. You have to double click to go into edit mode and only then can you &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;Click&gt; to activate the hyperlink. Probably more effort than you and your users want to go to.
<br />
<br />
Here is a link to an example file you can play with:<br />
