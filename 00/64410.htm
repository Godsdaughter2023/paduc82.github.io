<h2>            When adding a Gmail account I get error &#34;&#34;We couldn&#39;t find settings for &#34;email address&#34;. Provide us with more info and we&#39;ll try connecting again.&#34;&#34;</h2>
                    <p><i>can't add outlook.com account to mail app because its a gmail address</i></p>
<p>My Microsoft account's username is a gmail address. I did it a long time ago and don't want to change it because it will break my windows phone.
</p>
<p>So, to sign into outlook.com, I use this gmail address. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't add this account to the Windows 8 mail app however. The error I get is</p>
<p>"We couldn't find settings for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Provide us with more info and we'll try connecting again."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the boxes Domain and Username are show and are unpopulated. </p>
<p>What should I enter here? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>Hello, your default account is the Gmail account, you should be getting the mail from this account, if you are not, please go to Settings -&gt; accounts -&gt; this account and check the "Email" checkbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For other people hitting this issue when the account is not from Gmail. You can do one of 2 things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;Click&nbsp;on the Hotmail icon when adding an account, instead of Outlook</p>
<p>2) Click on Outlook icon, click Show More details, then enter the email and password, leave Domain and User as empty, but in the Server field enter "m.hotmail.com".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if that works.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One not turning on - Turning on Noise plays - Power Brick goes from White to Orange when trying to turn the Xbox on</h2>
                    
<p>When I try turning on my console it just makes the noise but doesn't turn on, neither does the Xbox icon (where you tap to turn it on - it's not lighting up).</p>
<p>The power brick light is initially white when I plug it to a power source, but about 5 seconds later, after I plug it to my Xbox, it turns back to orange, and continues repeating this for about 4 or 5 times, from white, then 5 seconds, orange, 5 seconds,
 white... Until it finally stays orange.</p>
<p>While it's orange and I try tapping the Xbox power button nothing happens, but if I do tap it while the white light is on the Xbox plays it's turning on sound but doesn't actually turns on, and the power brick light quickly turns orange again.</p>
<p>I been trying to register my Xbox to the warranty service over here on xbox.com, since I'm still in the warranty period, but it asks me for the console's serial number and &nbsp;I have no idea how I &nbsp;can get that, as the console is not turning on.</p>
<p>Anyone knows if there's a way to fix this, or, if there is another way I can find my serial number to call for warranty? I still have all my warranty papers here, so I'm not sure if I have to register my console after all.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey, there are a few videos on youtube as well as the support over here on Xbox.com. If none of the tips work for you your last resource is calling Microsoft support (just be sure to never ever try fixing your console by opening it, as you'll have to take
 the warranty sticker off, and so you'll lose your warranty).</p>
<p>After trying everything I was forced to call for Microsoft support as I was still on the warranty period. They'll try fixing it or sending a new one :).</p>
<p>Good luck, mate, if nothing works out, try giving them a call.</p>

<h2>            How Do I Extract PS1 Audio from PS1 games</h2>
                    I have some old PS1 games, (Crash, Spyro, and Final Fantasy) that I want to extract their songs from the game so I can listen to them regularly. People have the OST's on YouTube and I want to listen to them without going online. I tried VLC media player
 but the files were unreadable. Is there a program I can use?&nbsp;

<p>Similary problem occur when i click at other button.</p>
<p>May I know how to fix this prtoblem? Is there any command that I could run to make the Window back to normal again?</p>

<p><strong>thread information:</strong> </p>
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I just reinstalled Win XP.</span></p>
<p><span>I find that the mouse click is not functioning normally.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, usually when I click at File button, the menu list would stay and allow me to scroll down, but in my case the menu list just appeared in a fraction of a second, ad then it disaaperated. I need to retry many times to get the menu list.
 Similar problem occur at any button on the desktop, task bar and tool bar</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, when add a Favourite Button at the Internet Explorer 8, I click one but the URL Icon appears two time or more.</span></p>
<p><span>May I know what are the causes and how to overcome this problem? </span>

<h2>            Request to have main account inspected and possible ban reversal</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everybody, I'm posting this from a secondary account as I'm fairly sure Xbox denies you access to post anything on an account that has been permanently banned, but the main account i'm discussing has the gamertag 'Wsalu" (that's with a lowercase L instead of an uppercase I". I was banned about 6 months ago for "Abuse, Harassment, and Threats" after a long and troubled history of this type of behavior. I have to admit I was really angry when this happened as I've had a ton of time on this account with hundreds of dollars invested into it, and I'm sure as you guys know you're unable to access any content associated with that gamertag even offline once that account gets banned. The purpose of this post is to ask some questions and ask if there's any shimmer of light in a&nbsp;void of darkness that I'd be able to get one last chance of having the decision&nbsp;&nbsp;reversed, or having my communications permanently banned but be able to use my account besides that.

That's why I've had to turn to the forums. If you have contact info for the enforcement team I'd be more than happy to pursue it through that, but so far this is the only option.</p>

You're telling me that person get's a nice "better luck next time"? That the enforcement team has complete autonomy for doing whatever they want with people's accounts with no contact access from the people they're affecting, and has nobody they have to answer to? Do you know why a convict is given the chance to&nbsp;appeal dozens of times before given the death&nbsp;penalty?&nbsp;It's for the state to be absolutely sure before making an irreversible decision. &nbsp;"One and done, now move along" with account appealing just isn't right for the sake of the hypothetical.&nbsp;That's asinine, and I don't accept that as an answer.

            Hi AutoRepairLoopBlues,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Most likely you will have to go for point D, if you have executed others.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi, AutoRepairLoopBlues
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

</p><p>The internet advises to install various versions of the Visual C++ and .NET updates, but doing so does not address the problem. &nbsp;Looking in C:\Windows\System32 I see that in fact these DLLs are missing, and are not installed after the fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrei</p>

<p>Hi Uliana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code 43 usually occurs if Windows detected that there might be a driver corruption, missing driver or failed hardware on your device. For us to isolate this issue, we'd like to get the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?<br />
</li><li>What specific activity were you doing when you received Code 43?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>If you're trying to connect a Bluetooth device, please include the make and model of the device.</li><li>If possible, send us a screenshot of the complete error message you're getting.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Swamp, Does your console have a hard drive? If it does, remove the HDD and then try to boot the console. If that works, then your HDD is on the way out im sorry to say. You will need to buy another.</p>

            <p>Hey there raiders4life7.<br /><br />It sounds like you be experiencing some throttling. To check, what type of network hardware are you using and do you have any other devices connected to the network while using your Xbox One? Keep in mind, the 150-170 Mbps you're seeing is generally the max output your network can do, which won't necessarily equate to constant downloads at that speed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox One On Screen Keyboard</h2>
                    
<p>There is a problem when ever the on screen keyboard is brought up when ever searching or sending messeges, the keyboard ends up freezing on screen. This problem also makes it were you cannot bring up the main menu and the sign in, friends list, achievements,
 party, messages, notifications, settings and Snap an app screen. The only way to get around this for now is to connect a mobile device and connect with smartglass and start up an other app full screen.</p>
<p>This needs to be fixed right away.</p>

<p>Try doing a hard reset EXACTLY like this and see if it resolves the issue. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power cord
 back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational test for results. &nbsp;let us know. &nbsp;Good Luck!!</p>

            Hi Eli,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Please share minidumps first. If they are not present, please ZIP the memory dump to reduce its size so that it is easier to download/Upload.
<br />
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:
<br />

            Hi Eli, BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s) rather than that large Memory Dump file:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

    <title>Code 3 on Indie Games - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Code 3 on Indie Games</h2>
                    
<p>Hello xbox community, I have purchased the following games Total Miner: Forge, Castle Miner Z, and The End of Games. After I have updated the game Total Miner, the day after, whenever I start up any indie games it kicks me offline and a message pops up,
 and reads "The game has unexpectedly stopped working. Plesae try again. If this problem presists, contact the creator. Code 3." Has anyone got this error, if so have you gotten around this error? Please help me, so far its every indie game i play.</p>

<h2>            How to stop Windows 10 nonsense</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continue to be plagued with an annoying instance of Windows 10 which continues (and fails) trying to install on my Lenovo T520.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and hidden KB3035583; searched and deled all instances of GWX.* from my registry; and searched, taken control
 and deleted all instances of GWX.* from my hard drive (search).&nbsp; Yet the Windows 10 fairy lives on. Any suggestions.&nbsp; My last resort will be to simply re format my hard drive to factory specs and reinstall everything.</p>

            <p><span>I have advised my clients to do what I have dreaded doing for years -- turn off Automatic Windows Update.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is compounded by an incessant drive by Microsoft to install Windows 10 on your computer with out your permission.&nbsp; They keep re-installing KB3035583 (that is the enabler) on your
 computer, even if you uninstall it.&nbsp; The result is the huge download and then constant nags without an apparent way to say no.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So I have advised my clients to shut down WU.&nbsp; Once a month on the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to turn on WU and then to reject specific updates like KB3035583.&nbsp; After
 updating, they will turn automatic updates off again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 file.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer by now anyway.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is likely Win10 has already downloaded to your PC.&nbsp; If you are using windows 7, and have
<strong><span>not</span></strong> installed win10 and do not want it, here is a procedure that I have used many times and it works.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

            Thank you for the tips.&nbsp; A couple of extra options I hadn't tired yet.&nbsp; I did down load and install Windows 10 on my Lenovo T430 however I ended up setting the computer back to factory specs and then re imaging my computer.&nbsp; Although I like Windows 10
 I'll just wait to Purchas a new computer factory spec'ed for Windows 10.&nbsp; But my wife's computer was a different animal.&nbsp; Lenovo recommended against installing Windows 10 but Microsoft had other ideas. I'll try a couple of your ideas and if they don't work
 I'll just reformat the hard drive.

<em><strong>IF </strong></em>those conditions exist AND you follow the steps precisely, it will stop the Win10 invasion.&nbsp; I am absolutely confident of this.&nbsp; I have done on 10s of computers.&nbsp; It works every time.

            I downloaded Win10 and there is an option to go back to Win7. &nbsp; However it is telling me some of my files are missing and cannot go back! &nbsp; EEEEKS!!! &nbsp; So I found a link that was supposed to reinstall missing files and when I tried to go back to Win7 again
 I got the same message. &nbsp;:( &nbsp; &nbsp;Can I restore to factory and get my Win7 back? Thanks!

            Contact Dell Support immediately if you think the new computer is the problem. I don't understand if the problem is with the new computer or what you did with the old laptop. I don't know what you mean by "replicate" files to a different computer. A dead
 hard drive cannot be fixed or used or copied. Get help from Dell to unlock the new computer. Support can help you restore the original settings.&nbsp;

<p><br />
Contact those you "just bought" said system from.&nbsp; They should be your first line of support.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Given you said, "there is alot of data too complicated to mention", and yet you did mention it (nor do I understand how the data would be too complicated to mention) and you have thrown in a Lenovo laptop and something about Avast?!&nbsp; What are you saying
 - can you take a little time to explain your situation and what your grand plans were/end-goal is for all of this and what you hope to accomplish?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I suggest you invest in some external media - probably a Networked Attached Storage [NAS]device - so you can centralize the "data too complicated to mention" and also have a safe backup of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Windows 8 system (assuming that is the Dell)&nbsp;- if you are the administrator/owner - only you can lock/unlock yourself given physical limitations.&nbsp; You give it to someone who knows what they are doing (or the right Google keywords) and unless it is encrypted,
 they can likely do that and more.&nbsp; What do *you* mean by, "administrately locked out"?&nbsp; Please expand on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>What happened to the Lenovo laptop (that is unplugged) and why is it important to this conversation?&nbsp; Did you decided to use the Windows Easy Transfer utility to transfer files from one system to another and something happened?&nbsp; Or was it corrupted originally
 and that is why you have the new computer?&nbsp; And, again, how did it become part of this issue in particular?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Help us help you.&nbsp; Deep breath and start typing out some details.&nbsp; :-)</p>

    <title>Files Are Not Moved to the Recycle Bin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Files Are Not Moved to the Recycle Bin</h2>
                    
<p>My hard disk has two partitions: one is for software and the other is for data (documents, pictures, etc.)</p>
<p>When I delete a file from the software partition, Windows asks: "Are you sure you want to move this file to the Recycle Bin?"</p>
<p>But when I delete a file from the data partition, Windows asks: "Are you sure you want to permanently delete this file?"</p>
<p>When I view the Properties of my Recycle Bin, <em>neither partition </em>has a check mark in "Don't move files to the Recycle Bin. Remove files immediately when deleted."</p>
<p>It seems as though Windows is treating my data partition as a removable drive or a network drive, where files are not moved to the Recycle Bin on deletion.</p>
<p>How do I get Windows 7 to move files from my data partition to the Recycle Bin when deleted?</p>

<p>My problem is now solved.</p>
<p>Clearly, the partition with the problem was corrupted in some manner. Fortunately, this was strictly a data volume - documents, music, etc. I simply moved the data somewhere else, and then deleted the entire volume through Disk Management.</p>
<p>Next, I re-created the volume and moved my data back. Everything works as it should, including the recycle bin.</p>
