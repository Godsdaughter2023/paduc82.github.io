    <title>Visio - DXF import &#38; bad line joins - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christianovitch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio - DXF import &#38; bad line joins</h2>
                    <p>Our firm does most of its diagramming using Visio, but we very often get DXF files of source material which is then imported into Visio.&nbsp; This process works fairly smoothly--we convert the resulting CAD objects into Visio lines/curves, but Visio doesn't
 join those lines/curves into shapes.&nbsp; We have to do that manually, which is annoying, but not terribly so.&nbsp; What is highly irritating, however, is that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; Visio often seems to not realize that two lines share a common end point; we have to manually tweak one of the lines so that a contiguous joined line is created (if a shape has a gap in it, or overlapping lines, the shape cannot be correctly filled with
 patterns/fill colors); and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Visio nearly always screws up the curves.&nbsp; They appear fine, but, for some reason, joining the curves to the adjacent lines results in a non-fillable shape.&nbsp; Rather, the portions of the shape are fillable, but the overall shape doesn't fill correctly.&nbsp;
 For example, for a square with rounded corners, applying a fill color to the joined shape might result in that color being shown between the chord for each curve and the curve itself, but not within the rest of the square's interior.&nbsp; The only way to fix this
 appears to be to re-trace the curves manually and then join those to the square's sides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shouldn't be that hard--is it so difficult to make Visio take a third-party vector format file and make shapes which can be shaded without needing to retrace half the drawing?&nbsp; Am I missing something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Christian</p>

            <p>Hi Daisy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I used the wrong terminology when I said "we convert the resulting CAD objects into Visio lines/curves."&nbsp; We already do the conversion process you mention above--that's how we transform the CAD object into a Visio-editable format.&nbsp; The "shapes" which
 result from conversion are all lines and curves--it doesn't produce any "shapes" more complex than a circle or possibly a rectangle.&nbsp; As a result, we have to perform a "join" operation on the line segments which outline a shape--this should turn them into
 a shadable, patternable Visio shape.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Visio does an awful job of it and you essentially have to re-draw all the curvy bits and then join the new shapes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas?&nbsp; This has to be a common gripe about CAD import.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christian</p>

            I think the problem might be more to do with th DXF export format, the exported file consists of these disjointed line fragments. When imported into Visio there is nothing to say they are joined and just because one line starts where another ends it does
 not imply that the lines are joined. It would probably be over presumptious for Visio to do other than import this data as line fragments.<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I agree that it might be presumptuous for Visio to assume that line segments with common vertices should be joined, but I've resigned myself to having to join line segments manually using the "join" Shape Operation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, my main complaint is that Visio seems to feel compelled to add lines which aren't present in the DXF to my image.&nbsp; It's really best illustrated using a picture, so I added a link below which shows an example.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/christianovitch/October3201103?authuser=0&amp;feat=directlink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://picasaweb.google.com/christianovitch/October3201103?authuser=0&amp;feat=directlink</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, when Visio runs into a curved line segment, it fails to join it with neighboring line segments correctly and seems to insert an invisible, straight "chord" line running from one end of the arc to the other.&nbsp; This invisible line is integrated into
 the joined shape, and causes any fill operations (or subsequent "trim" operations) to have unexpected and undesired results.&nbsp; This treatment of curved line segments really can't be blamed on DXF format files--this is a Visio issue.</p>

            Looking for a resolution to the problem Christian describes.&nbsp; I have been battling the same issue.&nbsp; I have reconciled the start and end vertices in the Shapesheet's Geometry sections to ensure line and arc end points align to form a closed shape, but the
 Format&gt;Fill only fills/shades the area inside of the 'chord' lines of the arcs.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Jeff &nbsp; <br />
<br />
I found a solution to the problem of Visio viewing lines or segments of arc as separate entities, or filling joined line/arc combinations inappropriately, when in fact we intended for them to be filled as closed figures.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As I mentioned above, working with the Shape Sheet's Geometry section to reconcile the end points to form a closed shape is part of the solution.&nbsp; The part I learned later is that use of line segments from 'Drawing Tool Shapes' does not result in a line that
 is readily integrated with a series of arcs or other lines to become a closed shape.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I found that I needed to replace the line segments I originally created with "Drawing Tool Shape' with lines draws using 'Drawing Tools' in the Toolbar options.
<br />
<br />
Once I replaced the errant line segments, reconciling the end points in the Geometry section of the Shape Sheet for the structure was almost 'automatic'. It became a case of ensuring the beginning and ending X,Y coordinates matched.&nbsp; Clicking on a cell in the
 Geometry section causes a box to appear on the drawing, where the X,Y coordinate exists. Directly edit the contents of the X and Y cells to change the values to match the end point you want to join to.<br />
<br />
Ensure the value for the Geometry1.NoFill field in the Shape Sheet is "FALSE" then select the structure, select Format, then 'Fill' to cause the closed structure to be filled.
<br />
<br />
This still doesn't solve the problem of structures in DFX files being imported as 'open' structures, but I wonder if the 'lines' in the converted DFX files are coming into Visio with characteristics similar to the lines I found are created through the 'Drawing
 Tool Shapes' selection. Once these line segments were replaced with lines created with the snap to endpoint capability used by the Drawing Tools line segment in Toolbar options, the end points of those replacement lines were able to be readily joined with
 arc segments' end points in the Shape Sheet. <br />
<br />

            I have a similar problem with joining line segments but it does not require that I import a .dxf file to demonstrate it.<br />
<br />
I draw a series of independent arcs and use the size &amp; position helper to align the start and end points.&nbsp; Arcs I have created in this fashion join together flawlessly.&nbsp; After I have two or more joined arc segments I attempt to draw an arc from the end point
 of one series of joined arcs to the beginning point of another using the pencil tool.&nbsp; Then I highlight both and join them together.<br />
<br />
The Join works for treating the joined segments as a complex line.&nbsp; I can drag-and-drop the joined lines as if they are one. I can also change the line color or thickness of the line with a single command.&nbsp; But if I attempt to close the opposing ends of the
 complex line the resulting shape will not fill properly, acting as if the start x,y and end x,y of one or more of the joined line segments has been reversed.&nbsp; This opinion is further reenforced if I use the pencil tool to attempt to adjust individual arcs.&nbsp;
 On some of arcs drawn with the pencil tool when I pull the arc larger or smaller the reaction is opposite to that commanded (e.g., pull the curve dot upward, release the mouse button and the arc jumps an equivalent amount downward from the original location).<br />
<br />
Zooming in to 1000% on the start or end point of the problem arc shows that there are actually two disconnected segments with start and end points very close together but not actually joined.&nbsp; Deleting either of the disconnected points causes a segment of the
 complex line to be deleted but the remainder of the complex line is not effected.&nbsp; --more like two complex lines have been grouped rather than joined.<br />
<br />
It is not possible to position the offending start-end points exactly on top of each other since there is no size&amp;position helper for individual points. Therefore the discontinuity in the line always remains.<br />
<br />
When I export this complex line to a .dxf it is exported as a complex line but there will be a discontinuity where the complex lines were 'joined.'<br />
<br />
Oops, just realized, this is a Visio 2007 forum. I am running Visio 2010.&nbsp; Any of you considering upgrading to 2010 to solve this problem will have to wait a bit longer.<br />

    <title>how do I level resources in microsoft project 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean graham 101  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I level resources in microsoft project 2010</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a fairly involved 400 task project schedule with three main types of work, and two available crews for each type of work.&nbsp; Each task is linked to at least one other task.&nbsp; Now that I've got the logic straight, and assigned resources(crews) to my tasks,
 my resource useage ranges from half-utilization to 600%.&nbsp; I'd like to start leveling but am not really sure where to start.
<br />
<br />
I have tried to attack it manually in simple Levelling Gantt but end up in circular iterations (ie shifting things ahead only to be overallocated elsewhere).&nbsp; I've also tried the auto-leveling function but when I ask it to respect available slack, it says no-can
 do.&nbsp; When I ask it to auto-level without respecting the slack it splits tasks that I don't want it to.&nbsp; Also, it seems when I switch a group of tasks to "auto-schedule", or when I assign a calendar to a group of tasks, it levels the resources with unintended
 consequences on my task sequencing.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering where is the best place to begin here...any advice?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Reilly<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can exclude tasks and/or resources from leveling:</p>
<p>1. Tasks: set priority to 1000, leveling wll then not move that task</p>
<p>2. Resources: in resource sheet show the column Can Level, and set to No for resources that shouldn't be leveled.</p>

<p>thanks for answering</p>
<p>I don't think it is so simple, indeed there is no printer after checking with your suggestion,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even tried to follow the suggestion in</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I did NOT find any driver for the Onenote printer</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also surprising the response of&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernd P. who claims no printer should be available with the Windows 10 App, although I am sure it was there initially.</p>

 mail merge, ZIP DIST and RSVP; ZIP DIST contains a number indicating the distance between the invitee and the meeting hall, and RSVP contains "Yes", "No" or blanks, indicating whether the invitee has responded to the invitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Word document, to select only those invitees within 50 miles of the meeting hall who have not declined the invite I do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the Mailing ribbon.</li><li>Click Edit Recipient List in the Start Mail Merge group.</li><li>Click Filter under Refine recipient list.</li><li>Setup the filter as</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf4b9a53-0fa1-4fa2-a5a7-68aca9882f7b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf4b9a53-0fa1-4fa2-a5a7-68aca9882f7b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>To create the mailing I then do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click Finish and Merge in the Finish group.</li><li>Click Edit Individual Documents...</li><li>Click radiobutton All in the Merge to New Document dialog.</li><li>Click OK.</li></ol>
<p>I end up with a document containing 90 letters including invitees with a ZIP DIST greater than 50 but no invitees with a "yes" or "No" in RSVP. So it seems that the filter on RSVP works, but the filter on ZIP DIST does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get around this problem, I can create a column with a formula column that yields a TRUE or FALSE for the above filter criteria, and then use that column to filter, but I shouldn't have to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the problem?</p>
<p>

            It is as a result of using mail merge over a period of many years, going back to the earliest versions of Word, from which mail merge has not really changed, that I have come to that opinon.&nbsp; It is nothing new to Word 2016.

<p>FWIW I agree with Doug, because although there has long been a problem in Word there has never been any sign that Microsoft has any intention of fixing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are at least two problems that can affect what Word retrieves:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. columns with "mixed data types"</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. a long-term problem in Word to do with the way it generates the SQL query from your criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The criteria in the dialog box are translated internally by Word into a piece of SQL that (should be) appropriate for the "database" you are using. For Excel, by default Word uses the ACE OLE DB driver, which basically uses the same SQL dialect as Microsoft
 Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we might hope that the SQL generated would be something like</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT * FROM `Sheet1$` WHERE `ZIP DIST` &lt;= 50 AND `RSVP` &lt;&gt; 'Yes' AND `RSVP` &lt;&gt; 'No'</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Word generates different SQL depending on the type of data it thinks is in each column (for an Excel data source, it will be able to find out the data types (NUMBER&lt; TEXT, DATE etc.) from the OLE DB Provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in this case, it will probably decide that RSVP is TEXT, and in that case, it will instead generate something more like</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT * FROM `Sheet1$` WHERE `ZIP DIST` &lt;= 50 AND (`RSVP` IS NULL OR `RSVP` &lt;&gt; 'Yes') AND (`RSVP` IS NULL OR `RSVP` &lt;&gt; 'No')</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is to do with the fact that as far as SQL is concerned, NULL values can exist (and may be different from a zero-length string such as '') and you can't "=" or "&lt;&gt;" NULL. In other words, if there is a record where RSVP is NULL, it will
<em>not</em> be retrieved by a query that says SELECT * WHERE `RSVP` &lt;&gt; 'Yes'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that Word has decided to expand each of those RSVP criteria into 2 criteria, it cannot stop itself. If you go back into the Filter dialog, you will probably now see 5 lines of criteria. Next time, possibly 9. Word only really a smaller number, and sooner
 or later it will generate a piece of SQL where you get an OR where there should be an AND. At that point, you will see ZIP DIST values greater than 50.<br />
</p>
<p>If you can use Word VBA, you can inspect the generated query string by issuing the following command in the Immediate window when your mail merge main document is the active document:<br />
<br />
?ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.QueryString</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect in your case the ZIP DIST is not the problem, but if it is actually a text value, or if the OLE DB provider has decided that it is a text value, then you will get the same problem for that column.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If for some reason you have text values in the first 8 rows (say) of your table, the provider will decide that the column has data type TEXT and will convert susequent numbers to text. Because it's text, you will get that extra "IS NULL" test for ZIP DIST
 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the provider thinks ZIP DIST is numeric, Word just does the obvious test and does not test for NULL. But that doesn't matter because the problem is caused by those other tests for NULL.<br />
<br />
IMO Microsoft could probably fix the problem by saving your criteria as you entered them and not trying to reconstruct them from the SQL it generated. I don't see any sign that it does so. I believe it could also do better on the "mixed data types" issue, too,
 but that is probably not the problem in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to fix it outside Excel, there are various possibilities, but they all involve "extra steps" or code and as with many workarounds, each approach tends to solve one set of problems and not another.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen in several postings that you state "...data manipulation is best done in the data source...", no offense - I disagree.&nbsp; In most environments a list is not created for a single purpose. &nbsp; Manipulating the original spreadsheet is not the answer to
 a bug in an application that has a feature specifically for the purpose of pulling the data that you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the filter feature for YEARS and honestly never encountered this issue until today!&nbsp; The spreadsheet that I'm connecting to is not just used by me so to manipulate the data is irresponsible and inconsiderate. Yes, I understand I could make a
 copy of the file, manipulate the data and then complete my mail merge; but why?&nbsp; If the developers of MS Word has incorporated a feature into an application, then be sure it works for the general purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't take this post as being nasty or condescending, I'm just offering another point of view.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but I already did when I received the announcement directly from Here, that was why I posted my question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Here Blog entry documents&nbsp;Here's strategy and position, motivating my search for the Microsoft&nbsp;position and strategy to resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could find nothing specific.&nbsp; Was surprised to find so little info.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Microsoft strategy and position is not built around HERE Drive. There plenty of other navigation apps by companies that have many other navigation products and have been doing this longer than HERE,</p>
<p>CoPilot GPS, Navigon and others</p>

            <p>Actually, that is the Microsoft position, if you read the HERE Blog post and accept it as factual regarding Microsoft's use of HERE technology. &nbsp; I am aware of the other navigation products, but chose to use Here Drive+ for its features and function, which
 lead me to the purchase of the phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am specifically seeking Microsoft confirmation of the HERE statement&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HERE announcement states:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The Windows Maps app contains many HERE elements</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;since

            <p>Really don't see what you are getting at.</p>
<p>In the end Microsoft did not acquire the mapping service. They license Nokia's mapping service and Nokia retained ownership. They did integrate some into their Maps app.&nbsp; There is nothing to comment on. They had the license&nbsp;to use Nokia’s mapping services
 and integrated that into Maps. </p>
<p>&nbsp;The second link in the HERE statement is not correct. Last year Nokia sold all of HERE products.</p>

            <p>Well the point that I am seeking confirmation on is that the functionality of Here Drive+ will or will not &nbsp;be delivered by Microsoft Maps app as implied by the by Here statement from their blog. &nbsp;I appreciate but am not seeking the personal opinions of
 Community members, but I am seeking their help in finding references to Microsoft corporate statements regarding the future features and function of the Microsoft Maps app for the windows phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue for me is that my 925 is old and having issues and the fact that Here Drive+ is my most important app on the phone. &nbsp;I have tried most of the others apps available through the store , but the turn by turn voice instructions, and quality &nbsp;of the
 downloadable maps are what got me to opt for the phone in the first place. &nbsp;I have found nothing that works as well. &nbsp; I know I can opt for a platform supported by Here, but I want to stick with a Windows phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, Nokia sold all of their Here products to a consortium of German car manufactures. &nbsp;That consortium is who put out the notice (I am assuming) that Here Drive+ will not be supported on Windows 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that there was an error in the Here statement, what specifically, just curious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I did reply to this by email a month ago but have just realised that the message was not delivered. My response was:</p>
 rooted and have made no modifications other than the android os automatically updated. Perhaps this is the cause. All other apps work fine, including other email apps but I prefer outlook.</span>
<div>
I created another windows account to check what happens and outlook behaved the same ie closed with the same message when I tried to open an email in the inbox</div>

            These messages began soon after Microsoft announced it was not supporting this last version of outlook for android. &nbsp;This version is right before version that has the 'focus' inbox that can be turned on or off but no longer updated the devices calendar
 or contacts. &nbsp;Everyone went back to this prior version because it worked. &nbsp;Instead of fixing issues with latest version, it remains faulty and now the only version that did work gets gutted. &nbsp;Same ms m.o.

            I had the same problem. But at the same time multiple other apps also stopped working so that made me think the problem was something else rather than the outlook app.I even updated the outlook app as well as all the other apps that weren't working but
 none of then would work.I then noticed that there was 2 copies of the outlook app. The original old one and the newer one that I installed (during my attemps to fix all the apps that stopped working).&nbsp;I then deleted to old outlook app. Suddenly low and behold
 all the apps srarted working again and the outlook error message dissappear. Woot!This was my solution. Give it a try

<h2>            Wifi Settings Question...</h2>
                    
<p>I was messing around testing something with Wifi -but I really don't like to run on that often due to battery issues.&nbsp; I changed it back - but there is one setting "grayed out" that I am unable to "uncheck."&nbsp; See print screen...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get to that grayed out setting so I can change it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>change the 'connect automatically' to something different and the option should appear. if youre concerned about battery life, set it to 'always ask'</p>

            In addition to what others have suggested, you should be able to find most symbols through the symbol dialog (Insert tab &gt; Symbols &gt; More symbols).&nbsp; If you don't find the symbol you want when the font selected is "(normal text)" --which is the font at
 the insertion point in the document-- change the font in the symbols dialog to Arial Unicode and Cambria Math to look for them.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you know the symbol's Unicode value, you can&nbsp; type the value in the document and press Alt+x.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Lumia 640 all calendar entries moved back a day - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 640 all calendar entries moved back a day</h2>
                    <p>I woke up this morning to find all my diary entries on the calendar have moved back by 24 hours. The phone is synced to the correct date and time but all my entries with appointments have moved - everything I've booked for today is now on yesterdays calendar
 date. It's done this overnight, with every entry I've placed since January 2016 and all future appointments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm lost without an accurate calendar, I don't keep paper records anymore and use my calendar to plan my life!</p>
<p>Does anyone have the same issue and can it be rectified without cancelling every entry and re-entering it on the correct day?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Yes I've checked it for updates, it's up to date, I've turned it off and on again.</p>
<p>It changed all the dates of my entries overnight on 7/9/16.</p>
<p>I've tried unsyncing my emails to calendar on the phone then resetting them. I then deleted my email accounts from my phone and re entered them. &nbsp;I've checked my date/time settings which are correct. I've checked my location and time zone etc, its correct
 and hasn't made any difference when I changed it. I've logged onto my outlook account on the computer and unsynced my email accounts - still no change. I've tried unchecking the different accounts attached to my calendar but it remains one day out still.</p>
<p>What else can I try?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            Thanks for getting back to us. we suggest you perform a hard reset on your Windows Phone first. The hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings,
 etc&nbsp;will be removed from the phone. Then, turn on your <strong>backup</strong> under Settings so you can restore your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account). Note that resetting
 your device will not remove any OS or firmware updates. You will remain on the same version of Windows Phone after the reset.
<p>If you can turn on your device you can reset your phone under Settings:<strong> Settings
</strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone<br />
</strong>This procedure is described in details in this <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/basics/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">official how-to article</a>.

<p>If your phone is unresponsive and you can't reach <span><strong>Settings </strong>
</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />, you can reset your phone using the hardware buttons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong> </span>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />and

<p>When you feel the vibration, release the buttons, and then immediately press and hold the
<span><strong>volume down</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button until you see a large exclamation mark.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once the exclamation mark appears, press the following four buttons in this order:
<span><strong>volume up</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f6bd43a94-9d17-4c2d-8124-ac977d0da8b5%2fhardware-icon-volumeUP-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />,

Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take
 a while for the reset to finish.)</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The hard reset operation will take a while to complete and will show spinning gears before it reboots your device to factory settings. Usually it will finish within 30 minutes but can, in some rare cases, take up to a couple of hours. Some older Nokia Lumia
 handsets have a bug where a reset never seems to finish. If that should happen to you, check this

            <p>Thank you</p>
<p>I've reset my phone to factory settings and the phone's back working now but it hasn't resolved the problem.</p>
<p>The diary events are still one day out. Checking my calendar on my PC I can see that the discrepancy starts on 31st August, the calendar has merged the events from Wednesday 31st with Thursday 1st and from then on it's one day out. The calendar on my PC
 has changed my diary schedule too - it's not just the phone, I don't check the PC so hadn't realised this until now.</p>
<p>I store all reservation numbers, postcodes of appointment and important info on my calendar, it's confusing being one day out. Any other ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks again</p>
<p>Sam</p>

            <p>Some other issues are corrected by setting the time, date and time zone manually on the phone instead of automatic - but this is not likely to work when the entries in the cloud are messed up too.</p>

</p><p>Is it is outlook calendar live.com I use. I'm at a loss to know what to do, the calendar is useless as it is. I've done everything suggested with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a poor service from Microsoft when there is no way of contacting them directly to help, I know others have raised this problem, there's several questions on this site about it but no solution has been given.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly it's time for me to move away from Microsoft to a system with better customer service and working apps. Even this site on my mobile is impossible to write a reply on or navigate around.</p>

Compatibility issues with Google/Apple calendars, and with imported calendars from other sources, even Microsoft's own Outlook, have persisted on outlook.com for years. It's one of my favourite rants, since the transfer of contacts skewed my contact's birthdays
 by one or two days. - Just some of them, not all, amazingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume newly added events sync and appear correctly? - And single-instance events
<a href="https://support.office.com/article/0dd86c69-18f3-4f73-9d3d-375bdc9c3e34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
disappear from the phone after two weeks ...</a> after the Outlook Mail upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access to historical calendar data on Windows phone sadly never had any priority for Microsoft, so I moved to a hosted Open-Xchange and got a new battery for the Nokia N8, early 2016. Recurring calendar events got messed up on my Microsoft account back then,
 along with unwanted auto-linking of contacts with Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know for sure if other manufacturers do better? My busy friends still use a paper diary and a shared cardboard calendar on the refrigerator.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, you can't control the color of it.&nbsp; You might even be able to get it to color differently if you add emphasis to the text in the caption.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will need to change the design selection or some of the formatting choices on the image

            <p>It sounds like you're referring to captions that can appear collapsed on top of Image/Video elements.&nbsp; If that is the case, there is no way to change the background on them right now.&nbsp; If you want to change it, there are other Design/Layout combinations
 that display captions differently (i.e. next to the image or below it).</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Switching back to Hotmail will chaged back your interface from Outlook to Hotmail but it won't automatically change your email address back to your original
 address @hotmail.com. You'll need to rename the account back your Hotmail address manually. To do so, please follow the steps provided below:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: The following steps will currently only work if your previous account was @Hotmail, @Live or @Outlook ending in .com, .jp, .kr, es, .au, .ca, etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This rename process will not work if you previously renamed an @MSN.com account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is no way to rename an @Outlook, @Hotmail or @Live account back to an @MSN.com account at this time.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In your browser, navigate to https://account.live.com/ManageAssocIds</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sign in with your new @outlook, @hotmail or @live account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(if you are already signed in with your outlook.com account this step will not apply)</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under “Other email addresses” click the Remove link below your previous address.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Remove button to confirm the message.</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should now see a message on the page stating, “You've removed an email address from your Microsoft account.”</span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to https://account.live.com/ChangeId.aspx in your browser.</span></p>
<p><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Verify that “Create a new email address” is selected.</span></p>
<p><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the New Microsoft account box, enter your previous address and select your previous domain (hotmail.com or live.com).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Note:<span>&nbsp; </span>You must enter your previous address or the process will fail.</span></p>
<p><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the Save button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now you can use your original @Hotmail, @Live.com or @Outlook account to sign into your Microsoft services as you did before renaming your account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The @Outlook, @Hotmail or @Live address will now be an alias on your account from which you can still send and receive messages within Outlook or Hotmail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            <p>Hi Kushthakar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is facing some issues about CYAN update for a Developer Preview WP 8.1.</p>
<p>You have to Downgrade your LUMIA to WP 8 using NOKIA Software Recovery tool then only you will be able to get a CYAN update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>'BUT'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is going to release a WP 8.1 GDR 1 update in next week as a Developer Preview.</p>
<p>I will suggest you to stay on 8.1 Dev Preview and you will get OTA update next week automatically without downgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So wait up till next week. :)&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Send Cancellation button missing when cancel meeting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Send Cancellation button missing when cancel meeting</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes when I cancel a meeting, the "Send Cancellation" button does not appear (in its place is a "send update" button).&nbsp; When I click "Cancel Meeting", the meeting page closes and the meeting is deleted from my calendar, but is
 not deleted from the calendars of the invitees and I don't have the option to "Send Cancellation." Does anyone know how to ensure that the "Send Cancellation" option appears every time I cancel a meeting?</span></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi pari_95 41,
<br />When you are in the <a href="https://outlook.live.com/calendar/view/month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/calendar/view/month</a> Select meeting when you click Cancel do you not get a popup box that says Cancel Event and notify guests? 
<br />Could you please send more detail as how you are canceling the meeting. 
<br />I have tried to recreate in Outlook.com and my Outlook application. If it is not working as it should I would try to repair Office if using an outlook application.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />If your using a web version then Clear Browser Cache. With your browser open:
<br />On your keyboard hold the CRLT Key and the Shift Key together then press the delete button on your keyboard. This will bring up a pop up to clear or delete Browsing Data. Leave defaults selected. I usually leave my Passwords unchecked. Then Select Clear Data, or Delete or Clear now depending on your browser.
<br />
<br />Could you add a screenshot of the problem please. 
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/fdbk_commsite-fdbk_getstart/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/fo...</a>
<br />So I can further troubleshoot the problem if the above does not solve your problem. Your in the outlook.com forum so if your using an application please let me know which one. 
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Sam

<h2>            N95 update prblm, Nokia Refuse to repare &#33;</h2>
                    Update N95 killed my phone. I followed the update procedure as nokia mantioned. This is not my fault!<br />
I bought it in Dubai but now I'm in France for 6 months.<br />
Nokia refuse to repare, the say guarantie is not available in FRANCE!<br />
<br />
I should ask a visa to NOKIA before travelling abroad?

            Warranties only apply to the country of purchase and only if that model was for that country. The only exception to this is if you buy a european model as the warranty on these is valid all over europe.<br />
<br />
Nokia clearly state the warranty terms on their websites.<br />
<br />
Most companies operate in this way, for example if you import an ipod from the US for use in the UK the warranty isn't valid.

            <p>Hello DineshKulkarni,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you to share your Internet connection with your laptop or another device, make sure that your mobile operator allows you Internet sharing. If your mobile subscription plan has Internet sharing, I would advise following the troubleshooting steps at the
 link below, about how to share your connection.</p>

<h2>            visual basic code for deleting the FIRST shape in my word doc</h2>
                    I have a text box at the beginning of my word docs that instructs the user to do a few things. When they are done, I would like a macro to delete the text box. I used the following, and it works great IF THERE IS ONLY ONE TEXT BOX IN MY DOCUMENT. Unfortunately
 (of course) sometimes there is more than one text box. How can I modify this to have it delete the FIRST text box only?

The code should delete the the first shape added to the document.<br />
