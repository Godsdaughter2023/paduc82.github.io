<h2>            Favourite Bar changes in Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to move the favourite websites around on the favourites bar as they are currently showing in alphabetical order which means the sites I use most often are not all showing?&nbsp; I have tried to drag and drop them to move but this does not seem
 to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help gratefully received.</p>

            <p>This question seems to have been asked so many times before and as far as I know has still not been answered, my shortcuts in the favourites bar run from Z to A, cannot even get them to run from A to Z never mind arrange them as I would like them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technology has to be there as you can do it in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a fatal flaw in Microsoft Edge and will make users look for an alternative, so come on Microsoft do something about it, or at least tell us that you are looking to correct the situation.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 A1 Plus for students, no access to OneDrive and other apps</h2>
                    <p>I just created an Office 365 A1 Plus for students and looking at my licences. It seems I'm missing some apps such as OneDrive and SharePoint which I assumed was in the package. Is this not the case?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I try to access OneDrive&nbsp;using my University email, it sends me to my account portal. When I try accessing OneDrive on my windows I get an error stating ''Your OneDrive has not been setup'' with an error code 08004de90&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Zee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, the OneDrive will start setting up when the user clicks OneDrive app icon in his account portal the first time. And the setting up can take up to 24 hours. Therefore, please make sure you sign in to your account portal &gt; Click the OneDrive app
 icon from your app launch bar. </p>
<p>If OneDrive is still not set up well after 24 hours, please provide us the information below:</p>
<ol>
<li>The screenshot about the error message.</li><li>Your account information. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please access it via

    <title>Check if record exists, form option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mel_s.90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Check if record exists, form option</h2>
                    <p>Q: Is there a form option to automatically when a combination&nbsp;of values already exists?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a database of people who participated in an event and I&nbsp;made a form to enter the participants. All participants of the first event have been entered and now I'm moving on to the subsequent years. Some people participated in more than one event and
 I anticipated&nbsp;on this by creating a table and a subform for the events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't want any double entries. So I would need a to include to my form an option that recognizes whether the combination of 'first name' 'surname' 'date of birth' and 'place of birth' already exists.&nbsp; Ideally, it would bring me automatically to
 that existing form entry so that I only have to include the new event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, such an option exists, I don't have any knowledge of mSQL but if that is the only way to do it I'm of course&nbsp;willing to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            You could use four unbound text boxes on your form for entering the information:
<br />txtFName
<br />txtLName
<br />txtBirthDate
<br />txtBirthPlace
<br />
<br />Then after the four have values, you can use DLookup() in code to find the primary key of your table where the four values match. If the DLookup() doesn't return a value, then the person is new and you can append their information to your table and proceed. If the primary key value is found you can display the information. 
<br />
<br />We would need to know the table and field names and data types to get more specific.

            I'm not sure of your work flow. You need at least three tables here. You need a participants table, an events table and an attendance table. To enter data you should use a Main form bound to the Events Table and a subform bound to the Attendance table. Select the Event in the main form and the subform will have a Combobox to select the participants. The combo would have a Rowsource like this:
<br />
<br />SELECT ParticipantID, Surname &amp; ", " &amp; Firstname &amp; " " &amp; DOB &amp; " " &amp; BirthPlace
<br />FROM tblParticipants
<br />ORDER BY Surname, Firstname;
<br />
<br />You then select the participant. If the participant isnt listed you use the Not In List event of the combo to add them.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that the Bitlocker encryption you have for Windows 8.1 will remain the same even if you upgrade to Windows 10 therefore there's nothing to worry about.&nbsp; The files will be encrypted the same way it is in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any queries related to upgrading to Windows 10, let us know. We will be glad to help.

<h2>            Why do some links work and some not</h2>
                    
<p>I've just bought a new hp desktop that has Win 7 home prem 64 bit and IE 8 preloaded.&nbsp; I'm running IE 8 32 bit.&nbsp; On some websites, I have encountered typical underlined hyperlinks that do nothing at all when I click on them, but if I click on other links
 on exactly the same page, the links work properly and I navigate to the site or page correctly.&nbsp; This is occurring with no apparent pattern I can detect, and I'm quite sure it is occurring on web pages I've used with no problems at all running my old puter
 with Win XP Pro SP2 and IE 6.</p>
<p>I have not explored whether or not I have any special software like java or flash.&nbsp; I don't even know what those programs are.&nbsp; I expected Win 7 and IE 8 to work right (yeah, right) right out of the box, and they're not.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong, or what do I need to download and install to fix this annoying problem?</p>

    <title>My Office 2013 keeps crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nothxjeff  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Office 2013 keeps crashing</h2>
                    Good afternoon,<br />
<br />
My entire Office 2013 keeps crashing. For example: I start up Word 2013, and after 2 or 3 minutes of reading/writing/editing/saving it just freezes with the message that 'it does not respond'. Same applies for PowerPoint and Excel (programs I use regularly).
 Please please help me out with this one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've tried to put off the bluetooth add-in, I've tried a repair, I've tried to run Word (for example) in safe mode, I've tried to update my NVIDIA drivers, I've tried to delete some register keys, I've tried a full uninstall (using a third party program, because
 my uninstaller also gets stuck during the uninstalling phase) and reinstall, but it all didn't work and I'm getting a little bit grumpy. I've even tried the Microsoft fixit....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

            Hello BobFisher48,
<br />
<br />There was indeed a service outrage yesterday at Microsoft's end for a subset of users with Outlook.com in the impacted infrastructure. It is now fully fixed.
<br />
<br />You may like to try clearing your DNS revolver caches first: <code>Win</code>+<code>R</code> and enter <code>cmd.exe</code> then key in <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code>
<br />
<br />After you have changed your Outlook.com password, you need to change your password in Microsoft Outlook. 
<br />
<br />You may want to refer to this helpful article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-or-update-your-email-password-58b62e89-6a9b-467b-8865-d5633fcacc3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are using Outlook 2010,
<br />
<br />1. Open Outlook and right click on your mail account, select Data File Properties.
<br />2. Click Advanced &gt; Change Password. Enter your old password then your new one and confirm it.
<br />3. Click OK. Exit out of all windows.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that works.
<br />
<br />I am sorry for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Sutharsan       
        </p>

<p>I need help now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook on my laptop is out of action, repeatedly asks for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook on my Android phone has now stopped too, although I used the authenticator as instructed by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the password was now used to access all MS logins, accounts on computers, Hotmail, OneDrive, etc.&nbsp; Apparently not as one of my two laptops accepts yesterday's password, the other one today's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I tell Outlook, MS, laptops, etc, to use one password?</p>

<p>Right, I have reset my password, again, and now all seems to be OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems obvious to me that the whole problem was caused by MS failures with Outlook yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Why were customers not notified there was an issue with Outlook?&nbsp; It took me a lot of time to establish the fault was not at my end.</li><li>When will MS issue a report&nbsp; regarding their failures with Outlook yesterday, including lessons learned to avoid repetitions?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Why do we poor customers keep suffering from MS' failures with updates?&nbsp; I have lost a lot of time and money sorting out problems caused to my equipment previously by MS, and I doubt very much that I am alone.</li><li>I have lost use of my equipment for nearly two days, will MS be giving out refunds to Office 365 customers like me?</li><li>When will you fix the ongoing problem with Outlook deleting emails from the inbox? I have raised this issue twice, with many updates and have never received any help.&nbsp; I can forward about 40 emails from other customers with the same issue so I know this
 is quite common.</li></ol>

            Dear Bob,
<br />
<br />Thank you for the information, I am glad you can access your account.
<br />
<br />I am not Microsoft employee, I am a user like you trying to help out.
<br />
<br />If you want to leave feedback about this I suggest leaving it here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com</a> so developers would know what do you think.
<br />
<br />Or you can call Customer Service in your region <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a>

<p>Thanks for your help and support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried leaving feedback, but the site froze and I'm not about to waste even more time.&nbsp; Another example of MS attitude to criticism?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be in Hong Kong in a week or so and will try to call the hotline there to let them know about the disgusting service their parent company provides, and to see if they can fix the years long issue with deleted emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people would think it reasonable that a responsible company would provide their own staff to do what you are doing, and to monitor sites like this.&nbsp; Hey, if MS were that good we wouldn't have these issues in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, please don't think any of my criticisms are aimed at you, I'm glad for your help.</p>

            Dear Bob,
<br />
<br />If you could not leave feedback at UserVoice it might be related to the browser. I went and looked for some new requests and I could see that they are appearing, and I was able to vote ( this is basically how I could test it ) You could try to use another browser or inPrivate browsing.
<br />
<br />I wish I could help more, but I am a user like yourself. I also had some problems with Microsoft products, but not only with them. Here at least users have online access to the free resources and manuals and basically can find everything for the products (I mean such resources as support.office.com , docs.microsoft.com , MSDN and etc. )
<br />
<br />I wish you safe trip.

    <title>Trouble with exchange and pop3 account rules - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjkjj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble with exchange and pop3 account rules</h2>
                    
<p>Can someone assist. I run Outlook 2010 with an exchange account. When i add a POP3 account, outlook rules I create gets applied to both exchange and the pop3 account ( Rules &amp; Alerts shows APPLY CHANGES TO THIS FOLDER: ) and both exchange and pop3 are grouped
 together.</p>
<p>If I create an exchange account, or two exchange accounts, or one exchange plus one IMAP account - then the rules are applied seperately and the APPLY CHANGES TO THIS FOLDER permits me to select which account the rules apply to.</p>
<p>What I need is the ability to create rules so that i can (1) exchange rules get applied on the server level and applies only to exchange emails, (2) pop3 rules get applied only to the pop3 account</p>
<p>I must add that I have seperate .pst file for my pop3 account.</p>
<p>Any ideas ? This is wierd that Microsoft does not permit this.</p>

<h2>            Haven&#39;t received any emails since last Wednesday</h2>
                    Hi Since returning to the UK last Wednesday after being away on holiday, i haven't received any emails to my outlook account. &nbsp;I took my Macbook and phone to Apple thinking it was a problem there but it wasn't and i was told it was an issue with outlook.
 &nbsp;I am pulling my hair out and don't understand how all of a sudden it just stops. &nbsp;At first i wondered if it was something to do with me returning to the UK but i never took my macbook away and whilst away was able to access my emails on my phone and iPad.
 &nbsp;I use the email address for all my correspondence but am now considering just getting rid of it completely as it just seems to have no end of issues. &nbsp;If anyone could offer me any assistance in resolving the matter it would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks
 in advance.

<h2>            Why does Word &#40;Office365&#41; keep auto-adjusting column widths&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Word is continually forcing unwanted column widths on me, and apparently many others per other posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Auto-size/fit is NOT on for the whole table. Tried to manually enter width # in "Cell Size" tools - Word overrides automatically to whatever it auto adjusted to. Try to select column divider and move to width needed - automatically pops back out to size
 it wants (what is automatically decided is best).&nbsp; It appears that this is particularly a problem when pasting URLs/links in the column. It does not seem to happen as much with standard text.&nbsp; PLEASE FIX THIS BUG or RECOMMEND A SOLUTION!!!!&nbsp; I see many other
 posts about this problem, but no successful solutions!!!</p>
<p>Please help - this is SO frustrating!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            I don't think it's documented anywhere that could be easy to find, but "AutoFit Contents" is the default setting for all new tables. If you want fixed column widths, you have to click Table Tools | Layout &gt; AutoFit &gt; Fixed Column Width. It's best to do
 this immediately after inserting a table and before inserting any content. You can set it later, but then you may have to resize the columns that have already changed, either dragging by trial and error or by typing the dimensions in the width box on the Table
 Tools | Layout ribbon.

<p>Could you please try to temporarily turn off your firewall and proxy to see the outcome?</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I would suggest you perform a clean startup (Safe mode) to determine whether background programs are interfering with Office for Mac activation:<br />

<h2>            520 - lost signal</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, this has happened a couple of times recently where I have gone to use my phone and there is the NO SIGNAL&nbsp; indicator at the top of the phone and the only way I can get my phone to work again is to restart it.&nbsp; The phone had all the upgrades done when
 it went it for repairs a while ago.&nbsp; Is this a common problem and can it be fixed.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            hi mate, have you also checked that your microSIM is cut correctly? also check that you have the correct network carrier data settings and that you have the latest firmware, and Nokia system app updates from the Store. failing that, you will need to return
 to your nearest Nokia Care location to get it re-inspected.

<p>
</p><p>Just reading some of the sad "help me" messages that have appeared on this forum already by people who have no clue what they are doing, but wanted to "be the first" should be sending some major alarm bells out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The warnings also make it very clear that one should not use the preview as one's main OS, or on a business machine and so on...The reasons for those warnings are pretty obvious to anyone who has a modicum of understanding about a pre-Beta OS.</p>

<p>Did you download the file for the upgrade, or did you opt for the ISO download?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two ways to get the upgrade. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The one they seem to push towards is the file method. The file that you download and run installs all the latest Windows Updates, then prompts for a reboot. When you reboot you will be prompted for installing the Tech Preview through Windows Update. You
 can just ignore that if you really don't want to live dangerously and run the tech preview on your live machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is you clicked "yes" and ran the file, then decided you wanted the ISO and rebooted at some point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am almost positive this is what has happened to you (cause I did the same thing). Standard users, without joining the Insider program, AND running the file that downloads when you sign up, won't have access to the Tech Preview through Windows Update. Of
 course, they could just run the file and get it as well, if someone joined the Tech Preview and sends them the file. But it doesn't just automatically show up otherwise in Windows Update.</p>

            <p>Great answer. You are absolutely right. I clicked "yes" assuming I'd get an iso to download, but instead the installation started immediately - which is not what I wanted. I wanted a clean install on a fresh disk. So I cancelled out, downloaded and burned
 the iso instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - maybe you are right. I don't see the point in being offered as an upgrade though - disguised as a regular "Update", and it certainly fooled me.

<p>After a clean install of build&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">10041 from the iso, windows created an account named defaultuser0. No other accounts exist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Some forums suggest using the command prompt to either create a new account or activate the hidden administrator account. The command prompt when using
 the recovery option on the installation CD does not affect the installation itself. An in order to use the command prompt from the installed version of windows 10, you need to login as an administrator. The only administrator that exists is defaultuser0, for
 which nobody knows the password.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks, <span>Sara. I saw those instructions elsewhere and already tried that.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When booting from a USB stick (in place of a DVD), i can get to the command prompt, but as i said above, this is the command prompt for the installer's recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>only affects the installer's environment, which already has the administrator set as active. It doesn't change anything for the installed copy of windows. Is there a step missing somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(If it was that easy, wouldn't anyone with a windows DVD be able to get administrator access to any windows computer?)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a quickie........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my N96 I was able to download an app for use with this far cheaper sms provider than Skype,&nbsp;which integrated into my phone's contacts.&nbsp; I tried to download the app from fishtext's site but nothing arrived naturally because the N96 was a Symbian phone
 and the N900 is not.&nbsp; I can use Fishtext on my handset via the web so no biggy but it would be nice to have it integrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know if this might be in the pipe-line or do I need to contact Fishtext ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course - this is what they have told me as a response to my follow up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span>I appreciate your confidence in the handset, but Maemo 5's market share is virtually zero and, unless Nokia rapidly release a glut of handsets running Maemo 5 this year, which is not something they have indicated they will do, it's set to stay that
 way for some time to come.<br />
<br />
Much more promising platforms include Android, but even this is still too immature and fragmented to justify development hours.<br />
<br />
Platforms such as the iPhone OS offer both a sophisticated and stable development environment coupled with good and growing market share, which is why we develop for this platform. Everything else remains encompassed in our Java mobile application strategy
 at this time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your interest."</span></p>

            KB4011165 is for MSI installations of Office, not any 365. Exactly what Office bundle do you have?
<br />
<br />Another thing to try is disabling hardware acceleration, first in Office, next in Windows if Office doesn't fix the problem
<br />
<br />HARDWARE ACCELERATION - COMBO OF OPTIONS TO BE INVESTIGATED / CHANGED
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_windows8/office-365-really-slow/b2656170-a2cd-47d5-8f22-35ab6027d3df?page=4&amp;msgId=99dbb0f8-74b5-49d9-b4fc-59dd2dd15337">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a>

<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />I systematically went through every single option disabling things that might effect it, and the dumbest solution and dumbest option for me was simple... . By “toggle”, I mean change current setting, for these 2 or 3 options (depending on version) try all of the combinations of the settings on and off. The specific options you see depend on the Office application and its year (2010/2013/2016). 
<br />
<br />1.	Go to File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Advanced option
<br />2.	In the Display section:
<br />Toggle the check box for “Disable Hardware Acceleration” (2010 / 2013 / 2016)
<br />3.	Also try toggling the check box for “Use subpixel positioning to smooth fonts on screen” (2013 / 2016) 
<br />4.	In the General section &gt; 
<br />Toggle the check box for “feedback animation”  (2010 / 2013?)
<br />5.	Apply the changes by clicking on Ok button at bottom of the dialog box
<br />6.	Close Word normally
<br />7.	Restart Word
<br />
<br /> 
<br /><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=abacb31d-d431-4d3a-b9b4-b93c34647ed7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://fud.community.services.support.microsof...</a> (Screen Cap of 2016 Options Dialog with the options highlighted)
<br />
<br />This issue is most noticeable on machines with dual video chip sets, ie. video support built into the CPU plus an external graphics card.
<br />
<br />It didn’t have an immediate effect until I closed and re-opened Word, then it was fine. I unchecked the box and the screen flickered and it was sluggish again until I repeated the steps. The combination of the two options for whatever reason seems to have fixed for me.
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />
<br />Another option to try is this: 
<br />
<br />Try disabling display scaling on high DPI settings
<br />by following the steps below:
<br />1.	Open your Office installation folder and right-click on the Office app that has poor scaling issues and select Properties.
<br />2.	Click on the Compatibility tab and put a check on Disable display scaling on high DPI settings.
<br />3.	Launch that Office app and see if the issue still occurs.
<br />
<br />Disable Hardware Acceleration In Windows
<br />
<br />Open Run dialog using &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;R&gt; shortcut 
<br />Type inetcpl.cpl 
<br />press Enter 
<br />Click Advanced Tab 
<br />Click to add Checkmark beside “Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering” 
<br />Click Apply button
<br />click ok button
<br />Restart the computer to apply this change
<br />
<br />Effects of disabling hardware acceleration
<br />With hardware acceleration disabled, screen renders (drawing) is done using software rendering (WARP) that relies mainly on the CPU and uses limited or no graphics card resources. You can cause a lower frame rate and increase in the working set. Performance becomes more dependent on CPU characteristics, like memory, number of cores, and on how many apps are open, and can strain the CPU resources.
<br />
<br />On Windows 7, Office animations are disabled. On Windows 8, animations are enabled because of D2D WARP improvements found in Windows 8.

<br /><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2813143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2813143</a> Problem with video file dlumd32.dll versions lower than 8.7.x.
<br />I did fix this issue though.  I check my graphics chip settings, and at some point, Word, OneNote and Outlook got changed to High Performance while the other programs in the suite were set to something else (I don’t remember what the setting was now, but it was clear that the offending programs had matching settings while the behaving programs matched each other).
<br />
<br />I changed the graphics settings to match the behaving programs, and now everything works just fine.
<br />I hope this helps anyone else out there that might be having the same strange problem.
<br />Changed Outlook from ‘High Performance’ to ‘Power Saving’ in the Catalyst Control Center and it worked for me.
<br />•	If you use Avast Antivirus version 10.3.2225, 
<br />•	upgrade to Windows 10, 
<br />•	your Office apps may crash when you try to open them. 
<br />•	install their R4 release here, which resolves the issue in most cases.

<br />REGISTRY “HACK” TO DISABLE HARDWARE ACCELERATION IN OFFICE
<br />1. Run regedit (Win + R ; “regedit”)
<br />2. Browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common
<br />3. Create a New Key and name it “Graphics”
<br />4. Select Graphics, right-click on the right panel and create a New DWORD (32-bit) Value and name it DisableHardwareAcceleration.
<br />5. Enter Value data as 1
<br />NOTE: one person reported that TURN ON Hardware acceleration fixed lagging in Word. So if it was turned off when you checked, try turning it on …

<h2>            Java and Adobe Flash no longer work in IE11 after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I ran windows update getting the 1510 build, and after all the restarts, Java and Adobe Flash will no longer run in IE 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flash will run when&nbsp;I use the Edge Browser but Java will not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling java, rebooting, re-installing java and still cannot get&nbsp;the Pogo game site that uses Java to run.</p>
<p>I would like to get the ability to run that game site back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never see the Java console icon display when I click on one of the games to play it, before the update i saw the Java icon display in the notification area.</p>
<p>The website seems to be constantly recovering itself in IE 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the settings that Java says to check to get the Add-on to get Java to work</p>
