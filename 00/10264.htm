    <title>Outlook does not send emails until I open program and hit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook does not send emails until I open program and hit Send&#47;Receive</h2>
                    Seems like there should be a simple fix to this one:<br />
<br />
Whenever I click on an email address (on a web page for example), an outlook message opens and I type my email message. Then, when I am done I hit 'Send' (Obviously).<br />
<br />
But this does NOT send the message until I actually open the Outlook program and hit Send/Receive. I can't tell you how annoying this is when you open Outlook a couple of days later and you find out: oops that email never got sent.
<br />
<br />
Is there a way I can make it that when I hit the 'Send' button, it actually sends the email? Even when Outlook is not open?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Chris

            That's how Outlook works. You'll need to open Outlook to send the messages.

            I have had my 6234 for approx. 6 months. I have got the same problem. I have tried to update firmware, back up and restore all my files on PC Suite and even found a programme that shows you invisible folders on your 6234. All to no avail. I have got nothing
 apart from 6kb of things on my phone and i can't send txt messages as memory is full!! As a last resort i have taken it back to the shop and will collect it on Wednesday with the software being re-installed. Hopefully that will work although i do feel that
 it is going to be a repetive problem. If anyone does have any solutions that do work please let me know. Cheers.

            Update for this. I picked my phone up and they said it was corrupt software and all they did was reinstall this. I must say so far so good! i now have all the memory back and it seems to be working well. Hope this helps.

            <p>Yes, it is an Internet Explorer problem, and here's why: Outlook.com was designed with new HTML and web technologies that only newer browsers can support, but older browsers, including Internet Explorer 8 and lower, cannot and will not support the website.
 You mentioned that you're running on Windows XP, which means you're stuck with Internet Explorer 8. There are two things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a new computer with Windows 7 or Windows 8</li><li>Change your web browser by&nbsp;downloading Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome</li></ol>
<p>If you get a new machine with either Windows 7 or Windows 8, you can&nbsp;take full advantage of your Outlook.com email and you can prevent yourself from being left vulnerable when Windows XP support ends next year (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">view
 this Microsoft page</a>). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second choice is easier and can be applied immediately, but you'll have to remember to use that new browser all of the time from now on. You'll also notice that many of your websites will look slightly different since the browser&nbsp;is designed to handle
 new HTML and web technologies. Here are the links to download&nbsp;the optional web browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/</a></li></ul>
<p>You only have to download one of the two posted above and make sure you make the browser you download your default browser while you're still using Windows XP. Remember, this option will still leave you vulnerable when support ends for Windows XP next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

    <title>Mobile Device Center&#47;Vista Will Not Recognize HTC Ozone SmartPhone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lillianhatesvista  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mobile Device Center&#47;Vista Will Not Recognize HTC Ozone SmartPhone</h2>
                    I recently purchased an HTC Ozone from Verizon. Everything is great except I want to be able to turn mp3s into ringtones. To do this, I need to sync the phone with my computer, so it would seem. And here is what happened...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) The Windows Device Center would not install from the disc provided with the phone. It got to 99% (after installing the user manual just fine) and froze up. I cancelled the installation, and then proceeded to try and install it again. According to the
 program, it DID install, made it to 100%, everything,except no program was ever installed. I did this numerous times, with no luck.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) Meanwhile, I was using (and still am) the HTC Ozone as a modem. The verizon wireless modem software installed just fine, and it recognizes the HTC device. (It installed it on COM5).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note: at any point when the device is connected to the computer, vista does NOT recognize that it is present. It makes the "boop" sound when I plug in the usB cable, makes an effort at installing drivers, says drivers are installed and the device is ready
 to use, but the device does not appear anywhere, and no programs open or anything.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3) I downloaded the device center directly from windows, and this time, it installed onto the computer. When I plugged the phone back in, it re-installed the drivers again, and this time connected it to COM8. When I opened the device center, it claimed
 that there was no device connected. I went through the connection settings and connected it to the USB and all of the available COM options. None of this worked, and the device was never connected or recognized by windows device center.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4) Then, when I attempted to use the phone as a modem again, the verizon software no longer recognized it and I couldnt connect.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>5) I uninstalled all of the windows device center software and updates (if its not going to work, no point in having it on the computer effing things up), along with the verizon wireless software. I restarted the computer, and then reinstalled the verizon
 wireless software, at which point it detected the device on COM7. Now it works and I can connect to the internet and use the phone as a modem, but the computer/Vista still does not detect that there is a device.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>6) When I open windows device manager, I don't see the device directly. the HTC appears under "modems" as "HTC USB MODEM#2" and under PORTS COM &amp; LPT there is "HTC DIAGNOSTIC INTERFACE (COM8) and some RIM Virtual Serial Ports.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could this COM business be messing it up? This is my first experience trying to sync a smartphone to my computer, and I am not surprised that it doesn't work, vista has been nothing but one big "not responding" since the day I got it. I am not all that
 computer savvy, but would appreciate any suggestions or information if anyone else is having a similar problem!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Vista 32 bit, regular home edition, on a Dell XPS M1330.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

<blockquote>I recently purchased an HTC Ozone from Verizon. Everything is great except I want to be able to turn mp3s into ringtones. To do this, I need to sync the phone with my computer, so it would seem. And here is what happened...
<div><br />
<div>1) The Windows Device Center would not install from the disc provided with the phone. It got to 99% (after installing the user manual just fine) and froze up. I cancelled the installation, and then proceeded to try and install it again. According to the
 program, it DID install, made it to 100%, everything,except no program was ever installed. I did this numerous times, with no luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) Meanwhile, I was using (and still am) the HTC Ozone as a modem. The verizon wireless modem software installed just fine, and it recognizes the HTC device. (It installed it on COM5).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note: at any point when the device is connected to the computer, vista does NOT recognize that it is present. It makes the "boop" sound when I plug in the usB cable, makes an effort at installing drivers, says drivers are installed and the device is ready
 to use, but the device does not appear anywhere, and no programs open or anything.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) I downloaded the device center directly from windows, and this time, it installed onto the computer. When I plugged the phone back in, it re-installed the drivers again, and this time connected it to COM8. When I opened the device center, it claimed
 that there was no device connected. I went through the connection settings and connected it to the USB and all of the available COM options. None of this worked, and the device was never connected or recognized by windows device center.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>4) Then, when I attempted to use the phone as a modem again, the verizon software no longer recognized it and I couldnt connect.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>5) I uninstalled all of the windows device center software and updates (if its not going to work, no point in having it on the computer effing things up), along with the verizon wireless software. I restarted the computer, and then reinstalled the verizon
 wireless software, at which point it detected the device on COM7. Now it works and I can connect to the internet and use the phone as a modem, but the computer/Vista still does not detect that there is a device.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>6) When I open windows device manager, I don't see the device directly. the HTC appears under "modems" as "HTC USB MODEM#2" and under PORTS COM &amp; LPT there is "HTC DIAGNOSTIC INTERFACE (COM8) and some RIM Virtual Serial Ports.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could this COM business be messing it up? This is my first experience trying to sync a smartphone to my computer, and I am not surprised that it doesn't work, vista has been nothing but one big "not responding" since the day I got it. I am not all that
 computer savvy, but would appreciate any suggestions or information if anyone else is having a similar problem!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am running Vista 32 bit, regular home edition, on a Dell XPS M1330.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>
</blockquote>
Try Lakleeman's suggestion. It should fix your sync issue.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>You cannot use your phone as a modem and at the same time try to sync. It cannot do both.</div>

    <title>Multiple Notifications &#34;Windows 10 Technical Preview is ready - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teddystiles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Notifications &#34;Windows 10 Technical Preview is ready - Get started&#34;</h2>
                    <p>As always, I am enthusiastic about the upcoming Windows release. As such, I signed up for the Insider program and I installed something (can't remember what, maybe
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>?) to enable it on my Windows 8.1 PC. Now I DO plan on installing it on a new partition in the next week. Until then...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week or so ago I received the first "toast" notification: "Windows 10 Technical Preview is ready - Get started." The large picture on the left toast notification looks like a large computer monitor with green "refresh arrows" in front of it. In the lower
 right corner of the notification, there's the "unknown app" icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the notification and it did nothing. Didn't launch anything. I didn't care, because I planned on downloading the ISO anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward to today, and this notification is popping up frequently. A little TOO frequently. Like once a minute! It's seriously annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my start screen, where I found "Windows 10 Technical Preview" as having been installed last month. I right-clicked it, clicked "uninstall," and was booted to the desktop where the "add/remove programs" screen popped up. I don't see any program
 listed there that matches. If I click "View Installed Updates," I don't see anything listed there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me make it stop?!?</p>

</p><p>The behavior disappeared for a few days, but it's back this morning. Every minute or so a new notification pops up; sometimes multiple times a minute. Sometimes there is a break for a few minutes. I can manually close them, or I can wait a few seconds and
 they'll disappear. They stack up as many as, but never more than, three.</p>

            <p>This is driving me up the wall too. This is the only mention of it on the whole of the internet too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem arose from. I signed up to Windows 10 Technical Preview intending to download an ISO to install onto another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a small app to download to install Windows Technical Preview on the PC you downloaded the ISO on. If you click that. It then pesters you for ever more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically it is Windows update that is causing the above popup. Windows Update is set to periodically check for any new updates for patches and whatnot for Windows. But now I get no more patches or anything in Windows update. All that is there is to download
 and install Windows 10 onto this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically until I fix this any new patches for Windows 8.1 wont go onto my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried right clicking and ignore this update but it doesn't work it keeps coming back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There needs to be a way to say "this was a mistake, I do not want to update to Windows 10 on this PC" But for the life of me I cannot find it.</p>

            <p>The only way I have found to get rid of this annoyance is to turn off automatic installation of RECOMMENDED updates and in Windows Update you have to hide the update for the technical preview.&nbsp; This&nbsp;will have to be done each time&nbsp;they update the technical
 preview, which is why&nbsp;you will&nbsp;go a few weeks without a prompt and then it returns. &nbsp;Once you do these things, the prompt should go away.&nbsp; This doesn't turn back the fact that you modified windows update to authorize looking for the update, but it should stop
 the prompt until such a time as you decide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, I was going to update but the video card drivers for my laptop end up blue screening my Windows 10 installation atm, so I will have to wait until the drivers are fixed and/or Windows 10 is fully released for this computer.&nbsp; My desktop runs the preview
 just fine.</p>

            Thanks for your reply, Dennis. It's going off again today, and I still can't stop it. I can't see how simply turning off automatic installation (actually, I ALWAYS have it turned off anyway) would help when it's already been installed. I also can't hide
 the update because I've already installed it. My problem is that I've already downloaded the ISO, and can't find where to uninstall the update in the first place.

            Wow. I hadn't noticed that, AnthG - I hadn't been able to install any updates for almost three weeks. I ended up clicking on one of the Windows 10 notifications instead of dismissing it, and it did nothing. However, nothing has popped up since, and my
 updates started installing. Maybe the fix is as simple as "click on the notification?"

            <p>At this point it becomes a two-level security problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First how secure is where ever you have it from outside invaders?&nbsp; In other words if you store it on&nbsp;'cloud' storage somewhere such as OneDrive or those storage spaces provided by services such as iTunes, Facebook, etc. the question is HOW GOOD IS THEIR
 SECURITY?&nbsp; Other questions that fall into that same category is 'where is the storage physically?' since this probably has a lot to do with who can legally look at your files in that country/location.&nbsp; Now, as we've seen from many recent news stories there
 doesn't really seem to be any such thing as total security on any system that has an internet connection!&nbsp; Geeze, banks, governments, credit card companies, and even makers of hardware that has built in firmware like smart phones, hard drives and SIM cards
 for phones have been victimized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, assuming that you acknowledge that if it is in any file on a computer connected to the internet that it is vulnerable, then you have to consider how tough is it for someone to get inside of that file and peek at what is in it.&nbsp; As Norman David Jones
 said - with Excel it is almost a trivial matter to remove workbook, worksheet and even VBA Project passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your best hope is keeping the file in your physical possession: on your computer or perhaps on a removable storage device like a USB drive.&nbsp; Be sure to also keep a backup copy available.&nbsp; Now you don't have to be so concerned with how well some storage
 service keeps up their anti-intrusion protections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, it would be helpful if you had strong encryption that is relatively easy to actually use to keep the file encrypted except when you are actually viewing it.&nbsp; Something that is a little more difficult to 'crack' than Excel's passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that, I would look at this free offering from the U.S. Department of Defense, made free to the public!!&nbsp; It will encrypt/decrypt your file rapidly using FIPS 140-2 compliant processes.&nbsp; This is deemed 'adequate' for data at rest (on your device) and
<p><a href="http://www.spi.dod.mil/ewizard.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.spi.dod.mil/ewizard.htm</a></p>
<p>Basically it is a Java applet that you can just put on your desktop and drag files into it to either encrypt or decrypt.&nbsp; But be sure to:</p>
<p>#1 - don't forget the password you assign a file, because cracking this one won't be easy.</p>
<p>#2 - use a password that follows established guidelines for "strong" passwords:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At LEAST 8 characters long (longer is better)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mixture of lower and UPPER case characters</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains some numeric characters, and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains some special characters like _$!# etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, someone is going to ask "since the DoD developed this, don't they have a backdoor into it?"&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Since seeing what the NSA seems to have been up to over the past decade or so, while my gut feeling says "no", a reality check has to admit to
 the possibility.&nbsp; But how much time do you think the NSA would actually spend looking at stuff on your computer as long as you haven't attracted their attention through other activities such as emails/social networking/site visits to rather questionable people/organizations/locations?</p>

            Win 7 is looking for a traditional mail client (like windows live mail) but Hotmail can be configured as well.&nbsp; I suggest you Google the issue as I am not on a computer atm.<br />
<br />
Win 7 is asking you to "associate" what program you want to handle email.&nbsp; For what ever client you choose to use you need to go into the control panel&gt;default application control panel and set it there.<br />

In IE11, every opened tab has a prewiev on taskbar what I point on IE icon. Will it be possible in Microsoft Edge?</p>
<p>The other thing: In IE11 we are able to pin a website as an app, to the taskbar (with live notifications, etc.) Will Edge get this feature also?</p>
<p>It will be very good! At theese points, Edge is a step back compared to IE</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer Rendering Issues on Lumia 1020 &#40;GDR3&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philiposwald  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer Rendering Issues on Lumia 1020 &#40;GDR3&#41;</h2>
                    I've run into some trouble with the appearance and functionality of more than a few websites using Internet Explorer on my new Lumia 1020 (GDR3 updated on AT&amp;T).&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Most sites work just fine, but I've run into more than a few that appear correctly and function well on my wife's Lumia 920 (GDR2 on AT&amp;T), and on my father's Lumia 521 (GDR2 on T-Mobile), but then break down on the 1020.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When visiting the site t-mobile.com, only a portion of the site is visible, and when I scroll to see other parts of the page, I see empty space.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When visiting www.westernseminary.edu (a site I've helped develop), text links are sized incorrectly and the page's responsive design doesn't actually scale correctly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In particular, it seems that pages with responsive design become broken on my phone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone else run into this issue with IE on the 1020? Could this be related to the GDR3 update?<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks!</div>
</div>
                </div>

            Just tried one of the sites I've created with a responsive design and it seems to work perfectly on my Lumia 1020 with GDR3. Might be worth double-checking the website code if it does not display correctly.

            <p>I really appreciate your time on this, and I'm thankful for the help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Could I trouble you to look at <a href="http://www.westernseminary.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.westernseminary.edu</a> on your phone, and compare it to what you see on a desktop computer? It would be helpful to hear if your diagnosis is that code on the page is simply wrong.
 Though it would still seem strange that it appears correctly on a 920, but not my 1020.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As this is a site that I've worked to develop, my greatest concern is that this appears correctly on smartphones...and especially on my 1020, selfishly. Thanks again!</p>

<p>I appreciate you posting your issue here. I too have&nbsp;new Lumia 1020 and found one of my responsive websites is not displaying as expected either - I checked your
<a href="http://www.westernseminary.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.westernseminary.edu</a> and it looks fine now so you likely fixed the issue - can you share what you did? I tried some fixes from:
<a href="http://mattstow.com/responsive-design-in-ie10-on-windows-phone-8.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mattstow.com/responsive-design-in-ie10-on-windows-phone-8.html</a> and
<a href="http://devhammer.net/responsive-design-fix-for-windows-phone-8-device-adaptation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://devhammer.net/responsive-design-fix-for-windows-phone-8-device-adaptation</a> which&nbsp;did NOT&nbsp;fix my issue and I see a note 'October 15 2013 Great news! Microsoft have fixed the viewport issue in WP8 Update 3 (GDR3).' ... but if that is the case then why
 does my responsive site look fine everywhere else but on my Nokia Lumina 1020..?</p>

            <p>Hey there!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I didn't fix the issue myself, but our webmaster took care of it for me. It actually turns out that some coding that we had put in place on the site so that its responsive features worked in Windows 8/8.1 snap mode were keeping it from displaying correctly
 on IE10 on my Windows Phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And I don't recall what changes he made precisely, but I believe that it had to do with the "viewport" coding in the html.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were not able to make both snap mode in Windows 8 and IE10 on Windows Phone work at the same time, and so we opted to make the site appear correctly in Windows Phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense, and helps you to find a good solution!</p>

<p>Hey Ramesh, one of the tasks when you are adding your domain is to edit your DNS records, they will give you all of the DNS records you need in that wizard autodiscover included, if you are with one of the more popular DNS providers they will do it for you
 with login credentials.</p>

<p>I am trying to share an item from a list with an external user. I have the option to "Allow external users who accept sharing invitations and sign in as authenticated users" activated and I can share a site or a document from a document library.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I cannot share an item from a list library. I stopped inheriting permissions and when I try to share a specific item with an external user by entering their email I get an error saying that "Your organization has disabled sharing with external users.
 Please contact your IT department for help."</p>
<p>I'll be waiting for your help, thanks.</p>

<p>Hi AdelaP,</p>
<p>It seems not possible to share an item from a custom list. Could you clarify the "list library"? Is it a custom list or a library? If it is a library, what kind of library is it? Meanwhile, I'd like to confirm the following information to narrow down this
 issue:<br />
1. Does the problematic "list library" reside in the same site collection as the working site/document library? If you create a new "list library" and a new item in it within the same site collection, are you able to share it?<br />
2. Do you have the "Allow external users who accept sharing invitations and sign in as authenticated users" option activated from both tenant level and site collection level? Is the "Don't allow sharing outside your organization" option enabled for the site
 collection that includes the problematic "list library"?<br />

<p>The "list library" is a custom list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problematic sharing is on a list is in the same site collection as the working site/document library. It's not related to my custom list, it I create another list is the same behavior.</p>
<p>I have the sharing settings set up correctly both at the tenant and site collection level, as I am able to share a document or a site.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I discovered that if I share a document or a site with an external user &nbsp;(and the user clicks on the link he receives in the email)&nbsp;and then try to share an item from my custom list with the same external user it works fine. But when I try to share
 directly an item from a list with an external user without having shared anything else with that email before I get an error. I added a screen shot with the error.</p>

<p>hi adela,</p>
<p>thanks for your detailed updates.</p>
<p>from your screenshot, i notice you are trying to share a list folder to an external user. in this case, it’s not feasible to share the list folder with an external user directly. we need to share a document or a site&nbsp;with the external user first, then we
 are able to share this list folder&nbsp;with the specific external user. <br />
<br />
as for a list folder, when a document or a site is shared to an external user, a related external user profile is created in your microsoft online directory service, then it will be supported for us to share this list folder with&nbsp;this external user. for details,
 please refer to the<strong> more informaton</strong> part in the following article:<br />

</blockquote>
<br />
1/0/1900 is simply the way that Excel displays a date that is zero.<br />
<br />
If you want to see zero, format the cell as General or Number.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Excel might be misleading you.&nbsp; If you see 1/0/1900, but the cell actually contains the result of a time calculation (i.e. the date part is zero), simply format the cell as Time or an equivalent Custom time format.<br />
<br />
However, if you the cell computes a date and you only want to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
display</span> a blank, you could use a Custom format of the form:<br />
<br />
m/d/yyyy;;""<br />
<br />
Alternatively, if you want the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">value</span> to
<br />
=IF(A1-B1=0,"",A1-B1)<br />

            The straight explanation to your 1st issue is that Word <i>documents</i> typically do not have toolbars. If you send a Word document as an attachment it stands to reason that the recipient will open the attachment in Word [assuming s/he has the program].
 The toolbars they see are a part of their Word installation &amp; will appear any time they use Word. The only way to prevent that is to complicate the document with VBA that manipulates their copy of the program to hide the toolbars -- Something which most users
 will not tolerate &amp; may not open because of the macro warning. If they open the Word document using a different program (<i>Open Office</i>, Apple's
<i>Pages</i>, etc.), that program's interface is what will be presented.<br />
<br />
It sounds like what you would prefer to do is create a PDF &amp; send a copy of the PDF as an attachment. Word does not open PDF files, so the 'toolbars' the recipient sees when they open the PDF are those that are a part of the User Interface of the PDF reader
 they're using (Apple's <i>Preview</i>, Adobe <i>Reader</i>, etc.). Consequently, neither can Word send a PDF as an attachment. You need to use the features of your email software to attach a copy of the PDF after generating the PDF from the Word document.<br />
<br />
To do that you can either use:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>File&gt; Save As</b> then select PDF from the list of <b>Formats</b> in the <b>
Save As</b> dialog, or</li><li><b>File&gt; Print</b> then click the PDF button in the <b>Print</b> dialog &amp; select
<b>Save as PDF</b>. If you have Adobe <i>Acrobat</i>, <b>Save as Adobe PDF</b> also will be available when using this option.</li><li>If you do have Adobe <i>Acrobat</i> you may also be able to use it to generate a PDF from the Word document. It depends on which release of
<i>Acrobat</i> you have. Note that Adobe <i>Reader</i> cannot create a PDF other than by way of the [fee-based] online service offered by Adobe.<br />
</li></ul>
BTW: <i>Adobe</i> is the name of a software development company which offers a variety of programs. There's no indication of which of those programs you've installed, but none of them are available as tools in Word, itself. It's a service added by OS X in the
<b>Print</b> dialog.<br />
<br />
The real problem, then, seems to be in creating a PDF. Unfortunately, you give no description of how you're attempting to do that or exactly what happens when you try. I'm afraid "<i>not able</i>" doesn't give anything to go on. Without detailed information
 it's impossible to determine what might be the cause of the problem. In general:<br />
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have OS X [10.9.1] &amp; Office 2011 [14.3.9] fully updated</li><li>Run <b>Disk Utility</b> to <i>repair disk permissions</i> on your HD</li><li>Restart your Mac</li></ol>
If you still have a problem generating a PDF using one of the methods described above, please reply here with a full description of what that problem is. Indicate which method you're using, the exact steps you're taking as well as the specific results.<br />

<br />
Even if you have created a PDF from Acrobat (using the&nbsp; File menu &gt; Print &gt; Hold PDF button down &gt; choose Adobe PDF, is preferred method). When opened in Acrobat or Reader it will have some form of menu bar.<br />
<br />
The only way they will not see any form of Menu bar is when document is printed from printer. all applications whether Word,Acrobat/Reader, evena web Browser add a Menu bar of some sort.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Extremely Slow to Load Email for Printing</h2>
                    <p>Over the last year, I've completed three clean reinstall of both Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) and Microsoft Office Pro (64-bit) and latest printer drivers.&nbsp; The problem that I reported a year or two ago continues.&nbsp; I would have thought that Microsoft updates
 would have solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When printing to any device (HP Printer, MS PDF Printer, Nuance PDF Printer) the page either will not load, or is extremely slow to load.&nbsp; Due to my location, satellite internet service is the only option available.&nbsp; However, most webpages viewed on IE or
 Edge download quickly for printing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message reads: Message (HTML) (Not Responding).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run troubleshooting tools, checked spooler folder for uncleared print jobs, Print Spooler services, and printer devices settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Is there a way I can simply print the email without downloading anything first???&nbsp;</p>

<p>Johann, </p>
<p>
</p><p>PRODUCT: MS OFFICE PRO 2016 (64-bit) &amp; OUTLOOK FOR DESKTOP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I reply to your very long list of questions, when I was using Outlook 2003, I never had problems printing email.&nbsp; It shouldn't matter if I'm working online or offline.&nbsp; I should even be able to quickly print old emails whose links no longer exist.&nbsp;
 If you can't do that, Outlook 2016 more of a burden than a help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, when using Outlook 2016 desktop, shouldn't print work without an active internet connection?&nbsp; Is there an Outlook connections or options setting that I may have overlooked???</p>
<p>
</p><p>My responses:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Using Windows 10 Pro (64-bit).&nbsp; Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.248)</li><li>Using Outlook for desktop</li><li>Connectivity status you asked about: I don't think it's applicable.&nbsp; I do not use Outlook.com.&nbsp; However, I did follow the link to servicestatus you provided and it reported "Everything is up and running"</li><li>Using Outlook 2016.&nbsp; Version 1802 (Build 9029.2167 Click-to-Run)</li><li>Connecting to POP3 server</li><li>Email provider: Yahoo Small Business</li><li>Over the last two years, I have reinstalled Windows and Office at least 6-times.&nbsp; Outlook 2016 has always had problems printing email that has external links.&nbsp; More often than not, it is sluggish or will not print at all as it is stuck on loading linked
 content.</li><li>I've done all the troubleshooting steps you listed on more than one occasion.&nbsp; I have tried bypassing the router and connecting the LAN cable directly to the modem.&nbsp; I have good internet connectivity and response from websites.&nbsp;
</li><li>ISP is Viasat.&nbsp; Download typically 12-17 Mbps, upload typically 3-5 Mbps.&nbsp; No internet or networking error messages.</li><li>When trying to print, the emails are typically 1-2 pages from well known and secure websites.</li><li>Usually, only Outlook and the selected printer are the only apps open when attempting to print.</li><li>Because satellite internet service is a meter connection, I typically have the network connection properties set to Metered Connection On.&nbsp; However, the sluggish response continues even when the Meter Connection is set to Off.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to offer your help.</p>

<p>Yes I did follow the instructions.&nbsp; I started Outlook in safe mode and closed it.&nbsp; While I didn't try printing, there were no "not responding, stuck at "Processing," stopped working, freezes, or hangs."&nbsp; New user profiles have been established after every
 OS &amp; MS Office reinstall--at least six times over the last two years and the problem continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless I'm missing something, the printing issues have nothing to do with Yahoo.&nbsp; Yahoo is not my ISP, Viasat is.&nbsp; Also, Outlook only accesses Yahoo Business Mail (POP/SMTP) when sending and receiving email.&nbsp; The problem is that when trying to print an email,
 it takes forever, or gets hung up, as it appears to be trying to download images from the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of these images will not be available, especially when printing archived emails from years past.&nbsp; Outlook should promptly print the email selected even when working offline--having no internet connection or links found in an email that have expired
 should not get in the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Is there an email option or setting that saves all downloaded email content to the .msg file so that it doesn't have to download it every time the email is opened or printed???</p>

<p><span>Please correct me if I'm wrong.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem I'm having with Outlook printing emails that have embedded images has nothing to do with an email service provider.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Email is POPed from the email service provider's server.</span></li><li>
<span>When Outlook downloads&nbsp;email from the server, it&nbsp;does not download linked/embedded images unless it is from a designated Safe Sender, or when Download Images is manually clicked on.</span></li><li>
<span>When the images in an Outlook&nbsp;opened email do download, the downloads are via links embedded in the email that lead to&nbsp;the ISP rather than the email server.</span></li><li>
<span>When the email is closed, all downloaded images are discarded and not saved with the email.</span></li><li>
<span>Each time an Outlook email is opened, it has to once again download the embedded images because they are never saved.</span></li><li>
<strong><span>***How do you set Outlook to save images downloaded in an opened email so that the embedded images don't have to be re-downloaded every time it is opened and/or printed???</span></strong></li><li>
<span>To print an email:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>When first opened, the initial view contains none of the imbedded images that are lined to it (see Downloaded Email 180312 Step-1.jpg).</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Next, the email downloads the imbedded images through the ISP, not the email server (see Downloaded Email 180312 Step-2.jpg).</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Clicking on File and then clicking on Print brings up the initial print window (see Downloaded Email 180312 Step-3a.jpg).</span></li><li>
<span>Next, the email begins to download once again the imbedded images through the ISP in order to render a print file with the images associated with that email.</span></li><li>
<strong>&nbsp; <span>***The images were all downloaded when the email was opened.It doesn’t make sense that the images must be redownloaded when they were there just moments prior to executing the Print
 command.</span></strong></li><li>
&nbsp; <span>At this point, the image downloads will either be successful or Outlook will crash.For the same email, the images will sometimes download successfully, and at other times Outlook will crash.</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>In the event that Outlook crashes:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>A blank virtually blank window appears (See Downloaded Email 180312 Step-3b.jpg).</span></li><li>
<span>Microsoft Outlook is not responding error message appears (See Downloaded Email 180312 Step-3c).</span></li></ul>
</li><li>
<span>In the event that Outlook successfully downloads the embedded images and the email is ready to print:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>The blank window described above may, or may not, appear.
</span></li><li>
<span>Patiently waiting for image downloads while this window is open will either result in Outlook crashing as described above, or the download will complete and show a thumbnail of the printable
 image (See Downloaded Email 180312 Step-4).</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</ul>
<p><span>Additional Information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The same email that causes Outlook to crash when trying to Print can be printed without error, or delay, when accessing the email server via webmail.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The same problem occurs regardless the printer selected (HP Printer, Microsoft Print to PDF, or Nuance PDF).</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>I do not intend to use an outlook.com Outlook email account.&nbsp; Prior to going to Windows 10 (which from my experience over the last 2+ years is unreliable and wrought with flaws), I never had
 this problem.&nbsp; From 2004 to 2015, I used MS Office 2003 (with Outlook 2003) on a Windows XP Pro OS and never had these kinds of problems.&nbsp; Also, the Yahoo Business email account that I continue to use today had been in continuous use since 2007.&nbsp; This means
 that this email server worked fine when printing, but Windows 10 and MS Office 2016 have ongoing flaws.

<p>I forgot to mention in the previous detailed post (with all the screen shots) that if I open the same email using webmail access through IE,&nbsp;the linked images load in an instant and print without a hitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I must also mention that when trying print&nbsp;using Yahoo webmail, &nbsp;I do get a "Internet Explorer Blocked a Popup" message.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;unlike when trying to print from Outlook, the email with linked images still&nbsp;prints quickly and reliably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem is not the printer-it works properly with every other app and browsers.</li><li>The problem is not with my ISP-the images downloaded to the email go through the same ISP when using Outlook or webmail access.</li><li>There is no email server issue-the POP server receives the email with links for embedded issues that download via my ISP, it just has trouble doing so reliably.</li><li>The problem is located in Outlook 2016-printers work properly, and downloading the same images into the same email outside Outlook works properly.</li><li>Possibly some sort of handshaking problem exists in the Outlook 2016 print routine that prevents it from successfully downloading linked content.</li></ul>
<p>Other Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Windows Defender with default settings</li><li>Switching the Metered Internet Connection switch setting On or Off makes no different.</li><li>Using Malwarebytes, but disabling it does not fix the problem.&nbsp; Malwarebytes when active does not pop up a flag for suspicious content being downloaded.&nbsp;

<p>I just tried your suggestion and after checking email print behavior it doesn't help.&nbsp; Images are not permanently downloaded.&nbsp; When printing, there are&nbsp;there a long delays waiting for the download to complete and Outlook often crashes in the process.&nbsp; It's
 not an ISP or email server issues.&nbsp; When using webmail access to the server, images download quickly, smoothly, and print promptly without any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***The only thing this change in settings does is automatically download embedded images when opening the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, no one has addressed the root problems that appear to be in design of the Outlook 2016 program.&nbsp; The things I'm listing below are issues that I have repeatedly brought up, yet they continue to be ignored.&nbsp; I really wish those who try to help would
 pay a little more attention.&nbsp; So I will try to repeat myself in a little different way.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When an email is opened, embedded images are only downloaded for that single event.
<ul>
<li>This means that every time the email is opened, images have to be downloaded again.</li><li>This means that when trying to print the email, the images have to be downloaded again--even when the email is already open, and it's in view with images that have been downloaded only a few moments earlier.</li><li>This means that if I open an archived email, the complete email with its images may no longer be available due to links to the images that have expired.</li></ul>
</li><li>In the process of trying to print an email, the process of downloading embedded images often causes very long delays and/or Outlook crashes.
<ul>
<li>This didn't happen when using my Windows XP computer and running Outlook 2003.</li><li>What changed?&nbsp; I'm using the same POP server, ISP, and printer.</li><li>The same delays and crashes occur when using MS Print to PDF, and Nuance PDF printers--It's not a printer problem.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>****** I AM ASKING THIS QUESTION ONE MORE TIME</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Settings in Outlook </span>
that will <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Download AND Save the Images </span>
to email so that they may be printed, complete with embedded images,&nbsp;even if there is no internet connection?</li></ul>

</p><p>Most probably, you're signed in to a different account on the Skype application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have access to the primary email address associated with your Skype account, you may reset the password of the account using this link:

<h2>            Office 365 Outlook and hotmail.co.uk</h2>
                    <p>I have<br />
</p>
<p>Office 365 Outlook</p>
<p>I have tried both 32 and 64 bit versions of Office 365<br />
</p>
<p>Hotmail installs but then I get the ‘too many devices’ error</p>
<p>Calendar for Hotmail account won’t populate – computer says disconnected – it isn’t</p>
<p>I’m only using 4/5 installs and this is happening on 2/4 of my computers - the other two are working perfectly.</p>
<p>They are all running Windows 8 Pro 64bit<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried un-installing and re-installing office 365</p>
<p>I have tried a clean install of windows 8 and office 365</p>
<p>Nothing makes a difference – can download and send <span>
&nbsp;</span>email BUT no calendar and no contacts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I try my outlook.com account that works fine BUT I appear not to be allowed to move folders from hotmail.co.uk to hotmail.com and so this is not a viable option for me.<br />

            I'm afraid that nothing suggested so far has worked. Just done a completely clean install of Win 8 and Office 365. Precisely the same problem. Exactly what is being done about this? At the moment I am not prepared to renew my subscription to this when
 it comes up for renewal. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configure a test account with some test contacts and calendar items in it and check if you face similar issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will help us in determining if this issue is specific to the email account or not.</p>

            I did this with my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account as it seemed to me too that it might be an issue with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
I didn't get the 'too many' error message but it too disconnected and would not reconnect.<br />
In the meantime Windows Live Mail (FREE software!) works pretty well with the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account.<br />
And on the two machines that are playing nicely Outlook 2013 is fine - but they are both also running with exchange accounts as well (while I continue until end of August with the university).

Cheers Ra - but I have already tried this three times - even replaced the disc drive and started with a complete re-install. All to no avail.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is connected or not but the new outlook app for ipad doesn't seem able to find my settings either. It then has the silly window that says it's redirecting. Do I trust this website to which I can choose 'close' or 'no' but not 'yes'.<br />
<br />
So is there something wrong with my Office 365 account? My user name and password work fine in Windows Live Mail, give me access to download Office 365 and to my Sky Drive files so I can't think that there is much at this end?
