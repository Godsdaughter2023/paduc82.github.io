<p>
</p><p>It seems you're using WIndows 10 mail.&nbsp; For that the People app populates Contacts from any or all of your webmail programs.&nbsp; Just open the People app at Start&gt;All Apps, open the settings to add any missing accounts starting with your Outlook Account you
 had associated with Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; It should pick up your contacts, store them, and auto-complete addresses during Mail creation.&nbsp;

<h2>            New Windows 7 computer can&#39;t get Netflix tile to show up in WMC or access the internet TV options &#40;do show up in the guide data though&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently purchased a refurbished computer with 64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium, and I would really like to be able to access Netflix through Windows Media Center.&nbsp; Media Center is working great for me as a DVR- I was able to set-up live TV without any
 problems.&nbsp; I have never seen the Netflix tile though and internet TV does not seem accessible.&nbsp; I click on a show listed in the guide (in the internet stations) and it just beeps then nothing happens.&nbsp; I have tried passively waiting for the guide to update
 as well as download updates now both in WMC and following the command prompts listed here.&nbsp; I have run through every step in this list several times.</p>
<p>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977116</p>
<p>I have verified my location and language many times (US, English).&nbsp; I have also tried turning off Windows Media Center and player then turning back on, setting up new user with admin privileges to set up set up WMC, as well as deleting the programdata ehome
 files.&nbsp; This basically allows me to re-setup live TV, but never gets me any further along with the Netflix tile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I check the event log, I see it run through a bunch of steps then show "Errors during the last update".&nbsp; This line show up after every download, whether I iniate it or it runs automatically in the 6 hour window I set up in WMC.</p>
<p>I would love some help with this.&nbsp; I am getting very frustrated and running out of ideas.&nbsp; It seems like there are others out there with similar problems.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Do you have Silverlight installed?</p>
<p>You can try the below steps given below in order to resolve the issue</p>
<p>a. Open Media Center, choose Settings, General, Automatic Download Options, and ensure that the 'Download when connected' is enabled. The Netflix tile will appear after the next Media Center Guide download time has passed.</p>
<p>b. Open Media Center, choose Settings, General, Automatic Download Options, and select the Download Now button at the bottom. It may take some time depending on your connection speed.</p>
<p>After the Netflix tile appears within Media Center, you will have to install the Netflix application.</p>
<p>c. Try this direct link for the Netflix software add-on for Media Center.</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/D/8/DD8BD495-9A5A-46DB-B95E-A846AF35915E/NetflixInWindowsMediaCenter.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/D/8/DD8BD495-9A5A-46DB-B95E-A846AF35915E/NetflixInWindowsMediaCenter.exe</a></p>

<p>Thank you Azeez.&nbsp; Yes I did have Silverlight installed.&nbsp; I previously uninstalled it and reinstalled trying to troubleshoot.&nbsp; I&nbsp; have never seen the Netflix tile and I can see all the internet TV options in the guide but clicking on them merely causes a
 "beep".&nbsp; Nothing further happens.&nbsp; The two issues are clearly linked in my mind.&nbsp; Somehow anything internet related is not enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done all the steps you mentioned including the netflix direct download link and it tells me it installed correctly, but when MC opens, still no netflix.</p>
<p>There is a growing thread over on the Green Botton describing this same issue for other users with recent installs.&nbsp; Any further guidance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>There seems to be&nbsp;a recent snafu at Microsoft regarding new installs of Windows 7 32 or 64-bit and getting Netflix to appear and Internet TV to play.&nbsp; Many, many recent posts on The Green Button and other sites about same issue.&nbsp; I have wasted many hours
 myself trying all the ways to get both to work.&nbsp; Now that I know the cause is out of my control, I will just wait on Microsoft programmers to figure out what's going on and issue a patch or something.&nbsp; It seems some have fixed the problems, but as of today
 there are still many who are still having issues.</p>
<p>The issue is with new installs only.&nbsp; I have an x64 machine that still has Netflix working in WMC 7.&nbsp; I clean-installed 3 machines with Windows 7 32 and x64 and I can't get any of them to display Netflix or Internet TV.&nbsp; However, Vista seems to be untouched
 by this snafu since I also did a clean install of that and everything is working.</p>
<p><strong>To the Microsoft Support Mods:&nbsp; Please let folks know in future posts that there apparently is an issue in WMC 7.&nbsp; Don't just quote the same 'known issues' article as nothing that the user does will solve the problem.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I have tried so many different things that I fear I have broken something.&nbsp; At one point sports worked pulling in data from my local stations but now it seems I've lost that feature after too many attempts at fixing things.&nbsp; I also can no longer
 get guide data to update, so I am stopping.&nbsp; I hope they find a fix, but until then I am pausing.</p>

            I'm in the same boat. Tried all suggestions offered by Microsoft and others. Still no Netflix, no internet TV channels functional, missing icons on two different computers with new installs of 32 bit Win7. I do have it working on one older tower that I
 did a new install of 32 bit Win7. I have no idea why that one worked exactly like it was supposed to. How ironic that people with Vista never had the problem...&nbsp; I sure hope Microsoft will have a fix for this soon!

<p>Verizon DSL. Will get you the DNS info a bit later but as I mentioned in another thread, I have two computers with fresh new installs of Win7 Ultimate at home.&nbsp;Media Center Internet TV and Netflix installed correctly and work flawlessly on only one of the
 two.&nbsp;On the other computer, I can only see the internet TV channels in the TV guide but I am unable to actually watch any of them. Clicking on any of the icons does nothing. Netflix and Internet TV icons are missing from Media Center.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Upgrading from Windows 7 Pro 32 bit to Windows 7 Pro 64 bit</h2>
                    My Desktop PC at office is running Windows 7 Pro 32 bit. It is an OEM license. Since we have upgraded the RAM to 4 GB I want to get Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. My IT Dept. is saying that they have to buy a new Windows 7 Pro 64 bit license to do the upgrade.
 Isn't it possible to use the existing key to carryout the upgrade ?

            My HP Probook 4710s laptop came with Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit license. The laptop has 4 GB Ram and it is now limited to 3 GB due to 32 bit OS. After a while I used a Windows 7 Pro 32 bit license provided to me by my university. Now I am interested
 in knowing whether any of the following are possible ?<br />
<br />
1) Upgrading to Windows 8 Pro 64 bit<br />
2) Upgrading to Windows 8 Pro 32 bit<br />
3) Upgrading to Windows 7 Pro 64 bit<br />
4) Upgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit<br />
<br />
Only on the first two instances I would be buying a new license if any of the two is possible. I want to know whether I can perform the 3rd and 4th options with my existing key ?<br />

<p>Changeing bit versions requires a clean install</p>

<p>32bit can use a max of 4gb, your current sys has 4gb but some is in use for hardware resources, typically graphics - your 4gb is all being used</p>

            <p>The third and forth option do not need a new product key but phone activation may be necessary (see below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also because you are going from a 32Bit version of Windows to a 64Bit version a "Custom"/clean install is necessary. So backup your data files (Documents, Music, Photos, Etc.) and be prepaired to re-install your applications (have the installation media
 and product keys handy).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would personally stick with Windows 7 as most if not all your applications will run just fine in 64Bit mode.</p>

<p><br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
5) Stay on the phone <strong>*** do not select/press any options ***</strong> and wait for a person to help you.<br />
6) <strong>Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</strong><br />
7) The support person should give you a confirmation ID, copy it down on paper, <br />
8) Verify the ID is correct by reading back to the support person.<br />
9) Enter the ID number and click 'Next' to finish the activation process.<br />

            <p>The key should work with either a 32 or 64Bit version of Windows (Volumn license).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For OEM license you do in fact need a new key.</strong></p>

Yes, you can use the same product key with 64 bit version of Windows 7 Professional. You can download Windows 7 Professional 64 bit and install it yourself:</p>
<p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on COA sticker attached to your machine, with at bottom or battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its a desktop computer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing a custom install:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 64 bit DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to verify where you're importing the MP4 file. If it is within a usb/memory card, please copy it on your computer before importing to Movie Maker. Also, ensure that you have the proper codecs to support the MP4 files. It is also suggested that
 you ensure that your video card drivers are up to date. <span>Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with different software.</span></p>
<p><span>To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>DirectX Diagnostic Tool</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click on Start button and type “dxdiag” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.
</span></p>
<p><span>Example:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</span></strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://downloadcenter.intel.com/</span></strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this did not solve the issue, please provide us more information by answering the questions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>At some point, can you use Movie Maker without problems? If yes, please state when did the issue first occured.
</li><li>What is the version of your Movie Maker? To know the version of the program, click
<strong>Alt+F </strong>then <strong>U </strong>on your keyboard. </li><li>Do you receive any error message/code? If yes, please provide it on your next post.
</li><li>What is the duration of your MP4 file? </li><li>Where did your MP4 file originated? </li><li>What is your video card? To know your video card, please click the pearl button on the lower left part of your screen, type dxdiag then hit Enter. Go to display and you'll see your video card.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi MrBri,
<div><br />
<div>Checking the properties that you presented, it seems that the one that is not working is an HD video file. Also, it is possible that the MP4 that didn't work uses a different codec.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please ensure that you have updated your video card driver and have the right codecs for your MP4 videos. You can also try to use&nbsp;<span>Media info to check for the proper
 codecs. It will be able to identify the codec required for your audio and video files, and will provide a link to the website for the required codec</span><span>. You can get it
</span><span><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>here</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></div>
<span>&nbsp;<br />
</span>
<div><span>You can also run</span><span>&nbsp;the
</span><span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Fix It tool for codecs</a>&nbsp;to check for errors on your current codecs.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Please let us know the results.</span></span></div>

            I've found that I had to re-render them using Handbrake and then things started working OK from there. I don't know why certain .mp4's won't work while others do...

<p>If you are talking about being employed by Microsoft, corporate policy tends to be 18+ (there have been a few exceptions, but that is generally the rule). I know if you live in the Puget Sound Area (and maybe by Microsoft's New England Research and Development)
 they do offer High School Internships.

 job opening. Here you would need to prove your ability so link to any programs or websites you have made.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Mathew said I will second him plus you can join here actively,in other online forums,can create nice blog,websites too : )</p>
<p>It is not always mandatory to join Microsoft to help them to do better! Infact,MVP s are not Microsoft employees.Isnt it?</p>
<p>You can join Connect ,report bugs...</p>

<p>MVPs are not Microsoft employees, there are many MVPs that have become Microsoft employees, but they are required to relinquish the MVP title.</p>
<p>Connect is a good way to connect with the product team and by participating in the forums, newsgroups you will be helping users and depending on how much can get you noticed by someone at Microsoft, you said you knew C and C++ so you may want to check out
 the MSDN forums, you may also want to learn C# as that is what silverlight and WPF is done in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A big thing is networking, attend local IT usergroup meetings, if there are any local CodeCamps or GiveCamps near where you live, attend them, there tend to be a few MVPs and a couple of Microsoft employees at those.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Screen Brightness and &#39;sleep mode&#39; problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen Brightness and &#39;sleep mode&#39; problems</h2>
                    <p>I have an MSI U180 Netbook, which worked well under Windows 7 (starter), but since upgrading to Windows 10 it has developed a couple of problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The Sleep Mode LED is now permanently illuminated. The sleep key (Fn-F12) sends the PC into sleep mode correctly, and I can awaken it with the normal 'on' switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The screen has gone dark. The PC is useable, but I'd like to increase the screen brilliance. Unfortunately, the Fn-F4 (dimmer) and Fn-F5 (brighter) controls no longer operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find any setting in the control panel or Win 10 settings which would allow me to adjust the screen brightness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Santosh. Thank you for your suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, running the troubleshooter only reset the display timeout settings to the default settings. It didn't detect any other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no options (that I can find) for adjusting the 'sleep' or 'hibernate' settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new problem has now arisen with the Display Adapter. The error message disappears too fast for me to record the details. Windows has detected a problem and has self-rebooted half a dozen times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One option it gave me was to do a System Restore, which I've done, but I now get a message...
</p>
<p>"An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x8000ffff)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to think I would have been better off staying with Windows 7 !!!</p>
<p />

            <p>Rebooting again solved the System Restore problem. The PC is now back to "yesterday".</p>

            <p>I've been in contact with the manufacturers tech-support team, and they informed me that this netbook isn't 100% compatible with Win 10, and there may be 'issues' (whatever THAT means), so I've rolled-back to Win 7. The screen brightness problem remained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking to tech-support in my own company resolved the issue by reinstalling missing drivers using a program called "Driver Booster 2". Somehow, the Win 10 installation process had deleted them!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now my little PC is working correctly now.</p>

            <div>SOLUTION:</div>
<div><strong>Preliminary remarks:</strong><br />
As we all know Windows OS always bring problems.<br />
The boys of Redmond, since upgrading to W7, have failed to resolve how to adapt drivers on updating.<br />
Ie we moving from XP to W7, W8, W8.1, and W10, and always the same problems: drivers.<br />
It seems that is user problem, when it is not.<br />
The problem is always Windows.</div>
<div><br />
Happily, any MVP, or any employee of the Technical Service will tell identical answers:<br />
1. Update<br />
2. Uninstall<br />
3. Reinstall<br />
4. Update again<br />
5. If this problem is not resolved, they will blame the manufacturer of your PC.</div>
<div>But again, the problem is always Windows.</div>
<div>How to troubleshoot drivers?<br />
Unless you're a NASA college, you can not do it without a guide.<br />
When will you ask for help, they will make you reinstall everything again, at the risk of collateral losing, or directly, your computer.<br />
Some drivers could fry your computer completely forever.<br />
For example, the BIOS drivers.</div>
<div>As I've already broken a couple of PC's by the MVP's advices, I learned to force ignoring them.<br />
1 Never mind them.<br />
2nd Investigate on your own.<br />
3rd If in doubt, read the item 1 again.</div>
<div>Let's think about, using logic.<br />
A driver is a program, that tells Windows what type of components has your PC.<br />
For example: what video card, what sound card, etc.<br />
When updating Windows, the video card IS THE SAME (as other components of your PC).<br />
This means Windows changed, no computer.<br />
Therefore, you do not need new drivers, because your PC IS THE SAME.</div>
<div><br />
What does Windows with drivers when upgrading?<br />
It copy without reinstalling.</div>
<div>For that reason, some work, some do not. Depending on the type of driver.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>SOLUTION:</strong><br />
On update (for Windows 10), your former drivers are in the folder:<br />
C: \ SWSetup \ Drivers<br />
(I recommend that you copy into another PC, or DVD and keep)<br />
All have their installer "setup.exe", and you can use them, in case of formatting your PC in the future.</div>
<div>This time, (because it is an upgrade Win 7 or 8, 10) we will from the "Device Manager".<br />
(Right click on the Start button of Windows 10. It's at the top of the list)<br />
In the case of the video card, it is among the first in the Device Manager.<br />
It's called "Display Adapter" (click).<br />
Then right&nbsp; click, at the driver (Intel or AMD).<br />
Choose "Update Driver Software".<br />
Choose "Search for driver software on your computer".<br />
Here you have to put the folder on your DRIVER (which is dependent).<br />
Example: C: \ SWSetup \ Drivers \ VGA_PH \ Graphics<br />
OK.<br />
Restart.</div>
<div><br />
The driver is updated, and before restart, could operate normally control brightness.</div>
<div>I repeat, that you can also update the drivers with the "setup" of the driver concerned.<br />
Anyway I do not recommend using the "setup", except in the case of a clean installation (not an upgrade).</div>
<div>That is all.<br />
Your brightness control problem and will be solved.</div>
<div>
<p>If they liked it, choose this comment as best answer.</p>
<p>(I'm not native english&nbsp;speaker)</p>
<div>Best regards my friends !!!</div>

<h2>            Please help&#33;</h2>
                    So last year, I had&nbsp; bought elder scrolls online: tamriel unlimited, and it functioned how i was assuming elder scrolls online does. I only had the 14 day free trial of xbox live to play it. A year later I get 1 year of Xbox Live and a 40 dollar gift card.
 I afterwards buy an add-on for elder scrolls online because i thought i could play it. However, error code 0x803F8001 is shown. I try several times to load up the game with no result, restarting my xbox one and going over all of the solutions given on the
 support site. I eventually uninstalled the game and any add-ons to see if I could reinstall it and see if it worked from there. However, I cannot reinstall it, but am able to reinstall the add-on for some reason. What's even more infuriating is that I can't
 locate the order number of this game, meaning I can't get a refund, and I ended up wasting money on it. What can or should i do?
                </div>

<p>Hello Mushy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue concerning the inability to now play ESO: Tamriel Unlimited that you mentioned you bought on your Xbox One console through your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is so, besides checking for the order number it would be best to review the Microsoft
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027310/microsoft-store-view-your-order-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">order history</a></strong> to ensure that the game is showing up as a purchase on the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try multiple accounts accessing the game, to maybe see if this was purchased through a different account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games don't disappear, if it is not present on your account, it would have to be on another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>Back to the original request.</p>
<p>A troubleshooting for the error you are getting may be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/errors/error-code-0x803F8001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/errors/error-code-0x803F8001</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So a possible issue could that the game and the additional contant were not purchased with the same account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the installation, one thing to consider is that on XBOX the game is always the same, all additional content is just enabled once you buy it, be it from xbox store or directly ingame using crowns (if you got it recently I believe you added the Summerset
 add-on).</p>

            Hi there David, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />There's currently no way to remove the sorting letters from your Start menu in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />However, you can use third-party software to customize your Windows interface. One example is Stardock Start10:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/start10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.stardock.com/products/start10/</a>
<br />
<br />If you'd like to remove apps from your Start menu, you can right-click an app and select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you'd like further support! Thanks!

<p>Is anyone using a Harmony 650 to control the XB1?&nbsp; I just ordered one and was reading that Harmony released XB1 codes for all of their remotes.&nbsp; How well does it work?&nbsp; Are there any less expensive remotes that work?</p>

<p>I have a Harmony One which &nbsp;I use and wouldn't use anything else (even if it were cheaper) due to the way in which you "program" the Harmony range of remotes.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I have had it for five years and it currently controls eight devices. As my Xbox One is part of my AV setup I really only use the remote to turn it on and off in conjunction with the TV and AV receiver when I want to play games. Of course you cannot use
 voice commands like "Xbox On" and "Xbox Off" as the remote is programmed to do the turning on and off.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>On a sidenote the Harmony One is being retired at Xmas as the touch screen is beginning to develop black speckles, there is a Harmony touch (already setup) under the Xmas tree.</p>

<p>They are not "Evil" and work well. Based upon the 8 devices I currently have the intuitive Harmony interface and their very extensive database of devices allows me to easily set up "Activities" to control turning on &amp; off devices, setting or switching &nbsp;inputs
 etc.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I have a higher end AV Receiver (Yamaha DSP-Z7) which can be controlled by my smartphone but I need more than just the control of my receiver. Its all very well turning on the Receiver and selecting the right input but what is going to turn on my TV, Xbox,
 Xbox One, Blu-Ray player, DVD player/HDD recorder etc etc.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Logitech do market a product that allows you to use your smartphone as the actual remote but its not cheap and I prefer to have a dedicated rechargeable remote with its own cradle on my AV stand.</p>

<p>Harmony remotes are awesome. I've had the 550 for years and wouldn't trade it for anything. I like&nbsp;it better than the touchscreen models since charging it so often would&nbsp;get annoying.&nbsp;It works great with the 360, so I'd imagine it works just as well with
 the X1.</p>

 is about 7 years old. Has anyone any solution that can help me? Thanks.</span>

            <p>Hi Mully, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stuttering video, choppy video playback, or poor display performance can happen when video cards, also called graphics cards or display adaptors, aren’t working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating your video card driver can often fix these problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform steps from the link mentioned below and see if it helps. </p>

            <p>Hi Mully24cpm,</p>
<p>I had exactly the same problem on Windows 8.1, 64-bit after a driver update.</p>
<p>In my case, if I had more than&nbsp;one Internet Explorer tab open and clicked on the IE icon on the taskbar the screen went blank and when it came back I got this message.</p>
<p>I looked in Device Manager - Display Adapter. I have an Intel G41 chipset.</p>
<p>The driver was from 2014, I can't remember the exact date. I rolled back the driver to Version 8.15.10.2702, 11/03/2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not had the problem since.</p>

    <title>Windows Speech Recognition Capitalization Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jewellspg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Speech Recognition Capitalization Problem</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I add a word to the speech dictionary, if it wasn't already previously known, windows speech recognition asks if it is always capitalized or only sometimes capitalized. In this specific case, the word I have added is a name. So of course, I'd put
 in that it is always capitalized. My problem comes when I am writing. If the name is at the beginning of a sentence, there's no problem. If the name comes in the middle of the sentence? It never capitalizes. I've gone back to edit it multiple times, and every
 single time, it seems to default to only sometimes capitalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, part of this problem in as that known names -say Sarah, or David -will capitalize just fine… Until there is an 'S placed after them. In which case, the software will always type it as sarah's or david's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: is there a way to have these words consistently capitalized? I'm aware that you can say " caps" before a word, but when you're writing, it interrupts the flow.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>This was written using the software. I'm currently unable to type due to some sort of illness with my hands, so any help would be very appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, I appreciate it. As per your questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm using Gmail primarily in this instance. Microsoft Word 2007 also has the same problem.</p>
<p>2. The 64 bit version of Windows 8.1 is installed on my computer.</p>
<p>3. The name that seems to be giving me the most problem is 'Stiles'. It will still show up as 'stiles' instead of 'styles', as per the actual word, but perhaps that could be part of the problem? As for the lowercase once an apostrophe-S has been added, that
 happens with every name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your time.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Bootcamp Suddenly became Slow and won&#39;t Boot</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows 7 for 1-2 months without any crashing or serious malfunctions. &nbsp;All of a sudden this morning, Windows 7 became extremely slow and unresponsive, so I restarted the computer. &nbsp;Now, Windows 7 hangs on a black screen with a movable
 cursor and will not reach the login screen. &nbsp;Sticky keys works, but the Task Manager does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Microsoft Security Essentials installed on the computer, and briefly before the crash it mentioned that the Firewall had been oddly disabled. &nbsp;The problem might be caused by a virus that travels through the local home Wifi network and seems to attack
 computers randomly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still run Command Prompt, and tried to run chkdsk /f but to no avail. &nbsp;I do not have any backups or system restore points of the computer. &nbsp;I can still access the computer files and run programs via the Mac OS X partition of the computer. &nbsp;Should I
 save my important files and completely reinstall Windows 7, or is there an easier way to fix this problem? &nbsp;Also, if this problem is caused by a virus, how can I protect my computer in the future? &nbsp;Obviously,&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials does not seem to
 stop the virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            <p>Hello Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you made any hardware or software changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>2. Do you receive any error message or code while booting the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you steps provided in this Microsoft help article and check if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important notes:&nbsp; </strong><br />
As you mentioned that task manager does not open, you may follow these steps to open task manager from command prompt and then use suggestions provided in the above article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Open command prompt.</p>
<p>b. Type “Taskmgr” or “Taskmgr.exe” into the command prompt Window and press the “Enter” key to open the Windows Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimers:</strong><br />
Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more
 information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/back-up-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/back-up-registry</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to please also run Microsoft safety scanner to check for viruses and malwares.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Microsoft safety scanner</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may save all important files, however, you do not need to reinstall Windows right now.</p>
<p><br />
To find an antivirus program for your computer, you may refer to this article.<br />
<strong>Consumer security software providers </strong><br />

<p><br />
Note: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third
 Party Software is at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
