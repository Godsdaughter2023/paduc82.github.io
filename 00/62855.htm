            Hi Athol, 
<br />
<br />You can use the ADF (automatic document feeder) part of the printer to do this function. You will need to load all the pages you want to be within one file into the ADF, and then initiate the scan. 
<br />
<br />More information can be found in the printers guide if you are unsure: <a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c05139126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c05139126</a>

</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be done without folder renaming and messing with registry:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create a local account with the user name you wish. </li><li>Change account type to administrator (can skip if there is other administrator).</li><li>Remove original Microsoft linked account</li><li>Link local account to Microsoft account if you wish</li></ol>
<p>Local account creation is well hidden, here are step through Settings App :</p>
<p>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other users &gt; Other users &gt; Add someone else to this PC &gt; The person I want to add doesn't have an email address &gt; Add a user without Microsoft account.</p>

<h2>            Configuring firewall of echo port 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old application that uses TCP echo port 7 to ping a sever to see if it is there. On the server it is connecting too I have installed simple network features. If I turn off the firewall on the server completely, then the program can connect to port
 7. But with the firewall turned on, it cannot. I have added a rule to the inbound section of the firewall, allowing any program to receive connections on port 7. but this did not fix it. How do I configure the firewall correctly?&nbsp; I am using Windows Server
 2012 standard.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Due to the scope of this problem I would recommend you ask this question in the Server Technet Forum.
<br />From my understanding this is a firewall rule you will need to allow this type of connectivity on the server side.
<br />See link for forum to ask.

<h2>            Older hard drive content transferring.</h2>
                    
<p>So my 360 red ringed around 6 months ago and I haven't done anything about it since. I had the original 360 (the white one if you don't know what i'm talking about) and had most of my content saved on it's hard drive. &nbsp;I'm wondering how easy it would be
 to transfer all of that onto one of the new 360's hard drives, using the transfer cable. &nbsp;What transfers over, what doesn't specifically, and what can i get back by downloading later. And also what do i do about old memory cards will I have to use someone
 else's 360 to pull the content off of them or can the new 360's work with the older memory cards. &nbsp;Thanks for the help if anyone provides it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The transfer cable should move everything save on the previous hard drive onto the new hard drive. If you have any games installed on the old hard drive, you'll have to delete the file and reinstall them in order for them to work. The only thing that doesn't
 transfer is licenses, but you can do a license transfer at xbox.com/drm to fix that.
</p>
<p>As far as the memory cards, the new 360s don't work with the old memory cards. I believe there are some third party adapters that will make them work, but it would just be easier to use a friend's xbox to transfer the data to a USB drive.</p>

<h2>            Missing Korean voice dubbed of Halo MCC version</h2>
                    <div>
<p>(English)</p>
<p>Halo CE Anniversary has a serious problem.</p>
<p>Original Xbox Halo CE in Korean version of the Covenant was dubbed in Korean voice.</p>
<p>The problem is that Halo CE Anniversary, which was released as XBOX 360 and XBOX ONE, outputs Covenant voice in English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Korean people believed 343 industry would patch it sometime, but unfortunately it is still not patched.</p>
<p>After all, many Korean Halo fan gamers were disappointed by 343 industry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I contacted this forum now is because 343 Industries do not know this fact.</p>
<p>If you are looking at this post, you should help Halo fans around the world for Korean gamers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Korean)</p>
<p>헤일로 CE 애니버서리는 심각한 문제가 하나 있습니다.</p>
<p>Original Xbox (구엑박) 헤일로1 한국어 버전판에서는 코버넌트가 한국어 음성으로 더빙이 되어있었습니다.</p>
<p>그런데 애니버서리로 나온 (Xbox 360, Xbox One) 헤일로 애니버서리는 코버넌트 음성이 영어로 나옵니다.</p>
<p>
</p><p>소수의 헤일로 한국 게이머들은 343 인더스트리가 언젠간 패치해줄꺼라고 믿었지만 현재까지도 패치가 안됬습니다.</p>
<p>결국 한국 헤일로 팬 게이머들은 343 인더스트리에게 많은 실망을 받았으며, 다들 포기한 상태입니다.</p>
<p>그렇지만 손놓고 있으면 뭐가 달라집니까? 한국에서의 헤일로 팬 게이머들은 소수지만 그 소수가 협력을 한다면</p>
<p>언젠간 343 인더스트리와 마이크로소프트에게 우리 얘기가 도달할꺼라고 믿습니다.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>이 게시글을 보고 있다면 소수의 헤일로 팬 게이머들과 엑박 유저들에게 부탁드리겠습니다.</p>

<h2>            Gears of War 2 black screen &#40;xbox 360&#41;</h2>
                    The game Gears of War 2 on the Xbox 360 console after Microsoft logo shows only the black screen, the console freezes up and all buttons on the gamepad don't working (i can only shutdown console from the power button). From other profiles in attempt of
 start game the screen shows error : "Can't run Gears of War 2". Gears of War 3 and Judgement work on the same console normally under all set profiles. The system cache was cleaned off from the console settings on all devices, after that i receive update but
 game still not working. Any idea what i can do with it?

<p>Hey there Spottable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to play GOW.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, for this problem I would run through the steps outlined in our article entitled<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/console/xbox-360-screen-freeze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Xbox 360 Screen Freeze Solution
</a>for resolution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help so much then another great troubleshooting steps I'd try rolling back your 360 updates by following
<strong>Solution 7</strong> on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/console/system-update-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot problems with an update to your Xbox 360 console</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give those steps a shot and let us know how that went. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I tried rollback dashboard last update an install it again, also i reinstall the game and remove/upload my live profile but nothing changed. I think there is only one way that i can do it is reinitialize console(but i think this is not helps me because
 i download this game on that console first time, previously i play it on another xbox)&nbsp;

            I tryed format console, but almost nothing changed game still shows black screen after start. Format console make only one useful thing - GoW2 began to work normally under local xbox profile or without any loaded profile.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the game began to work without a profile loaded, it's possible that a corrupted save file in the hard drive for one or maybe all of the profiles on the console's hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have cleared the hard drive's cache, re-installed the system update, re-installed the game, re-downloaded your profile and other steps as well to no success, what I suggest now is to delete the saved data for GOW2 for any profile and try starting
 over. I know this may be hard to do, but at this point it's the last resort step since the other GOW games are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a digital copy or disc copy and are your other GOW games disc or digital?</p>
        </p>

            <p>I don't think this will do it since enlarging the window size usually does the same thing, but just to check.... try clicking the "hide folders" at the bottom left corner, then turn it back on to show folders and see if it gets itself together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't, I think the next thing I'd recommend is one of these two options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Run System Restore to restore a working copy of the registry/system files.</strong><br />
This won't touch your files, only takes about 5 minutes, and you can "undo" if you don't like the results of the restore.&nbsp; It's one of the safest options you can try.
<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/quickly-repair-pc-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Details here under "option 1"</a>.<br />
<br />
and/or<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>System File Checker</strong><br />
This is also a safe choice, it's a built-in scan that will repair any missing/broken system files.&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Details on that one here. </a></li></ol>

            If you mouse is working properly on everything else, normal use and games except Farm Frenzy, I can only conclude that there is something in their programing that is causing the problem.&nbsp; Their program may not be really Win 8 compatible as they may claim.&nbsp;
 Don't play it.

<h2>            Can not add existing Microsoft account to People app</h2>
                    Hello! When I open People app it offers me to add accounts; when I try to add&nbsp;my Microsoft account (the same one which I use to log in to Windows 10) it says "To finish adding account you need to use Windows Hello or enter your PIN" -&gt; I press OK and get
 the message: "There's already an account set up to use &lt;Name_of_Account&gt;" -- that's all. So I can't use People app. What should I do? Thank you!

<h2>            Bully Scholarship edition not working</h2>
                    I bought Bully Scholarship Edition today off the Xbox Live Marketplace and it's giving me a lot of trouble. When I start it up and it plays the opening scene,theres no sound,and then freezes before the loading screen shows up. And then if i'm able to even
 get past the cutscene and onto the loading screen,an error pops up that says "please insert the game disc and close the disc tray/disc cover to continue". And if I finally get past the cutscene and loading screen with no error,I'm able to play for about 45
 seconds,then I get a disc is unreadable error. But there is no disc,as I downloaded the game from the xbox live marketplace. Heres a list of things I've tried to do: Re-download (unsuccessful),Clear system cache (unsuccessful),and take out my Hard drive and
 put it back in (also unsuccessful). I feel like I've wasted my money...I can't even play the game.

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;XxCHR157M45xX! Can you tell me the order in which you did those troubleshooting steps?<br /><br />The order I would try would be:<br />-Delete the game from your hard drive (go to the system hub on your dashboard, settings, storage).<br />-Clear your system cache (this guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache</a>).<br />-Restart your console.<br />-Redownload the game from your download history (this guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content-history</a>).<br />-Try relaunching the game.<br /><br />If that doesn't work, try the same steps but download the game to a USB drive if you have one. Let us know how that works for you! ^_^

<p>I've reinstalled it (TWICE NOW),and that hasn't solved anything. I cleared my cache. And whenever I try to install to a flash drive it says "there was a problem performing that action". And yes,the USB has more than enough space available for the game. Note:I'm
 MOVING the already downloaded game from my HDD to my flash drive. </p>
<p>That was $14 I could've used on a WORKING game...</p>

<p>Tried to move the game from Hard drive to USB</p>
<p>Cleared cache</p>
<p>Tried moving the game from Hard drive to USB once more,also didnt work.</p>

<p>Hey there Christmas! If you haven't already, please try those steps in the order that Cerb suggested them. If that doesn't work, try removing your current storage device altogether, inserting the USB device (formatting it if necessary) and then download
 directly to the USB device. Let us know if that works any better. Thanks! </p>

                    <p>Somehow Windows 10 disappeared (I have idea how) &nbsp;from my Asus X551M laptop running windows 10, and I was met with error code 0xc0000185, so I made a recovery usb from my desktop, also running windows 10. The boot went fine, untill I was met with a blue
 screen that says:</p>

</p><p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your Pc administrator or PC/Device manufacturer.</p>

 restarting your computer. Note: On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears, Use the arrow keys to choose Repair your Computer in the Advanced Boot Options and then press ENTER.
 If prompted, select the Windows 10 installation to be repaired, and then click Next
</li><li>Select the Language and a keyboard input method and click Next. </li><li>Select a User name and type your Password and click OK. </li><li>Under System Recovery Options, click Startup Repair. Note: If the repair process detects a problem when it starts Windows 10, it will run Startup Repair to automatically fix the problems. Allow this process to complete. Startup Repair might prompt you to
 make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.

            Hi M0mstered ,
<br />
<br />Were you installing the application from Apple's website? (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204283</a>)
<br />
<br />If you click the download option at the top of the website, it will download a file called iCloudSetup.exe.
<br />
<br />Where does the error message show up, i.e straight after opening the iCloudSetup.exe?
<br />
<br />Has iCloud ever been installed on your computer before? If it has, I would advise checking Apps &amp; Features and seeing if there are any lingering installs for the application. 
<br />
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

            Start by uninstalling all Apple Software (<a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-download-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-...</a>); this includes iCloud itself, iTunes, Apple Support software etc. I recommend using Revouninstaller (<a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-completely-uninstall-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-complet...</a>) to thoroughly remove all Apple Software. Also make sure you uninstall the Apple Software Updater too. Try installing iCloud and iTunes again.

            That means the files are in your old user account folder (every user account has a folder inside the
<b>C:\Users</b> folder, which is where all your files are stored). &nbsp;When he deleted the user account, he was asked to "Keep or Delete?" your files. &nbsp;If he deleted them, they are gone forever. &nbsp;If he saved them, he will be able to tell you where they are.

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Just wondering, i've been looking for a more "arcade like" racing game similar to the older NFS's, Burnout, Dirt ect.<br />
<br />
Which of the games in this serious would be more in that genre? I've played Carbon and loved it, and recently bought Hot Pursuit since it was by Criterion which did Burnout but its not really what I was going for. Its a good game but there isnt really any free
 race modes it just all Career which tacks on certain vehicle restrictions or multiplayer.<br />
<br />
Basically i'm just looking for a solid racing game that lets you pick any car you want pick a track and race. Haha, that isnt really a simulator.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Blur is probably the best arcade racer this gen, but it died cause the devs went under.. basically it is mario cart with real cars... to bad it didn't have more cars and tracks as it really was a blast.

<p>Split/Second was purely underated. That game ran on a system which no arcade racers have ever done with very good effects. That game trashes Blur.... Black Rock Studios closed August 2011 but the servers are still kept running by Disney. The DLC for the
 game is still about which is game modes (offline only), cars and a track. </p>

<p>Most Wanted is the best NFS title on the 360. It is a far better game than Carbon. The only problem I had with Most Wanted was that I thought it was actually better on the original Xbox. EA added the horrible
<em>golden glow of dawn</em> lighting to the 360 version, which does little except screw up the way the colors look and create lots of dark shadows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though a lot of people didn't like it, I thought NFS Pro Street was pretty good, for what it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually put in PGR4 earlier tonight. That was a great game. It's graphics are on-par (better in some ways) with FM4. It's arcade, but the physics aren't typical on-the-rails arcade style (like many NFS titles). I think it's a far better arcade racer than
 FM4 is a sim racer. At least the AI is competent.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I'll definitely be passing on this one. I loved Most Wanted, but hated Burnout Paradise. I guess EA has started outsourcing non-creativity.</p>

<h2>            Critical_service_failed BSOD restart loop windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on my Sony Vaio Duo 11 a few weeks ago. It was running fine, until I did an update and found the start menu and notifications panel were unresponsive. I did a laptop reset without issue and the problem disappeared. However, as soon
 as it updated again, the problem came back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reset again, but once it hit 100% it fell into a loop. It starts up, 3 seconds later it shows a BSOD with a "CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED" error, then restarts, goes back to the BSOD with the same error 3 seconds later, resets, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get to the login screen. I cannot get to desktop. I cannot get to BIOS. I do have the OS installation ISO on a usb but I cannot get more than 3 seconds into start-up, so I can't force an OS install from the usb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?&nbsp;</p>

<strong>CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED.</strong></p>

            <p>The solution that worked for me was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold down the "assist" button that's on all Sony laptops (to my knowledge), then press the on button. That'll start up the computer in a troubleshoot mode specific to Sony laptops. Then you select boot from external drive from the menu there, as long as
 you have an OS on an external drive that you can plug into the computer.</p>

            <p>@Howard.</p>
<p>My problem was with a laptop that i upgraded from Windows 8 like you, so no install disc. I replied elsewhere but I'll repeat as your problem sounds identical to mine as my problem also occurred whilst attempting a system restore.</p>
<p>I ended up taking said laptop to my local computer shop that I use regularly for buying bits and pieces, and i have known the owner 10+ years so i didn't expect to get ripped off.</p>
<p>Anyway, he had the devil's own job getting it to boot up. Apparently a partition and the restore settings had been totally wiped out so eventually he had to do a complete fresh install. All in all he took around 4 hours to solve the issue.</p>
<p>Verdict - no idea how it happened but it wasnt a virus or any Windows 10 update. The timing of my problem appeared to have been merely coincidental with the ladt update. Do you have any IObit cleaning programs installed? He thinks that may have been the
 culprit.</p>
<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings but this cost me £50 but at least i have the latest updated version of Windows 10 and a clean laptop.</p>

            <p>Hey</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a dell inspiron 15 7000 series and I encountered the same error message. The computer did the automatic repair and then diagnosed the pc then it says windows can't load correctly then it tries to restart to an earlier point and the only
 option is to click restore or cancel. I click restore and then the laptop appears to restart however it stops at a black &nbsp;screen with the Dell logo and doesn't move.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>

<h2>            ETA on Windows 8 &#47; 10 DX9 Memory allocation issues fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As per the title there is an error preventing Windows 8 and Windows 10 from using more then 4064MB of memory in a DX9 application. This error was acknowledged by windows and sent to the Windows Platform Team to be fixed back in april here:&nbsp;https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/1263324/gpu-memory-allocation-limit-on-directx9-windows-8
 It says Windows 8 in the link but this was reported before windows 10 Technical was released. This issue has as I said been known since april, did not happen in windows 7 and is causing a great deal of grief for many gamers with windows 8 + 10. I go from having
 &nbsp;44960MB of memory on windows 7 to 4064MB of memory on Windows 10. As you can imagine, this is crippling. Is there any word on when this issue will be fixed? I would very much like to get back to modding Skyrim, Fallout, etc, but this is making it impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>This is only a community forum . Nobody in the MS tower of power will hear your plea.<br />
- Win10 does have a <em>Windows Feedback</em> in the Start menu that people often get referred to.<br />
I'm somewhat skeptical as to it's effectiveness, but you definitely won't get any results posting here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- How are you measuring the RAM use ? Have you played Skyrim with the same mods on Win7 for a
</p>
<p>direct comparison ? What are the exact figures ?</p>
<p>- Are you using a 4K monitor, to push the RAM use over 4GB , or just ultra high res textures ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I can't compare DX9 Win10 vs Win7 because I don't have DX9 games that require more than 4GB.</p>
<p>- I don't like ultra high textures (like looking through a magnifying glass, imo), but do have the first 'official' full<br />
high texture pack&nbsp; and some&nbsp; mods with high textures.<br />
Skyrim&nbsp; runs mostly at 45-46% or just under 3.8GB of RAM use on my system.</p>
<p>I can crank it up to 50% if I set AA to 16x CSAA and use 4X super-sampling (but I normally leave it off</p>
<p>due to using ENB ).</p>
- The Skyrim RAM use is pretty much the same on my Win7.&nbsp; 44% instead of 46% because Win7
<p>is using a bit less RAM at idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"I go from having&nbsp; 44960MB of memory on windows 7 to 4064MB of memory on Windows 10. "</em><br />
<br />
44960 = approx&nbsp; 43GB. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what you are referring to here. Is this how much RAM shows in Windows ?</p>
<p>Win10 is quite capable of using more than 8GB RAM, and it displays it accurately in</p>
<p>Task Manager Performance, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>- Are you using the same motherboard with a capability to use more than 16GB RAM ?</p>

            <p>Did any of you actually bother to look at the link? I doubt Hardcore Games even read the post.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Windows 8 and Windows 10 are unable to allocate more then 4064 mb of memory to a direct x 9 application, even if said application is 64bit. Here is a quote from the link I provided:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Description&nbsp;<br />
1. Desctiption:<br />
All DirectX 9.0c/x64 desktop applications can't allocate more GPU memory than 4GB on Windows 8.1. Even if GPU have 12GB.<br />
On Windows 7 it runs ok and correctly allocates 7GB for example.<br />
<br />
2. How to reproduce:<br />
I call D3DXCreateTextureFromFile() of D3DXCreateTexture() and I get error code:<br />
D3DERR_OUTOFVIDEOMEMORY when GUP memory alocatewd is about 4GB.<br />
Expected result is to allocate about 12 BG for textures.<br />
<br />
3. Tips<br />
- I have 32 GB system ram so the RAM is not the issue"<br />
<br />
Here is Microsofts reply:<br />
<br />
"Hi,<br />
<br />
We have determined that this bug belongs to the Windows Platform team and we have transferred this bug to their database. Per their request, we will close this bug and they will contact you directly if they need further information.<br />
<br />
We appreciate you taking the time to submit this issue.&nbsp;<br />

As i said, this issue was not present in windows 7. It has been reported by people who understand what is happening and has been acknowledged by Microsoft. Boris Vorontsov, the person who made ENB made a tool which can demonstrate this issue. Download this
 file: http://enbdev.com/download_vramsizetest.htm and run the DX9 version. It will calculate the amount of Video memory a DX9 / 11 application can use on your system. If you are using windows 8 or 10 it will fail to allocate more then 4064MB of memory. If
 you try it on Windows 7 it will report back the correct amount. Skyrim Performance Monitor can also show the 4064MB wall being hit.<br />
<br />
If i wont get a Microsoft response here, where can i get one? Feedback wont work as that is simply feedback, and would not get a response.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So now we are talking about VRAM, not system RAM ? My gpu has only 2GB VRAM, so I can't compare</p>
<p>VRAM use.</p>
<p>Regarding allocation. How much RAM is the Skyrim game engine capable of allocating ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did read the article, but as it seemed more about developing with Visual C++, and a technical inquiry</p>
<p>I was&nbsp; curious as to how much RAM <em>your </em>Skyrim install is using when you run Win7, because my Skyrim install will notpush over 4GB (including system use) on Win7 either.</p>
<p>Real world gaming figures are what I'm curious about.</p>
<p>

            <p>I just had a quick burl around Skyrim and the max VRAM use was 1581MB (on Win7 atm).</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------</p>
<p>- Not wanting to hijack Joshua's thread but -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nvidia forums, as with these, AMD, and pretty much any hardware forum is all about complaints.</p>
<p>Valid or otherwise.</p>
<p>I have used 355.60 and 358.91 on Win10 with no issues </p>
<p>(well, no worse than any other time in the past 12 years of the issues inherent in PC gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38b1eb61-0c17-431a-a983-ba4d21c43482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38b1eb61-0c17-431a-a983-ba4d21c43482" /></a>&nbsp; ).
</p>
<p>- I also installed 355.60 on Win7 to better compare performance between 7 &amp; 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I used to only change graphics drivers two, maybe three times a year, but since I started haunting the
</p>
<p>Nvidia forums about five years ago I have installed drivers more often to verify if the driver was indeed the</p>
<p>Great Satin that posters insist the were... They're not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>These complaints and accusations roll in with virtually every driver release, and every new AAA game title.
</p>
<p>The number of AAA titles that don't need patching before being properly playable is astounding, but within</p>
<p>a week of release everyone is all over the drivers without considering that if the drivers, and not the game,
</p>
<p>are the issue, that the developer is the one who strayed from the format, and stuffed up the instruction.</p>
<p>Nvidia and AMD are then left to sort out the mess. </p>
<p>By the time I get around to buying a game the smoke has cleared; the dust has settled. :)</p>
<br />
<p>I've never had a driver that was basically flawed. The Release Notes for each driver do point out issues</p>
<p>with specific games, which is often limited to a certain gpu series (commonly the most recent), but the driver
</p>
<p>is never flawed overall.</p>
<p>SLI profiles are another thing altogether. SLI has <em>never</em> been anything but trouble, and people do have to
</p>
<p>wait for a new driver when playing a new release game with SLI (Xfire too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one exception I am aware of was with the 400/500 series cards and 320.something which Nvidia
</p>
<p>acknowledged were&nbsp; problematic with the 400/500 series.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Needless to say, I didn't experiment with this driver when my Gigabyte GTX560ti was still alive
</p>
<p>( It died suddenly of unknown causes after five years of faultless service, about six months ago&nbsp;

</p>
<p>More than I can say for my GTX770 which was RMA'd after the first three months due to what I believe
</p>
<p>was a power regulator failure on the card </p>
<p>- EVGA said nothing, but sent back a card with the same 'SC' fan shroud, but with 'Classified' clock speed.
</p>
<p>Curiouser and curiouser.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've been a bit bored with the gpu forums lately. Day in day out, people blaming the driver without looking into
</p>
<p>the myriad other possible sources of their problems (Gets a bit that way here too, but Win10 has tossed in some</p>
<p>new complaints to spice it up. It's been fun ranting on about DRM blocking &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9dc92836-9644-4000-8558-c8aff78b01c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9dc92836-9644-4000-8558-c8aff78b01c0" /></a>

            I'm talking about RAM, VRAM and Page memory combined. The tool I linked is a DX9 application that attempts to make use of as much RAM, VRAM, and Page Memory as it can, until it cannot use any more, and reports back the amount. On Windows 7, this amount
 would be the total amount your system has. In Windows 8 or 10 this amount is always 4064, unless it would be less. The total RAM, VRAM and Page memory for my system is, as I said, 44960MB, If I installed Windows 7, this is what a DX9 application would be able
 to make use of, and what give or take a MB or two, the Memory test would report back. However, in Windows 8 or 10, it is limited to 4064MB. Microsoft have acknowledged this is an issue on their end and have been "fixing" it since april. This is the issue I
 am talking about.
