<h2>            Losing Track Information When Burning CDs</h2>
                    
<p>Can you maintain the track, artist, song name information when you burn a CD (into .cda format,
<u>not </u>mp3)?&nbsp; I use Windows Media Player to do my burning and ripping.<br />
<br />
If not, what software would you recommend?&nbsp; Again, I need the CD's to be in .cda format so it can be played in my older car CD player and my old boom box.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

            Hi Golf_Ne1,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your inquiry to the Microsoft Answers Site.<br />
&nbsp;CD Audio (.cda) tracks are audio files that can be stored on CD media. The .cda files are representations of CD audio tracks and do not contain the actual pulse code modulation (PCM) information. Cda files can be played only from a CD-ROM. To test a .cda file,
 either try to play a different .cda file from your CD-ROM or try to play a .cda file from a different CD-ROM. Copied from the CD-ROM to the hard disc it cannot be played. This is format used for encoding music on all commercial compact discs. If you buy a
 CD from a store, the music on that CD is stored in CDA format.<br />
The current standard for CD audio requires a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and a sample size of 16 bits (2 bytes per sample). As a result, you need to store 2 x 44,100= 88,200 bytes of data every second to record in mono. Recording in stereo would require twice
 that much storage. That extrapolates to about 10 MB of data for every minute of stereo sound! It is for this reason that compression schemes such as MP3 are so important.
<br />
Unfortunately, your computer can't store files in CDA format, so you still have to convert CDA files to another format to store on your hard disk.<br />
When you burn the MP3 songs into the Audio CD is up to the burning software to insert the song information (which if you use Windows Media Player it does have the feature), and also the CD player has to be able to read the song display information. Make sure
 the mp3 file has the track information before burning to audio cd.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if we may provide additional assistance<br />
<br />
Thank you,

<p>If the game is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">disc based</span> it's probably due to the games copy protection -
<em>SafeDisk</em>. This is one symptom, but the most common</p>
<p>is a bogus error message suggesting to 'Run as Administrator'. I have more details on DRM Blocking in my post at&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---this thread---</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to use a noCD fix/hack from ... <a href="https://megagames.com/games/syberia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://megagames.com/games/syberia&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>to run the disc based version of this,</p>
<p>and many other games, on Win10.</p>
<p>( I have downloaded and scanned the first English version. Avast and Malwarebytes found no threat.
</p>
<p>When downloading verify that you do not download&nbsp; the 'backup' CD by <em>Razor</em>. This is not a noCD fix.
</p>
<p>The fix that says noCD ENG is actually a French version by <em>Quark</em> ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>0r... You can buy a download version from <em>Good Old Games.</em>&nbsp; GOG fix any issues and remove pesky DRM from their games.</p>
<p>The also have a money back guarantee. If you wait for it to come on 'sale' you can get up to 70% off the full price.</p>

    <title>Why do I have two desktop screens&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffy087  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I have two desktop screens&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the screwed-up Microsoft Free Upgrade to Win10 - I had Win7 - there's been a new problem every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today's is that&nbsp;not long after I powered up I clicked on the Task View icon (little box with jug handles).&nbsp;It gave me a choice between Desktop 1 and Desktop 2. They're are identical in every way bar one - Desktop 1 showed the two programs that were running
 whilst Desktop 2 didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing has happened in another profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't think of any reason why anyone would want two desktops**&nbsp;and there's a + sign bottom right to add more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I didn't have two desktops before, I didn't do anything to get the second one and I don't need two. How do I remove it please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>** PS Is it aimed at mobile phone users?&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>I am experiencing difficulties with my Skype for business.&nbsp; My co-workers cannot start a chat with me but I can start a chat with them.&nbsp; I am shown as unavailable to my co-workers and anyone I have added to a group or team on my contacts list, it says updating...
 for their status.&nbsp; If I do not have them added to a group or team and I search their name, I can view their status.&nbsp; I have tried to remove people from my lists but this did not work, I restarted Skype and this did not work either.&nbsp; Could anyone help me with
 this issue?</p>

<p>Hello Tanner H,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my understanding to this issue, it seems like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Your status in Skype for Business shows available, but on co-worker’s side, it shows unavailable when checking your contact card, all co-workers can’t IM or call you either.</p>
<p>2. When you check these co-workers status in Skype for Business, they all show as updating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to this scenario, you may try the following steps to scope the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. If your account has been configured onto multiple Skype for Business clients, temporarily exit them all, only login one Skype for Business client. If there’s any anti-virus or firewall
 software, disable them and test this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Change a different network, as sometimes issue can be caused by network conditions, ports or specific traffics being blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Manually
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-your-presence-status-in-Skype-for-Business-9b64eef5-47b8-46d8-a744-f490e6f88feb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update status</a> on your side via change your status to busy or unavailable, wait a while and then change back to available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Login Outlook Web App, then use Skype for Business integration to see if co-workers can reach to you. Also let one co-works using Outlook Web App Skype for Business integration to send
 you a message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. You may need to confirm with you admin whether there’s any recent change made to your account, and confirm your
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/setting-your-coexistence-and-upgrade-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Teams upgrade mode</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I’d like to confirm, if these users send an IM message, will any error prompts? If any error generates, please share a full screenshot of it with us for checking. If convenient,
 you may also provide a screenshot of issue symptom, so we can better know about your issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Hello Tanner H,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt response. If all co-workers are external contacts, or internal users? You may contact one co-worker of yours and let him try to clear Skype for Business caches to
 see if it works:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&gt;. Sign out Skype for Business, in prompt Sign-in page, click
<strong>Delete sign in info</strong>, then exit Skype for business completely.</p>
<p>2&gt;. Right<span>-</span>click the Windows icon, search “<strong>Run</strong>” application and open it.</p>
<p>3&gt;. Copy the paste the following
<span>path</span> in the search field: <strong><em>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</em></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>4&gt;. Click
<strong>OK </strong>to navigate th<span>at location.</span></p>
<p>5&gt;. Delete the folder
<span>which </span>name begin<span>s</span> with
<strong><em>sip</em></strong><em>_</em></p>
<p>6&gt;. Delete all the sub-items under the
<strong>Tracing</strong> folder, don’t delete Tracing itself.</p>
<p>7&gt;. Open the command prompt and run "<strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also check your Skype for Business client version number and share it with us. You may find this information via Skype for Business-&gt;Help-&gt;About Skype for Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue still exists, to look into the issue, may I collect tracing log from both side for checking? To collect logs, please firstly let co-workers clear Skype for Business caches again,
 then on your side, clear caches via above steps, after done, try to reproduce this issue, and then compress the Tracing folder on each side, and send them to me in Private Messages (to protect your privacy) :

            Make sure the vents are all clear of dust and debris and it is in a well ventilated area.&nbsp; You can also try performing the hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold
 the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

    <title>Windows 10 fails with Intel HD 3000 Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dean290000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 fails with Intel HD 3000 Drivers</h2>
                    <p>I have an Dell XPS 13 Laptop (2013 model) which I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; I first tried and an update and then a clean install.&nbsp; The Specs are pretty standard I5 CPU/8GB RAM/256GB SSD drive and Intel HD 3000 Graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My display goes fuzzy where the screen is almost impossible to see and the only way I can fix to the display is to reboot or go to into the graphics properties and change the resolution and then revert back to the original resolution and everything looks
 fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Dell come out and replace the display just in case and their support says that Intel needs to rewrite the HD 3000 drivers to work with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running version 9.17.10.4229 of the HD 3000 drivers and the driver fails sometimes multiple times a day and sometimes it will go a week without failing.&nbsp; Most of the time, I have to change the resolution or reboot, although every once in the
 while the system will state the HD 3000 driver failed but has been reloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest complain I have about this is that I ran a compatibility check and Windows 10 showed all my drivers worked with Windows 10.&nbsp; I understand that Dell makes the actual laptop and Intel writes the drivers but Microsoft Windows 10 is the one that
 states that the drivers were compatible.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried putting numerous versions of the drivers on this laptop but it is the same problem every time.&nbsp; Some versions of the drivers crash more than others but no one has updated the drivers for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an IT Consultant who takes his laptops to clients daily, I just cannot have the screen mess up especially if I am connected to a Server/Router/Firwall, etc. and have my screen become fuzzy (and almost completely impossible to view) if I am in the middle
 of upgrading a device.&nbsp; It is also embarrassing if I am showing a presentation to clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to wipe out the SSD and reinstall Win 7 Pro.&nbsp; However, I thought I would make one last ditch effort to post in the forums here to see if there is a solution/workaround that I am unaware of before going through the hassle of reimaging and reinstalling
 all my software, files, and data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Dean</p>

            <p>I have found a fix that so far has been great oiling for four days. I don't want to say it is resolved yet.&nbsp; I found a person who poster a YouTube video with the exact same make computer and same problem The solution was. To put on the video drivers for
 thr HD 3000 that Dell first released for Windows 8 and set the&nbsp; compute&nbsp; not to allow updating of the drivers.to.newer ones. &nbsp; So far this has fixed the. Issue but I want to give it would weeks before I am satisfied it is fixed. &nbsp; I may have made it 3 to 4
 days one other time in the. Last 8 plus months without the screen become g distorted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not hwv&nbsp; access to my Dell laptop at the moment but will post the driver version within a couple of days for other with this same problem.

            <p>This is definitely the fix for the 2013 Dell XPS 13 LX123 is the model I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the graphic drivers 9.17.10.2770 (release data May 2012) of the Intel HD 3000 chipset designed for Windows 8.x. I set it where it does not automatically update the driver and this has worked for 2 weeks which is at least 7 - 8 days more than
 it ever went before without having the screen screw up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps other people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I found this fix from a youtube video searching XPS 13 with HD 3000 drivers Windows 10 display problems.</p>
<p>

<h2>            EDI</h2>
                    
<p>This topic is very likely to induce some more "ending talk" so, be warned.&nbsp; Kimieva and myself have had much debate recently on whether or not EDI survives the 'Destroy Ending'.&nbsp; She maintains that it's impossible and that there has been no proof of it happening,
 while I distinctly remember seeing her walk off of The Normandy at the end not once, but TWICE and my son also witnessed it on my last ME3 playthrough.&nbsp; I'll link this&nbsp;
<a href="http://masseffect.answers.wikia.com/wiki/Can_EDI_walk_out_of_the_crashed_Normandy_after_choosing_the_%22destroy_synthetics%22_ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://masseffect.answers.wikia.com/wiki/Can_EDI_walk_out_of_the_crashed_Normandy_after_choosing_the_%22destroy_synthetics%22_ending</a>&nbsp; while it's not exactly "proof", there have been others who've seen her survive 'Destroy' as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that none
 of my playthroughs of ME3 have included the 'Extended Cut', but EDI appeared to be displaying more human traits as the game went on to me and I can see many reasons (perhaps because I want to believe) how she could've survived, anybody else here see her walk
 off of The Normandy after 'Destroy'?...:-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no reason for EDI to survive Destroy, regardless how much you encourage her to rework her programming or purse a relationship with Joker. She is an entirely synthetic lifeform, based largely off of Reaper (Sovereign) technology. &nbsp;It doesn't matter
 if the Crucible is targeting only synthetic life or only Reaper-based life, EDI fits the bill for both categories.<br />
<br />
You can believe and "head canon" anything you want, but EDI dies in Destroy. If she somehow walks out of the Normandy in the pre-Extended Cut Destroy ending, that's more of a glitch than something that was intended.
<br />
<br />
Or to put it another way - there's a scene in Mass Effect where Corporal Toombs reacts to Shepard as though Shepard has the "sole survivor" background even if you have the "war hero" or "ruthless" background. Or Conrad Verner in Mass Effect 2 says you stuck
 a gun in his face, even though if you took the Paragon route in Mass Effect and did not do any such thing. Or, in Mass Effect 3, the scene where Donnelly &amp; Daniels finally get together never appears because it is incorrectly linked to Ashley's approval of
 Shepard. (corrected in the Extended Cut)<br />
<br />
All of these things were never intended. You can assign meaning to them if you want, but you're assigning meaning to a mistake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While any "evidence" that I've been able to unearth does indeed point towards a "design oversight", the possibility of her surviving isn't so unbelievable to me. &nbsp;For one, I still DO subscribe to the 'Indoctrination Theory' as being the best explanation

 able to solve The Reaper problem on her own due to lack of insufficient data. &nbsp;It's perfectly feasible to me that she saw the probable outcome of purging all synthetics as one of the only effective strategies of exterminating them and therefore prepared accordingly
 (like she always does) by taking steps to follow through on her instincts to survive (a human characteristic that she could not possibly have overlooked in her "quest" to better understand humans). &nbsp;Her computing powers are second to none and was no doubt
 yet another prodigy by The Illusive Man (she was designed by Cerberus NOT The Reapers) to further advance humanity, hard for me to see her as nothing more than synthetic, if anyone was capable of engineering "Synthesis" to ensure her survival, it was EDI (Shepard
 herself is a Lazurus Prodigy from "Synthesis" who also survives 'Destroy'). &nbsp;While talking to her in ME2 she makes reference to certain "protocols" that would kick in if a certain situation were to arise, The Illusive Man likely also saw to it that EDI carry
 out the human legacy "no matter the cost", and as far as 'The Extended Cut' debunking this possibility by putting her name "on the memorial board"? &nbsp;That DLC was designed to please a certain group of players which I was quite happy not to be a part of, all
 though I expected something different (or better?) out of the original endings, I liked the "open to interpretation" (or, "artistic") approach of the original endings which is what I still go by, EDI's alive at the end of my playthroughs and I'm still going

<p>There is the possibility of speculation as to Shepard surviving because we don't know the extent of how the implants are keeping Shepard alive. It is possible that they are now functioning just like the pins we have today to mend broken legs.<br />
<br />
As to EDI I found it more likely that the Geth would survive over her, they after all are pure software. EDI is reliant on her hardware, which is why the AI core is so damn large.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is probably going to sound harsher than I intend it to, so all apologies in advance. We've already spoken at length about this, so you know most of my feelings on this matter. I'm just going to elaborate a bit, and respond to your individual points.</p>
<p>[quote user="Arkham99"]</p>
<p>While any "evidence" that I've been able to unearth does indeed point towards a "design oversight", the possibility of her surviving isn't so unbelievable to me. &nbsp;For one, I still DO subscribe to the 'Indoctrination Theory' as being the best explanation

<br />
Okay. Let's start here. Indoctrination Theory is not true. However, let's say that it is. If we say that IT exists and is the intended explanation for the end of ME3, EDI's survival in the Destroy ending
<em>means nothing at all</em>. IT postulates that the breath scene at the end of the high EMS Destroy option is Shepard "waking up" from the indoctrination, and that the true ending has yet to occur. From the IT perspective of things, all events that occur
 after Harbinger blasts Shepard on Earth take place in Shepard's mind. The confrontation with the Illusive Man, Anderson's death, speaking with the Catalyst, activating the Crucible, the aftermath of the Crucible, and the Normandy crew stepping out onto the
 jungle planet are nothing more than a hallucination. <br />
<br />
If you believe in IT, then it doesn't matter if EDI steps off the Normandy, because none of that actually happened. Shepard is still on Earth, the final battle is still taking place, and the ending of that battle has yet to happen.<br />
<br />
[quote]Besides from seeing her survive 'Destroy' with my own eyes, EDI has always been very adept at foreseeing every possibility well beforehand and applying the best course of action, she wasn't able to solve The Reaper problem on her own due to lack of insufficient
 instincts to survive (a human characteristic that she could not possibly have overlooked in her "quest" to better understand humans). [/quote]<br />
<br />
I'm assuming at this point, you're not actually speaking about IT any longer. Everything here is irrelevant if IT is accurate.<br />
<br />
Saying that, there are many problems with this, Arkham. The first is that the exact same argument can apply to the Reapers. Exactly what steps do you think she could have taken that the Reapers themselves could not also have taken? The Reapers know about the
 Crucible, the Catalyst confirms as much in the Extended Cut, and if you prefer not to take that into account, then keep in mind that when the Illusive Man warned the Reapers about what the Crucible fleet intended to do, it's likely he explained enough to them
 that they would either outright know or extrapolate enough to take whatever precautions EDI could, or greater. Firing the Crucible would essentially do nothing at that point if synthetics were capable of shielding themselves from it. If you're honestly going
 to say that EDI could solve this problem but the Reapers could not, especially when the entire brain trust of the Crucible construction team couldn't even tell us what it was going to do, then I would say that's nothing more than wishful thinking.<br />
<br />
Saying that she'd "take steps to ensure her survival" is very vague. Considering she is not even three years old, that she would already have a solution that the Reapers would be unable to figure out themselves is problematic. Legion states that for all its
 processing power, the mind of a single Reaper, a Destroyer and not a Sovereign class vessel by all evidence, was unknowable and unfathomable to it. I don't think Legion would have the same opinion of EDI.<br />
<br />
[quote]Her computing powers are second to none and was no doubt yet another prodigy by The Illusive Man (she was designed by Cerberus NOT The Reapers) to further advance humanity, [/quote]<br />
<br />
1) This is your opinion. It's never stated anywhere that EDI is the pinnacle of computing power. The Geth consensus, for example should have a far greater overall computing power than EDI by weight of sheer numbers alone. EDI is an AI, but she isn't necessarily
 the greatest AI ever created nor the most powerful one. And if you think her computing power exceeds the Reapers much less any single Reaper, we have to re-examine the entirety of the lore as presented so far.<br />
<br />
2) While EDI was designed by Cerberus, she was designed using material and data recovered from Sovereign. This is confirmed in both ME2 and ME3. She's technically based on Reaper technology, which means she would likely have some vulnerability to any weapon
 that targeted it specifically.<br />
<br />
3) She wasn't designed by the Illusive Man. She was designed by Cerberus. This confirmed throughout ME3. He ordered her creation, but a separate team did all of the developmental work and sent reports to the Illusive Man on their progress. The videos in Cronos
 Station confirm this.</p>
<p>[quote]hard for me to see her as nothing more than synthetic, if anyone was capable of engineering "Synthesis" to ensure her survival, it was EDI (Shepard herself is a Lazurus Prodigy from "Synthesis" who also survives 'Destroy').&nbsp; [/quote]<br />
<br />
EDI is completely synthetic, Arkham. No part of her is organic. Now, saying that, being synthetic doesn't exclude her from being sentient, alive, self-aware, etc, but she isn't organic. This is an important distinction to make when taking the Crucible into
 account. The Crucible isn't targeting <em>machines</em>, it's targeting <em>non-organic life</em>. Regardless of how you feel about EDI, she's not organic, and the Crucible won't care that she is a living, sentient being.<br />
<br />
As far as your other statement about EDI "engineering synthesis," I'm not sure what you're trying to imply. EDI can obviously affect her own programming, but nothing she can do to either the Eva Core platform she controls, or the Normandy's Quantum Blue Box
 technology that houses her systems, is going to make her organic. She's not and can never be organic.
<br />
<br />
Shepard can survive the Destroy ending because Shepard is an organic that has synthetic modification. Shepard is nothing like EDI in this regard. Shepard is closer to the Quarians, who use cybernetic enhancements, than EDI.<br />
<br />
[quote]While talking to her in ME2 she makes reference to certain "protocols" that would kick in if a certain situation were to arise the Illusive Man likely also saw to it that EDI carry out the human legacy "no matter the cost", [/quote]</p>
<p>Um...no. The Illusive Man did nothing of the sort. He was very clear that it was intended to be nothing more than a cyberwarfare suite in the Cronos Station videos. The shackles that Joker removed were meant to control her behavior, not to initiate some
 great humanity preservation scenario. The protocols EDI referred to meant scenarios that could release her blocks, allowing her access to the Normandy and her full Cerberus databases. Joker removed those in ME2.
<br />
<br />
I'm 99.9% percent certain that at no point in any of ME2 or ME3 that the Illusive Man mentions anything similar to what you're proposing, nor does EDI say anything that can corroborate it.<br />
<br />
[quote]and as far as 'The Extended Cut' debunking this possibility by putting her name "on the memorial board"? &nbsp;That DLC was designed to please a certain group of players which I was quite happy not to be a part of, all though I expected something different
 (or better?) [/quote]<br />
<br />
The "certain group of players" you refer to were all outraged that EDI had to die in the Destroy ending. Half of the people who are still, to this day, raging about the ending of Mass Effect 3 are upset at how the Destroy ending forces you to kill EDI and/or
 the Geth. Nearly everybody wanted them to survive Destroy, especially in the Extended Cut. There are exceedingly few people who were actually pleased to see EDI's name on the memorial wall, and those people never liked EDI to begin with. Her death in Destroy,
 pre or post Extended Cut, was never meant to appease anyone. It's meant to be the price of choosing the Destroy ending, since the Geth can be killed at Rannoch.
<br />
<br />
You make it sound like EDI dies in Destroy because BioWare is appeasing people who wanted her to die, which is almost certainly not the case.<br />
<br />
[quote]out of the original endings, I liked the "open to interpretation" (or, "artistic") approach of the original endings which is what I still go by, EDI's alive at the end of my playthroughs and I'm still going to abstain from downloading a DLC that should
 never have happened in the first place which significantly alters a story that I was supposedly crafting myself on how I decide it to be...:-)[/quote]<br />
<br />
It's obviously your choice to not download the Extended Cut and accept the endings as originally presented. Saying that EDI survives Destroy in your playthroughs is only the result of a glitch or oversight, though. If you pick Destroy, and ME4 allows you to
 import some measure of your total save files, she's not going to be there. The point of Destroy is that all synthetic life is wiped out. If synthetic life is capable of ignoring the Crucible's effects, then the whole premise of the ending is compromised.<br />
<br />
And regardless, if you truly subscribe to IT, none of this matters, because Shepard is waking up on Earth and the final battle has not been fought. Nor will it ever be fought, since no further content will be developed regarding the endings.</p>

<p>There's just as many problems with your "absolutes" as there are with my "head canon" views, let's entertain your "absolute" opinion that, what was it you said the other night? &nbsp;Oh yeah, "there's absolutely nothing organic about EDI whatsoever", and combine
 that with EDI's own words which were, "I exist primarily within the ship (Normandy)", now this would make The Normandy itself no different than EDI's "robot" body, a simple vessel in which to house an AI (or, a SYNTHETIC), yet in addition to Shepard surviving
 'Destroy', The Normandy also clearly survives and is very much functional afterwards, yes it's a large piece of hardware but it was very much reliant on EDI's systems for optimum performance, such as outrunning the "energy surge" after Shepard chooses 'Destroy',
 curious that you'd so readily accept that Joker found the time to assess EDI was no longer functional (and dealt with his "emotions" accordingly) and successfully "rebooted" all the ship's systems before performing the greatest evasive manoeuvre of the millenium
 after the ship's brain stopped functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You make it sound like EDI dies in Destroy because BioWare is appeasing people who wanted her to die, which is almost certainly not the case."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I'm not saying that "people wanted her to die", I'm saying that a group of players refused to accept the "open-endedness" of a very different approach to ending a story, for reasons beyond me&nbsp;that group preferred to have BioWare "connect the dots" for
 them instead of making up their own minds, I didn't require a cutscene showing The Normandy evacuating Shepard's squad on Earth for I all ready imagined that to be the case, this group battled to no end to maintain control over their choices and have them
 "mean something" but in the end, demanded that BioWare spell out everything that happened for them and didn't want to create their&nbsp;OWN ending to their OWN story.&nbsp; Those that DID choose their own interpretations of the original endings (e.g. 'Indoctrination
 Theory') are now looked down upon as not going on what "BioWare said".&nbsp; I chose EDI for a squadmate&nbsp;every chance I could&nbsp;and encouraged her human qualities at every opportunity, her last words to me were "I TRULY feel ALIVE" (you're basically calling EDI a
 liar if you don't believe her) and she DID survive my 'Destroy' ending, if you prefer to label that a "glitch" that's fine, I personally prefer to see it as a logical progression to a story that I had a hand in fashioning through choices that I made...:-)</p>

<p>I think the point that Arkham is trying to make here is that the non EC ending is open to a vast amount of interpretation and that it leaves many openings for people to&nbsp;fill in&nbsp;the gaps on their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is fine for those who enjoy that kind of ending... many however, did not and saw most of the 'openings' as plot holes or w/e. The point is, many of us are just never going to agree on a lot of the details of what 'actually' happened or did not. Discussing
 these topics is fine, but more often than not it just turns into a bickering contest over who is 'right'... when there, by the original ending's own inferences, is no singular 'correct' ending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's JMPO, but I detest that kind of 'make up your own details' ending in the context of the ME universe. Simply because the whole trilogy is absolutely laden with facts, details and&nbsp;backstories. People with inquisitive, 'hungry' minds can get lost in the
 codex alone. In short, the ME galaxy leaves little to the imagination. The fact that the ending did almost the exact opposite&nbsp;never did&nbsp;sit right with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one thing I'd like to note about the EDI idea. Casey Hudson stood by&nbsp;his 'protecting the&nbsp;artistic vision' stance adamantly. He wasn't about to change what was already there and I believe a statement&nbsp;in regards to EC before it released&nbsp;(not necessarily
 from Casey himself) was made that was similar to "There's a lot we can do with what is already there, without rewriting it". Drawing that to its natural conclusion, that means all they were doing was 'connecting the dots'. Perhaps elaborating or even building&nbsp;on
 the facts that were already there.&nbsp;Regardless of whether they were connecting them to 'appease certain people' or not, they weren't&nbsp;changing them. That being said, EDI died in my destroy endings, both original and EC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my original destroy ending, Joker got off the Normandy alone, followed by Liara, then Javik.&nbsp;EC... her name was on the memorial wall. I simply can not... will not... believe they made such an oversight (or rewrite)&nbsp;as that, taking into consideration how
 much flack they were taking in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Joker not being able to escape the energy surge without EDI. I remember a conversation between EDI, Joker and Shepard in the cockpit, where EDI basically said Joker piloted the Normandy 'better' than she did herself, especially in high stress level/combat
 situations, saying that 'increased stress levels' actually gave him an edge&nbsp;and she basically just operated the cyber warfare suites and left Joker do the flying in those situations. As for the Normandy not being able to function without her (or at least at
 optimum efficiency). I will simply choose to see it in a context similar to "The lights are on but no one's home". If my house were fully automated and all it's functions were done by computer (lights, heat/AC, appliances etc.) It may run more efficiently
 with it but if that PC crashed, my house would still function as long as someone was there to access the controls, switches and etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just FTR... not calling you wrong, as long as you're willing to extend me the same courtesy.</p>

<p>"Acording to Engineer Adams argument with Donnelly on the Normandy, EDI is now the Normandy. After Joker unshackled her AI and she was able to take control of the ship, EDI is now part of every system of the Ship. EDI also tells Shepard she controls the
 life support system. If the Red Wave did truely destroy EDI and forced the ship to crash land then how could Joker land a ship with that many failed systems? How could the crew of the Normandy survive without life support to even survive a landing? How could
 the Normandy take off from a planet that was not in a dry dock facility?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of many threads where players claimed to see EDI alive after 'Destroy':</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's either a "design oversight", or BioWare originally intended to leave the possibility open with the original endings...:-)</p>

<p>Because the Normandy isn't dependent on EDI for anything except the Cyberwarfare functions, Arkham. Prior to Joker unshackling EDI, everything else on the Normandy functioned independently. While EDI may have had control over various other functions if necessary,
 the operation of the Normandy was never dependent upon her. Joker unshackling her provided her access to many of the Normandy's other functions, but the ship can function fine without her.
<br />
<br />
In ME3, there's even a moment where EDI goes completely offline while dealing with Eva Core, and the ship doesn't shut down.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made a folder on OneDrive for videos and I want that folder to be shown in the Videos library in explorer, just like there is a OneDrive Documents and Pictures folder shown in explorer's Documents and Pictures library respectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going into settings of the Videos library, I have added the OneDrive Videos folder but for some reason it is still not shown in the Videos library in explorer.</p>
<p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />You can try the following procedures below:
<br /> 
<br />Log into OneDrive on your computer and run the following commands to update OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R 
<br />
<br />In the Run window, enter: 
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe/reset
<br />
<br />Wait 2 minutes and then execute the following command: 
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\update 
<br />
<br />Click OK. 
<br />
<br />Make sure the OneDrive icon in the notification area of the taskbar disappears and then re-appears after a minute or two. 
<br />
<br />If the OneDrive icon doesn’t re-appear after a few minutes, open the Run window again and enter: 
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't solve the problem please try to reinstall the last version for OneDrive in the link below

<p>I have found the cause, which seems to be something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Properties box of the Videos library, it is shown that the library is optimized for videos. If you select in the dropdown menu to optimize the library for, say, Documents, then a separation line in the explorer window shows up that separates the OneDrive
 files from the files on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as the library is optimized for videos, the OneDrive files are <strong>
<em>not </em></strong>separated from the videos on the PC and they are all shown together in the explorer window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug?</p>

<br />Change double click to single click
<br />To effect this change, You will have to change a setting in  File Explorer Options in Windows 10.
<br />To do this, type ‘Folder‘ in Start Search and click on File Explorer Options.
<br />Here under the General tab, you will see Click items as follows.
<br />Select Single-click to open an item (point to select).
<br />You may also want to select the Underline icon tiles only when I point at them option.
<br />Click Apply &gt; OK &gt; Exit.

            There are not any messages in my "Drafts" folder, but I still get the message that there are unsent emails in my outbox.&nbsp; I really don't want to send them if I don't know what they are.&nbsp; What do I do to see the unsent emails?&nbsp; Expanding the ribbon doesn't
 show an outbox for me.<br />

<h2>            How best to transfer files and settings to a new computer&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo Yoga running Windows 10 and recently bought a newer model as a replacement. Is there an easy way to transfer settings and files to the new computer - ideally it would look and operate exactly the same.

<p>Does the new computer have Windows 10?&nbsp; Is it activated?</p>
<p>If it is then you could clone the older computers hard drive to the newer computers drive.</p>
<p>EaseUS Todo Backup can do the clone if you can connect the new drive to the old computer.</p>

<p>Only files can be transferred. You have to install all your programs and setup your user account and UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sign in with Microsoft account, then some things can be set on your user account. Like your desktop image and things like that. If you had synced your user settings with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to transfer files</p>
<p>is on your old PC</p>
<p>go to C:\Users\Public</p>
<p>copy all your files and program installers into a folder here.</p>
<p>Now on your new PC</p>
<p>Open Network folder, select your old PC</p>
<p>Open the Public folder and copy or move it to your new PC.</p>

<p>In addition to what Certified_friend said there is one thing you can do,</p>
<p>If you have not cleaned it out before doing a clean install or reset or an update do this; copy the Download Folder in File Explorer to a USB or another drive on the disk.&nbsp; Then use it to install the downloaded programs rather than wandering all over the
 Internet to download the programs again.</p>
<p>What he does not tell you is that downloaded files when installed also puts data in the System files and if it is not there your programs will not work.</p>

            Hi Joe,
<br />
<br />Is the hard drive in the new model of the same or greater size to the previous model?
<br />
<br />If it is, then if you can connect the two hard drives to the one system, you can clone the old hard drive onto the new one with software like the Free version of Macrium Reflect
<br />
<br />Please Note, before doing this, make sure Windows is activated on the new device
<br />
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you will have to manually move all your data (files and folders) over to the new device
<br />
<br />On the old device, go to Settings - Accounts - Sync Your Settings and turn on all options there
<br />
<br />Then when you log into the new device with the same Microsoft Account, those settings should transfer across       
        </p>

<p>I see it is a laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I would not try using the old drive on new PC. Especially if the internal hardware is all different. You are just setting yourself up for problems. But what do I know right. LOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was a PC, then you could connect it and copy the files to C:\. But I would still do fresh installs of my programs and spend the 1 1/2 hours to set up my UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just get all your program CD's out and any program installers you have on old PC so you can install them on new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cutting corners to save a little time will usually bite you in the .... and cause you days of grief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>

            Hi JPickett60 
<br />
<br />DCOM 10016 errors are the most common errors in Windows 10, generally there is nothing you need to do, because these will happen without you even knowing any thing occurred. The Windows operating system is designed to recover from errors behind the scenes, without ant user knowledge or interaction
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will generate 100'2 sometimes 1000's of errors a day and this is believe it or not quite normal and no action needs to be taken
<br />
<br />Unless you are actually having problems with your PC, if you are, please let me know and we will resolve that for you . . .

<h2>            Skype format Has Changed</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community, So, I tried to use Skype yesterday, but its format has changed. &nbsp;It seems very different and I was unable to navigate it. &nbsp;also, My Contact List has been extremely abbreviated. Most of my contact have disappeared. Also, the name Skype Beta
 appears, which seems very odd.</p>
<p>I would like to return to the format that existed two days ago. &nbsp;Thanks for any helpful ideas and responses. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Using Windows 10</p>
<p>Directly wired to modem.</p>
<p>Internet can run for hours just fine and then it drops out repeatedly.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting usually fixes the Default Gateway not available error.</p>
<p>It does not stay fixed for long.</p>
<p>Looking or fixes, I checked my adapter's version.</p>
<p>I think I have the up-to-date version of&nbsp; Broadcom NetLink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet&nbsp; Driver version: 15.6.1.2</p>
<p>I unchecked the box that allows my computer to power off this device.</p>
<p>If I wanted a fresh copy of the driver, I don't know which one I might need.</p>

            I will keep your advice in mind.&nbsp; However, the driver I got from Dell has solved my problem. That Ethernet driver is 12.2.2.2 dated 8/6/09.

<p>Whether making the Internet connection a metered connection is the "best way" to stop Windows updates is debatable. A more effective way would be to disable the Windows Update service via the Services Manager (services.msc).</p>

            Hi Nat.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Admin, copy and paste in the following command and press Enter:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash). 
<br />
<br />4 Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  
<br />
<br />5) If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows help &#38; support can&#39;t start</h2>
                    Hi, I have Windows 7 &amp; for some reason I cannot get Windows Help &amp; Support to start when I click it. A box comes up simply saying "unable to start"<br />
<br />
I have checked Services &amp; there is no mention of Help &amp; Support there. I'm sure it has always been there before!<br />
<br />
I have done a system restore and it still will not open up. I have not downloaded any software for months &amp; I've done a malware &amp; virus scans which state nothing found.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me please to get Windows Help &amp; Support to work again?<br />
<br />
many thanks.<br />

            <p>Thank You for posting your question, I would personally like to apologize for the late reply.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main problem why the error message keeps coming up due to Windows not being updated, quote the reason for the program saying that there is a file missing, to try and troubleshoot this please try this and follow the steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the second link will open a&nbsp;webpage should open up your windows update tool, please make sure that you have selected to receive updates from Microsoft office and Microsoft programs, as there maybe an update for your program/Windows based Machine. Also direct
 x which runs your graphics in the back ground. I recommend going to the first link and downloading the new one and then check for updates for your machine.</p>
