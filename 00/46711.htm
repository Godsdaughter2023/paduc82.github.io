<p>Hi kamleshbouddh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might not be using the correct recovery key. If you can’t find your recovery key, try to think back to when you set up BitLocker.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Here are places to look for your BitLocker key:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>On a printout you saved</strong>. Look in places you keep important papers.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Saved on a USB flash drive</strong>. Plug the USB flash drive in to your locked PC and follow the instructions. If you saved the key as a text file on the flash drive, use a different computer to read the text file.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>In your Microsoft account</strong>. To get your recovery key, go to
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=237614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BitLocker Recovery Keys</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>In your Azure Active Directory account</strong>. For work PCs where you sign in with an Azure Active Directory account, to get your recovery key, see the device info for your
<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=857635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Azure account</a>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have the recovery key, you might have to format the drive which means you’ll erase its contents, but at least you’ll be able to use the drive again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if I can help you with anything else. </p>

<h2>            Why are some Blu-ray disks not recognized by 64-bit Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Most pre-recorded commercial Blu-ray disks can be played on my Dell workstation, which runs under&nbsp;64-bit Windows 7. However,&nbsp;3 or 4 new Blu-ray recordings&nbsp;are simply not recognized. The drive makes typical reading noises after inserting any of these disks
 but they never appear in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers for the BD/DVD/CD drive were already at the latest level and I even tried&nbsp;deleting and reinstalling the drivers.</p>
<p>

            <p>Dear Shalini,<br />
Thank you for your attempt to help but your suggested solutions appear to be aimed at people whose&nbsp;optical disk&nbsp;drives are not recognised by Windows in any circumstances. That is not my problem. As I said in my original post, I do not normally have any difficulty
 in accessing Blu-ray disks in my BD/DVD/CD drive. The problem is limited to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">specific disks</span> that don't show up in Windows&nbsp;Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my original post I said that 3 or 4 disks had this problem. However, I think that I was just being impatient with some of those, as&nbsp;it now appears that only one disk might be affected (an Opus Arte recording of the opera
<em>Die Meistersinger</em>). No matter how long I leave this particular disk in the drive, it never appears in Windows&nbsp;Explorer. It does play on my dedicated Blu-ray player, so the problem only relates to my attempt to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;on a Windows PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does a Blu-ray disk require extra steps in the mastering process to make it readable by Windows?</p>
<p>

<p>This disk is made for all regions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downloading the Windows 7 Codec Pack from 3 different sites but all were rejected by AVG Antivirus as containing malware (a "highly active" adware program called OpenCandy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after downloading the DirectX updates (all of which appeared to be at least 7 years old) my Blu-ray of
<em>Die Meistersinger </em>is now readable! While it is theoretically&nbsp;possible that some other change during the past week or so made the key difference, I am prepared to give your suggestion the credit for fixing my problem. Many thanks for your help on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is DirectX something required by all Blu-ray disks? If so, then might different disks be looking for different versions of DirectX?</p>

            <p>My recording of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> came on two Blu-ray disks and the problems reported above all related to Disk 1. I'm fairly sure that a brief check of Disk 2 several weeks ago showed that it was readable. However, after cracking the issues with
 Disk 1 earlier today I then found&nbsp;that Disk 2 was now demonstrating exactly the same issues I previously described for Disk 1.&nbsp;Applying the latest Windows 7 updates and rebooting my PC made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with Disk 2 has just been resolved by a method I stumbled across by accident. As originally experienced with Disk 1,&nbsp;the presence of Disk 2 in my drive was not showing in Windows Explorer (despite regular reading noises from the drive) but I
 happened to select 'Computer' in the left pane of Windows Explorer and then noticed that the right pane included an entry for 'BD-RE Drive (D:)'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double-clicking that right pane&nbsp;entry somehow triggered completion of the disk reading process and&nbsp;a reference to Drive D and the Blu-ray title&nbsp;then appeared in the left pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still find it very strange that only one of the recordings in my Blu-ray collection should cause such issues but I hope this thread offers some potential solutions to anyone else who hits a similar problem.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The model of Blu-ray player is not relevant. Earlier in this thread, I stated that my
<em>Die Meistersinger</em>&nbsp;disk&nbsp;"does play on my dedicated Blu-ray player, so the problem only relates to my attempt to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;on a Windows PC".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opus&nbsp;Arte, the publishers of this <em>Die Meistersinger</em>&nbsp;recording, did their best to help but their technical contacts were not from the original authoring company, which limited their ability to check out the problem in greater depth.&nbsp;A replacement
 disk provided by Opus Arte behaved in exactly the same erratic fashion as my original disk. Sometimes Disk 1 would be readable, but not Disk 2. On another day, Disk 2 would be readable, but not Disk 1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never managed to reach a position where both disks were readable at the same time and never found a consistent way of ensuring that a specific disk was readable. It was just a matter of trial and error. However, the fact that I did eventually manage to
 read both disks enabled me to complete their conversion to MKV files (using MakeMKV software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In practice, therefore, I no longer have a problem, as I can now stream the MKV versions over my home network (my normal procedure) and I can still play the original Blu-rays on my dedicated BD player.</p>

<h2>            How do I disable the fingerprint reader at signin&#63;</h2>
                    When I first loaded Microsoft Windows 7 it seemed to give me no choice about having a password (or fingerprint scanned) required at login.&nbsp; I normally wouldn't uses the restrictions to access, but figured "oh what the heck?") and segt up th fingerprint
 scanner.&nbsp; For over a year it worked pretty good, but of late either my fingerprint has changed (!!) or the reader has fallen into some kind of disrepair.&nbsp; Anyway I want to eliminate it from my signin, - as well as the password requirement.&nbsp; But I can't find
 any way to do it.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
HELP, please!&nbsp;

<p>The Headset that came with my xbox one that I purchased 7 or so months ago has broken, I can hear chat it connects to the controller all fine but the microphone wont work. it has worked the last time I used it about 3 weeks ago but now will not. I'm wondering
 will I be able to get a free warranty replacement, is this just a bug with there software&nbsp;and is there any way I could fix it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can almost assure you that the wires inside are the problem. &nbsp;The stock chat piece has a fundamental design flaw in that the wiring comes straight out of the adapter and those wires end up getting repeatedly kinked to the point of failure. &nbsp;i don't know
 if there is a warranty for that item, but they are only 25 dollars to replace. &nbsp;That being said a new one will eventually fail as well. &nbsp;</p>

<p>HE IS RIGHT!!</p>
<p>This is definitely something they know about and I feel like don't care. When I bought my Xbox One. Everything that came with it had to be replaced. The console, the controller, and the headset all in only a few months. One after the other starting with
 the controller, which the LB button quick working in a month. The the console was bricked while it was installing a system update from Microsoft. After I got it back my mic stopped working shortly after, suddenly and for no reason at all. It's still in a box
 with their address on it in the trunk. I bought a new one because it was almost as cheap as paying to have it sent back. Well guess what? Yup, you got it, a few months of use and right in the middle of a GTA session while trying to introduce a friend to the
 game it stopped working mid-sentence. Same problem.</p>
<p>Here's the moral of my story and what I will be doing to remedy this situation:</p>
<p>BUY A TURTLE BEACH HEADSET or something comparable</p>
<p>Microsoft makes junk and they do not care. Here's a computer, it's gonna get viruses, somebody might steal your identity and bank account, the thing might just freeze up all together for no apparent reason, but don't worry... it's cool.</p>
<p>They figure they will replace anything in warranty no problem and they stay really busy honoring them warranties. They just bank on most people are just going to replace it on their on or lose their proof of warranty or that you will forget its covered by
 warranty or whatever. Just that you wont actually make them replace it and they will get paid over and over for the same thing.</p>
<p>By the time you end up buying a good set because you replaced the other one so many times you could have already paid for the good set and never went through the headache.</p>
<p>Dont count on your replacement to perform any better. You will be disappointed.</p>

            Hi Pavan<br />
<div>I understand you are getting Error 0X5 and 0X490 and “Boot Manager failed to find OS Loader” after you had System File Error issue and you tried to fixit with Diagnostic tool.
<br />
<div>You said you want some solution which can work without Windows Installation disk, however in this case there are very limited steps that we can take to get this working without the Operating System Disc.</div>
<div>We can try some of these steps mentioned below to get this problem solved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong>: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Perform system recovery</strong>.<br />
<div>The System Recovery Options menu contains several tools, such as Startup Repair, that can help you recover Windows from a serious error. This set of tools is on your computer's hard disk and on the Windows installation disc. For your information, please
 review this article What are the system recovery options in Windows? to get more help:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-are-system-recovery-options#what-are-system-recovery-options=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-are-system-recovery-options#what-are-system-recovery-options=windows-7</a>
<div><br />
<div>If the above mentioned step does not solve the problem, we can try to Rebuild BCD using Bootrec.exe tool ( But that would need you to have windows 7 Installation disc)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2</strong>: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Rebuild BCD using the Bootrec.exe tool<br />
</strong></div>
<div>Use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows Recovery Environment to troubleshoot and repair startup issues in Windows. For your information, please review this following link to get more help:<br />

<p><span>Hi Madhavaarimilli,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you receive any error message when you try to create a new user account or access Internet Explorer 32 bit?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if you can create a new account on your computer.
</span><span>To boot to the desktop in safe mode keep tapping F8 key during restart. Once you see the option to boot in safe mode, select it and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link to know more about how to boot the computer in safe mode:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>To create a new user account follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Open User Accounts by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>User Accounts and Family Safety</strong> (or clicking
<strong>User Accounts</strong>, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking
<strong>User Accounts</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click <strong>Manage another account</strong>.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click <strong>Create a new account</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click
<strong>Create Account</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persist in safe mode,
</span><span>I would suggest you to run System File Checker (SFC) scan and check if if helps you fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run SFC Scan follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp; At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know more about running System File Checker:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the issue related to opening Internet Explorer, I would suggest
</span><span>to run
</span><span>the Internet Explorer troubleshooter built in Windows 7 and check if it helps you fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run Internet Explorer Troubleshooter, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Close all programs. </span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, and then click Control Panel. </span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Under System and Security, click Find and fix problems. </span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the task pane on the left, click View All. </span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click Internet Explorer Performance. This opens a new window. </span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click Next. </span></p>
<p><span>7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The troubleshooter will run and try fix all identified issues automatically. Click Close.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the troubleshooter has successfully run, check if you receive the same error.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also access the link below and follow the steps to troubleshoot issue with Internet Explorer.</span></p>

<p>Did you even play the game or demo to know it?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you want to try out the demo it's available on the Japanese Marketplace titled "Eternity of Fate" (original name). It definitely isn't terrible, it's great.</p>

<p>Because many gamers are uninterested in games that aren't heavily advertised or 'guaranteed to be good', as it were. Something they're familiar with.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>It's also the fact that gamers dont want to waste $60 on games that look pretty bad. $20 is one thing, but I would never purchase a game as bad looking as RoF at launch</p>

<p>One of my favorite games of this console generation (I got 1000/1000), it is sad to see it did so poorly. &nbsp;It is however, a gem of a game ANY JRPG fan who has not had the grace to pick up should definitely do so.</p>

<p>Why were the sales bad ? Because it came out near the time of Final Fantasy and another big game at the time (I forget which one).</p>
<p>It being a new title and people not often willing to try something new, especially one they hadn't heard much about, resulted in poor sales. It was a victim of bad timing and unfortunately not enough press to its name</p>
<p>[quote user="Sword StyIe"]</p>
<p>Why were the sales terrible? Because the game was terrible.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Ah someone else who was chewed up and spat out by the battle system I see. That's the thing its so out of the traditional style many people called it terrible because it wasn't simply a FF "I have the bigger numbers so I win" game. Every battle could pretty
 much end you even against normal enemies and you could if you understood the mechanics, take on far superior enemies out play them essentially.</p>
<p>[quote user="Sword StyIe"]</p>
<p>Take a peak at my games played list. You'll notice there is a little game called Resonance of Fate on it. You'll also notice that it is on a very small list of games that I could not bring myself to finish. Can you guess why that is?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Because you sucked at grasping the battle system and though it was highly unfair and deliberately skewed against you, instead of extremely balanced and rewarding to learn ?</p>
<p>honestly Resonance of fate is far from tough when you get it.</p>
<p>The start is admittedly rather brutal to you but past the 15- 30 minute mark if it all clicks you'll find it very good.</p>
<p>There's only been two bosses that have caused me any real pain and that was due to having to defend something and not as such being purely about keeping myself alive and in another fight not having the full game mechanics on your side so your super moves
 are essentially disabled forcing you to fight very differently. The first boss did get a kill on me indirectly as I tried to leave the dungeon but had someone very badly damage so an was able to rapidly pick them off. However I managed to get out of that using
 an escape item. Mostly though the Game is actually pretty easy if you learn it.</p>

<p>Because the battle system was completely unforgiving and had no learning curve. It started you on hard as **** and only got worse from there.</p>

<p>If games put you off at the start then it can hardly be surprising if people don't want to continue to play.</p>

    <title>Excessive upload by Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firstaid84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excessive upload by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My Win10 machine is using about 50 GB (upload) or more per day - all while sitting idle.</p>
<p>All data connections are marked metered, all live tiles are turned off, there are only a small handful of applications - none requiring internet, verified none are running in the background, always have extensive monitoring by Eset, updates are ONLY marked
 to be shared on the LAN, run malware checks daily, and as far as i can see it is just the Windows system using the bandwidth.</p>
<p>But I can't seem to stop Windows from uploading other than turn it off.</p>
<p>So far I've incurred three excessive data use charges by my ISP at the fault of Microsoft.</p>
<p>What can be done about this?</p>

<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Update
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options - Delivery Optimization - Advanced Options
<br />
<br />On that page you will find 4 sliders, you need to reduce the amount on the bottom two sliders . . .

<p>I just tried testing that theory by closing up every firewall rule. &nbsp;All of the applications requesting access are Windows system processes. &nbsp;All related to Settings, Cortana, and Update. &nbsp;As long as I dont let any of those through my network traffic stays
 reasonable.</p>

<br />
<br />Do you mean this data usage happens when you are using your PC&lt; but not when t is idle?
<br />
<br />Using Task Manager as explained below, can you see the name of the process that is using your network?
<br />
<br />
<br />Open WIndows File Explorer (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) 
<br />
<br />On the Processes Tab, click on the Network Column header so that arrow faces down

            Does it make you wonder that the Settings app, which usually doesn't need internet bandwidth, is uploading data; or that Windows Update, which normally downloads data, is uploading instead?

<p>The data usage happens when the machine is idle and the monitor is off. &nbsp;Once I wake the monitor traffic drops to 0. &nbsp;So, if I am sitting there starting at the screen waiting for traffic to appear in Task Manager - it won't. &nbsp;It reads a solid zero.</p>
<p>if i sort by the applications using network resources in Task Manager (even though they all say zero), delivery optimization, AppXSvc, and BITS float to the top.</p>

<h2>            Upgrading a prebuilt computer</h2>
                    So i currently own this computer&nbsp;<a href="https://m.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/acer-acer-aspire-gx-gaming-pc-intel-core-i7-7700-3tb-hdd-128gb-ssd-16gb-ram-nvidia-gtx-1060-win-10-eng-gx-785-eb11/10587597" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://m.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/acer-acer-aspire-gx-gaming-pc-intel-core-i7-7700-3tb-hdd-128gb-ssd-16gb-ram-nvidia-gtx-1060-win-10-eng-gx-785-eb11/10587597</a>.
 In a couple of years or so i am questioning if i can upgrade to a GTX 1080. Is my power supply enough? Or should i upgrade that too? Will my cpu bottleneck the 1080? Is there enough space? I also have more questions if you dont mine answering. If the 1080
 doesnt fit my case, should i get a new case and just put everything onto there but with thr new graphics card? Thank you for taking your time answeing this.

<p>There should be no problem upgrading to a 1080, but when the time comes you would be wanting to upgrade</p>
<p>to the new series card that will have been released by then. Power requirements have been falling on gpu's over the</p>
<p>last few series, but we won't know until the next series has been released if this trend will continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nvidia's minimum recommended psu for a 1080 is 500W (under full load a 1080 uses 180W +\- (add cpu/HDD ), so your machines</p>
<p>psu should be adequate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>- Due to games putting full load on the system for prolonged periods of time many gamers traditionally preferred a psu with 50-100W headroom as the psu will run cooler and last longer if not being pushed to it's limits (also to allow for an SLI upgrade).
</p>
<p>However, with modern psu's this is not as critical as most quality psu's intended for gaming machines&nbsp; will have enough Amps
</p>
<p>on the +12V rail alone to equal, or nearly equal, the Watts shown on the psu's label,&nbsp; eg- 41Amps yields approximately 500W,</p>
<p>so&nbsp; +12V rail with 35 Amps/420W +/- or more on a quality psu should be adequate.
</p>
<p>- Note that OEM builders unfortunately do tend to use cheap psu's .</p>
<p>( Too much power becomes can also create unnecessary heat, because psu's are less efficient when running below approx 35%</p>
<p>capacity ). </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Absolutely no worries about your cpu becoming a bottleneck. Not only is your cpu a high end model, games have become less</p>
<p>cpu intensive over the past few years. You could SLI two 1080ti's and still not have to worry about your cpu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The dimensions shown on the Acer site are external, but your case <em>should</em> be deep enough, depending in part on</p>
<p>how the HDD cages are arranged. Sideways allows more room than the traditional fore and aft arrangement,
</p>
<p>but most gaming cases make allowances for extra long cards by making part of the HDD cage removable.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen often, but some cards have the power connectors on the end, which also adds to the effective length of a card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to find if a particular brand and model graphics card will fit is to&nbsp; go to a site such as Newegg and verify</p>
<p>the length of the card in the specs.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; I don't live in Nth America, so I don't by from them, but Newegg is very handy when you need details/specifications</p>
for a product you may be interested in. Here's a shortcut to 1080's<br />
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/global/au/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;N=100203018%20601201888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Newegg.com&nbsp; Product List 1080</a><br />
<br />
Start with a long 3 fan model for an idea of what the max length would be. If that's to long a two fan model should fit.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.newegg.com/global/au/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814122077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Randomly selected 1080</a><br />
<br />
Click on the <em>specifications</em> tab and scroll down near the bottom for the cards length in the dimensions section.<br />
You need the same measurement between the back of the case and whatever may be in the cards path at the front of the case.<br />
Plus some extra clearance to help with manoeuvring while installing or removing the card from the PCIe slot.</p>
<br />
<p>- There are lots of reviews for graphics cards. Most have benchmarks for a number of games, as well as general info about the card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;They usually show the position of the power inputs, which are often not visible in the advertisements.</p>

<p>This is something you will have to deal with at the time. If, in two years I were able to make a quick sale for enough money to balance&nbsp;</p>
<p>the cost of buying all new parts for a full build I would sell the Acer and buy all new.</p>
<p>Problem is, PC prices depreciate fast, so you may come out ahead buying a new case, gpu, and possibly a power supply.</p>
<p>Problem is you will likely be left holding the Acer case and psu.</p>
<p>As with the graphics cards there are reviews for all major components that go a long way toward understanding what suits
<em>your </em>needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you are happy with the features on the motherboard, the motherboard cpu and RAM should still serve you well</p>
<p>(save money by not having to buy a new Win10 product key too). <br />
- If the psu has 38 Amps on +12V rail it could also be worth keeping, but OEM builders tend to use the cheapest model psu's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Personally, the case is not a good gamers case (assuming the one in the review for the model that uses an AMD cpu is the same).</p>
<p>The power supply on top, and the fore/aft HDD cage are desgin relics. It's also a bit cramped</p>
<p>(not built with upgrading or tinkers in mind). A two fan graphics card would be a tight fit, if it fits at all.</p>
<p>- A power supply at the bottom makes for easier tinkering and a cooler psu as it draws air from outside the case.</p>
<p>- Not wide enough for a quiet after-market cpu cooler (most standard cpu coolers are loud when the temps rise),
</p>
<p>and only has basic case cooling. This cooling may be fine with a graphics card that exhaust out the back, but cards with
</p>
<p>dual/tri fan coolers exhaust most heat into the case, so you need good exhaust fans in the case).</p>

</p><p>Case selection is largely subjective, and most of the above features will be found in good gamer cases. Here's some examples,</p>

<p>No worries. Don't get to talk hardware much around here.</p>
<p>I actually bought my last two machines second hand, but prior to that I built three myself.
</p>
<p>- The fist second hand machine was bought late 2012 (owners priorities changed &gt; new car). This was a three month old
</p>
<p>custom build, is still in use, will still run most games at max settings @1080p, and should be in the family&nbsp; several more years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My newer machine was custom built early 2014.&nbsp; I've had it since late-2015. This machine started out with me looking</p>
<p>for a gpu upgrade as my GTX770&nbsp; 2GB was starting to come up a bit short on VRAM.&nbsp; Ended up with whole new machine</p>
<p>(owner works in on line PC shop, so he does a lot of upgrading).&nbsp; The value was too good to pass up.<br />
- Cpu is Intel i7 4970 @4.0&gt;4.4GHz - Gpu, Nvidia GTX980 (4GB) - 16GB RAM - Motherboard, ASUS Maximus Hero VII&nbsp; (silly name),</p>
<p>but good mobo - 1TB SSD ( added 2 120GB SSD's - one with Win7 atm - and a 2TB HDD I already had) - Case as above</p>
<p>w/ Corsair 750W psu. Don't recall model, but it's higher end than necessary. Hyper 212 EVO cpu cooler ( Installed liquid cooling</p>
<p>on cpu as a learning experience last year ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm a bit of a second hand rose overall... &nbsp; </p>
<p>Bought an ASUS ROG Swift 27" (@1440p) G-sync,&nbsp; IPS monitor (also about 3 months old second hand, from a young diesel fitter
</p>
<p>who makes a bundle working at the mines) about nine months ago. </p>
<p>(second monitor is a Benq XL2420Z 24" 144Hz TN panel monitor, I was using before the ASUS&nbsp; - bought from Uni student )</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The older machine has Intel i5 3570 - gpu, AMD HD7970 (3GB) - 16GB RAM - AsRock Z77 Pro motherboard (a basic model),</p>
<p>Coolermaster CM690II case w/ Antec True Power 650W psu. Hyper 212EVO cpu cooler.
</p>
<p>My old Benq XL2410 24" 120HZ monitor ( owner was getting married ). </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were buying new I would go with an Intel i5 cpu (Possibly an AMD again. My home builds were all AMD) .
</p>
<p>i5 are good gaming cpu's, and more in my budget than i7. </p>
<p>Similarly, the Nvidia series that fit my usual budget are the 60's and 70's ( 1060/1070 ).&nbsp; If they release a
<em>'ti'</em> version of 1060 I would </p>
<p>generally go with that vs a 1070 as the 'ti' versions generally offer better performance per dollar. The 1070ti could also be better</p>
<p>value on that level than a 1080.</p>
<p>I also generally go for basic mobo models (not necessarily the cheapest), and mid-range model&nbsp; psu's from respected brands</p>
<p>(I've used both Corsair and Antec on my other machines), so my current machine does have higher specs than what I would</p>
<p>build for myself. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- A new gpu would be my next upgrade, but not before the next series is released. By then the xx70 will be significantly
</p>
<p>more powerful than the 980. There are only a few games where 4GB VRAM&nbsp; comes up short @1440p,</p>
<p>and I may never go to 4K (if only because I'm 72 ).</p>
<p>Game technology is not advancing at the rate it was a few years ago so the upgrade cycle is considerably shorter than it once was.
</p>
<p>Particularly with cpu, mobo and system RAM . </p>
<p>It's difficult to second guess the technical advances in game graphics and the impact on performance, but going by my HD7970 3GB
</p>
<p>performance 5yrs on, I expect the GTX1070/1080 with 8GB VRAM should still be keeping up for another four years or more.</p>
<p>Particularly @1080p or 1440p .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers - BD</p>

<p>I can't say with 100% certainty because OEM builders have often made 'custom' motherboards.
</p>
<p>There is nothing in using another case that should affect the mobo/cpu/RAM though.</p>
<p>Even if the motherboard is a custom Acer design you should not have any problems as you can still use the drivers provided by Acer</p>
<p>for your model. However, you may need to do a BIOS update if you upgrade the gpu to the next series. This could be confirmed by</p>
<p>Acer support.</p>
<p>From the one image of your machines internals I found, the power supply looks like a standard size, so this should not be a problem
</p>
<p>either </p>
<p>To give us better understanding of what you have, open the case and post what +12V Amps are shown on the psu's label</p>
<p>(or post an image of the label).&nbsp; Also look for a brand name and model on the motherboard, if visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Time for you to go forth and do some research.&nbsp; We all have to do some research to catch up on the latest if we leave a few years</p>
<p>between builds. It just takes less time than when first starting out. There are heaps of tutorials, and reviews that can be found by doing a few on line searches.&nbsp; I always look through several written tutorials or reviews from different hardware sites.</p>
<p>I rarely consult YouTube videos. YouTube videos should be only used as supplements as they often focused on only one aspect of a build</p>
<p>or lack finer details. They are also more likely to include inaccurate information than dedicated hardware sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition they are often poorly presented/edited and end up being time wasters, but occasionally the video images do show things</p>
<p>you don't see in a tutorial at a hardware site, so they can be helpful at times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If after you have done your studies, you still don't feel secure building your own you could sell the Acer and have Newegg
</p>
<p>(or other similar site) assemble a machine from your choice of components. You will still come out ahead compared to buying an OEM machine</p>
<p>(disregarding the loss incurred selling the Acer).</p>

<h2>            Something in my xbox doesnt&#39; power down when i shut it off.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, i've been noticing something strange with my xbox of late, whenever i shut it off something inside won't power down. It's either&nbsp; a fan or the hard drive but i'm not sure.My console works fine, i haven't had any problems with it playing games or anything
 and when i do power down everything on xbox screen does shut off. The only way i can completely stop whatever keeps running is to unplug it totally. However if i replug it immediately it's starts right up again, I have to keep it unplugged for a while&nbsp; and
 it doens't redo it when i replug it.</p>
<p>This only seems to happen when i use it for long periods of time, if i happen to power up while it's cool and shut it off right away it completely powers down. It never use to do this so is it normal? Should i get it checked?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p><span>On some models of the console the cooling fans remain on for a short period of time when you turn off the console. From what I understand it only happens when the console gets too hot.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Be sure your console has adequate ventilation. It should not be kept in an enclosed space, near another heat source, in direct sunlight, on a carpet or soft surface and you should be dusting it atleast once
 a week, more if you smoke and/or have pets. <br />

<p>Oh thanks, i actually bought a controller recently with a play and charge kit but i often just leave the controller plugged in.</p>
<p>I didn't know it did that. After a bit of testing, my xbox shuts off if the controller is not plugged in, but stays when it is plugged in. Now i feel silly, but at least i learned something new.</p>
<p>Ty for the help</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you can do is to import/subscribe&nbsp;your Google Calendar via Hotmail Calendar in that way Windows Live Mail will automatically sync with your Hotmail Calendar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two ways to add a calendar in <span>
Hotmail</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Import a static calendar that doesn't update automatically (known as an ICS file).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Subscribe to a calendar online and receive automatic updates.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a detailed instruction on how to do this, please read this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/calendar-subscribe-calendar-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>article</strong></a>.</p>

    <title>Fake Virus Warning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwarren1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fake Virus Warning</h2>
                    <p>How does a Fake Virus Warning pop up w/audio and take over a brand new computer with McAfee Virus running?</p>
<p>This happens almost every time I open a window with Microsoft Edge; and yes I've run a full scan several times.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Shouldn't this be an easy fix for Microsoft and an easy catch for McAfee????</p>
<p>We pay too much money for this type of garbage to be on a computer at start up!</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean. I can tell it's fake; and I've also verified it as others have posted a question concerning the same or a very similar deal.&nbsp; There are other people though who may not realize it is fake and might call the freakin number.&nbsp; My
 biggest concern is that it keeps occurring daily even though McAfee is up and running. Plus it isn't like I've gone to weird sites or downloaded anything other than updates.&nbsp; Even if it was coming by way of my email, McAfee should still grab it and delete
 it.&nbsp; If this is a problem with Microsoft, they should repair the hole in their firewall.&nbsp; If it is unique to the laptop brand, someone should have figured it out by now. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It's fake, pretend. A scare, not a virus. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just some juvenile using a standard function that disallows you to use the exit button and switch tabs. It's standard html code that is abused for other purposes. There is no way to tell for a virus scanner whether that function is used for security purposes
 or for scaring purposes.</p>

<p>It's a scam, not a virus. (Unless you call and allow remote access). This has been going on for more than five years. As of right now, I don't know of any security program that protects against it. It's not so easy since it isn't malware. It happens with
 any browser, including Appel's Safari.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - Only works when plugged in, immediate shut-off.</h2>
                    Im quite disappointed. My surface pro is very lightly used and looks like its a day old. Its does not boot up or show any sign of response unless plugged in, once unplugged it is immediately shut off again. The battery shows it is at 99%. Before hand the
 battery was fine and lasted many hours before dieing, nothing abnormal lead on to this. I assume it is hardware related not software... Can anyone help me out here? Is this common?

            Hi kgozi ,
<br />
<br />Look these recommendations:
<br />
<br />PC is charging slowly or discharging while it’s plugged in - <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfperf/discharging-while-plugged-in/a10001d2-2a4f-4b75-a505-a9d55f9d3c35">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Surface battery won’t charge or Surface won’t run on battery - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023536/surface-surface-battery-wont-charge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402353...</a>. 
<br />
<br />As well we can try to see if this is due to a driver update issue.  In order to resolve and keep your drivers update, please run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/403723...</a>
<br />
<br />If any issues would be detected, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the battery driver.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any questions       
        </p>

            It might be a virus on your Surface, or a problem with a software or driver. You should probably reset the Surface, but don’t forget to back up all your important files! If the problem carries on after that, then all I can recommend is tell Microsoft (or
 the seller if it was bought third-party) and say something along the lines of “My Surface Pro 4 will work fine when plugged in but will instantly shut off when unplugged, whatever percentage the battery says. Is there any chance that I could get a refund or
 a replacement?” You will probably get a replacement, but if you know it’s out of warranty or the support people say that it’s out of warranty then you can get a refund, or as I say “So be it!” That means “Live with it!” I hope that this will work for you,
 and have a good day!

            <div>We can try removing and reinstalling the battery driver. To do this: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Plug in your Surface. </div>
<div>2. Select the search box in the taskbar, enter device manager, and in the search</div>
<div>results, select Device Manager. </div>
<div>3. Select the arrow next to the Batteries category. </div>
<div>4. Double-tap or double-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery,</div>
<div>select the Driver tab, and select Uninstall &gt; OK. </div>
<div>(Or you can right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery and</div>
<div>select Uninstall.) </div>
<div>5. Leave your Surface plugged in. </div>
<div>6. After you remove the battery driver, install Surface and Windows updates. Go</div>
<div>to Settings, Updates, and check for updates manually and install any updates</div>
<div>that are available. </div>
<div>7. Restart your Surface and test to see if anything has changed. </div>

<p>
</p><p>This might be caused due to conflicting software in the computer. This might also happen when there are too many unnecessary startup items in the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps, this issue might be resolved by performing the System Maintenance troubleshooter on the computer. So, let’s try that out and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run a System Maintenance Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and check if that help. Follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Press “<strong>Windows Logo”</strong> + “<strong>W</strong>” keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Type “<strong>Troubleshooting” </strong>
in the search bar and press “Enter”.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>In the “<strong>Troubleshooting”</strong> window, click on “<strong>View All”</strong> on the left pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click on “<strong>System Maintenance”.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click on “<strong>Advanced” </strong>
and then click on “<strong>Run as Administrator”.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click “<strong>Next”</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if the issue still persists. If it’s not resolved, then it might be due to some other reasons which the troubleshooter was not able to detect and fix. I would suggest you to continue with the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Check the issue in Safe Mode and then perform a Clean Boot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows, we can start the computer in different advanced troubleshooting modes to find and fix problems on the PC. One of such troubleshooting mode is Safe Mode with Networking. Here we start Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services including
 the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer the steps in this link to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode, then you may perform a clean boot on the computer to check if the issue is caused by any software conflicts. This might resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. Perform a clean boot on the computer by following the steps given in the link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow all the steps given in this link and try to figure out the application or service causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the<strong> “Step 3: Reset the computer to start as usual”
</strong>under Windows to reset the computer to start as usual from the above link.</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 7 image to another computer. Can it be done &#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; I have an older Acer Win 7 that only lasted a couple of years before first losing&nbsp;the Q on the&nbsp;keyboard and then&nbsp;finally stopped using it when I went to start it and got a mssg. saying to shut down because of some kind of imminent failure if I continue.
 My question is can I install&nbsp;the Win 7&nbsp;system image I&nbsp;made from this&nbsp;lemon machine&nbsp;onto my current Acer Win 8.1 or any other machine I may buy in the future(soon) ?

            Hi GeoTeras, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />No, as computers come with OEM versions which will not activate of other computers. Added the new computer would have entirely different hardware which would block the image from being restored.
<br />
<br />OEM versions are non-transferable.
<br />
<br />Retail versions can be transferred. 
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

            It depends on how Windows 7 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	It it originally came with the computer, it is not transferable.
<br />
<br />Full version (Retail):
<br />﻿
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.﻿
<br />- Doesn't ﻿require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />- Expensive﻿
<br />﻿
<br />Upgrade version (Retail):
<br />﻿
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />- Expensive, but cheaper than full version﻿
<br />﻿
<br />OEM System Builder version:
<br />﻿
<br />OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:
<br />- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel
<br />- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on
<br />- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard
<br />- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system

            As far as activation is concerned, Windows would not activate on any other machine as OEM licenses are tied to the first motherboard.
<br />Using an Image on a different computer is never recommended except for the fact you have a Hardware Independent System Image.

            The activation issue has been covered.
<br />
<br />In addition to that, the only time it is OK to transfer a image from one computer to another is if they are running the same hardware.  Or very similar hardware. The reason is that hardware requires 'drivers' to run.  Windows installation files/disks come with generic drivers for all of the general classes of hardware: audio, video, keyboard, mouse,network, etc. If those generic drivers have been removed by hardware maker and replaced by hardware specific drivers, when the image is moved to another computer it may not work because some key piece of hardware cannot talk to windows.

<h2>            How do I do away with password in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Articles I've read about getting rid of the password step in Windows 10 all agree that one uses the Run command "<span>netplwiz" and that the box labelled "Users must enter
 a name and password to use this computer" should be UN-checked.&nbsp; The trouble is, when I bring up that command, I see that the box is ALREADY Un-checked. I've tried checking it, saving, then going back and UN-checking it.&nbsp; Nothing works. What's the REAL way
 to get rid of that password step when starting up or waking the computer from sleep mode? Thanks for your replies.</span></p>

            Hi Alan, you are getting that because you are still signing in with a Microsoft Account - that must have a password . . .
<br />
<br />In the process above, I mentioned you must switch to a local account first . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account  - IMPORTANT !!
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and enter a new password or leave it blank as appropriate 
<br />Close the Settings App

<p>Heyo,</p>
<p>Since I have no option of internet connection at home (an NO I will not get one either I am completely fine with that) I always play my games and use the XBox 360 in offline mode or whatever to call it. Though every time I start it up I keep getting prompted
 about the fact there is no internet connection available for XBox 360 Live and every time it asks me to check the internet connection settings in the XBox 360 setup.</p>
<p>Is there no way to turn this connection check off? And please do not suggest me to ignore it or "just get an internet connection"...</p>
<p>All I want is to get rid of that stupid message</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Welcome to the forums</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you are on a silver account that has once been connected to Xbox Live, then the error message will always pop up. However you should be able to fix the issue by clicking onto your network settings and disconnecting the Xbox from the network location/setting.
 This should stop the message from popping up on your Xbox 360. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If this does not work, then I am not sure what else you can do to stop it from coming up. If that is the case, I am sorry about that.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I hope all of this helps,</p>
