<h2>            Build 9926 Slow</h2>
                    Hello there Windows users. I have a Toshiba Satellite C855D - S5303 laptop with 10 Gigs of Ram and AMD Radeon HD 6310 Graphics card and ever since I've updated to the new build, my computer has been unusually slow. I tried defragmenting my hard drive and
 deleting some files to try and make it run faster but nothing has worked. I did notice that the Graphics card is having that Code 43 problem. If anybody has had this lag in the new build of Windows and knows how to fix it, that would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you

    <title>Customising local directories for synced files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Customising local directories for synced files</h2>
                    
<p>I am after a way to custom the names of the directories that the synced files will go to. For example, I'm syncing shared files from Joe Blogs, but I want to rename the directory to JB. This step reduces URL lengths noting the 260 character limit.</p>
<p>Is there a way to achieve the customising of local directories?</p>

<p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed information. Now I understand your situation. To summarize:<br />
• Shared with Me is a view that shows the shared files&nbsp;from others. The files are stored in other's OneDrive for Business library rather than a team site library.&nbsp;The method doesn't work for an&nbsp;OneDrive for Business library.<br />
• It seems "Joe Blogs" is also the display name of the user who is sharing files with you. You are trying to sync files in his library, and the synced folder will be named "Joe Blogs", which is expected.<br />
• If we simply change the name to JB, just as I mentioned before, we can change it successfully but the name in the address bar will not be changed.<br />
• Changing the user's my-site title doesn't help.<br />
<br />
Given this situation,&nbsp;it is not feasible to directly change the local synced folder name of a shared OneDrive for Business library. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>Here are some workarounds for your reference:<br />
1. Modify other parts of the URL to shorten its length as I mentioned before.<br />
2. Based on the test, we can change the user's Display name and the User name in Office 365 admin center as an admin.<br />
Note1: In fact we suggest keep the current user name to avoid&nbsp;confusion&nbsp;or confliction.<br />
Note2: It takes some time to let the changes apply to SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Jim</p>

            <p>Hi Boyce,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are specifically interested in Spyware only (and have other malware and viruses covered to your satisfaction), then I recommend one of two products (both free):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use SuperAntiSpyware: <a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://superantispyware.com/</a>.&nbsp; While very little actually gets past MSE, sometimes a few tracking cookies will get by and this catches most of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another commonly suggested free alternative is Spybot Search &amp; Destroy: <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many standard malware tools will address spyware are part of a larger amount of coverage.&nbsp; This includes Malwarebytes:
<span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>&nbsp;and ESET online scanner:
<a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>, Microsoft Safety Scanner:
<span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a>&nbsp;and a few others.&nbsp; Most AV programs include coverage for spyware to some degree and if not, they typically do not
 deactivate Windows Defender when installed and Windows Defender specializes in spyware (but doesn't cover viruses or other types of malware).&nbsp; If your AV program disables Defender when installed (as MSE will do), it's because the AV program provides that coverage
 itself and having Defender working at the same time could cause conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p><span>**************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here's what I do (and it isn't 100% but nothing is, and in some cases only catches things after they've already gotten into the system, but it's a good process while remaining reasonable and they can all work together - as proven by the fact that I
 use them):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> for real-time protection and run 2-3 quick scans a week with a scheduled weekly full scan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To backup MSE in real-time, I also use Prevx. </span><a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a><span>. This is only a scanner (get only the free version - the paid version
 not only isn't worth the money, but includes things which would cause conflicts) - so if something is found, some other product or process must be used to remove it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I update and run run full weekly scans with Malwarebytes: <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware: </span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and</span><span>ESET online scanner</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a>.
 G<span>et only the free versions. Any that also have paid versions include features like real-time protection that cannot be used along with MSE anyway (in these cases), so there's no point in spending the money anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use Secunia PSI </span><a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/</span></a><span> to make sure all my programs are updated and current (since updates often
 plug security holes in the software and thus can be important as many people never check and/or update their software unless prompted - and this way I don't need to check everything since notifications and sometimes updates are automatic).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I always follow the following advice from Stephen Boots - MVP:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled. </span></strong><span>No other firewall truly offers better protection or is needed. This one is perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON and not running with elevated privileges.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-<u>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</u></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Practice safe web browsing.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
</span></span>

<h2>            how to connect MS Outlook 2010 with SAP R&#47;3 using RFC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to connect outlook with SAP through RFC. The whole problem is that I want to&nbsp;select a mail from outlook and as soon as user drag that mail to the archive folder then it will invoke the SAP for connection and I want to send that mail to the SAP and
 save it there and then there must be a check for subject of the mail. If the mail subject is matched with the following criteria then it resides there in the SAP and then will be get stored in the outlook folder named as matched under the archive folder. Otherwise
 it will not stored on the SAP and then sent it back to the outlook and stored under unmatched folder under archive folder in Outlook. Desprate help needed regarding this.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                    <div>I read that in order to find messages older than 1 month I need to go to Settings.&nbsp; I already went to Settings and selected the option which appears to display any such messages because there was a link to Settings
 in the message explaining how to do this, but I would like to know how to get to Settings in case I need to in the future, as the aforementioned link no longer seems to be there
<p>I have tried mousing over every icon I can see and none of them says 'Settings'.&nbsp; Apologies if I just missed the icon or something, but if not, I must say I never cease to be amazed by how things that could be so easy are made so obscure and this isn't just
 with Microsoft.</p>

    <title>What level of encryption does Word use for password protected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What level of encryption does Word use for password protected PDFs&#63;</h2>
                    When creating a password protected PDF, what level of encryption does Word use? I understand that you can change encryption settings if you have Acrobat, but I need to know what it is without Acrobat. I've heard of many PDF encryption types, and many of
 them are breakable through "recover your document because you forgot your password" apps (aka,"hack this pdf for me" apps), so I need to know what kind of encryption is used in Word 2010. If it's at least 128-bit AES,&nbsp;then I'll be fine,&nbsp;but I haven't been
 able to find out what it is!

            There is no need for sarcasm. We have no idea of your level of knowledge or what you are trying to do.
<br />
<br />
I did not say 'if it can be copied it can be modified, I said if it can be SEEN it can be copied, whiuch is entirely different. PDF password protection is widely used to limit what a user can do with a document that he can open. It is that which I was warning
 about.<br />
<br />
The encryption used by Word 2010 is discussed at <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179125.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179125.aspx</a>.<br />
<br />
AES 40-bit encryption has not been used since (I believe) Acrobat 3. I am pretty sure that the current encryption level from the Word PDF tool is AES 128-bit (but i cannot find it specifically documented and I doubt that Microsoft's programmers will respond
 here). If you want to be certain or make it even stronger than that, you will need Acrobat X which allows up to AES 256-bit encryption, but then that doesn't come free with Word.<br />
<br />
FWIW the tools widely available to break the passwords on PDF files do not make any headway with the passwords Word 2010 creates on PDF files. However as you appear to know if you have the time, the processing power and the inclination any password can be broken.<br />

    <title>10586.29 and Bluetooth audio bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamcv  say:</h3>
<h2>            10586.29 and Bluetooth audio bugs</h2>
                    <p>Twice in one day after upgrading from 10586.0 to 10586.29, Lumia 950 XL, the volume for my Bluetooth connection to my car&nbsp;has been bugging out. I had it set to 30/30, and for one drive it was actually playing at full volume, but the next time I got into
 the car, the phone still reported 30/30, but actually played at roughly 20/30. To work around it, I set the volume lower to 28/30 so that the phone registered the change in volume, then put it back up to 30/30.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing as the .29 build called out Bluetooth stability fixes, I'd say we need a little more polish. Don't get me started about how bad the Bluetooth Audio metadata is. Groove tends to be ok, but it flickers between unknown and the song, while Pandora UAP
 always says Unknown album and usually never gives the song progress bar any data. In that sense, the 8.0 Silverlight Pandora app was more functional for me. Is the OS handling Bluetooth Metadata poorly? Is it the UAP SDK? Or is it Pandora's implementation
 of their app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I'm leaning towards the OS handling it poorly because Spotify, a Silverlight 8.0 app, used to show perfect metadata on WP 8.1, but now has many issues with Windows 10 Mobile. Having excellent metadata work in my car is one of the things I value
 a lot, I hope this gets better sooner than later since Windows 10 Mobile phones are now in full release.</p>

            <p>I wanted to expand on this a bit, to maybe shed some more light on it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I get the same behavior on my Lumia 950 XL with the current build (10586.36).&nbsp; Specifically: when I make a Bluetooth connection to the car, and set the phone's volume level, it will work fine as long as it's connected, but if it disconnects and re-connects,
 even though the phone appears to remember the volume setting I had made, it's actually broadcasting at a much lower volume and will do that until I tap either volume up or down, then it will jump to that volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b) Where this manifests itself the most for me is when using the phone for GPS navigation (my car doesn't support A2DP, so no music listening for me): each time Cortana is going to speak directions to me, it creates the Bluetooth connection (which my car
 thinks is a phone call from Cortana - it's a bit old), says the directions, and then hangs up.&nbsp; Each time it does this, the volume setting is forgotten.&nbsp; So it appears to be part of the reconnect process, maybe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) This also happens with Continuum: if I broadcast my phone screen to a wireless HDMI adapter, and the phone goes to sleep, it disconnects the connection to the HDMI adapter; when I wake up the phone and reconnect, I see the same behavior - whatever volume
 I had set up on the phone still claims to be there, but it's actually the quieter volume level until I tap either volume control button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Interestingly - this (at least 1b) doesn't happen on my Lumia 1020, with the same build.&nbsp; So maybe it's a driver thing.</p>

<p><span>I don’t know if this is the right place to ask these questions, but I don’t know another one .</span></p>
<p><span>I bought an Office 2016 Pro licence to someone and he sold me an account with this format, so that I can make the download of the software.</span></p>
<p><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
<p><span>This name.com, I imagine it must be the name of a company, but I'm not sure.</span></p>
<p><span>What I don’t know and would like to know is:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It seems to me that my account depends on his global account. What kind of dependency there is between these 2 accounts?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>I can imagine that, as an administrator, he can log in in my account, is this correct?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If name.com stops, in the future, the contract with Microsoft I can imagine that my account will be closed too, is this correct?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Is there any kind of disadvantage to me about this situation? I didn’t install anything yet.</span></p>

<h2>            Contacts Corrupted After Upgrade to Skype For Windows Desktop 7.39.0.102</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Windows Desktop automatically upgraded to version 7.39.0.102 (on 20 Aug 2017) and that seems to have corrupted my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>My favourites list is empty.</li><li>Some contacts seem to have been renamed (some other contact's name with a different contact's contact details).</li><li>It's somehow also affected Skype for iOS. (I suspect the desktop upgrade either corrupted the contact database and sync'd them back or there's some incorrect mapping in the database which got the contacts mixed up).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Point (3) is particularly strange since Skype for iOS was updated on 10 Aug 2017 without corrupting my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have the same problem and know how to repair my contacts list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>After entering my email on the diagnostics page and clicking continue, I get an error page: "Oops It looks like there was a problem with Skype, please try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try uninstalling and reinstalling Skype but I doubt that will help since it's already merged some of my contacts and that's sync'd to my online account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll report back on if the uninstall helped or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Karen</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled, restarted and installed the latest Skype on both desktop and iOS.</p>
<p>I'm still missing my frequent contacts and my favourites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've since had to edit an important contact and delete the information that was merged from the other contact (phone numbers, name).</p>
<p>I haven't checked all my contacts but I suspect that some family contacts have been merged with other contacts as well since those family contacts are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Conrad.</p>

<h2>            Hate MathType, want to go back to Equation Editor</h2>
                    I made the mistake of buying MathType.&nbsp; I am used to Equation Editor, which permits one to edit edit existing equations - MathType stupidly renders the equation as a picture, making editing impossible.&nbsp; What I would like to do is trash my contaminated
 Word 7, and install the simple version of WORD 7 offering equation editor.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I've seen another debate about this on another Word forum that I visit. I would imagine the easiest solution for you would be to do a clearn
<strong>uninstall</strong> of MathType and then install the Equations Editor for Word.</p>
<p>Before installing the Equations Editor, as a precaution, I would do a Word <strong>
Diagnose and Repair</strong> "just in case". Here's how:</p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Open Word</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click the
<strong>Microsoft Office Button</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Word Options</strong> button at the bottom</span></p>
<p><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Resources</strong> link</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>Diagnose</strong> button next to
<strong>run Microsoft</strong> <strong>Office Diagnostics</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click
<strong>Continue</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click
<strong>Run Diagnostics</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>If a problem is identified, Office Diagnostics may offer to run the repair process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then install the Equations Editor</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to the
<strong>Control Panel</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on
<strong>Programs</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Click
<strong>Programs and Features</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on the
<strong>Microsoft Office 2007</strong> entry</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Change</strong> link</span></p>
<p><span>6. Select
<strong>Add or Remove Features</strong>, and click <strong>Continue</strong></span></p>
<p><span>7. Click the
</span><strong><span>+</span></strong><span> sign next to
<strong>Office Tools</strong></span></p>
<p><span>8. Click
<strong>Equation Editor</strong></span></p>
<p><span>9. Click
<strong>Continue </strong>to start the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that does the trick. Let us know?</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Sharon</p>

<h2>            Organising notes in OneNote - How to avoid chaos when printing sheets with included documents&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've asked the same question in the German community already, but people there do not seem to be very active and I did not get any replies, so I thought I'd ask you as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using OneNote for studying, and I ran into a problem - I really like taking notes electronically, but to really learn efficiently, I have to print out everything in the end, which ended in a mess, lately. So how do I take my notes? I usually insert a
 large PDF into one section of OneNote (I don't create a section for each page seperatly, because it would be tedious to click through a few hundred pages), and then highlight stuff on the PDF and add notes at the side. And now I'd like to print all this, preferably
 in landscape, with a page of the PDF on the left and my notes on the right. But I cannot find any option to get this done. When I print it, it cuts off pages etc. Any tips how I can handle that correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and to avoid some misunderstandings: I'm talking about printing on physical paper, not the "print to OneNote" option which inserts documents into OneNote...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the description of my problem is not all too confusing. ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Patrick</p>

            Thank you for your answer. I just checked out the print preview again. It is pretty limited, so that's going to be tedious. Is there really no other way to structurise things? That would be quite a let down for me. OneNote is such a mighty tool, but the
 inability to print properly would make it useless for me...

<h2>            Shortcut keys disappearing when copying a style to another computer</h2>
                    Hey all
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to copy some styles from one computer to another so that when they're pasted into a new document (using INCLUDETEXT), that document will then have those styles. &nbsp;I can manage to do that, but, unfortunately, I lose all the shortcut keys that
 I assigned to the various styles. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I saw that someone had a similar problem and they were told to save the document with the styles in it as a custom template. &nbsp;I've saved the document with the styles as a docm inside my Microsoft Templates folder, where the original Normal.dotm is saved,
 but the shortcut keys still aren't coming across when I bring the styles into a new document.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On my original computer where I created the styles, I can copy them over to a pre-existing document and the shortcut keys come along too, so this is really confusing me!</div>
<div><br />
Any help appreciated!!!</div>

            Shortcut keys are not stored as part of the styles, so copying styles from one document or template to another is never going to bring the shortcuts with them.<br />
<br />
Similarly, saving a template from the document that does contain the shortcuts, and putting it in the same folder as Normal.dotm, doesn't make the shortcuts available in other documents. That template is just sitting there, doing nothing. If you used the New
 command to make a new document based on that template, then you would get the shortcuts because the template is associated with the new document.<br />
<br />
There are two ways to get the shortcuts on the second computer:<br />
<ul>
<li>Move the template containing the shortcuts to the folder %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\Startup. Any template stored in that folder is automatically loaded when Word starts. The shortcuts (and macros, if there are any) in that template will be available in all
 documents. Of course, the styles applied by the shortcuts must also exist in the current document, either because they're defined there or because the INCLUDETEXT fields bring them from another document.</li></ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-create the shortcuts in the Normal.dotm template of the second computer. You might find this easier than messing with templates and unfamiliar folders.<br />
</li></ul>

    <title>VLOOKUP doesn&#39;t recognize copy-pasted when searching for them - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> konstantinosl81  say:</h3>
<h2>            VLOOKUP doesn&#39;t recognize copy-pasted when searching for them</h2>
                    Greetings!<br />
<br />
So for accounting reasons we want certain spreadsheets where we can copy paste some arrays of data and then we want parts of that data to be transferred in other arrays. VLOOKUP is great for that matter and serves its purpose as a charm. However, i have an
 issue on the very basic step of this procedure, which is copy-pasting the data.<br />
<br />
Let's suppose that the copy-pasted arrays consist of 5 columns: 1 2 3 4 5. with column #1 obviously being the one containing the code that we will be looking for to transfer other data to our final arrays. What VLOOKUP is unable to do, is to match these numbers
 with the ones on our final array after i copy-paste them. However, if i manually type the numbers on column #1 (e.g. type 11 instead of copy-pasting 11), it works like a charm. I do not face any other issue such as not having any of the desirable numbers returned
 of the other columns just because they are not manually inserted.<br />
<br />
Any idea why the copy-pasted numbers are not ... detected (?) by VLOOKUP and i need to manually type them? Is there a possible fix to that? I tried special pasting the values, didn't work. Tried changing the data type from General to Number, still didn't work.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated since it would save me a lot of time on transferring and editing data!<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pasted data from external sources often contains characters you can't see so functions like VLOOKUP don't work reliably or at all. There are workarounds but I find the best way is to clean the data and to do that I use this code. Put the code in a general
 module and then select the data to clean (column 1) and run the code and then try your VLOOKUP again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sub CleanMe()<br />
Dim c As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c In Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not c.HasFormula Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With c<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Value = WorksheetFunction.Trim(.Value)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Value = Replace(.Value, Chr(160), "")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Hello and thank you for your time and response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned data originated from external sources, i forgot to mention that the data i am talking about is also excel data. To be more specific, companies send us their financial data in excel files and all we want to do is to just copy-paste these
 arrays in our spreadsheets and then use VLOOKUP to transfer some selected data in some specific work sheets.<br />
<br />
I will still try what you said though, i hope it was not just for completely external sources but it can also work to fix buggy (?) excel data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: As an update, i tried what you suggested above and had no results.</p>

    <title>How to setup a table style with multiple header rows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simon mcinnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to setup a table style with multiple header rows</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to set up table styles in Word 2010 that can handle multiple header rows. Typically users will use this where their table has a first heading row that uses merged cells to show grouping of sets of columns and then a second row the identifies
 the individual&nbsp;columns. The headers rows have different formatting to the rest of the table.</p>
<p>The options dont seem to allow this to happen as you can only format 'Row Header'. I've provided a rough and ready example below with bold used to show where different formatting is applied. Obviously in the actual tables its much more detailed styling thats
 required!:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Group 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F</strong></p>
<p><strong>X</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34&nbsp;&nbsp;23&nbsp;&nbsp; 34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;23&nbsp;&nbsp; 34</p>
<p><strong>Y</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 23&nbsp; 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33&nbsp; 23&nbsp; 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>AS far as I know, you cannot set up multiple header rows in the table style so that, when applied, the multiple rows are in place.&nbsp; You can set certain items like inside borders (for when the row header had dark shading and&nbsp; you want the inside borders to
 be grey or white, for example).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To apply the&nbsp; header row formatting to multiple rows in the table: after the table style is applied,&nbsp; select the rows you want included in the "header row" and on the Table tools &gt; Layout tab, click Repeat Header Rows.&nbsp; If header row is ticked in Design
 tab &gt; Table style options, you will see your&nbsp; header row formatting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,</p>

<h2>            Pages&#47;notes stored on my mobile phone have disappeared</h2>
                    <p>The pages in the quick notes section on my android phone (HTC one)&nbsp;have disappeared. They do neither appear in the online version of onenote (onenote.com) or my PC-windows version of onenote. The notes that have been lost from my phone are those that hadn't
 yet been synced to the other onenote systems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The notes disappeared yesterday. I noticed their disappearance when&nbsp;I tried to create a new page/note from the android "new note" widget. The notes created from this widget become stored in the quick notes section of my notebook. When I clicked the new note
 widget, I was asked to chose the destination for where the page should be created. This hadn't happened before. When I chose the quick notes section I saw that all my earlier notes had disappeared. The quick notes section also said something about "sync error
 16th may" (which is the last time I synced my phone with the other onenote systems). Now I can't open the notebook from my phone,&nbsp;that contains the quick notes section. I get the error message that "Unfortunately, OneNote has stopped."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried to get the notes back by restarting my phone, since I am afraid that they somehow&nbsp;will be permanently deleted if I restart the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only tried to look for the notes at onenote.com and onenote in windows. I've&nbsp;also plugged the phone to my PC and&nbsp;manually look for the notes through the&nbsp;folders on my phone. I couldn't fine them, or any relevant folder&nbsp;where they could be stored (maybe
 you know where I can look for them?).&nbsp;I haven't tried to restart my phone and perform a manual sync since I am afraid I could permanently delete the notes somehow. I have tried to be cautious.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me with getting&nbsp;back&nbsp;the notes that have disappeared on my phone?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            If a friend has bought the exact same model and the songs work then it means that your model is faulty or they have different firmware to each other and one works better than the other.<br />
