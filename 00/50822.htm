<h2>            Sharing and networking with Virtual Box</h2>
                    Hi, I am a new user in&nbsp; the community. I have recently installed Windows 8 onto Virtual Box, and would like to share files between the Host PC (Windows 7 32-bit) and Virtual PC (Windows 8 64-bit).<br />
Are there ways in which could make this possible?<br />
<br />
Network discovery is on on both operating systems, but the host PC is not visible on the network of the virtual PC. While the virtual PC is visible on the host PC and is unable to connect because its network path is not found (Error code: 0x80070035).<br />

            Hi Tary,<br />
<br />
Please post this in the Windows 8 forum. This is for the Surface Pro and you are unlikely to get a proper response from MS here. In all likelihood, you are better off posting this on an Oracle forum instead as MS does offer support for VirtualBox. This is likely
 an option you need to set in VirtualBox itself as normally you can set it to share files between machines directly. If this answered your question, feel free to mark it as answered.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Word &#40;docx&#41; does not always open when I double click on it</h2>
                    When I do not have any other Word documents open and double click on a Word document it will open. &nbsp;Occasionally when I have already opened one or more Word documents and then double click on another Word document in my files it will not open; instead
 one of the Word documents already open will come to the front. I have to close all the documents already open in order to get that document to open. &nbsp;Then I have to double click on each of the other documents to get them open at the same time. &nbsp;This is a nonsensical
 problem.

    <title>Fast Computer, Slow Boot caused by Memory Card Reader - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_ledger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fast Computer, Slow Boot caused by Memory Card Reader</h2>
                    <p>Hello All!<br />
<br />
I have Windows 10 Home with the following system settings:</p>
<p>Ryzen 7<br />
16 GB Ram<br />
1070 GTX<br />
Samsung 960 M.2 (Really Fast)<br />
All drivers are already fully up-to date and from the hardware vendors not just from windows update.<br />
</p>
<p>I recently added a multi-card reader which attaches to the motherboards USB3.0 port. Windows appears to await each drive for 2 seconds during boot which turned my sub 1 second boot time to 17 seconds.<br />
<br />
The card reader is : "Shintaro Blazer USB3.0 Int Card Reader" I don't think the card reader is the problem, people have the same issue when USB drives are attached to their PC during boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question, how do I delay the initialisation of the card reader. I want it to initialise after the boot process is complete (or some other way to stop the delay).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Hi David,<br />
<br />
If your card reader is attached to your device while booting, we suggest that you remove it. You only need to connect it to your PC once the boot process is complete.
<br />
<br />
In that case, you can delay the initialization of your card reader.</p>

<p>That isn't possible as its internally connected to the motherboard of the computer, it isn't externally connected. There is a USB3.0 header on the motherboard.</p>

<p>It is not a BIO's issue, the card reader is already disabled in boot. In-fact everything is disabled except my boot drive (a 3.5 GB/s SSD, very fast, not the issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It is a windows issue</strong>, the delay is during the windows splash screen, which means the boot drive is already(correctly) selected. Windows appears to poll all of the available ports on the SD Card reader with a 2 second time-out on each port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This I think is accounting for almost all of the current boot time. I was hoping there was something that would do that in registry. I can disable USB ports in registry and that works but that is kinda silly as I need my usb ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either want to change windows default time-out for the drives or I want to disable it for USB ports until boot is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am my PC's manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your kind assistance.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have managed to correct that particular problem somehow in the myriad of&nbsp;troubleshooting attempts since before the 30th.&nbsp; I can't even communicate them back there were so many.&nbsp; An internet upgrade muddied the waters as well with ISP internet problems
 still occurring.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80041003&#63;</h2>
                    I have been having an issue with being unable to launch any programs. They crash shortly after launching or do not appear at all, or become unresponsive. Even the start button crashes..? I've found errors in the Event Viewer which I guess are pertinent
 to this issue. &nbsp;The details provided is as follows.&nbsp;<span>Details - Event filter with query "SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA "Win32_Processor" AND TargetInstance.LoadPercentage &gt; 99" could not be reactivated
 in namespace "//./root/CIMV2" because of error 0x80041003. Events cannot be delivered through this filter until the problem is corrected. I've tried the solutions provided in earlier questions on this issue. The one where it's supposed to "fix it for me",
 like all programs, fail to launch. The one where I'm supposed to fix it myself using the workabout.vbs script, I can not launch the script. Send help? Thanks in advance. &nbsp;P.S. I'm running windows 7.</span>

            <p>Hi Jun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to launch any program and getting error code 0x80041003. The issue could be if there is some third party conflict. It could also be if there is some system file corruption. I would suggest you to try the steps
 provided in the article mentioned below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong>clean boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists and you are able to login to your computer then I would suggest you to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

<h2>            Disk boot failure, Insert system disk and press enter.  Please Help</h2>
                    Okay, I have a custom built pc; asus p5n-e board, 4gb memory, 8800 gt graphics card, 550w psu, intel quad core 2.66ghz.&nbsp; I just recently had to replace my power supply, about one week ago, and last night I shut my computer down.&nbsp;(everything was normal)&nbsp;
 I&nbsp;got up and turner on the computer and it said Disk boot failure, insert system disk and press enter (or something very similar) so I got the Vista home premium 64 OS Disk out and put it in the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;5 minutes later, I get the blue screen and it says,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;"A problem has&nbsp;been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.<br />
<br />
DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL<br />
<br />
If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer.&nbsp; If this screen appears again, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed.&nbsp; If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacture for any updates you might need.<br />
<br />
If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software.&nbsp; Disable BIOS memory options such ascaching or shadowing.&nbsp; If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select advanced startup
 options, and then select safe mode.<br />

<br />
I have checked evry cable to make sure everything was tight, the only other thing I can think of is the hard drive is fried, I check the BIOS and the is nothing listed under the SATA"s were I believe the Hard drive use to be listed and yes its a Serial ATA.&nbsp;
 Is it possible that it is the hard drive?&nbsp; Thanks, James King<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Run SFC as "C" wisely suggested :<br />
<br />
Then go to Nvidia and <strong>MANUALLY</strong> check for updated driver for your card (do not use their scanner).<br />
<br />
Nvidia Drivers<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a><br />
<br />
Also check their forums as there will be others that have had this issue.<br />
<br />
Nvidia - Forums <br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvidia_zones.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvidia_zones.html</a>'<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : You mainly want to update your display adapter (video).<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

 I have reinstalled Silverlight.&nbsp; I deleted it once again and downloaded from Microsoft Website Silverlight version 5.o and installed this version.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back to the video to watch it again.&nbsp; Even after installing a fresh copy of Silverlight from Microsoft I still get the same error code #525/6013 Dram Support Enabled.&nbsp; Is there somewhere else that I may not have Dram Support checked such in my CMOS.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10&#59; THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER</h2>
                    <p>Hello; Recently, my computer has begun to show a 'Blue Screen of Death' while I am playing games, then restart. &nbsp;The screen specifically states to search for the error 'THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER'. I tried reinstalling my Video drivers, which solved the
 issue for a while, but it soon returned. I've tried looking through my Event Viewer to see if there was any potential program which may have been causing the issue, but I couldn't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll include a download link to some of my computer's recent .dmp files; If anybody can find anything out from them, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

3. If both the video driver and the system BIOS are fully up-to-date, check with the manufacturer for recent driver updates.
<br />
4.&nbsp;As a last resort, try exchanging the video card. <br />
5. Check Device Manager for&nbsp; yellow exclamation (!) mark for all hardware devices. If there is any yellow exclamation mark then install latest drivers for the that particular hardware.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, ensure all the pending Windows updates are installed.</span></p>

            Services for UNIX Is not supported on Windows 10. You should instead use the Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux, which you can easily enable by going to the Microsoft Store then download Ubuntu for Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />The last version of Windows to include the subsystem for UNIX was Windows 7 I believe.

 you know if the file is deleted from its original location?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the original location of the music file where you actually saved it just in case if it deleted only from the LimeWire library.</span></p>

<p><span>If it is present in the original location then recreate the library within the applications. And, if it is not, then I am afraid the file might
 have been permanently deleted. </span></p>

<p><em><span>International, copyright, license, local and government laws all play a part in what is and is not allowed in each region. That said there is a reason why that theme isn't available in Sweden. Most likely
 that content is region locked and the only way you will be able to get it is to go to the UK as REGION LOCKED content requires you to meet ALL of the criteria to get it.

<p><em><span>So if it is region locked you must have a UK account and actually live in the UK. If it were a game then you would also need to have that region version of the game as well.

    <title>No notification when battery saver turns on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick .g.  say:</h3>
<h2>            No notification when battery saver turns on</h2>
                    <p>As of the past several days, I believe it was after a windows update, when my computer automatically goes into battery saver mode there is no notification on my screen. There used to be a little thing that showed up briefly on the screen and then it would
 be under my notifications section until I got rid of it. I tried looking for some solutions on the Microsoft forums but nothing has worked so far. One of the things I tried was that SFC thing in the command prompt as an admin, but that didn't work, neither
 did checking for an update to a driver that was mentioned in a different post. I'm sure there must be a fix to this that I just don't know or haven't tried yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated, thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>This could be caused by incorrect Power plan settings. You can run the <strong>
Power troubleshooter </strong>to scan and fix issues with the Power settings. To do this follow the steps below:</p>

</p><p>If the issue persists, you can consider resetting the Power plan settings to default. Here's how:</p>

            I had already tried the troubleshooter which unfortunately didn't solve the problem. I also tried the next way you suggested with the command prompt. That reset several of my settings but still the next time my battery was low I see the little green icon
 in the battery icon area, still no notification though.

<p>I did everything you said and just now when my battery got to 25%, there was no notification. I happened to look down at the battery icon and it had the little green leaf on it so I knew it came on, but didn't notify me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that in the new account: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>My files are not available (music files, documents etc.)</li><li>Favorites gone (nothing in favorites bar or favorites list)</li><li>background reverted to Microsoft default as well as log in/lock screen</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing as how this didn't help the battery issue and caused these others, is it okay to go back to using my original administrator account which has all my files, favorites etc.?</p>
<p>

<p>So it did the reset a day ago, and then reinstalled all my programs that were removed, which was just a few and a couple of apps. I am back in battery mode now but did not have a notification. I honestly feel unsure now if I was getting a notification about
 the battery or if I was just confusing that with a notification from my security program that lets me now when it goes into "battery mode" which turns on at 30% battery which is also when I have battery mode set to come on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct in thinking that there was a windows notification when battery mode turns on, or do most computers not do that? I feel like with all the possible solutions you gave me maybe I was just thinking it was a battery notification when it very well
 may have been that my security program was turning on "battery mode".</p>

<h2>            Logitech Setpoint Mouse tab disappears after I log off restart or shut down.</h2>
                    Hi there folks the problem I'm having is with logitech setpoint software it has worked fine on Win XP Win Vista but I can't get it to run on Win7 Ultimate.&nbsp; Problem is when I install the setpoint software it shows the mouse button but the minute that I
 either log off restart or shutdown, once the system boots again the mouse tab is missing from setpoint.&nbsp; I know that logitech are having issues with this as they have a part saying in their website about just this problem.&nbsp; What they say is what I have done
 about a hundred times now and that is to uninstall it then re-install it.&nbsp; What I have started doing now is installing the older version of setpoint ie 6.20 that gets the mouse tab up and running.&nbsp; But the minute that I either log off, restart or shut down,
 the mouse tab disappears.&nbsp; I could go on and on about what I have tried, just wondered if anyone else has encountered this problem and managed to find a fix for it.&nbsp; So, I'm open to suggestions fro
                </div>

<h2>            All in favor of MS re-introducing the Trackball Optical, say hey&#33;</h2>
                    <p>The Microsoft Trackball Optical 1.0, one of the best thumb trackballs ever made, with the exception of one fatal flaw - the steel bearing balls that support the thumb ball.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'd think steel would be tough and wear resistant, but a little oil from the human thumb, combined with regular old dust and other crud made a sort of lapping compound that wore flat spots on them, which allowed the ball to drag on the back of its socket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key to MSTBO1.0 longevity is to *always* wash your hands before using it and *always* pop the ball out and clean the socket before you use it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other brands of trackballs use hard ceramic or silicon carbide or even synthetic gemstone for those support balls. There are people who charge $60 and up to do a repair/upgrade of the MS trackballs with silicon carbide support balls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue it had was a high manufacturing defect rate due to the placement of the transistor providing power to the sensor LED. A person not taking proper care during assembly could hit that transistor with part of the housing and break one or two of
 its solder connections. Since the device also has an LED simply to illuminate the socket, assemblers plugging them into a USB power outlet would think them functional, even though the illumination LED is much dimmer than the tracking LED. I picked up a bunch
 of them on an auction website after MS discontinued the model, and fixed them all with a little bit of solder on that transistor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I'm down to only one unworn one left, despite all the care and cleanliness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to see Microsoft re-introduce this trackball exactly like the original, with the exception of using something much tougher than steel for the support balls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see that, respond affrimatively!</p>

    <title>Windows 10. Application opening in tool bar but not visible on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10. Application opening in tool bar but not visible on desktop.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 this morning and have had some issues. Firstly I had the black screen which I have only been able to solve by logging in blind. (Logging in without seeing the log in page). And once it finally worked I was stoked however now I can't
 access any tabs I have opened. They appear in the tool bar at the bottom when I open them and I can interact with the right mouse button e.g. close or pin. But I do not see the display to allow me to properly use the application, this is becoming extremely
 aggravating as I can't even revert to 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is unclear please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>Hello Callum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do you use multiple monitors?<br />
2. What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use multiple monitors, then it is possible that the program or app window is open on another monitor. This may also happen when display driver is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>update display adatper drivers from the computer manufacturer's website
</strong>and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thank you for replying so quickly it usually takes days on most support sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never used a dual monitor, but that appeared to be the problem. I ended up having to right click on settings, maximising the tab then fishing for it in nowhere. Then I am not quite sure what I had to do, but I beleive I had to configure the computer
 to number of monitors it was using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My make is a Dell Alienware and Model is the X51.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this can help other people having the same issue and I apologise for having no clue what I am talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

    <title>Skype for Business - Server is temporarily unavailable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericdmadsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business - Server is temporarily unavailable</h2>
                    <p>I have the strangest thing going on with Skype for Business.&nbsp; Here's a brief rundown of my environment:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On-prem active directory with AADSync and ADFS to Office 365 tenant.</p>
<p>No on-prem Exchange or Skype servers -- Everything has been migrated to O365, hybrid setup removed, but AADSync and ADFS remain in play.</p>
<p>ADFS works properly with all O365 services, and passes all online tests using the microsoft connectivity analyzer.&nbsp; (all certs up-to-date, etc.)</p>
<p>Skype for Business O365 connectivity tests (DNS, etc.) passes all tests.</p>
<p>All DNS tests from internal and external pass tests and show the expected information.</p>
<p>My public DNS zone is hosted within my Office 365 tenant, so all of the Exchange Online and Skype for Business public DNS settings are set by Microsoft.</p>
<p>My private (internal) DNS has the same settings.</p>
<p>I have Microsoft DirectAccess "always on" VPN in play, but not on all clients.</p>
<p>No major changes to my environment for many months.</p>
<p>Everything was working properly until a month or two ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what happens, and what I've tried:</p>
<p>Anyone in my environment who already has Skype for Business set up continues to work normally, including myself.</p>
<p>If I set up a brand new computer with DirectAccess activated, I can log in with a new user and everything works, including Skype for Business.</p>
<p>If I set up a brand new computer standalone without any connectivity to my on-prem network, everything works EXCEPT Skype for Business.&nbsp; It says "Server temporarily unavailable".</p>
<p>I've tried manually setting the internal &amp; external server names in the S4B client but still the same message appears (albeit faster).</p>
<p>If I set up the Skype for Business client on any smartphone (with the same new user), it works fine always.</p>
<p>Again, all connectivity tests pass, and I'm only using O365 - NO on-prem Skype servers.</p>
<p>Active Directory has been cleaned of any "old" metadata information from when there was an exchange and lync server many years ago, and this has been working perfectly for several years, even new users.&nbsp; Only recently it seems something has changed and now
 I can't set up new users off-net.</p>
<p>I experience the same behavior with Office 2016 installed locally from an ISO, or Office 2016 installed from Office 365 (click-to-run).</p>
<p>All current Win10 and Office updates have been applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas, or have run into something similar?</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you so much for the suggestion!&nbsp; I rarely post questions on these forums, but this one was REALLY weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THAT SAID, I actually just now finally solved the problem!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a time skew between my ADFS server, the domain controller, and the client machine I was testing from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went on my domain and made sure all VM hosts and guests had the same time settings, and BANG it started to work again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really odd that it worked for existing users and not new users, and it worked for mobile clients, AND no other applications were affected - ADFS was working normally for Outlook, and all other O365 services.&nbsp; Only Skype for Business was affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ahhhh I can finally sleep now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone for listening to my banter.&nbsp; I really hope this helps others that have ADFS in their environment solve this issue if you run into it.&nbsp; Just make sure time is synced ALL the way through your environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
