<h2>            critical process died blue screen out of nowhere</h2>
                    I have a lenovo z500, windows 8.1 installed. I was doing nothing in particular when my computer froze and then the blue screen appeared. I can get my computer back to normal when I shut it down completely and restart, however this keeps happening every
 now and then. what do I do to fix it?&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<em>-- %systemroot% is the environment variable for your Windows directory. For example, C:\Windows.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all .DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop, create a new folder on the Desktop to put these .DMP files in, and then zip the folder. You can then either use a 3rd party tool such as 7-Zip/Winrar, or you can use Windows'
 default method of zipping folders.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compress-uncompress-files-zip-files#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Compress and uncompress files (zip files).</a><br />
<br />
 the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the .ZIP containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel Memory Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel Memory Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel Memory Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel Memory Dump is
 the best choice. Do note that Kernel Memory Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong>
</em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

            I have tried to follow your directions yet things were not exactly the way you assumed they should look like on my end, but I think I figured out how to do what you wanted me (it was not set up for creating DMP files before).<br />
<br />
as to my problem, I have yet to encounter another blue screen and by now have solved a different issue I had which might have been connected to this one (that, I am unsure of) which is to go back to an earlier graphics card version that got screwed up in one
 of the updates from 8.0 to 8.1. so, we'll see. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Yes, my instructions are set for 7, not 8. 8 has a few different options, but it should be followable. Let me know if you crash again + have the dumps.</p>

<p>Hopefully an easy one. &nbsp;Trying to enter a password with a ` (backtick) in it. &nbsp;but can't find it on the xbox one virtual keyboard. &nbsp;is it there somewhere? &nbsp;thinking currently the password will need to be changed to avoid this character.</p>

<p><span>Good afternoon,</span></p>

<div>My name is Dmitry Krant and i have been purchasing XBOX Live codes and reselling them on ebay for quite a while. I have nevr had any issues until yesterday. Once of the codes i sold and emailed on ebay was farudulent. (I received an email from both ebay
 and paypal advising this). I was caught off guard and since i had already sent the code to the fraudulent buyer, i contacted Microsoft right away. My fiance Layla called and spoke to Michelle who was amazing on the phone. It took more than an an hour but at
 the end she was able to deactivate that code and reissue me a new one. Today around noon, i got another email from paypal and ebay letting me know that 3 of my codes that i had already sold, were fraudulent as well. So once again i called Microsoft and i have
 been ont he phone with 6 people, 2 managers, 3 chat reps, and i was flat out told we WILL NOT HELP YOU. I was able to save only some of the chat sessions but here it is.</div>

<div>please help.</div>

<p>GoldAtol2744426, </p>
<p>What is it that you want from us here? </p>
<p>As she stated in the chat, you bought the codes and were reselling them. Therefore, your deal with Microsoft was done already. The fact that your buyer was fraudulent has nothing to do with Microsoft, it has to do with Ebay, and has to be handled through
 them. </p>
<p>When selling items on a website such as that (Ebay, Craiglist, Amazon, etc) you run the risk of dealing with fraudulent buyers, and that does not fall back onto the company from which you purchased the product that you are now selling.
</p>
<p>If I sold a watch from Express on Ebay and the buyer turned out to be fraudulent, I wouldn't be able to go to Express and ask them for another watch. That is something that would have to be handled through Ebay.
</p>
<p>Sorry that this is not what you wanted, but again, this issue is not Microsoft's responsibility.

<p>Also just to add, when you purchase codes they do state that Microsoft will not replace codes if they are destroyed, lost, or stolen. So they are not obligated to exchange the card. The first rep did something that they generally do not do and you got lucky
 with that one. </p>
<p>Another thing, you should not post your personal information on the forums.</p>

            <p>I've removed all the personal info from your post. &nbsp;It's advised that you don't post personal information on the public forum because almost certainly people will see how you were responding in the chat you posted and then they'll harass you using your phone and email address you provided to try and get your fired up again. &nbsp;Some things are better left out of a post.</p>
<p>About the codes, I assume you mean that you sold them on Ebay and the buy took and redeemed them and didn't pay? &nbsp;MS has no way of checking to make sure the codes belong to whom. &nbsp;For example, I can't find a used card on the ground or at a friends house and call MS and say that I sold the card and the person who redeemed it shouldn't have because they have no way of knowing what really happened. &nbsp;All they can see is if a code was used or not and by whom but they have no way of knowing the circumstances surrounding the redemption.</p>
<p>Another example would be a Twitter contest. &nbsp;I could lose a contest and simply call MS give them the code I didn't guess correctly and say that a fraudulent buyer stole it from me and have a new one issued.</p>
<p>Understand, I'm not saying this is what you're doing but simply pointing out that if MS employed this policy of reissuing codes in this manner would be easily abused.</p>
<p>Ebay and PayPal on the other hand offer buyer protection and the transaction issue is their problem to resolve.</p>

    <title>After the year of FREE download being available what will happen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After the year of FREE download being available what will happen if....</h2>
                    <p>Hi ALL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post is mostly aimed at the Microsoft staff that should have an answer.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the year of FREE download being available what will happen if and when....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) A customer has to completely reinstall once the FREE download and activation period</p>
<p>is over for Windows 7 / Windows 8 / Windows 8.1 customers from just after midnight on
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*29th July, 2016</span></strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Microsoft be keeping a record of every customer that has taken the FREE upgrade offer</p>
<p>in order to maintain support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine a fiasco happening when a clean install of their genuine Windows might not activate<br />
after the <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*above date</span></strong> ( for Windows 10 ) if the customer has remembered to put Windows 10<br />
on a USB stick or burn it to a DVD disc.<br />
</p>
<p>2) The so called workaround mentioned on some websites such as this one,</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
</span></p><p><a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Windows+XP+Vista+Users+Can+Get+Free+Windows+10+Upgrade+Thanks+to+Loophole/article37411.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://www.dailytech.com/Windows+XP+Vista+Users+Can+Get+Free+Windows+10+Upgrade+Thanks+to+Loophole/article37411.htm">http://www.dailytech.com/Windows+XP+Vista+Users+Can+Get+Free+Windows+10+Upgrade+Thanks+to+Loophole/article37411.htm</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>I guess no longer works now that TECHNICAL PREVIEWs of Windows 10 are no longer being activated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I bet some / most Microsoft staff and Microsofts' <em>genuine</em> customers were annoyed when
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Windows 8 keys</strong></span></p>
<p>could not be used for the FREE upgrade to install <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 8.1 ?</span></strong></p>
<p>I hope Microsoft has learnt something from this?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I see the article you posted is from June, which predates the release, and when Microsoft clarified things, and most of it is just wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The Insider builds are not a path to a release license.&nbsp; They are only a path to Insider builds.&nbsp; Now since Microsoft didn't terminate the Insider program, you can pretty much just keep using them provided that you accept the fact the every once in a
 while (different for the Slow/Fast ring) you will have to download and update to the builds they push.&nbsp; If you don't then the Insider build will expire.&nbsp; And also note that people that got stuck on an Insider build and didn't get the 10240 build downloaded
 and installed in the period of time Microsoft gave for it, they might be totally locked out and have to reinstall their old Windows and upgrade to the free Windows 10 RTM to do anything including rejoining the Insider Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) It has never been possible to use an old Windows version product key to activate the newer version Windows.&nbsp; What has been done in the past is to issue an update key for the new version of Windows.&nbsp; And those update keys would only work if the old version
 of Windows was installed.&nbsp; You could never take for instance a Windows 7 key and install Windows 8 and then use the Windows 7 key to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Windows 10 update is really only different so far in the handling of update keys.&nbsp; So far it doesn't have any.&nbsp; Instead what they have done is record the "fingerprint" that is used for activating your Windows 10 upgrade on their servers.&nbsp; And if a request
 for activation with the same "fingerprint" comes up again it will automatically activate.&nbsp; Basically there is the requirement that the upgrade be done from the running Windows 7/8/8.1, which means that is the way they can ensure it is valid.&nbsp; Then they allow
 the upgrade and when it finishes do the automatic activation and store of the "fingerprint".&nbsp; If someone does a clean install of Windows 10 without first doing the upgrade, then it just won't activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) After the upgrade the user is free to do a reinstall of Windows 10 and can skip the requests for the product key, and once they get to the point where they log in, it will automatically activate again based on the "fingerprint".</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) So for this process the ending of the free upgrade doesn't matter. But what if you change something in your hardware that makes the "fingerprint" different?&nbsp; Well it isn't going to be something like your drive or graphics card.&nbsp; Changing network cards
 or motherboards might trigger it.&nbsp; If that happens&nbsp; Then the next big question is what kind of license you had with your old version of Windows.&nbsp; If it is an OEM license (one you got with a new machine), well as far as Microsoft is concerned, that is a new
 device, and your license was only valid "for the life of the device".&nbsp; So you would either have to purchase a new Windows 10 license/product key or some how get your old Windows installed/restored, and then if the free upgrade is still open, upgrade to Windows
 10.&nbsp; If your license is "retail" as in you bought the DVD/product id.&nbsp; Then it would be the same process reinstall/upgrade during the free upgrade period.&nbsp; After that period Microsoft is going to have to do something, but as of yet they have not said what
 that will be.<br />

<h2>            Miracast to Multiple Displays Simultaneously</h2>
                    <p>I am wondering if it's possible to miracast connect my Windows 10 computer display to two TVs at the same time. When I connect to one, and then try to connect to the other, it disconnects the first one. Maybe there is some software I can use?</p>
<p>

            Hi Hoopitz, in order to display to two TVs wirelessly you may need to purchase additional hardware. Miracast only supports connecting to one additional display. One option is to use wired HDMI or DisplayPort, if your PC has this, for one of the TVs, and Miracast for the second TV.

            You need a splitter for this. Can’t do this through wifi as of yet. <br />For example I have a surface dock and have 2 TVs plugged into it at the same time. <br />Basically miracast is not going to cut it on its own. <br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.mycablemart.com/help/splitter_help.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mycablemart.com/help/splitter_help.php</a>

<h2>            Out of range problems with DVI To HDMI In Windows 7 64bit</h2>
                    I have a problem that is really becoming annoying due to the fact after searching the internet for two days I find a lot of people with the problem, but no solution.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here are the components I have:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 Premium 64bit</div>
<div>Nvidia 450 Graphics Card</div>
<div><span>Westinghouse 26" L2610NW</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have been using this system for about 6 months with a dvi to vga connector to the monitor with
 no problems whatsoever. A month ago I purchased a blueray drive so I could watch blueray dvds on my HD monitor. I finally got the software I needed to view the blueray disks and when I loaded one up the program told me I needed switch to the dvi or hdmi port
 from my video card to monitor i order to view these copy protected movies.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I pulled out my dvi to hdmi cord that came with the monitor and which worked on an old Vista system
 of mine and plugged it in. When I rebooted my system the only thing I get on my monitor is an out of range error. I know what an out of range error means and I don't understand why windows is trying to push my monitor beyond what it is set to go.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have my video card and windows set to operate at 60hz which is just about my only option other
 than 59hz. I have tried both and still get the out of range error no matter what.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>I have the latest Nvidia drivers for my video card and have called Westinghouse and they claim it is an issue with Windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What gives? I spent a lot of money to watch bluerays on my PC and while my system seems to work great, I really need
 to get this fixed. At this point I'm ready to sell the whole dang thing and start over with verified working parts even if they are inferior to what I am running now.</div>
                </div>

            I ended up buying a new monitor and now everything works correctly so I have to assume the problem was within the monitor and probably not windows itself.
<div><br />
<div>The monitor I purchased had no cables so I am using the cables I used on the old monitor and everything is working fine. I can even watch commercial blurays on this system now.</div>

<br />
<br />To turn on Spell Check - Windows Key+i &gt; Devices &gt; Typing &gt; Turn on Autocorrect misspelled words and Highlight misspelled words
<br />
<br />This will turn on Spell Check for your computer, hence Gmail will also be taking the inputs from this option. (There is no selective option to turn it on only for Gmail. It is for all typing done in Windows 10)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48eed8bd-f4c0-486f-85d5-cd78b269fca6?upload=true" />

                    <p>hey everyone;</p>
<p>after I had a clean installation through my Lenovo y50-70 I'm facing an akward UI lag in windows! I install all windows update and all my drivers are in best condition but it's funny to see that I have a really good performance and graphical render on my
 games and apps but in windows simple animation i see lags and low FPS animations! this is really getting annoying! it maybe because of intel hd 4600 or Dual switchable graphics ( Nvidia GT860 4GB DDR5 ) or any other thing but i want it to be solved ASAP! it
 seems to be i'm the only one who is facing it! today is assembled a computer case with following specifications:</p>
<p>Biostar A58/AMD FM2/8GB Ram/ATI 7480</p>
<p>it's way too lower then my system:</p>
<p>Corei7 4790HQ/16GB Ram/ Nvidia 860&nbsp;4GB DDR5 + Intel HD Graphics 4600</p>
<p>
</p><p>but after all i see lags on my system but the AMD system is smooth as heaven!</p>
<p>can you help me to fix it??&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to Quote users, create a Picture Signature and more&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi so i thought i would chime in quickly and tell you guys how to create a picture signature, how to remove picture signatures from being viewed, how to insert pictures to a thread, and how to edit the forum settings for your preference.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Quoting a User</span></b></p>
<p>To Quote a user simply hit reply underneath the user you wish to quote, this will bring up a quick reply text box. Once this is up select "Use Rich Formatting"&nbsp;<br />
Once you have the the Rich Formatting editor up you should see the users post and the option to quote the user underneath. Hit the Quote link and it shall pop the quoting code into your post automatically. View this screenshot for where the quote button is:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi194.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fz2%2fcarl118%2fquote.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Forum Settings<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p>First of all we will show you how to view the forums settings, and to remove signatures from view. simply point your web browser to http://forums.xbox.com/user/settings.aspx and you will come across this page:</p>
<p><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi194.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fz2%2fcarl118%2fScreenshot2011-05-13at102928.png" /></p>
<p>Here you can find the usual forum settings from the older forum, but with more options like "display user signature" simply toggle to your preference and your good to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Making Forum Signatures<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p>To make a forum signature make sure you have your image at a reasonable size, I'd say 620x100 is a sensible size. Make sure that it follows the websites terms of use and code of conduct (i.e. no naughty pics or illegal stuff). Next you will need to upload
 the picture to a hosting site Photobucket.com is a good example. Upload your file and copy the sharing code given as [*IMG]Example link[*/IMG] (there wont be any *'s in your code)</p>
<p>Once you have this code simply point your browser back to the Forums Settings page and paste that code into the signature area. Animated .GIF images work too, heres my example of sonic the hedgehog running:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gifanatics.com%2ffiles%2f409086_sm.gif" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Adding images to a thread<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p>To add an image to a thread post, simply follow the steps for making a forum signature, except the size. Make sure your image isn't too big i recommend you keep it under 650 pixels wide and 500 in height. Upload your image to a hosting site like Photobucket.com
 and retrieve the [*IMG] sharing code.</p>
<p>Once you have that code simply paste it into the text box of the post you are making and you are good to go. Animated .GIF's work in posts too.</p>

<p>Are gifs allowed?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably. Doesn't seem to be any size limit on the images. But due to the loading times of some gif's, they'll end up not allowing them.</p>

<p>I don't know, about the commands, because in Windows XP and Windows 7, I rightclick on the C-drive, click on Proberties, The tap "Tools", and click on Check now. Then mark both points, and click yes to make a restart.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot redeem Office 365 promo code for 12 month Xbox Live Gold - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot redeem Office 365 promo code for 12 month Xbox Live Gold</h2>
                    
<p>I took advantage of the Office 365 subscription promotion that includes 12 months of Xbox Live Gold for free. (Details in the following link)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/offer/buy-office-365-get-12-months-of-xbox-live-gold-FX104049875.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/offer/buy-office-365-get-12-months-of-xbox-live-gold-FX104049875.aspx</a></p>
<p>I received my promotional code without any problems, but am unable to redeem it. I tried from the website (On two different PCs, and from both Chrome and IE), and from my console, but would just receive unhelpful generic error messages. I contacted Xbox
 Live Support via online chats on two occasions, and they were unable to help. All they could suggest was that maybe because I already have a Gold subscription, the code won't apply.<br />
<br />
But, the promotion details DON'T say anything about being restricted to new subscribers. And they DO very clearly state that if I don't redeem my code before the end of October, it will expire. The Xbox Live Support people swore to me that the code doesn't
 have an expiry date on it, but the conditions of the promotion would beg to differ...</p>
<p>So what can I do about this? Xbox Live Support don't know anything about the Office 365 promotion, and the promotion doesn't have any kind of support or contact of its own. Who am I supposed to talk to? Is it within anyone at Microsoft's power to just tack
 12 months onto my existing subscription, and invalidate the code?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
What's the error code/status code you get when you try to redeem the code on your Xbox 360 console, not on Xbox.com, on the console.<br />
<br />
Please let us know, you should receive something that starts with an 8 and is about 8 characters long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks. Wasn't aware of that restriction (or that I had as long as I did pre-paid on my subscription). It's a little worrying that the support chat people I contacted didn't mention this too. I definitely quoted the error code.</p>

            <p>Hey, StatedAlarm98! This thread is almost 3 years old. We do not allow users to give out codes here on our forums. If you are having issues redeeming a free Gold Trial, it's likely because your account has already had one on it. If you are running into another support issue, please post up a new detailed thread so that our community can work on helping you out. Thanks for understanding!</p>

            When saving a picture via right click on a website, saving to different folders makes no difference, some it doesn't, maybe file type has a factor in it, but 98% of the time photos will open after saving.

            Hi Granville.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps &gt; Choose App by file type, scroll down to .pdf and make sure your installed .pdf reader is chosen.  If you have no preferred installed reader like Adobe, then choose Edge for default.  
<br />
<br />Now try again downloading and opening .pdf files.  
<br />
<br />If IE still won't work right then Reset it in it's Internet Options &gt; Advanced tab.  
<br />
<br />I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser, and Firefox and Chrome let  you sign in to sync your Favorites on any other device you sign into.  Set the preferred browser as Default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>&nbsp;Google Chromium opens automatically evertime I start Windows 10. How do I stop that from happening?</p>
<p>I have disabled it as a start up item, but it just keeps starting up anyway. Its like its pre-programmed to start up no matter what I do to stop it. Its sucking up space and slowing down my start time. How do I dump it?</p>

<h2>            Hyper-V migration of Windows XP to Windows Vista&#58; vmstorfl.sys error message</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I am running a Windows 2012 Core server as host OS with Microsoft Hyper-V on an Intel Xeon server.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Because of a legacy application, I am running an old Windows XP machine, with all service packs and hotfixes installed.&nbsp; Also Hyper-V integration services are running. Everything is running smoothly. Since Windows XP is not supported anymore, I want to upgrade
 this Windows XP machine to Vista. For that, I do have a DVD with Vista Business and SP1, including a .valid license. Unfortunately I cannot install this legacy application on Windows Vista for some reason, but that's not the case.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>After starting the upgrade van Windows Vista, the machine is really really slow. But that's okay, in the meantime I can grab a coffee (or two). The problems arise when the upgrade is completed. After the final reboot, an error message appears after the Windows
 Vista logo (translated poorly from Dutch to English):</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Cannot launch Windows This is probably caused by a recent change of hard- or software. &lt;bla bla&gt;.</p>
<div>
<p class="contentCodeblock">File: vmstorfl.sys<br />
Status: 0xc0000098<br />
Information: Cannot load Windows because a required file is missing or damaged.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Using the Windows Vista DVD (ISO image) I was able to launch a command prompt to see what's wrong. The file, vmstorfl.sys, is in place, so that's not the issue. A chkdsk /f doesn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Luckily I have some snapshots of this Windows XP machine so I was able to revert back. However, after following the same procedure again, the same error comes back.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>What I've tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of installation of integration services on the Windows XP machine before upgrade to Vista</li><li>Removal of all unncessary applications on the Windows XP machine</li><li>Booting from the Windows Vista ISO to try the system repair option</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>But still.. Bad luck. I cannot get this issue fixed. Also on the Internet I haven't found hardly any information about vmstorfl.sys or any other information from this error message.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Does anyone of you have a suggestion?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><br />

            I read your post and I know it's a Windows Vista question. That doesn't change the fact that Extended Support for Vista SP2 ended on 11 April 2017.

<h2>            Repair .NET Framework 4.7.1 in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Framework has developed&nbsp;"ghost" HP 6968 printers from the installation the install of&nbsp;four total printers installed serially the last three as warranty replacements.&nbsp; This is causing Framework printer net names stuck in it from previous printer installs
 causing continuous error pop-ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way besides HP recovery to repair Framework?&nbsp; Unfortunately, running recovery wipes out long used data from some of my applications that cannot be backed up and restored to the applications.&nbsp; For one it requires the complete re-installation
 of Norton Security Suite thus throwing away all the data for its password vault.</p>

<p><br />
So the device cradle has an ethernet connection?</p>
<p>If so why not simply plug it into an ethernet port on your router? I guess I don't understand why the cradle and handheld portion (sounds pretty mobile to me) can't be next to the router.</p>
<p>Beyond that ICS is what your looking for, ie. share the laptop WiFi connection with the device that is plugged into your laptops ethernet port. The device will receive a IP from the laptop and be able to access the internet through the laptop.</p>

            <p>Well a cheap 25 foot (or longer)&nbsp;Ethernet cable from Monoprice or WalMart or Best Buy or Radio Shack or whomever)&nbsp;would certainly work. Plug it into the router and run it to a place outside the closet that is convenient to an AC power plug. You could coil
 up the cable in the closet between uses. If this is a once a week deal that would work IMHO...</p>

The decision to stick with Windows Vista can happen for a variety of reasons: application and hardware compatibility, nostalgia, inability to run later releases of Windows on existing hardware or it just works.">Windows

<p>Thank you Andre. It is actually Windows 7 Ultimate TRIAL and he is claiming to have a licence to do what he is doing but that doesn't make any sense because it is free to anyone on TRIAL. Thank you for your very clear instructions. Unfortunately I don't
 know what BIOS means. The rest I think I can follow. At least I can leave negative feedback for the creep and warn others. He is just starting selling on eBay so that will hopefully be the end of his monkey business. I will also report him to eBay. He just
 keeps telling me that the only way it can get sorted is by paying him. That's extortion. And eBay will be able to see his messages. Not very bright of him. If you could just tell me what BIOS means I would be most grateful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There was never a Windows 7 Ultimate trial, what he likely did was perform a keyless installation of Windows 7 Ultimate (didn't enter a product key) and now Windows 7 is in reduced functional mode.</p>

            <p>You are going to need to reinstall the original Windows Vista Business license that originally came with the system or consider migrating to Windows 10. Because Windows Vista will no longer supported come April, I would look into purchasing a license for
 Windows 7 or Windows 10. Learn more:</p>

            <p>Hi Andre. &nbsp;I note that the guy is still selling laptops on eBay with the so called Windows 7 Ultimate "trial". &nbsp;If (or rather when) purchaser gets into trouble with the system he demands $80 for the code to get Windows 7 Ultimate going. &nbsp;This seems highly
 unethical and, as I have his name, address, phone number etc, I would like to report him to Microsoft. &nbsp;Do you think they would be interested? &nbsp;He is hurting a lot of people with his scam.</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot Run Any Sort of .jar File on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moneyhurricane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Run Any Sort of .jar File on Windows 10</h2>
                    I have been trying to open a .jar file for Minecraft for several days now but instead of opening the launcher it forces me to choose an app to run the .jar file on. Java does not appear, yet I have it installed. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Java
 multiple times trying to fix the problem, but it is not working. None of the app choices given to me are actually compatible with .jar files and when I search for Java from the "other apps on this PC" option, it does not pop up. How do I fix this?

            Hi MoneyHurricane, this is a very common problem, the file association for Jar file is broken and it can be hard to repair manually . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download an exe file. 
<br />
<br />Double click the exe file to fix the files association, then restart your PC
<br />
<br />That's It - fixed!
