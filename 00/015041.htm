<h2>            ox800ccc0e code</h2>
                    Have not been able to send or receive email through Outlook and getting the error code ox800ccc0e and that Outlook cannot connect to the server. I can send and receive email through Yahoo (linked account) on computer and mobile device, however. Need help
 figuring this out. Outlook was working fine and then one day it just stopped connecting. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've tried several "fixes", however, those available through Outlook cannot log in to the server to troubleshoot.

    <title>I can&#39;t access my hotmail account despite following the recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> serena73  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t access my hotmail account despite following the recovery prompts and advice on support forum.</h2>
                    <p>My account was seen by Hotmail to be 'hacked' as a program I was using called unenroll.me obviously did something Hotmail didn't like. I got an email about someone using my account and unenroll.me being unlinked from my account at the same time. I was concerned
 about the recovery email being fake and was waiting until I got onto a PC to check the link before pressing. Getting to work this morning, no Hotmail. I've filled out considerable amounts of personal info for recovery but no dice. One issue is that my old
 recovery email no longer exists and I hadn't updated it. The level of protection around a lowly free email is just insane. I have less dramas recovery bank logins. So, is this email, which most of my logins and accounts are attached to, is just gone? I can't
 provide anymore information than I already have. What's required here? Sacrifice of small animals to dark gods, or an interpretative dance where I demonstrate my soul essence to the gods of Hotmail? Oh, and particularly love that when I try to contact support,
 it says to email them THROUGH THE ACCOUNT THAT HAS BEEN BLOCKED! Tech support has always been one of the seven rings of hell, but now the trend seems to have gone to a very special place where you click madly around a site, looking, looking for this elusive
 support but never being able to contact anyone, not even a bot. I think I have a better chance of finding the Holy Grail than this mythical support thing you're talking about</p>
<p>TLDR: can I have my goddam Hotmail account back please and is there any option to dial back the insane level of security? Right now I'm at the never ever use Hotmail again level of fury except every tech firm seems to be just as ridiculous.</p>

            Hi Serena,
<br />
<br />Ok - totally frustrating and I feel your pain! Don't shoot me I just want to walk through the process here....
<br />
<br />1. go here <a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />2. say you forgot your password
<br />
<br />What options appear? Give me a reply I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />-Jeff

            That process is exactly the same as the recovery process for my email, so not sure how its supposed to help. I've apparently failed to provide sufficient information for your bots to approve me accessing my account, so that means no changing password or
 any other way around. Is this it? Is there any other way for me to prove I'm me?

            Ok, so when you no longer have access to the old recovery email or phone or challenge questions or authenticator app, then the only thing you can do is wait for MS to respond.
<br />
<br />When I went through this process I received a reply to my current email address after 2 days. I filled in all I could, but it said they needed to review. They did get back to me, but it was not immediate as I did not have good info.
<br />
<br />I hear you its a pain, but think about what people put in their free public email! It's crazy the content out there, so after all of the wikileak hysteria all reputable services put in restrictions like this. Try dealing with Apple and a forgotten apple id - ouch :)
<br />
<br />I don't know what the final screen said for you, but the idea is you supply as much info as you believe and then Microsoft will review and get back to you. It could be a day, could be a week but they will respond after they do their due diligence. 
<br />
<br />Some folks have 30 day lockout, and there really is no way around that wall.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />-Jeff

<p>Is that actually whats going to happen? As I got several automatic emails saying the below, which seemed to indicate a blank ban that isn't going to be lifted until I can get past the automated step:</p>
<p><span>We recently received a request to recover your Microsoft account (email adress here).&nbsp;Unfortunately, our automated system has determined that the information you provided was not sufficient for

<p><span>At this point, your best option is to

</li><li><span>Make sure to use the
<strong>correct domain for your account</strong>, such as hotmail.com, live.com, or outlook.com. Keep in mind that your email address may be country specific. For example, if you created your account in Sweden, your domain would be “hotmail.co.se” rather than

            From what I can tell I can't access the account, my details given aren't sufficient, that isn't going to change because that's all I've got, there's no way to ask for a review because I can't contact anyone from support directly and everything is stalling
 at the 'resubmit form' stage = indefinitely.

            Hi Serena,
<br />
<br />I believe so, it happened this way for me when I switched back to Microsoft from Apple a few years ago. 
<br />
<br />Do you know anyone who has an email from you from that address? I know the subject line, email it was sent to, time, would help a lot. 
<br />

            Did that and that was not enough. I know they were right because I checked the emails before I added the details. I don't actually send a lot of emails from this account and most are to the account I'm trying to use as a recovery one, so is probably bouncing
 this for this reason. I'm in a closed loop system right now with no means to do anything about it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Server delay.</p>
<p>- If the user is using a firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with this, I'd like to know if you are receiving any notification for the delayed messages. Please post your email account as well in the private message area so that we can check it on our end. To view it, please sign in using a Microsoft account

            Hi jlatorre,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your response. Here are the other reasons&nbsp;why there are delays in receiving emails:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>The mail servers may be undergoing maintenance, or there may be a service outage.</span>
</li><li><span>The message was large, or it contained one or more large attachment.</span>
</li><li><span>Messages that are sent from Outlook.com, MSN, or Hotmail accounts are subject to the same spam filtering as incoming mail from third-party email services.</span>
</li></ul>
<div><span>The issue that you've reported is sometimes general and is usually resolved automatically. If you would mind. I would like to ask a few questions with regards to your issue:</span></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><font><span>Are the emails you receive that has been delayed contain attachments?</span></font></li><li><font><span>Does the delay in receiving messages happen to any contacts that sends you an email?</span></font></li></ul>
<div><span>We're looking forward to your response.</span></div>

            All emails were delayed both with and without attachments, even tests I sent myself from my own email accounts that only contained one word. Now I am discovering that I am not getting some e-mails at all in the past few days, even ones that are on my safe

            I have this same issue! Most of my emails are delayed and sometimes I don't even get the emails. I've tried checking my emails using different apps: outlook.com, windows mail, phone, etc. Like there is a huge delay at the server. I see this more with emails
 regarding password resets from various sites. I know this is a hotmail problem because I can do the same password reset using a gmail account and it goes through immediately. Even recently I had a post selling something and immediately after posting there
 should have been several emails back to me from people responding... I didn't receive them until the next morning.

    <title>Copying tabs with multiple pivot tables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> funean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying tabs with multiple pivot tables</h2>
                    I do several analyses each month using pivot tables. &nbsp;I have a document with the data for the month organized as a table, and about a dozen pivot tables displaying the analyses I want. &nbsp;What I want to be able to do is copy the current tab in order to make
 the next month's tab, then paste in the new month's data, and have all the pivot tables point to the data on that tab (rather than the original tab) without having to laboriously go into each pivot table and "Change Data Source" to the new location. &nbsp;E.G.,
 if I have a tab named "January," I want to copy it, rename it "February" and have all the pivot tables on the new "February" tab point to the data located on the "February" tab, not point back to the old "January" tab. &nbsp; It seems to me this used to be possible,
 and even automatic. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use a dynamic named range to make a PivotTable easier to update. If the named range expands to include more data, you have to refresh the PivotTable to include the new data. You can read more about creating a dynamic named range here in

    <title>How do I download the desktop version of Office 365 Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattijalakas  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I download the desktop version of Office 365 Home</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased Office 365 Home.&nbsp; The Microsoft site states as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Office 365 Home enables you to install the latest full desktop version of Office applications, including Word, Excel,&nbsp;PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook, on up to 5 PCs or
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/office365home/#onMac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Macs</a>, in addition to 5 Windows tablets or iPads—so you can use all the features offline as well as online.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also install Office on multiple
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/office365home/#multipleSmartPhones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">smartphones</a> for easy access."&nbsp;
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/office365home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/office365home/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I incorrectly assume that I get a desktop version of Office which I can use even&nbsp;when I am offline.&nbsp;&nbsp; On weekends, I take my laptop to the cottage&nbsp;&nbsp;where we have no internet connectivity and I would like to use Office there.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am eligible, then how do I download and where is my product key.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I go to ''my account'" and login, I can see that I have installed Office 365 on my machine but I think that this is only an internet version and not a ''full desktop version''.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am not eligible for a full desktop version,&nbsp;how do I get my money back?&nbsp;&nbsp; The return site does not provide an option office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks, </p>
<p />

            <p>The version of Office 365 you have installed on your computer is the "full desktop" version they mention.&nbsp; You are supposed to be able to run it Offline for up to about a month. So running it over the weekend should not be a problem. You have to connect
 to the internet monthly to allow it to reconfirm your subscription status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: after you do the initial install you have to run the program while connected to the internet and use the features you plan to use at home.&nbsp; The initial 365 / Click-to-run install process provides you with program "stubs" that are enough to start the
 program while more program code is downloaded.&nbsp; After those initial downloads, you should be able to use the program disconnected from the net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when you try to run it after the install is complete?</p>

<p>I recently used online chat support myself. I found it had several advantages over phone support, even though you still contact the same outsourced, support personnel:</p>
<ul>
<li>No ESL accent issues</li><li>Provides instant time stamped transcript</li><li>When you get transferred to the “right” person, they can review the history</li><li>If they don’t read history, you can copy / paste the past conversation to them, saving you having to repeat yourself</li><li>They are more likely to go off line to ask other people for help (good for you)</li><li>You don’t have to listen to “elevator muzak” when they are off line</li><li>You have 2 hands free to surf the web when they are not talking to you. </li></ul>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>For some reason, I found that waiting for online chat responses intrinsically <strong>
LESS</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>frustrating than listening to elevator muzak. </p>
<p>Make sure to copy the text from the chat window and save it before closing the chat window. It is handy to have a timestamped copy of the conversation, if only to publish it on the internet ... &lt;evil grin&gt;</p>

    <title>Word Document with track changes displays incorrect spacing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word Document with track changes displays incorrect spacing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with documents that have been edited using track change. When I got the documents back for the copy editor, they didn't&nbsp; display correctly on my computer and when I sent a few back to their authors, they didn't&nbsp; display correctly on theirs as
 well. Not all authors reported problems, but most did. BTW, on the copy editor's computer, they looked fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What comes back to me are spacing problems. Some words are mashed up together and some spacing after a period is omitted.&nbsp; We've sent the documents to a typesetter to fix the formatting issues but the problem still remains. What is odd is that the typesetter
 sent a few papers back to a co-worker first (MAC computer) and she said this test paper displayed correctly on her end. On my Windows 8 computer, there is no difference from the paper I received before it was sent to the typesetter. I still see mashed up words
 and some spots where there's no space after a period. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know all our authors have different Word versions and some are probably MAC base while others are Windows based. What is the problem and can it be fixed so that the documents display correctly to everyone?</p>

<h2>            .xlsx file extensions won&#39;t open in Office 365 on Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I recently downloaded a huge amount of data from the cloud onto my new MAC. I have a license for Office 365 Home. Some of my Excel spreadsheets will not open but others will. When they will not, then it states that Excel cannot open the file abc123.xlsx
 because the file format or file extension is not valid. I don't understand why they won't open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or solutions please?</p>

<br />My name is Kyle and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />It is possible that during the download your files have been damaged that is why some open and others do not. I suggest trying to download the damaged files again.
<br />
<br />If this does not work, you could try to do a Recover an earlier version of an Office file with the following link:

    <title>Windows 10 Preview Build 9879 Power Configuration as computer sleeps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fr. yuri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Preview Build 9879 Power Configuration as computer sleeps after every 15 minutes</h2>
                    <p>Alright. I use this SP3 for streaming certain events to the web. It worked fine with Win 8.1 and then I heard about Win 10 Tech Preview. So, in my IT glory, I decided to replace my Win 8.1 on my SP3 with Win 10 Tech Preview. I've upgraded and until recently
 I didn't have any problems with the power configurations. Now, all of a sudden, no matter what I set my power configuration settings to, the stupid machine goes into sleep mode after 15 minutes.\</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have double-checked everything except for the BIOS and every single thing is set to not sleep. Not even to turn the screen off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two power configurations at the moment: The standard "Balanced" and then my own "Broadcasting Power Plan". The SP3 is currently set for "Broadcasting Power Plan". The basic settings are to not put the computer to sleep on battery or when it is
 plugged in and the plan brightness is maxed out. Under advanced power settings, I have the Lid Close Action set to do nothing on either battery or AC and the same for the power button action, both Do Nothing on battery or AC. The display off feature is set
 to never on both battery and ac, the display brightness is set to 100% for both battery, dimmed display brightness is set to 100% for both and the enable adaptive brightness is set to on for both battery and ac. Finally, I fail to see how the battery features
 could pertain to this issue seeing as when I am broadcasting, the computer is 99% of the time plugged into the ac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if someone could please help me to resolve this issue, it would be greatly appreciated. But what would be even more appreciated is a way to entirely disable power saving on this computer as it is rarely away from a AC plug. In the old days, we use to
 be able to disable ACPI support in the BIOS and that would turn power saving off entirely as well, but that option is no longer available in the modern BIOS. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please and thank you for the help. And for those who may ask, we finally got the other problems with the SP3s and desktop figured out finally. The network issue turned out to be our ISP going offline and then coming back online. Dumb dumbs. Anyway, all is
 good now except for the power management *stuff*.</p>

            I'm using my SP3 for everything, and also have Windows Technical Preview installed. The power plans are working fine for me. The only difference I can see is that I'm using dual boot, keeping the Windows 8.1 and Windows Tech Preview installations separate,
 in order to minimize the risk of&nbsp;the device getting bricked or losing stuff if something goes wrong. If you can, I suggest partitioning and dual-booting as this can reduce the chance of driver conflict and consequently messing up the system. If there is not
 enough space, try to revert the OS to Windows 8.1.

            <p>Well, I'm trying to figure out what driver conflict you are referencing? Everything on here is from the Preview. I have no&nbsp;<em>known</em> Windows 8 drivers on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, why is it that people and corporations can never just give a straight answer? All anyone seems to be able to do anymore is offer workarounds. I'm looking for a solution and dual-booting is not a solution. It is just a way to dodge the problem at hand.
 As is reverting to Win 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The day that a company finally admits that they made a mistake with their product, openly, will literally be the day that Hell freezes over. Now, enough with workarounds and let's try to resolve/solve the issue at hand. All of my power management options
 ARE off and I am still having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some other way to disable power management? Or do I have to try and remove the power management drivers themselves from Win 10?</p>

            In build 9879, there is a bug with drivers duplicating. I'm not sure if that's the cause. I don't think there are that many power options available in Windows 10, but they are working fine for me. I tried creating a power setting as you've mentioned and
 everything works as expected. As far as I know Microsoft never installs anything extra such as power managers so I'm fairly sure there is nothing that gets in the way of PC settings as long as you don't have too much junk software.

            Indeed, but if certain bugs are one-time, it'll be a lot harder to identify and fix. As for SP3, that stands for the Microsoft Surface Pro 3.

<p>
</p><p><span>Trying out an early build like this can be risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete
 your files, so you should back up everything.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want to stop using Windows Technical Preview and return to your previous version of Windows, you'll need to reinstall your previous version from the recovery or installation media that
 came with your PC—typically a DVD. If you don't have recovery media, you might be able to create a USB recovery drive.

            Fix the boot problems first with next Build.. Changed 2 HDD because of "operation system is missing" everytime I turn the laptop off.. And Not showing HDD in boot menu and when I am trying to Install new windows.. Cost me $200 just because I wanted to
 try your software.. And it's really good, but this boot thing ruined everything.. Finally on the 3-rd HDD and same problem I found a way to fix.. Saved me one more $100.. Ain't cool.. Major problems like this one should be fixed first.

                    <p>Hello, I have a number of forms that I want to reside on our server for many users. The problems is that the forget and save over my form instead save as and renaming the document to their location. I have the doc set as restricted so that they only fill

            <p>This is what templates were invented for. The default action of a template is to create a new document from the original.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word has a feature called <strong>Workgroup Templates</strong> that allows templates to be shared on a network. Users create new files using
<strong>FILE&gt;New&gt;CUSTOM</strong> and the resulting documents cannot over-write the template accidentally, since they are saved by default to the user's folder, not the workgroup templates folder. Here is Charles Kenyon's page about finding and setting the workgroup
 templates folder: <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/word/workgrouptemplates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Workgroup Templates</a></p>
<p>If, for some reason, that solution is not to your liking, I would fix this on a operating system level by making the network share folder read-only for all users except yourself. Then they can't accidentally over-write your file.</p>

<p>Have to assume that your last reponse is in reference to the Outlook/Exchange wizard enabling you to link to an Outlook contact folder. Given that the secondary assumption is that what your original question really referred to&nbsp;was the ability to&nbsp;have some
 kind&nbsp;of 'real-time" link using some "out-of-box" functionality - then the answer is - "doesn't exist" for the categories field.</p>
<p>Can you export categories info from Outlook? Yes, via any of the other methods described in the original response but still won't solve your problem without creating some kind of custom front end. The "categories" field is a "multi-valued" (also referred
 to as a &lt;keyword&gt; field which means that you cannot simply apply a filter to its value such as<br />
the following pseudo type of query</p>
<p>"select all where categories = 'abc'" <br />
<br />
if the value of the categories field contained more then one category value</p>
<p>In short, your question is a "development" related issue (ergo - really belongs in one of the development related forums) that will require some kind of custom code.&nbsp;At the very least will require some knowledge of the Outlook Object Model.</p>
<p>It also comes down to how often, how much and how critical it is to have "real-time" access to the outlook data for your requirements versus having the database updated once a day (as an example).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have checked the email address connected to your community profile and I found out that the subscription of
<strong>United States unlimited mins mobiles and landlines 1 month </strong>is already cancelled on your Skype account, this means that you don't have worry as you will not be charged on the date stated on the email and this is also the reason why you are not
 seeing any option to cancel the subscription on your Skype page. </p>

<h2>            Word 2016 - Assign Value in One Text Box to Another Text Box</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a word document into which I have inserted a table. &nbsp;The table is repeated multiple times for each one frames a different picture. &nbsp;In the first table I have inserted a rich text box control with a tag name of TextBox111. &nbsp;In the next table (same
 document) I inserted a rich text box control with a tag name of TextBox222.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have generated code tied to the lost focus event of TextBox111 that I had hoped would populate TextBox222 with the text in TextBox111. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it does not work. &nbsp;The codes is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub TextBox111_LostFocus()</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Me.TextBox222 = Me.TextBox111.Text</p>
<p>(also tried Me.TextBox222.Text = Me.TextBox111.Text)</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the code manually (i.e. not depending on the event to fire) I get a compile error of "method or data member not found". &nbsp;I should note that when I type in the Me. TextBox222 word's autocomplete does not find the tagname. &nbsp;It does find TextBox111.</p>
<p>When I go to the properties for the 2nd text box I can see that its tagname is TextBox222.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>If you're using rich text <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">content</span> controls, that sort of code isn't applicable at all -- it works only for

<p>
</p><p>Your post is confusing because you speak of "tag names," which exist only for content controls, but the LostFocus event applies only to ActiveX controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using content controls, then the code needs to look very different, starting with the fact that the applicable event is&nbsp;Document_ContentControlOnExit, and you need to use the expression&nbsp;ActiveDocument.SelectContentControlsByTag("something")(1)
 to get access to a content control with the tag value of "something".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you are using ActiveX controls, then this code (in the ThisDocument module) works perfectly well.</p>
<p>

Private Sub TextBox111_LostFocus()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Me.TextBox222.Text = Me.TextBox111.Text<br />
End Sub<br />

<h2>            Moving files from OneDrive Personal to OneDrive Business</h2>
                    <p>Hello -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved my folders and files from my Personal Personal to my Business OneDrive and everything seemed fine; the files were moved over and was able to access them on my Business OneDrive. However, after it was done I received the following message (screen
 shot below) on my Personal OneDrive. If I select <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">"Restore Files"</span>
</strong>it moves the files back to my Personal OneDrive and then I get the same message on my Business OneDrive; the files and folders are then back on my Personal OneDrive and removed from my Business OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm reluctant (terrified, actually) of choosing <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>"Remove"</strong></span> in fear of loosing all my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed any light on this situation?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi I do Qubes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This warning will show up when you delete too many items at once from your OneDrive. The goal is to remind you that deleting the files will also delete them from the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you move them to either one of your OneDrive (either Personal or Business), it means that it will be removed from the other, which is why moving them back and forth will show the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When moving important files, we suggest using <strong>Copy </strong>instead of
<strong>Move/Cut</strong>, to make sure that the files are working after you copy them, before then deleting the original.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest keeping a backup to prevent any data loss in case something happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Sometimes Office error messages are cryptic or misleading. I suspect this one is accurate. It is likely seeing one dimension of the pdf as exceeding 22." To see if that is the case, view the pdf in a pdf viewer at 100% zoom. Even if it can open it, you may still have trouble with conversion.
<br />
<br />Since Word 2013, Word has had the ability to directly open pdf document. However, some pdf documents (from scanners mostly) are really pictures of text rather than the text itself. Just as you can't look under the hood of a picture of a car, you can't edit a picture of a document.
<br />
<br />In that case, you need to convert the picture to text. This is a process known as optical character recognition. This is built into Adobe Acrobat and is also in Office OneNote. Most scanner software comes with an OCR component as well. Once you have text, you can edit it with Word.
<br />
<br />If you simply want to write on the document (but not in it) you can add a Text Box floating on top of the document layer, whether or not it has been put through the OCR process.
<br />
<br />Word documents that have been saved as PDF will not need the OCR process, they retain their text, although not all of their Word structure and formatting.
<br />
<br />Finally, documents converted from pdf (or really any other format) to Word can be tough to edit because the conversion process never has a one-to-one matching of how formatting is done. This means that a converted document will seldom be formatted in Word in a way that makes sense. An example is multiple section breaks to change margins, where in Word you would simply change the paragraph indent.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

            There is probably some setting on your scanner that allows you to control the dimensions of the output.&nbsp; I haven't looked for such a setting on my scanner, but by default, the scanned output matches that of the document that is being scanned, though it
 is possible in the preview of the scan to select a smaller part of the page, but even then the size of the output matches that of the selected part of the page.

            Thanks for that, Doug. I've had to put this problem aside for the moment, but I have looked, and it seems I wasn't using my scanner properly - as you say, there is a setting to determine the size of the scan, so that should fix it.

 to only sync what I placed into it it was syncing everything I have in iTunes. Not possible. Can't seem limit .

            Hello JebbieMarie!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!<br />
<br />
If your device is indicating that you have Critically Low on memory, this means that your device is running-out of free space on your device to do all of it's thinking (also called Storage Memory).&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of users choose to install their programs into&nbsp;"Device
 Memory", which is synonomous with Program Memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Program memory is the same space that Windows Mobile uses to when programs need memory to temporarily store info.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to go into your Add/Remove programs and remove as many of your programs and re-install them onto external storage (a SD or MicroSD card), along with your pictures, songs and other miscellaneous stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reserve Device memory for programs that
 you use multiple times every day.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
This will free-up a lot of space for your programs to use when they need it.

    <title>N95 SLOW IMAP protocol - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> olmadsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 SLOW IMAP protocol</h2>
                    I am using IMAP on my N95 for reading email.<br />
It appears to be very very slow.<br />
The systems people here have traced the IMAP daemon on the server when the N95 is reading email. It seems that the N95 insists on checking all folders even if they are not subscribed to. And since I have almost 2000 folders it takes forever.<br />
<br />
I wonder if there are others that have have experienced a similar problem and/or if there is a fix for this problem<br />
<br />
I have recently updated the software on the N95<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            I have a similar speed problem using the native S60 email client that comes with the N95. Initially I thought it was an issue with unread messages (I have thousands of them) but after changing them all to "read" it clearly isn't - the speed is atrocious.<br />
<br />
Firstly it insists on downloading headers for all 6500 messages I have on installing (haven't found a way around that), and then takes 2 or 3 minutes to open the folder. Whilst this is going on, my Messages app is unusable. In fact, Messages itself becomes
 v v v slow to open anyway which means writing txts/MMSs is out of the question if I have my N95 linked via IMAP to GMail.<br />
<br />
The settings are all correct (have been through the advice given on the GMail help page...) and it's a brand new phone so there shouldn't be any conflict between the email client and other apps. Not sure if it helps, but am on v30 firmware.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also been facing issues with my N95-1 (RM-159).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It recently went to repair under guarantee due to a distorted loudspeaker, and came back with updated firmware (v35.0.002).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the firmware update (I can't precisely tell which one it had before, but it was the one&nbsp;it came from the factory, and was was customized&nbsp;for the local cell phone provider, so I think it wouldn't help), it was fast and responsive eventhough I had
 my gmail configured and my work e-mail (2 different mail boxes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if I configure just the gmail account, it takes about&nbsp;15 seconds to open the "messages" application, and if I select the mailbox, another 20-30 seconds to open.&nbsp;If I configure both, it can take up to a minute to be able to access the "messages" application.
 The whole phone becomes very slow and sluggish until&nbsp;I shut down the "messages" application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to reset both the phone memory and format the memory card to see if it helps. But I would like to know if anyone have here a workaround to get my phone working as before with the original firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not even counting with the problem I'm facing that I'm not able to update ovi maps to 3.0 version due to a failure on ovi maps updater, that can't get enough information from the phone (code 3, unespecified error number 1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Reformated the device and the memory card, and still the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional&nbsp;information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gmail mailbox:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4702 emails archived</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cell phone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>around 1100&nbsp;SMS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>73Mb free memory on phone (76Mb used)</p>
<p>1423kb of stored messages&nbsp;</p>
<p>212Mb used on memory card (734Mb free)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to reduce the number of mails on my mailbox, as well remove some old SMS messages, to see if it helps. But it's too annoying that I had it working nice previously and now, although the phone in general is faster, it's much slower for mail and
 messages. About the previous firmware, all that I remember is that it came with Fifa07, and ngage software was not fully installed (just trial).</p>

            <p>hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your answer, however I tried to put it on the forum you mentioned and got the following:</p>
<p>Body text cannot contain images or links until we are able to verify your account</p>
<p>
</p><p>what do I do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also not sure it is only network question as a few other things happened since the update - Cortana is not working and keep asking to set it up but even after I set it up nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>again this happens now on 3 computers that went through the latest update.&nbsp; was working before the update.</p>

</p><p><span>You can try performing a system restore and check. System restore will takes your PC back to an earlier point in time. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you

            <p>the system restore won't help as it will bring the system to the time before the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>let's be optimistic and assume that everything will work after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but then whenever the update will take place again we will come back to the situation now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as I explained this happened on 3 different computers - 1 new laptop just opened, a desktop and a surface pro 3.</p>
