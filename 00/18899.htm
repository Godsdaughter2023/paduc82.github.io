<h2>            Unable to Open Visio 2013 File After Opening and Saving ACAD File as a Visio File</h2>
                    Summary:
<div>- Received an ACAD file of unknown version.</div>
<div>- I can open with no issue in my ACAD 2014 LT.</div>
<div>- Unable to open in Visio 2013.</div>
<div>- Opened in ACAD 2014 and saved as a 2004 ACAD version.</div>
<div>- Able to open and save 2004 version with no issue as Visio 2013 file.</div>
<div>- When I try to re-open converted file in Visio 2013 I get an error that the file is either not a DWG or DXF, or is corrupt.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note:</div>
<div>- After opening the ACAD 2004 version file in Visio, the drawing opens with one object in it, the entire drawing. &nbsp;If I high-light the single object (which is the entire drawing) and run the Ungroup command in Visio, Visio appears to run okay, ungrouping
 approximately 245,000 items, until it gets to the end, and then Visio stops responding. &nbsp;No way out other than forcing the program to close. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Follow Up Attempts:</div>
<div>- I opened the original file again using ACAD 2014 LT, made sure all layers were turned on, no layers were locked, no layers were frozen, and no groups in ACAD file (For clarity, ACAD does appear to be saved with any group assignments so I really didn't
 do anything regarding this last item). &nbsp;Then I saved as ACAD 2004 version from ACAD 2014. &nbsp;Then I reopened the ACAD 2004 file in Visio. &nbsp;All issues as described in Summary: above were the same.</div>
<div>- I performed the same task as Step 1 above in Follow Up Attempts: only difference being I converted to ACAD 2000 instead of 2004. &nbsp;All issues as described in Summary: above were the same.</div>
<div><br />

            Sudeep, thank you for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>First answers to your questions...</div>
<div>
<p>How did you open the AutoCAD file? File -&gt; Open or Insert Tab -&gt; CAD Drawing? BOTH</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And just to confirm that&nbsp;you saved the file as VSDX without doing any modifications and when you opened this VSDX file you got the error right? YES&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am unable to reproduce this issue so is it possible for you to share the AutoCAD file which you have used? I CANNOT. &nbsp;SORRY.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, when you try to convert the CAD drawing, instead of using ungroup command, use convert (Right click on the imported CAD daring -&gt; CAD Drawing object -&gt; Convert). I TRIED BOTH WAYS. &nbsp;HOWEVER I NOTICED AFTER USING THE SECOND METHOD, RIGHT CLICK AND CONVERT,
 THE ERROR MESSAGE WAS DIFFERENT WHEN RE-OPENING THE FILE. &nbsp;I WAS WORKING IN A VDI ENVIRONMENT SO I MOVED THE FILE TO MY LOCAL WORKSTATION AND WAS ABLE TO RE-OPEN AND WORK WITH THE FILE AFTER OPENING, MODIFYING, SAVING, AND CLOSING. &nbsp;FROM MY LOCAL WORKSTATION
 I STILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH RE-OPENING THE FILE AFTER USING THE UNGROUP COMMAND.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apparently I was having two issues. &nbsp;The Ungroup command, but when I resolved this issue by using the Convert command I was also having a memory issue in VDI. &nbsp;When working from my local workstation and using the Convert command the issue is resolved.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

    <title>OWA in dark mode displays lines of black boxes in email body - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OWA in dark mode displays lines of black boxes in email body</h2>
                    <p>I have a recurring issue of lines of black boxes in my emails when using OWA in dark mode. When I view the sent email from my browser in dark mode, it looks fine, but to a recipient using a regular version of Outlook, it shows up like the image below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's taken me a while to narrow it down, but I believe that it's the suggestion highlights that are showing up this way. I've resolved it by disabling suggestions in the settings menu (Gear Icon &gt; View All Outlook Settings &gt; Compose and Reply &gt; Quick Suggestions
 &gt; disabled 'Offer suggestions based on keywords in my message').&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you aware of this issue, and/or are you working on a fix for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Unexpected Kernel Mode Trap after 15025 Attempts Auto Update</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Book is now crashing with an UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP whenever I enable WiFi (about 2 minutes after connecting to the Web). &nbsp;Was running 15019 just fine. &nbsp;When 15025 tried to update list night (Feb 1, 2017), something went amiss.</p>

            <p>I should add that my desktop shows I'm still on 15019 rel 170121-1513. &nbsp;So the update to 15025 never completed, not sure if it got part way or what. &nbsp;I had gone to bed thinking it would be done by morning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went out and bought a backup laptop since my my Surface Book is not much use without Internet. &nbsp;Hope a solution is found soon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm willing to DL any sort of patches and copy them over to the Surface Book via thumb drive to try them out for the dev team.</p>
<p>

            <p>Microsoft are releasing the ISO for build 15025 soon.</p>
<p>Download the ISO, open with windows explorer and double-click setup.exe to install build 15025.</p>
<p>It is very similar to windows update in that it will save&nbsp;your data and programs&nbsp;in the update.</p>
<p>But as always please backup any data important to you just in case the update crashes.</p>

            Only accounts other then pop can have individual inbox. I was not able to find an option to change this. Perhaps you can create rules to move emails from a particular account to a folder.

<h2>            Conditional Color formatting of &#39;Resource Usage&#39; view</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to explore the conditional color formatting in 'Resource&nbsp;Usage' view in MS Projects 2010. I want to set a condition on the resource allocation field (where you see the #of days a resource is allocated to a task in a week).e. if the resource is allocated
 for more than&nbsp;40 Hrs in a week&nbsp;then the field should turn 'Red' color. And if it is less than 40Hrs in a week then it should turn 'Yellow'.</p>
<p>Is there any functionality within MS Projects 2010 which will help me achieve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since you are facing this issue only after upgrading to Windows 10 Technical Preview, this issue must be occurring due to the driver incompatibility

    <title>Emails are full in my Outlook 2013 and cannot delete old emails in any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregorynash90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails are full in my Outlook 2013 and cannot delete old emails in any folder despite hitting SHIFT DELETE</h2>
                    <p>My emails in Outlook 2013 are apparently full and it is preventing me from both sending or receiving emails. This is not good as I cannot get any work done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when I hit SHIFT DELETE I still get the same message 'The message store has reached its maximum size. To reduce the amount of data in this message store, select some items that you no longer need and permanently (SHIFT + DEL) delete them.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me with a straight forward solution to this as all of the forums I have read so far have just told me to by pass the trash folders by hitting SHIFT + DELETE which is no good to me or have given an extremely long winded explanation
 of going through files in explorer which has had no effect either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Okay, the online server does have discrepancies on there and junk items I have previously deleted from it has not updated on my Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done is archived the whole account and then deleted the proposed faulty one and set it up again. It seems to have worked, doesn't have any of my old sent items in it but the archive has them all in if I'm ever desperate to get them back. Not
 perfect but a lot better than not being able to send nor receive emails!</p>
<p>

    <title>Groove Music crashes video driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoganvt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove Music crashes video driver</h2>
                    <p>Don't know what's going on, but with the latest update of Windows 10, my Groove Music app causes my video driver to crash.&nbsp; Upon opening the app, I see the main app screen with my artists, then the screen goes blank and a flashing arrow appears.&nbsp; If left
 alone, after&nbsp;several minutes, the display reverts to a default Windows video driver and Groove is functional, but at a much lower resolution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can play an individual song by clicking on it and as long as I don't try to adjust anything in the smaller Groove Music app window, everything plays.&nbsp; The screen does go to black the second the artist wallpaper changes, but comes back quickly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what's going on.&nbsp; The app worked fine prior to the latest update.&nbsp; Is there any work-around?&nbsp; Anyone experiencing this issue?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi HoganVT - this is something we were made aware of recently and we're investigating. We'll let you know if we discover a good workaround. Sorry for the problems, this is really frustrating.

            <p>I'm also experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think is related to the poor Intel support for older integrated GPU's. I'm currently using and Intel i3 2nd Gen notebook and Windows 10, not fully supported afaik, but managed to work. Adoble Flash Player also crashes, so I try to use HTML5 instead.</p>

            Yeah, I think you're right. We've reproduced this internally on older integrated Intel devices. We're working on a fix in the Groove app, and simultaneously the system and device guys will work on a better solution with Intel.

            That's generally not how Store/Universal apps work, as they are updated through the store. I do hope that you don't have to wait too long to get the fix.

<h2>            Why is a website prompting me to download a file named application&#47;octet-stream&#63; What program do I use to open it with&#63;</h2>
                    I have recently upgraded to Windows 7, and I"m using IE8. There is a website I visit daily (it's a 100% safe site), and every time I try to access it, I'm prompted to download or save a file named "application/octet-stream." (I get this using Firefox,
 as well.)<br />
<br />
When I click on "Save," the dialog box just disappears and the website's tab closes.&nbsp;I do not get this same prompt&nbsp;using any other PC&nbsp;viewing the website in question; only on my home PC.<br />
<br />
I have not found the answer anywhere on the internet. Your help would be TREMENDOUSLY appreciated!

</span><span>Does this happen with any particular website or all the websites?

</span><span>Are you able to access other websites without this issue?

<br />When you want to find out whether or not 2 variables are related or correlated, then an XY Scatter Chart should be used to plot the graph.

<br />74,476 REASONS YOU SHOULD ALWAYS GET THE BIGGER PIZZA

<br />One day last year, an engineer and I went to a pizza place for lunch. The engineer told me he wasn't very hungry, but he said he was going to get the 12-inch medium instead of the 8-inch small — because the medium was more than twice as big as the small, and it cost only a little bit more. This sort of blew my mind.

<br />Game for some charting awesomeness?
<br />Off late, I have been doing a lot of data analysis and visualization on performance ratings, salary hike, gender pay equality etc. Today let me share you an awesome way to visualize massive amounts of data.
<br />Scenario: Your organization of 3,686 people recently went thru annual performance ratings &amp; review process. At the end of it, everyone was offered some salary increase (from $0 to $24,000 per year). You have 7 business groups. How do you tell the story of all these salary hikes in one chart?

<br />A very commonly requested Excel feature is the ability to add labels to XY chart data points. The XY Chart Labeler adds this feature to Excel.

<br />Shading between plotted lines with a light color can enhance some charts. The shading may help to indicate a target range for the data.

<h2>            Missing folders in &#39;On My Computer&#39; in Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>It seems that Outlook for Mac 2016&nbsp;(15.30) has randomly deleted all of the subfolders that sat below folders in my Inbox stored On My Computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, this is the structure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- On My Computer</p>
<p>-- Inbox</p>
<p>--- Folder 1</p>
<p>---- Subfolder (deleted)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these second level subfolders are missing. Searching for the emails that should be within said folders return no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I recover the thousands of business emails it seems that Outlook has randomly purged?</p>

<p>Hi Corentin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try copying the .olm onto the new Macbook Pro and then importing it into Outlook 2016.&nbsp; That did work although it created duplicate sets of folders -one under On My Computer and an identical set under another folder under archive labeled the .olm file.&nbsp;
 After verifying that the folders were identical I deleted the archive file and seem to be back in business.&nbsp; I'd definitely recommend creating (and saving) the .olm file for anyone upgrading to Outlook 2016 from any previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Manvendra and everyone who is facing a problem with Nokia E63 that is hanging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought my Nokia E63 5 days back and as you have said it started hanging from the second day expecially when I tried to navigate from contacts back to the main screen, wherein on pressing on Menu or Home screen button, a thin line appears on the top right
 hand corner. This problem was getting resolved when the phone was restarted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had called Nokia helpline and they had said that refreshing the phone to the factory settings would solve the problem, but this did not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, no need to worry as there is a solution that has worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First install the Nokia PC Suite on your computer and connect your device to the computer/laptop using it. Use the back up option to back up your phone's contacts, messages settings etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now download the software updater application from any Nokia site and Install it on your machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now connect your phone to your computer (if not already connected) using PC Suite. Then run the Software Updater. This will first check if any updated software is available. There is a new version of the firmware that is available with Nokia now. Its size
 is around 110.5 MB. So make sure that you have a good internet connection which does not break. Start the update process and make sure that you do not disconnect your device at any time during this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the update restore your backed up data to your phone again. In my case everything was the same as before the update. The settings were not lost. I only had to redownload the Ovi Maps again.</p>
<p>After the update is done the problem with the menu button getting hanged will get resolved. Its now been 24 hours that my phone is switched on after the update has happened and my phone has not hanged despite heavy usage especially since I have my office
 mails synced to my E63.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So guys relax, E63 is a good phone as you already know and this will solve the problems. I might be mistaken but it seems to me that the phone has become faster after the firmware update.</p>

 Personalization&gt; Home Screen&gt; Key Shortcuts&gt; Left Selection Key (CHANGE MENU TO RIFHT SIDE AND CAMERA ON LEFT SIDE) Problem seems solved at this point. I hope this helps you guy. Kind Regards.

<p>You sure the SIM is in correctly? Is this a new microSIM or is it a cut down mini SIM? If the latter get a new SIM.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Share Videos transfferd from pc through music and videos app</h2>
                    I can't share videos from Music+Videos..if they are transferred from PC<br />
<br />
It can be done only if they are copied to Photos folder..but then I cannot view them in Music+Videos app<br />
(can share the once shot from phone's camera, as they are automatically stored in photos folder).<br />
<br />
Is there any way to avoid this?...can i send from videos app directly?<br />
<br />
I use HTC 8X.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi Chinmay_P,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to share videos transferred from a PC&nbsp;directly from the Music+videos app. Unfortunately, it seems that you can only share videos from Camera roll; please see the following article about sharing videos on Windows Phone 8:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/photos/take-edit-and-share-photos-and-videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/photos/take-edit-and-share-photos-and-videos</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please have a look at the following thread regarding sharing videos on Windows Phone 8:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/share-video-files-same-as-pictures/cb805b9a-69f3-41e8-9638-da49afc65341?page=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/share-video-files-same-as-pictures/cb805b9a-69f3-41e8-9638-da49afc65341?page=1</a></p>

<p>Have you restarted the Mac since installing the "update"? If not, try that before anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specific details usually point in the most direct direction. Simply "reinstalling" is a
<em>scorched earth</em> policy that is used on Windows boxes but should be a last resort on a Mac... it isn't the recommended starting point. It typically results in the same issue - and perhaps others - being regenerated because the installation files rarely
 are responsible for creating the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before jumping to conclusions IMO it would be best to know exactly what you're working with.
</p>
<ul>
<li>What version of macOS are you using?</li><li>Can you launch any of the Office programs? If you can launch Excel go to <strong>
Excel&gt; About Microsoft Excel</strong> in the main menu to determine the present <strong>
Version</strong> &amp; <strong>License</strong> type of your Office installation. Include that info in your reply.</li><li>Exactly what "update" did you install: Mac Office? macOS?<br />
</li><li>How did you obtain the update: MAU? Direct download? If the latter, from what source?</li></ul>

<h2>            MS account connected to old &#40;invalid&#41; email address</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a Microsoft Account for at least five years.&nbsp; It is tied to an old email address that is no longer valid.&nbsp; When I created this account, I simply used it to ask questions on these community forums.&nbsp; Now that I have started using Windows 8.1, I
 connected this Microsoft Account to my Windows 8.1 logon.&nbsp; When I go to my Microsoft account page at account.live.com, the 'Basic Info' tab says "Your email address has not been verified." and there is a link that says "Verify your email address".&nbsp; I cannot
 do this because the email address linked to this account is no longer valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the "Aliases" tab, my old (invalid) email address is shown as my primary alias (and my only alias).&nbsp; I'd like to add a new alias corresponding to my current email address, but I cannot do this - I see a message that says "For security reasons,
 you need to verify your primary alias before you can add another alias."&nbsp; But I am unable to do this because, as I mentioned above, the email address connected to my primary alias is no longer valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how I can get around this problem, so that I can remove the invalid primary alias email and set my Microsoft account to use the correct email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />
Paul</p>

<h2>            Memory Card&#47;Gallery Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! I have a Nokia E63, and am having some issues with the Memory card and gallery. Whenever I insert my memory card, the phone registers it, and I can download things to the memory card. But, when I try to go into my gallery (pictures, videos, everything)
 it just won't go into it or load. When I take the memory card out, the gallery loads straight away. It's an issue because I need to put the stuff in the gallery onto the memory card, and it's got 2gb so there shouldn't be issues with the memory status... Please
 help!</p>

<p>One way around it would be to use the File Manager to copy the items by folder from the phone to the memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that, it takes time for the gallery to refresh after you put a new memory card. This process can take a few minutes to over half an hour depending on how many items you have in the memory card including music as the music player also needs to
 find the files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait a few minutes after instering the memory card before you open the gallery and see if that helps.</p>

                    I just installed build 10130. Everything&nbsp;works fine except the&nbsp;Music app. When I open it, it stays there for 1 second and then flashes away. Is there anyway I can fix this?

    <title>How is Office 2016 any different from Office 2011&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> websandy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How is Office 2016 any different from Office 2011&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to figure out how Office 2016 for Mac is different from Office 2011 for Mac.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently abandoned my Windows computer for a Macbook because I just had too much work to do and it had become a productivity issue. When I got my Mac, I started with Office 2011 (because I guess Microsoft never updated Office for Mac the way they did for
 Windows). About four months later, I purchased Office 2016. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not only does Office 2016 seem to have nothing additional over Office 2011, but it seems to be missing things that were in 2011. For example, decorative borders and clip art. The MS Office online instructions say to go to "Layout - Page Layout." That takes
 you nowhere. Hunting around and going to "Design - Page Borders," gets you "Borders and Shading," which does not have decorative borders. Also, 2011 had clip art, and 2016 has no clip art.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Word for decades and am not a beginner. Am I missing something, or is Microsoft dropping off functionality as they publish each new version?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Welcome to Mac! &nbsp;I've also been disappointed with Windows 10 and have made the switch to OS X El Capitan. &nbsp; I run a couple of Windows games in CrossOver, which works very well, and MS Visio 2016 in a VMware Windows 7 virtual machine since I need that application
 at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone back to Office for Mac 2011 and prefer it by far to the newer release. &nbsp;Until Microsoft restores all of the features available in the 2011 version I'm staying put. &nbsp;The only exception is Outlook, which in my opinion has been improved for those
 working with Microsoft Exchange servers in an office environment. &nbsp;I keep waiting for the update that restores the ability to customise the ribbon, for example, but there's no sign of it yet. &nbsp;And as far as I know, MathType doesn't support the newer version
 either. &nbsp;Perhaps in another 6 months or so we'll be tempted to make the switch, but for anyone hoping to find a Windows equivalent in OS X, the wait will surely be much longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you can install each of the Office 2016 for Mac applications individually, and even run them in parallel with their 2011 counterparts, I suggest you try them both and make your own choice. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks Geoffrey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mac has been a dream! No more, "Gee I think I'll make a cup of coffee while that page is loading"! And thanks so much for the input regarding Office 2011 and 2016 - seems it was just as I suspected. Strange marketing strategy, but Microsoft has always
 been a bit quirky. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know that I could run Office 2011 and Office 2016 at the same time on a Mac - I never would have tried that on Windows! But then, the Mac has been just one surprise after another. (Like transferring all your Windows Office documents over to the
 Mac, and they work without doing anything - <em>amazing</em>!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I <em>will</em> run both versions; and when I want the extra functionality, I'll revert to the older, Office 2011 (like life, "strange but true").</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, how would you rate the comparable Mac programs, like Pages, to Office for Mac? Are there any that are just as good, or better? And would you know of a simple Mac database program for contact management (with a little more functionality than the
 built-in one) that is good for the Mac, or should I go with Access for Mac?</p>

            <p>I'd recommend KeyNote for presentations, but neither Numbers nor Pages can (yet) compare with MS Office. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't provide Mac versions of its Visio, Project or Access applications, and OneNote for Mac only allows cloud storage. &nbsp;Evernote would be a Mac alternative here. &nbsp;A recommended Mac alternative for Visio and Project would be OmniGraffle and OmniPlan
 (or Merlin Project), but they have their limitations when working with Microsoft-formatted documents. &nbsp;OmniPlan can't import a Project 2016 file, and when exporting OmniGraffle diagrams to XML format the file sizes are much larger than their VSDX counterparts.
 &nbsp;A Microsoft Access alternative would be FileMaker Pro, which has a similar interface, but of course all of these Mac programs aren't cheap. &nbsp;Then again, Microsoft Project costs a pretty sum as well...</p>

            Pages 5 released in 2013 deleted dozens of features which many found essential to their work, forcing them to return to Pages 4 (from 2009) or to shift to Word instead. &nbsp;I would not recommend it. &nbsp;And in general the iWork apps cannot substitute for Office
 if you need to really be compatible with colleagues/superiors using the latter.

            <p>I couldn't agree with you more in regard to the watering down of Office 2016 &amp; its myriad shortcomings, but I can't agree with your examples :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A search of Word 2016 Help using the criteria <em>page border </em>yields (among other related articles) this:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/client/Add-a-border-to-a-page-in-Word-2016-for-Mac-0189e5ea-ca16-470b-9bd1-d7863eceb429?NS=MACWORD&amp;Version=16&amp;SysLcid=1033&amp;UiLcid=1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add a border to a page in Word 2016 for Mac</a>,
 which appears to be both accurate &amp; appropriate. The Page Borders always have been located in the
<strong>Format&gt; Borders &amp; Shading - Page Border</strong> dialog in the list simply labeled Art. AFAICT, there's absolutely no difference between what's provided in O2016 compared to O2011</p>
<p>
</p><p>Including locally installed Clip Art is something that Microsoft has been working away form over the last several version... it was removed completely from Windows Office with the introduction of Office 2007. It's just that they've done the same thing here,
 but as yet haven't provided the online same availability for Mac users. In addition to millions of other locations for Clip Art, the Microsoft library is bigger [and arguably better] than ever... you just have to know where to look :-):
<a href="http://www.bing.com/images?FORM=Z9LH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Bing.com - Images</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO, I'd prefer it that way... I'd far rather selectively store only the images I need routinely rather than have some software designer clutter my HD with stuff I'll never use :-)</p>

            <p>If you really need to get legit work done Then I would recommend keeping a Permanent Licensed version of Office 2011, around at least for next 2 Years. 2016 Is a Total Rewrite in Apple Code of Office. And as such Components are required to be sandboxed and
 compartmentalized. So they are having to rewrite in stages to add features. Some may never be added back. Some may eventually work out better than in 2011. &nbsp;I figure It will take a minimum 2-3 years to get to perfection.&nbsp;<span>Microsoft
 is painfully aware that 2016 is but a shadow and has extended to sunsetting of updates and support to around Sept/Oct 2017.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would go ahead and keep subscription to Office 2016 under the Office 365 Subscription. In a few cases 2016 actually performs better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One feature I like in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, is that They have a new feature called Pin in which you set documents to be pinned and They will readily avai</span>lable regardless of when they were authored. &nbsp;Just click on
 pinned, and a list of Pinned items will show.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also in word if you stop in a Document more than 1 page long and you want to go to where you left off you shoul</span>d see an arrow Icon on Right side and click on it and you go to place you left off. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>As Geoffrey replied, MS Access is not available for OS X, although the Windows version can be used on a Mac if you're willing to install the Windows OS on a Boot Camp partition or as a Virtual Machine. I've never used CrossOver but have heard some good things
 about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, however, MS Access is way overkill for your need as you describe it. You might take a look at the Contact Management software already at your finger tips... It's called
<em>Outlook</em> :-)</p>
