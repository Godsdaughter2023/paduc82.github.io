<h2>            Xbox 360 refuses to let me login to my profile</h2>
                    
<p>I'm confused and have no idea what to do. I'm able to log in to my microsoft account on my pc and smartphone but my xbox 360 refuses to let me in to my account. I've changed my password twice tonight trying to get in. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>To solve this issue you should remove your profile from the console, clear the console cache three times in a row and download the account again</p>
<p>a)Here’s how you can remove any Xbox profile from your Xbox 360 console:</p>
<p>Go to settings and select System.</p>
<p>Select Storage.</p>
<p>Note If you don’t connect any external storage devices to your console, select Hard Drive. If you do use external storage, select All Devices.</p>
<p>Select Profiles.</p>
<p>The Profiles option is highlighted on the All Devices screen. </p>
<p>Select the Xbox profile that you want to delete.</p>
<p>Select Delete Profile Only – This deletes the Xbox profile but leaves saved games and achievements.</p>
<p>b) To clear the system cache</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage.</p>
<p>The Storage category is highlighted on the System Settings screen. </p>
<p>Highlight but don’t select a storage device, and then press Y on your controller for Device Options.</p>
<p>Note It doesn't matter which storage device you choose. This clears the cache for all storage devices.</p>
<p>'Hard Drive' is highlighted on the Storage Devices screen. </p>
<p>On the Device Options screen, select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>The 'Clear System Cache' option is highlighted on the Device Options screen. </p>
<p>When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes.</p>
<p>Note When you’ve successfully cleared the system cache, you’ll return to the Storage Devices screen. You can then press the Guide button on the controller and return to Xbox Home.</p>
<p>c) Here’s how to add your Xbox profile to any Xbox 360 console:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button &nbsp;on your controller.</p>
<p>Select Download Profile.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Download Profile screen, select Download Profile.</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 ‘Download Profile’ screen showing the ‘Download Profile’ option highlighted.
</p>
<p>Enter the email address of the Microsoft account that’s associated with your Xbox profile. If you don’t know it, see the Lost Account Solution.</p>
<p>Enter your Microsoft account password. If you’ve forgotten it, you’ll need to reset your password.</p>
<p>Note If you have a child account, your parent’s Microsoft account information is required to download your Xbox profile on the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>If you use external storage on your console, select the storage device on which you want to save your Xbox profile. If you don’t use external storage, your Xbox profile will begin downloading.</p>
<p>After you download your Xbox profile, you’ll be asked if you want the console to remember your password.</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 ‘Download Profile’ screen showing the ‘Remember Password’ option highlighted.</p>
<p>If you want to sign in without being prompted for a password each time, select the Remember Password option.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that when you choose this option, anyone who uses your console can sign in as you and use your account information. This includes any credit card information you might have saved.</p>
<p>Leave the Remember Password option unchecked if you want the console to require a password to sign in to your account. This is a good idea if others in your home can easily access your console, or if you downloaded your Xbox profile at a friend’s house.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! </p>

<h2>            OneDrive installer runs forever without progress</h2>
                    <p>I would really really like to use the new OneDrive Files On-demand feature. So I tried updating OneDrive. The installer however gets stuck at the first step "Preparing OneDrive for first use..." CPU usage is 22%, and stays like that for hours if I dont stop
 it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- uninstalling OneDrive. I had issues re-installing it but eventually succeeded with an older (the same as I had) version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I switched to Windows Insider Builds and got the latest build of the fast ring. But when I booted into that build OneDrive no longer worked, and again I could only (re)install the older version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now switched back to where I was, stopped the insider builds, but now onedrive keeps trying to update itself automatically quietly. Not so quietly though, because my fans start running nonstop because of the looping CPU usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current version is Build 17.3.6816.0313. The installation issues occur when I download the latest installler from the OneDrive website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 Pro, OS build: 15063.483<br />
</p>
<p>Is this a known problem? What to do?&nbsp;</p>

            I already did, I was hoping for some more immediate one on one actions / debug steps. Since I rely on OneDrive for my daily workflow I guess I'll go back to an earlier build and wait till the issue is resolved

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My issues was on Windows 10 anniversary update.&nbsp; PC 14393.51</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution.&nbsp; I recently changed the developer option to allow side loading of apps but it never worked (it was stuck on downloading patch or something like that)&nbsp; and I was unable to disable side loading.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to reboot in safe-mode and navigate to developer options and change it back to windows store only.&nbsp; After that windows update, store update, and installing new apps started working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see below none of my installed apps updated from 15-23 Aug until I was able to turn off Developer Mode.</p>

<h2>            Printers Disappear in &#34;Printers and Scanners&#34; after upgrading</h2>
                    <p>
1. Since last Windows 10 update 1803 all of my printers have stopped working. An <span>
HP&nbsp;development company LP 11/18/2017 7.0.1.1 driver</span> was also installed with this update.
<br />
2. When I try to print from an application a full list of printers appears. When I try to print, the printers indicate connecting to printer and then ready.&nbsp; And then the error message = Windows cannot print due to a problem in the current printer setup&nbsp; or
 we couldn't print because there doesn't seem to be a printer installed. <br />
3.&nbsp; "Settings/ Printers and Scanners" does not show any printers. When I try "Add a printer", no printers are detected.&nbsp; Using "the printer that I want isn't listed" I can find (and add a copy of) the HP printer.&nbsp; The copy of the HP printer then shows up in
 the application list of printers and in the "settings/printers and scanners".&nbsp; I can't print using the copy of the printer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
4.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; I cannot find the Microsoft Print to PDF printer in the Microsoft drivers list under the print to file option when using the "the printer that I want isn't listed". Running "optionalfeatures" indicates that the Microsoft Print to PDF is enabled&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
There is a restore point for the last update.&nbsp; Is that the option of least resistance or is there registry or other issue that is causing the problem.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Qualcomm Atheros Communications driver update for Bluetooth USB Adapter.</h2>
                    My Qualcomm Atheros Communications driver update for Bluetooth USB Adapter has not worked since I upgraded to Windows10. I have searched for a new driver, but continue to be told that there is none available at this time. No problems prior to this upgrade.

            Power failures are notorious for corrupting your NT File System (NTFS), so you need to boot into the XP Recovery Console and run chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; until it reports no errors (that may take more than one pass).&nbsp; You are on the right track though.<br />
<br />
If after burning your CD as indicated below, you do NOT see the message:
<p><b>Press any key to boot from CD...</b></p>
<p>Then you need to get into the BIOS in your system of unspecified make and model and adjust the device boot order to put the CD Drive as the first boot device.</p>
<p>If you see the same missing or corrupt message instead something is not right and you need to look at things more closely.&nbsp; Sometimes there is an option on the screen when the system reboots to press a key to select a boot device (mine is F11) and then you
 can just choose the CD/DVD drive as the boot device.<br />
</p>
<p>If anybody wants to recreate these sorts of problems for practice, just pull the plug on your running XP system 4 or 5 times and you will all the message we know and love.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<br />
Here are my standard suggestions:<br />
<br />
You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

I have an PH Pentium 4 running widows xp. I am trying to repair my system. I'm past my last point and
<br />
I got my computer to boot from the cd. Now I'm trying to us the Recovery Console but I'm now asked
<br />
for the Administrator password. I have tried leaving blank and lots of passwords which I use but none worked.<br />
<br />
Is there a way around this? If I can passed this problem I think I can get it fixed.

            What version of XP are you running (Home, Pro, MCE)?<br />
<br />
You can fix it, but if I tell you how, I will violate the Terms of Use of the forums regarding circumventing security.&nbsp; They have already banned me once and I am not through having fun with the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" yet so don't want
 to take any chances right now.<br />
<br />
However, you might have luck finding ideas by using a search engine (Google) regarding a lost or missing XP Administrator password.&nbsp;

            Hi Kelso.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) First try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Complex Wall Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ranger oz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Complex Wall Glitch</h2>
                    
<p>So I was playing a few games of Flood last night, and it came to my attention that in multiple games people were glitching into the wall, totally making it difficult for the game to end. They would glitch into the wall, where they can't get kills, but also
 are damn near impossible to be killed, and so the game time simply runs out or people start quitting, which totally ruins the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figured I would post this up and make people aware. It was very annoying and frustrating, and I think it needs to be fixed. Not sure if anything is already being done about it, but I didn't see anything on it so here it is!</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there hasn't been a single official word on this glitch, the grenade super-throw glitch, or the instant cool-down boltshot glitch. They also have said nothing about the custom game options. So far, 343 has done a pretty terrible job
 at winning me over. </p>

<h2>            Unable to login, Flashing screen after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Dell Studio 15 laptop. It had windows 7 installed previously. While I trying to upgrade to windows 10 today, it went good until the welcome screen appears. Once welcome screen is loaded, the screen started flashing &amp; I could not able to
 access any thing by doing anything like clicking or pressing any button combinations (Shift+restart/ctrl+alt+del/ anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I see is a flashing screen with fast access logo in the middle, date/time on left and battery/wifi on right bottom of the screen and nothing else. I don't see any restart button or anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through some forums for some solutions for similar problem. But I couldn't follow any of them as,</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am not able to access task manager</p>
<p>- I am not able to access windows button</p>
<p>- None of the buttons or mouse click works</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, I am not yet logged into Windows. I'm still got struck in login window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've frustrated a lot after doing an upgrade attempt. Will some one help me restore back my Windows 7? I may never go for Windows 10 again until a stable version comes out.</p>

<p>So with the new update (hate it) i can`t grant my son an allowance so he can get map packs. I tried to add my debit card to his account so he can buy them but it won`t let me. Just lets me add a code from a points card (no one near me sells them). How do
 i give him money? Thanks</p>

<p>As you've already found out, the only way to do it currently is via a prepaid card system.
</p>
<p>There are a number of reputable online retailers who sell them, and their delivery is normally very quick - that may be th best (and cheaper than buying via Microsoft way to do).

                    <p>Flight simulator game: instruments are not working correctly. Not used since end July. Have updates affected this and how can I correct it please?</p>
<p>Please note that I am not very computer technical. I can follow simple instructions but do not understand coding etc. I think possible an update of another thing may have affected it such as windows 10, VCL or Realteck High Definition Audio Driver - all
 these have updated since I last used it.</p>
<p>Has anyone got any advice please as the game is functional but the instruments are not accurate. Many thanks for any help you can give.</p>

<p>Which Flight Simulator are your referring to? &nbsp;Are these inaccurate instruments found on the Default aircraft or on third party purchased ones? &nbsp; What inaccuracies are you noticing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had any trouble with the instruments in FSX even with all the updates thrown at us. &nbsp;The only thing I've noticed is that the number 3 (when inputting into the radio panel) is a little discoloured: &nbsp;but nothing one cannot live with.</p>

<p>Hi Chriso, my name is Barbara and I posted the question on behalf of my son Christian who is away till Tuesday pm next week. He has been in touch with the following info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>•No problems existed last year. I am using the Baron.</p>
<p>• manifold pressure drops well below what it should. So much so when I set the aircraft up at 6000 feet (a normal cruise altitude) manifold pressure drops to zero (ISA conditions set)</p>
<p>• VSI and altimeter don't match up making a descent and instrument approach Impossible. Pitch the nose down to try and achieve a normal rate of descent causes airspeed to exceed it's normal range. Conversely it takes an age to climb even though VSI shows
 about 1000fpm.</p>
<p>• downloaded duchess, same problems.</p>
<p>• had a play with the g1000 baron and doesn't seem to have the same issue with climb, didn't check descent but will do</p>
<p>• has had a Windows update in the last year.</p>
<p>• have downloaded and reinstalled fsx. Problems remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are grateful for your input and hope this further info helps. Of course it will be better if yourself and Chris can communicate directly once he is home, but we could get no support from Microsoft and he needs to get it sorted as he uses it for actual
 pilot training and has some tests due. Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Hi Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll write this now so Chris can see it when he returns home. &nbsp; Microsoft won't be able to help with this type of problem; he would be better off joining an Aircraft Simulator Forum (of which there are many) to post his questions there. &nbsp; There may be others
 on those Forums who could identify and help sort this out. &nbsp;However, I shall try to assist here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Chris is using a third party (purchased) Beechcraft Baron, then he would need to approach the Support section that the aircraft developer provides as any problems, such as he is experiencing, will need to be addressed by them, or by others having such
 issues with this aircraft type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If he is however, using the Beechcraft aircraft options from FSX itself, then these issues can arise from either a corrupted file pertaining to this aircraft or, as he has suggested, maybe a download that has somehow affected this aircraft's performance.
 &nbsp;Since he has not had this problem last year (and he knows what he is doing as he is a student pilot), it appears likely that something outside of FSX has caused these problems. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test, I took a flight in the default Baron, and replicated his situation (level flight at 6000 ft, cruise speed of 140 kts), and I had a manifold pressure reading of 17 inHg. &nbsp;This was purely a default flight, standard baro. pressure of 29.92 inHg,
 and no special weather applied. &nbsp;Does he get similar readings with the Glass cockpit Baron, which may appear to behave better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>His descent and climb rate mismatch are other issues. &nbsp; I know with light or GA aircraft, it is normal to point the nose down to both maintain speed and descent attitude. &nbsp; Unlike airliners, where generally descent rate is achieved by lowering airspeed.
 &nbsp;If the nose needs to be lowered to maintain proper descent profile, this may require lowering airspeed to compensate. &nbsp; Re: &nbsp;climb rate. &nbsp; Again, factors such as fuel load, payload and wind speed and direction would affect ROC. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, if clearly his aircraft is not performing as it should, and re installation of FSX has not sorted out the problem, he could try to restore his system to an earlier time (if he has a Restore Point that would go that far back), thereby eliminating
 any download that may have caused these problems. &nbsp; If he can't find an old Restore Point, he could physically go through his offending Windows/Other updates and uninstall them and re-boot his computer. &nbsp;Then before re-downloading those updates, he would need
 to check his aircraft performance each time, so as to isolate the offending update. &nbsp; A long and slow process for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the type of problems he's having are better dealt with at a Developer or a Flight Simulator Forum level. This Community Forum, is essentially here to deal with problems with MS Operating Systems and MS or other software that aren't working well
 together. &nbsp;If his FSX has been installed without problems, then any matters arising from within FSX should be dealt with by others. &nbsp; Hope this will point him in a positive direction.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Chris.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just returned and had chance to play around with it properly. The same problem with manifold pressure exists with the G1000 Baron; i only use the default aircraft. The problem doesn't seem so apparent on the duchess add on that I recently purchased
 but their is a definite problem regarding the relation of all the pressure instruments in the climb and descent and affects most aircraft that I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your time and thought in offering viable solutions is enormously appreciated: thank you. I shall try to restore a previous version of windows as suggested and then get onto the forums. Hopefully I can find a fix for this problem and crack on with the important
 stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>

<p>Christian, just giving you a link to an old post (using FS9 - for his CPL lessons in that Sim) in Avsim. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>May not be an identical problem as you are having (he's trying to maintain 25 in Hg in climb profile). &nbsp;I think his answer ultimately was to stay at a lower altitude to maintain a higher MP reading until you are able to climb higher. &nbsp;Of course, mixture
 settings are also important here: &nbsp;you would know this already. &nbsp; Not sure what your MP readings are at the various V speeds and then in climb. &nbsp;So hope you can gain some help here:</p>

Alright so I just got my computer back from a friend who fixed up my computer after getting a virus. Haven't had it for but a few days now, and the computer started to say I was getting viruses. I'm assuming when I got the computer back the virusware was not
 installed? Regardless it was telling me I need to download Windows 7 2012 anti-virus ware or something. Instead I downloaded AVG anti-virus ware because it is free. I restart my computer to finalize the AVG and when it loads back up I receive a blue screen
 reading as follows:<br />
<br />
A problem has been dected and windows has been shutdown to prevent damage to your computer.<br />
<br />

<br />
If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Check to make sure and new hardware or software is properly installed .<br />
If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need.<br />
<br />
If problem continues, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory option such as caching or shadowing.
<br />
If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced startup options, and then select Safe MODE.<br />

<h2>            Monitor zoomed in in HDMI cannot adkust</h2>
                    Device is Samsung 2494 connected via HDMI.&nbsp; Monitor display is zoomed in so that windows in full screen are cut off at top and bottom.&nbsp; This makes it impossible to close or minimize windows.&nbsp; Also the bottom task bar is cut off on the ends losing the rightmost
 and leftmost icons.

    <title>Windows 10 Home - Lenovo Keyboard Lag issue&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidly647  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home - Lenovo Keyboard Lag issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I recently purchased a Lenovo Y700 laptop with Windows 10 Home installed on it. I immediately noticed a problem regarding the trackpad lagging when I'm toggling (alt+tab) through windows: the
<strong>cursor will freeze</strong> (can't left, or right click either) for about 0.3 or 0.4 seconds before it begins moving again. Here's a brief summary in point form:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Causes that result in trackpad freezing temporarily:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- ALT+TAB originally&nbsp;</p>
<p>- CTRL+V, CTRL+C</p>
<p>- hitting just about 95% of the keys on the keyboard (excluding CTRL, ALT, Windows, Fn, or Menu)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting:</p>
<p>- the problem does not occur when using laptop keboard + an external mouse</p>
<p>- the problem does not occur when using an external keyboard + trackpad</p>
<p>- the problem does not occur when using external keyboard and external mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) All drivers (seemingly) are up to date, and I had a Lenovo tech support agent go through remotely to update the drivers as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced such issues and managed to resolve it? I don't want to have to send this laptop back in for a replacement (it's only 10 days old)</p>

<p>Hi Andre, thanks for the quick response. I found the solution from the manufacturer's website actually. It was an issue with the Synaptics drivers for my touchpad. I had to disable some Palm Check sensitivity, which I had read about a few days ago, but could
 not find the option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is resolved now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Suddenly my windows search is behaving weirdly , I am on 1607 (Build 14393.447) .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search results is not showing up newly installed applications , for e.g I installed Firefox, slack , but when I click on Start key and type Slack , it does not showsup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I had Cortana disable few days back. So I was thinking this might be the reason. So I went ahead and enabled Cortana back by running the below command in elevated powershell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also tried rebuilding Indexes, changing index location, etc but still the same issue. Though old apps search is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried creating some text files under a index path and they are getting searched fine. Please help me resolving this issue as this is frustrating to open up applications.</p>

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.

<h2>            I went to play a DVD on my computer tonight and got this msg&#58;  Windows Media Player cannot play the DVD because a compatible DVD decoder is not installed on your computer.</h2>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I went to play a DVD on my computer tonight and got this msg:&nbsp; Windows Media Player cannot play the DVD because a compatible DVD decoder is not installed on your computer.&nbsp;
<br />
I played DVDs on my computer a few weeks ago. Would like to know what is going on. Any ideas/suggestions???&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I tried to play one of the same DVDs I have played previously... same message.&nbsp; Nothing to my knowledge has been removed from my computer and I am the only one with access... 'very confused.<br />
<br />
Thanks if anyone can help.<br />

<p>Yes and if you install the utility you will see all the Decoders on your system.</p>
<p>Also the utility will tell you if a Decoder is compatible or not.</p>
<p>Are you using Media Player&nbsp;version 10 or 11 ?</p>
</blockquote>
the utility tells me I have no decoder... only thing I can think is if I actually deleted it... I rarely remove anything because I don't add a lot of things... but it is possible a few weeks ago I did get rid of a few things (I am pretty cautious because I
 am no expert).&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the Media Player version 11 I was trying to use...&nbsp; but I now reloaded 10 to see if there was something update- related that messed things up.<br />
<br />
because I successfully used the VLC player, I haven't yet tried Windows Media Player again (since reloading WMP and loading the codec pack.)<br />
<br />
So great to have the input of someone who knows what he is doing.&nbsp; Thanks again. I will try the Windows Media Player again later and see if I have its use back again.<br />
<br />
Have a great day!<br />
