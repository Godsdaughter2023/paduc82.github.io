            <p>Hi there!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sorry you're having issues with your network adapter. Does the X&nbsp;work on wireless still?&nbsp;Can you plug a laptop or another device into the Ethernet cable to ensure it's working with that, and not a closed port or bad cable? If you find it's working with a laptop or other wired network device using the same cable and port, I would suggest unplugging your Xbox One X from the wall, power cycling your router and/or switch, then powering the One X back up. Sometimes routers and switches shut off ports if it detects a network storm or collision, and it could temporarily&nbsp;block a MAC.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Post back and let us know!</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker Preview Black - Audio good until I change speed</h2>
                    <div>I have Windows 7. The movie maker preview screen is black, but the audio is good. I can see the thumbnails but not the preview of the actual clip. I “published” a video and everything was there (except I couldn't actually edit it since I couldn't
 see anything to edit). I put in another video to play with the speed of the audio and I lost the sound after speeding it up and slowing it down. When I “published” it with the adjusted speed, the audio was completely lost but the video was still there. &nbsp;I
 have checked the video card software and it is up to date. There are no updates in Windows Update either.</div>

            I have done all of these things and yet I am still having a black screen with Movie Maker. I put a picture in the timeline and nothing happens. I hit play and it will run through the video but I see nothing. I insert a video and I can hear the sound but
 I can't see it.
<div><br />
<div>So it's not the video software. The Windows Live Essentials is up to date. I am not using unsupported files because last I checked .jpg and .wmv files were the first listed supported files of each category. I ran the Microsoft FixIt tool and it came up
 with nothing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do hope that you have something else for me to try.</div>

            It sounds like your video driver is out of date.&nbsp; Open the Run dialog (Start menu, or Windows+R) and type
<strong>dxdiag </strong>then press Enter.&nbsp; That will run the DirectX Diagnostics.&nbsp; Go to the Display tab to figure out the make/model of your graphics card or chip.&nbsp; Common GPUs are made by Intel, NVidia and AMD/ATI.&nbsp; Go to the manufacturer's website and find
 a utility for updating your graphics driver to the latest.

    <title>cannot boot up windows 7 home pre first, then ends up could not - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            cannot boot up windows 7 home pre first, then ends up could not reinstall windows 7 by using the DVD</h2>
                    <p>I could not boot up windows 7 home premium on acer aspire 7715 laptop on July 8 (on July 7th everything worked fine), getting a black screen with white cursor on it, not able to reach the logon screen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so I tried:<br />
1. startup repair--did not detect any problem.<br />
2. F8 choose safe mode or last known good configuration--getting error "no bootable device", I put in the windows 7 DVD, nothing happened.<br />
3. System restore to June 28-- it says "system resotre finished" but it won't reboot the pc by itself. I manually shut down then turn on the pc. still not able to start up normally but able to boot into safe mode with networking. i managed backing up some files
 but pc running very slow in safe mode.<br />
4. clean install windows 7 home premium by using 64 bit DVD--it successfully copying and expanding windows files but it stucked at "Completing installation" page for more than 8 hours. then i manually shut down the pc.<br />
5. using the recovery partition to restore the laptop to factory default-- it stucks at 2% then getting error 0X45d<br />
"Restore failed - error code= 0x45d (WIMApply Image cannot apply image. the request Could not be performed because of an I/O device error"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>right now when I start up the laptop, getting windows boot manager error "windows failed to start.a recent hardware or software change might be the cause..."<br />
File: \windows\system32\winload.exe<br />
status: 0xc000000f<br />
info: the selected entry could not be loaded because the application is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kinda run out of options. then i tried reinstall windows 7 home premium again by using the 32 bit DVD. it stucked at "expanding windows files 21%" for more than 6 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called Acer who says it is a windows issue but why can I reinstall windows 7? is this a Hard drive issue? Thank you very much.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Event 17 Error on Coming Out of Sleep. Slow Resumption of Contact with Mouse</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have a Dell XPS 1330 laptop running Vista Home Premium 32bit which was purchased about three months ago. Ever since I’ve had the laptop, I’ve had ongoing problems
 with losing BT connectivity with an MS mouse &amp; keyboard when the laptop comes out of sleep mode. It is fitted with the internal Dell 355 plus EDR BT card. &nbsp;BT driver v.6.0.6001.18064 is installed.</span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;After&nbsp;multiple driver reinstalls, two re-installations of the operating system &amp; two replacement BT cards – I still have the Dell 355 plus EDR , the problem has
 reduced to an irritation &nbsp;level. After the second BT card replacement, when the laptop comes out of sleep mode, there is a delay of about 35 seconds before the mouse works &amp; there is an error - event ID 17 logged in the Event Viewer: “The local Bluetooth radio
 has failed in an undetermined manner and will be unloaded”. The event does not occur if the laptop comes out of hibernation mode. Occasionally the mouse will not resume operation &amp; then I have to use the wireless on/ off switch to re-activate the BT card.</span>
</p>
<p><span>I’ve tried un-checking the "Allow Computer to shut of this device to save power” option but no help. I currently have no&nbsp; Nokia software installed as I understand&nbsp;that
 this can be associated&nbsp;with Bluetooth connection problems.</span> </p>

<p><span>Hello Stuggy,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you reinstall the drivers for this device are they installed correctly when viewed in Device Manager? Does the device have
 a yellow question mark or red exclamation next to it? If it does this would indicate a problem with the driver itself. It seems as though you may have already tried this option to check the driver installation but I wanted to cover all of the bases.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there a possibility of an updated driver from the manufacturer for that piece of hardware? Are there any support documents
 from the manufacturer regarding this problem?<br />
</span></p>
Are you still receiving this error when using a different bluetooth device?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I could find about&nbsp;this game, it is compatible&nbsp;with Windows XP and previous versions.&nbsp; If you have not tried the Windows 7
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/windows-xp-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
XP Mode</a> then you may want to install that and then try running the game within XP Mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If that doesn't work you may want to check with <a href="http://support.ea.com/cgi-bin/ea.cfg/php/enduser/home.php?p_li=&amp;p_sid=WFu63DMj&amp;p_sp=&amp;p_faqid=0&amp;p_iid=0&amp;p_created=&amp;p_prod=&amp;p_cat=&amp;p_cv=&amp;p_pv=&amp;p_prods=&amp;p_cats=&amp;prod_lvl1=&amp;prod_lvl2=&amp;prod_lvl3=&amp;cat_lvl1=&amp;cat_lvl2=&amp;cat_lvl3=&amp;p_hidden_prods=&amp;p_search_text=&amp;p_new_search=&amp;p_accessibility=&amp;p_page=&amp;p_lva=&amp;nextlink=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

I told him to **** off and proceeded to continue and I blocked him. He then went on to go though and like everything single thing I’ve ever done giving me 76 notifications which I have proof of and went onto a different account to message me. He reported me and got me com banned for two weeks even though he harassed me way worse and started the entire thing. Swearing isn’t always worse than pure harassment.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
First make sure the hard drive is first in the boot order.<br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as it boots - set the hard driver to first in the boot order.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
Restore boot manager when it is missing or compressed <br />

The DMI issue is caused by hardware so you may have to contact the System Maker or Motherboard Maker's<br />
Support or a real computer shop (one that does its own in-house servicing.<br />

    <title>Some Apps Not working After Windows Store went Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fibrofrogs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some Apps Not working After Windows Store went Missing</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I went to bed I came back and the store was missing i found a link to an app online in my web browser which made the store open up and reinstall itself but now the solitaire and photo app that come with windows ten both wont work.
</p>
<p>I had a similar issue the other day and Contacted Microsoft tech Support, The Microsoft Tech Suppprt helped me but he had to make a whole new user profile and then import things from one profile to the other.
</p>
<p>He said my user profile was corrupted. It worked fine for 24 hours now I come back to pc this am and the same issue is back as i said the store went missing and now several apps wont uninstall or work.
</p>
<p>I have tried the power shell method of uninstalling apps &nbsp;but it just makes errors which is what it did before the tech made a new profile.</p>
<p>I have run the trouble Shooter for the apps. Just about every solution given in these forums and none have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to know is how is my profile getting corrupted so easily that it breaks the apps and when I am not even at the computer.
</p>
<p>This is ridiculous and unacceptable that the apps break the store and or corrupt profiles so easily or when away from computer.</p>
<p>My educated guess would be since the computer is on and the apps get news etc from the internet something goes wrong when I am away and something gets corrupted in my user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a solution to put these apps back in working order with out me having to contact tech to spend 5 hours redoing a profile and 8 more to put everything back the way it is please please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Please fix with a patch asap and put our apps back in working order and fix the user profiles. I cannot afford to spend hours remaking profiles and I certainly cannot afford to lose data doing a reformat to do a fresh install. I have never ever
 had so many problems with an operating system as Windows 10.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this without it being a nightmare? I want to use the new apps please. Right now I am for sure the photo and the solitaire are broken and missing off the live tiles and start menu. They cannot be uninstalled nor reinstalled. HELP</p>

            Hi Fibrofrogs,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I appreciate your interest in windows 10. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will certainly help you with this.<br />
<br />
I need more information about this issue so that I can assist you better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. What is the make and model of your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. What happen when you try to use app?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>This issue could have occurred due to corrupt system files .<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to Follow the below methods to fix issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1. Try to clearing the Store Cache:<br />
</strong><br />
a) Press the Windows key + R keys.<br />
b) In the Run window, type WSReset.exe and click “Ok”.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2. Try to Run SFC Scan and DISM Tool .</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Run System File Checker to see if any corrupt system files.
<br />
Follow the steps.<br />
<br />
a) Type “cmd” on the Start screen.<br />
b) Right-click on it and select Run as administrator.<br />
c) Type the following command and press Enter: SFC /scannow</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Disclaimer :</strong> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Repair damaged Windows files: </strong></p>
<div>Run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool which fixes the Windows corruption error if there are any. Follow the steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;Press Windows+X.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click on Command Prompt (Admin).<br />
3.&nbsp;Type the command DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth and hit Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong> <strong>Re-register Windows Store .</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to Re-register Windows Store by running the following commands in a CMD window started as Administrator:
<div>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted </div>
<div>$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.<br />

            <p>None of the above worked. The store is working fine but some of the default apps vanish when you click on them from the start menu and the live tiles. I used the uninstall commands for the broken apps now when I go to the store and the update runs I get
 updates for a bunch of apps and non really update they all give this error code&nbsp;0x8007003</p>
<p>Please look up my accounts and see notes by your tech support Jan M at&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
<p>My computer is built from a local computer shop. So there is no make and model number to give you. Jan M has all my specs looked them over and said all was fine with the hard ware so that is not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening is your apps and live tiles are somehow corrupting my user profile. Then they don't Work in this case I had finished putting all my stuff after 5 hours with your tech support desk tech Jan M. He had to create a new profile and copy all
 of my things over to new profile to fix the apps doing this error code. I then spent 8 More hours putting my icons back on my task bar and re installing antivirus and a couple other things that did not transfer over.</p>
<p>All was running beautifully &nbsp;all day after this Windows 10 ran great. I went to bed and when I got up the next morning the windows store was missing and so were the photo app, solitaire and a couple others. So i used the commands mentioned in the forums
 and I got red errors in power shell. I then read someone had to go to a link to an app in their web browser and this made the windows store open up to install the app. So I tried it and low and behold the windows store opened up and reinstalled itself. So
 I was able to get the store back. Then it wanted to update and download apps that are working fine all over again but keeps giving the 0x8007003 Error code.</p>
<p>So Just to test things out while waiting for you to reply I added another user profile to my pc. When I logged into it windows 10 set it self up and low and behold everything is fine with the apps and store on that profile.</p>
<p>So I logged back into mine and it is still broke. I removed the extra profile as it has none of my settings. This shows that while i was sleeping my windows store and apps problem again corrupted my user profile.</p>
<p>I cannot afford the time to keep making profiles and copying all of my stuff from one profile over to fix this. Not to mention I do not know how to migrate from one profile to another like that Jan M did it for me during that 5 hours of support.</p>
<p>So now I have the store back but some default apps like photo etc are here but when you click on them they turn invisible or vanish from the start menu and live tiles.
<strong>None of your solutions mentioned have done anything for this issue and error code. &nbsp;Oh and doing your solutions broke more of the apps now the people app dont work, the phone companion and a whole slew of other default apps and all try to reinstall
 in the store, except the people app and still give the error code lsited above. </strong>
All you did was make my problem worse!</p>
<p>I cannot afford the time to reformat my computer either but I am starting to feel like I will have no choice unless you fix the way the user profiles and apps and live tiles are interacting. A patch is needed!</p>
<p>HELP!<br />
</p>
<p><strong>It just occurred to me how my profile is getting corrupted when i am sleeping, the store is updating and reinstalling the apps even ones that are just fine and once it tries to reinstall the app it then breaks it! It is the store breaking my profile!
 Please find a way to fix this I cannot do another 13 hour stint fixing it! Want to know how I figured it out? I Left my pc and when I came back I heard the hard drive working hard like something was installing so I used task manager to see what was running
 so much and it was the windows store so I opened it and there it was it had downloaded updates of apps after I did the code you gave and it was reinstalling apps that were working just fine after it did each app it then broke them! You guys need to fix the
 store reinstalling apps on top of apps its corrupting the profile OMG!</strong></p>

            <p>Wanted to make one last post about this shortly after I reported this a new patch came out on 8/28 that proved i was indeed right now we can shut off the automatic updating of apps in the store. My advice is to do this pronto. In the end I had to further
 contact Microsoft tech Desk and they did a repair upgrade of my system. The suggestions made here were not helpful and further corrupted my install of Windows 10. Although I finally now have a great working Windows 10 with out having my hard drive reformatted
 this was nuts!</p>
<p>If your apps go missing, do not work or the store wont work do not I repeat do not try the codes in powershell that are provided in these forums. You will end up further corrupting things. I guess that is why Contact support is built right into our start
 menu now. My advice if these problems happen to you click on start click all programs and find the built in contact support button! Instead of umpteen hours it took a mere 2 hours for help desk to repair compared to scouring the forums for hours and using
 powershell codes that may or may not work that may or may not corrupt your Windows 10 install.</p>
<p>Lets hope for more updates sooner than later because had I had the shut off apps from automatically updating I think I just might have survived Windows 10 &lt;Grin&gt;</p>
<p>The tech desk support was excellent, friendly etc hope it stays free until all these bugs are squashed. If it doesn't might be worth the price over the headache unless you have many hard drives and a reformat is a breeze ;)</p>

 cannot find the file specified. When I search on my computer for anything with "ASInsHelp" in the title it takes me to an application extension file in a folder under Asus called PC Prove II. PC probe II is a program I tried to install but was unable to due
 so because my mobo did not support it.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue? <br />
<br />
2. What happens when you tried to install PC probe II? Do you get any error messages?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Uninstalling Asus software suite might not help here because Asinshelp.sys is a driver which runs the software to work during the startup. If you have uninstalled any Asus product from the computer, I would suggest you to reinstall and check with the issue.
 Meanwhile, let’s go ahead and perform few steps to resolve the issue. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
<div>Run the <strong>Fixit </strong>provided in the article: <br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 1: Safe mode</strong><br />
<div>Boot your computer in safe mode and check for the issue.<br />

<div><strong>Step 2: Clean boot</strong><br />
<div>If you do not face the issue in safe mode, then put your computer in clean boot and check for the issue.<br />

<div><br />
Note: Once you are done with clean boot, please follow step 7 in the article to put your computer back to normal startup.<br />
<div><strong>Method 3: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perform an <strong>SFC </strong>scan on your computer. Refer to the following link:<br />

<h2>            Links take a long time to load</h2>
                    <p>I just reinstalled windows 10 and ever since any link I try to open takes a long time to load, during this time the program I opened the link from will freeze until the link opens in my browser around 30 seconds after I clicked it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using internet explorer instead of my default browser (chrome) and I also tried opening links in different programs and the same thing happens, so I think it's an issue with windows.</p>

<h2>            E&#58; Drive not working after upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from windows 8 to 8.1 and now my DVD RAM GT80N is not reading CDs on my laptop. I used it the other day and it worked. Now it won't. I checked the device manager and it says in the status menu that the drive is working properly, but it is not.&nbsp;I
 have tried all CDs that I have; even the ones I used the other day. There is a message 'no CD in the E: drive in windows media player, even with CD inserted in the drive. What could have gone wrong. Can someone please rescue me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you all for your advice.</p>

</p><p>The make and model of my computer is HP Pavillion G6 notebook.</p>

</p><p>I have tried <strong>'all of the above'</strong> and no way. It is really weird. My next move is to take it to a repair shop and see if the drive can be changed; maybe it is just a coincident that the drive 'go wacked' after the upgrade to 8.1.</p>

<p>Are you sure that it is still that letter?&nbsp; What does&nbsp; diskmgmt.msc&nbsp; show?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. one possibility that it could be is having another device plugged in which is looking like a CD drive with no media loaded in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you could probably go into the BIOS&nbsp;settings and confirm that your CD drive is showing there.&nbsp; Or try booting something else and see if it detects your CD drive.&nbsp; Etc.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Thumbnails Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irvineboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Thumbnails Issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with video thumbnails on my Asus Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp; This is a brand new laptop.&nbsp; All MOV files, that I transfer from my iphone to my laptop are NOT showing thumbnail previews.&nbsp; I have deleted the thumbnails cache but that does not solve
 the issue.&nbsp; Other video files like AVI and MPG and MP4, are all random.&nbsp; Some MPG/AVI/MP4 video files will show thumbnail preview and others will not.&nbsp; So I don't know if the file thumbnail setting is corrupt.&nbsp; The videos will play when I click on them so
 the videos themselves do work.&nbsp; It is the thumbnails that won't show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried taking these video files to my other Lenovo Windows 10 laptop to test them out, and the thumbnails work.&nbsp; So the video files are good.&nbsp; It is some sort of issue on my Asus Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp; I am not sure what to do.&nbsp; The Lenovo Windows 10 works
 with these video thumbnails.&nbsp; It is the Asus Windows 10 (new laptop) that won't work with displaying video thumbnails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted on forums but no one seems to know.&nbsp; Please help!!!!!!!!</p>

    <title>Surface Book enters sleep mode by slow two-finger scroll in Chrome - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book enters sleep mode by slow two-finger scroll in Chrome</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>for some days now my Surface Book enters Sleep Mode whenever I slowly two-finger scroll up or down in Chrome using the trackpad. It does not happen if i scroll really fast (fast finger movement) or use the touchscreen, and it only happens in Chrome (tried
 scrolling down a pdf - no problems there). I can wake up my book in a few seconds and no data gets lost, but it is still very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does someone experience the same issue and knows what to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thankful for every information.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just cant say for sure what exactly solved it...</p>
<p>I uninstalled Chrome and restarted my Computer, which he used to install some updates. One of those two actions solved the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strangely I cannot see the update that just got installed in my update history and after the restart he told me "updates couldnt be installed correctly" (or something like that) but searching for updates now tells me I am up to date. The last entry in my
 update history is dated 09. August, but he definitely updated just now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well nevermind, the issue is solved, scrolling works fine again in Chrome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My Dell Inspiron 15R keeps on freezing after 15-30 minutes&#63;</h2>
                    <b>I got a Dell Inspiron 15R a couple of months ago and currently it keeps freezing after about 15 - 30 minutes. I can't do anything while it's frozen not even Ctr + Alt + Delete or move my mouse. This is getting really frustrating as I always have to
 manually shut down my laptop. I have scanned with both Malwarebytes and Eset Security but Malware bytes found nothing and I am never able to complete the scan with Eset as my laptop freezes during that time. I did check the logs that Eset had made from my
 last scan and it said it removed 5 threats it found but my laptop keeps freezing still. I have also tried the automatic "Microsoft Let Me Fixit" but it couldn't find anything. Please help I need a answer because I can't deal with this anymore!!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h3> jard9911  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS explorer long delay after right click</h2>
                    <p>I am running Win10 and have a problem with a long delay after I open some directories and right click an entry.
</p>
<p>It takes ~15-30 seconds to open the dialog box. But once it has opened it, a right click on subsequent files opens immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem seems to be on rarely used directories, or directories that I have never opened before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started having the problem about 1-2 years ago after I had some problems on Windows 7. I can't remember the exact nature of the problem, I think it was a corrupted drive or Windows.&nbsp; I believe I had to run chkdsk and/or do a Windows 7 recovery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might go away after upgrading to Win10 but it didn't. I have tried several things like indexing the drive etc. but the problem remains.

    <title>Changing the email address on my Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changing the email address on my Account</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change the email address on my account in Win10 as my current email address is already deactivated. I can access the section where I am asked to insert a new alias email address. However when I insert my gmail address, I am told "<span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">This
 email address is already taken. Please try another one."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I've
 checked and I don't have the email address presently listed as an alias. I may have had other accounts in the past where my gmail address may have been used. How do I go about checking as to where this gmail address may have been previously used?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>Dear Sayan and colleagues</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem (it would seem) as Cassim but your response has not helped me (I leave it to Cassim to speak for himself). &nbsp;The gmail address I wish to use to replace the now defunct address previously used as my primary Microsoft acount is my logical
 email address to use, it having been mine for very many years (and though little used in the past is now my everyday address and highly likely to continue as such). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have registered that email address as an alias (in the Microsoft given understanding (at the page that the link you provided takes one to) that I could later elevate it to my primary address.</p>
<p>I have waited the suddenly (Microsoft) announced waiting period that it would take for this alias to take effect and have received the (Microsoft) generated message to say that my waiting period is now over ... but ...</p>
<p>When I proceed to my Microsoft account (still using the now defunct primary (login) address to get access) I find that the newly registered alias address IS NOT listed.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I try to register it again only to now get the message&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"</span><span>This email address is already taken. Please try another one.</span>" &nbsp;It would seem that Microsoft
 has now hijacked my preferred email address and refuses to allow me to use it as an alias, far less my primary address. &nbsp;I don't want to use another. &nbsp;Microsoft has no explained right to force me to and the most logical address for me to use is this gmail
 address. &nbsp;I have re-entered my Microsoft account several times but the situation remains the same .... my newly registered alias is not displayed as available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grateful for some explanation as to why this is the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not redirect me to Microsoft support standard articles as I researched them extensively before coming to you (the EXPERTs) for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, Peter</p>

<p>After three months of frustration, this is what I have learned about trying to "Create a new email address and add it as an alias" @outlook.com to existing account.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is specific to trying to merge one outlook account (or email address at least) with another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error message returned "This email address is already taken. Please try another."<br />
</p>
<p>"You cannot add an alias that is already associated with another Microsoft account. Aliases cannot be used to share information between two Microsoft accounts.&nbsp;Existing @hotmail.com, @live.com, Outlook.com, and @msn.com addresses can't be added as aliases."
 Source: support.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first you have to close one account before you&nbsp;can add it to the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"When you tap or click the Mark account for closure button, we wait 60 days before permanently deleting your Microsoft account in case you change your mind or need to access something on the account before it’s gone forever." Source: support.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then have to wait another year (!) before you can reuse it. Source: chat with MS Support</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you want to merge two MS account email address into one account, you have to wait 60+365=425 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't&nbsp;shoot the messenger.</p>

                    <p>I own an HP laptop which came with win 8 pre-installed 64-bit with a recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as everybody i upgraded to win 8.1 through windows store and everything is good... till now..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem and I need to reset my windows (meaning to refresh my PC and not reset it to factory settings)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I enter the windows recovery environment and choose to refresh my PC and I choose win 8.1, BUT IT IS NOT DONE BECAUSE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"the drive where windows is installed is locked, please unlock it and retry later".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all solutions out on the net, but none had worked...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix it microsoft without the need to reset all my PC.</p>

<h3> eyedeetentee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot adjust microphone level</h2>
                    <p>What's the deal? It was just fine a couple days ago. No I haven't changed anything. I haven't even let Windows Update run without my permission. It has been updated, but that was weeks ago. This happened before back when Win10 was released. I didn't do anything
 to change it then.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01f321d0-fd63-426d-a958-bcf579f3e4c0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01f321d0-fd63-426d-a958-bcf579f3e4c0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have already done all the generic troubleshooting. I know that Windows 10 has issues with microphone settings, which is really ridiculous.</p>

            Hi EyeDee.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Since you've tried all of the fixes, what I'd do next is report  this to Microsoft using the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />Just in case you missed any, here is everything I have for Mic issues:
<br /> 
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try these fixes next:  
<br /><a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br /><a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recognize-headphones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recog...</a>
<br />
<br />Some report that what worked is turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt;  Change Settings Currently Unavailable &gt; uncheck the box for Fast Startup, Save Settings.  Restart and then disable Hibernate file to clear it, restart PC again and enable Hibernate again:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hiberna...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
