            <p>Hello CindyIkundo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;for posting in the community regarding downloading&nbsp;movies to your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To move files between PC and phone there are various options. You can simply use file explorer. Also, depending on your Windows version you might be asked to install Windows phone app for desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More options for syncronizations files between PC and phoine can be foud here:

http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp8/basics/sync-my-windows-phone</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you can use built in app called Music+Videos to rent or buy movies and download or stream them to your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if that helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows management in Excel 365</h2>
                    I do not understand why each workbook opens in a separate window - the desktop gets totally messy with workbooks that float around and with no easy way to switch between them. Have I missed something? Cannot see anywhere under options to have all workbooks
 within the same container.

            I assume this means that if you have for example 10 workbooks open, then you have 10 windows more or less randomly floating around among all other windows? What I simply do not understand is if there is no way to hold all these workbooks within a single
 container "Excel" to be able to switch to non-excel windows without a lot of mess.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may cascade the Excel windows from View tab as mentioned in above post. And combine the Excel file task bar icon to one tab. To do so,
</span><strong><span>Control Panel&gt;
</span></strong><span><span><strong>Taskbar and Navigation&gt; Taskbar&gt; Buttons on other taskbars
</strong></span><span>and select <strong>Never combine.
</strong></span>Unfortunately you cannot put all Excel file into single container as per your description.</span></span></p>

<h2>            OneNote 2013 Free Manual Install</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me two days to manually install OneNote 2013 Free manually so I wanted to share the steps. I had to install manually as the installer was blocked from the proxy, and I didn't want to ask to have it unblocked. The installer is not clever enough continue
 when this is the case, so I went through a lot of troubleshooting and not all credit is given where due.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to get a copy of installed files from a working machine! This is normally in c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have an Office 2013 application, run the cleaner O15CTRRemove.diagcab , then reboot.</p>
<p>You will want to enable logging to see the error messages in the %temp% directory, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/223300/en-au</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">What do to</p>

<li>Copy the files from your working machine, everything in the "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15" folder. Copy this to your destination machine.</li><li>Copy the registry settings from your working machine, everything from:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0<br />
Import these to your destination machine.</li><li>Expand out the following key and delete the entry for<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Internet\WebServiceCache\AllUsers\office15client.microsoft.com\config15--lcid=1033&amp;syslcid=3081&amp;uilcid=1033&amp;build=15.0.4569&amp;crev=1\0</li></ol>
<p>Keep running the installer&nbsp;setuponenotefreeretail.x86.en-us_.exe (or use the 64bit version if you have Office 64bit already installed) and check the %temp% folder for the latest log until it fully installs. It's usually called &lt;Computername&gt;-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;####?&gt;.log

                    I would like to Flag a Message and set a day, like tomorrow or even a certain date. But the Ribbon gives me one Flag only. And I can't customize the Ribbon either. The Flags I'd like to use are shown grey only. A reset of the Ribbon doesn't work either.
 What can I do?

            I did find my answer myself. I could not change it in massage view. But after I have set the Follow up Flag, the Flags are showing up, changing to the Task view. :-)

            <p>I suggest that you have a look at the following functions and see which one suits your purpose. You will probably need to use one of them in conjunction with the sum function in the horizontal formula and then it should not be needed in the vertical formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ROUND</p>
<p>ROUNDUP</p>
<p>ROUNDDOWN</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example. The following will round&nbsp;the summed value to&nbsp;the nearest 2 decimal places.&nbsp; Similar for the other 2 functions but rounds up or down in lieu of nearest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =ROUND(SUM(A2:D2),2)&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Stop text wrapping in Outlook 2010 Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachelhubbard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop text wrapping in Outlook 2010 Calendar</h2>
                    When printing my monthly view calendar in Outlook 2010, it has always kept appointments to one line and cut off the rest. All of the sudden today, it began wrapping the text of appointments onto multiple lines and now includes the location of appointments
 in parentheses.&nbsp; In the monthly calendar view, it shows only one line of text, but when I go to Print the calendar in monthly view, it shows &amp; prints all the lines of text. How do I change this back to the old way of single line appointments?

            I opened outlook in Safe mode but the calendar still prints appointments with text wrapping. When I look at the monthly calendar view, it doesn't show the text wrapping. But when I go to file print, it then shows the wrapping and prints it that way.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thats what I am saying, there are only two emails for that day listed in the 'Recover Deleted items' pop up box. All the items that were deleted today were from the 7th and they are NOT in the 'recover deleted items' box when they clearly should be!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are emails that are only 10 days old NOT in the 'recover deleted items' pop up box?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't check hotmail all the time and yeah every time I get a new email from an address not in my contacts list it automatically gets put through to junk! This means I have effectively two inboxes! Oh, and the 'block email address' function doesnt seem
 to work either!</p>

</p><p>I can easily scroll down anyway to the emails that were dated the 7th there are only 2 from that date (as I have already said)&nbsp; but NOT the ones I am looking for!</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are about 5 emails that were only removed from Junk today and only date from the 7th of September so surely they should have been put in 'Recover Deleted items' immediately? It seems they have not!</p>

            <p>When you searched by date&nbsp;using the search-mechanism in Recover deleted items, did you use
<strong>9/07</strong> or <strong>09/15/2016 </strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Fri 9/16.</strong> The reason I belabor this nonsense is because the mechanism seems to prefer different search-parameters depending upon the immediate day,&nbsp;or week, or 8 days, or&nbsp;longer -- for
 example: last Sunday is listed both as&nbsp;<strong>Sun 9/11</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>9/11/2016.</strong>&nbsp; Also, if your Region and language settings are not in English (United States), my examples would need to be adjusted for something like English (United Kingdom)
 where the format is <strong>day/month/year.</strong>&nbsp; Thus, I would suggest trying&nbsp;<strong>9/07/2016
</strong>first.&nbsp; Meanwhile you could also try <strong>Wed 9/14</strong> and see if that produced anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I do not understand your final paragraph, or your statement "Both emails you have sent do not work!"&nbsp; The only communication to you from me has been either here in these posts, or in email messages from the Community due to the subscribe process.&nbsp;
 I gather from what you are saying though is that none of my suggestions have worked.&nbsp; Is that correct?</p>

            Junk folder is emptied ~10 days and is not included in "recover deleted" once its gone its gone as the online servers are not backed up.

</p><p>I fail to understand why junk mail isnt backed up like deleted items are...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely Microsoft must realise that if someone sends an email and that sender isnt in a safe list then it &nbsp;goes straight to junk when it shouldn't? I wonder why Microsoft engineers can't figure out that there are plenty of emails that get forwarded to junk
 that shouldn't be there and that there WILL be plenty of items that need to be recovered?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, I mean none of your suggestions have worked. I said 'emails' because I also get an email when you post on here (and the email is a duplicate of what you say here). so I am correct in what I say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help anyway, but it seems Microsoft does not back up the items that get removed form Junk Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though there are plenty of emails that end up in that folder that shouldn't be there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted Windows system file is a possible cause for Excel 2016 to crash. It would be great if you can provide more details about your concern. Please answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Is the issue isolated to a single Excel file?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Have you installed the <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Install Office updates">latest updates</a></strong> for Office 2016?</li><li>Which version of Office 2016 are you using?

<h2>            Office 365 Activation</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have recently bought a DELL Laptop with Windows 8 installed in it.<br />
I have the Office 365 installed from the beginning but not activated.<br />
I don't have any activation key as I was not given.<br />
So, I choose the way of signing in my Windows Live account.<br />
Whenever I do this, it prompts that the account is not associated with Office 365.<br />
<br />
MS Office is very important to me for my work. Kindly resolve my problem.<br />
Thanks a lot in advance.<br />

            The copy of Office 365 that came with the computer is a time limited trial. If you did get a full license along with the computer you would have some sort of paperwork with a product key on it.<br />
<br />
You will have to buy a keep-paying-forever subscription to Office 365, or an Office 2013 pay-once 1-computer license to get a product key you can use to activate it.<br />
<br />
If you get 365, then your email address/account will be associated with Office. <br />

<h2>            Compile error in hidden module&#58;&#60;module name&#62;</h2>
                    
I upgraded to Office 2010 from Office 2007, and now once I open my office programs I get the following message. Can someone please tell me what to do with this message.
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A protected <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/client/HV01200929.htm?app=WDV&amp;ver=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
module</a> contains a compilation error. Because the error is in a protected module it cannot be displayed.</p>
<p>This error commonly occurs when code is incompatible with the version or architecture of this application (for example, code in a document targets 32-bit Microsoft Office applications but it is attempting to run on 64-bit Office).</p>
<p>This error has the following cause and solution:</p>
<p>Cause of the error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The error is raised when a compilation error exists in the VBA code inside a protected (hidden) module. The specific compilation error is not exposed because the module is protected.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have access to the VBA code in the document or project, unprotect the module, and then run the code again to view the specific error.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you do not have access to the VBA code in the document, then contact the document author to have the code in the hidden module updated.</p>
</li></ul>

</p><p>Below are the steps on how to sort Months in PivotTable manually.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select any of the months.</li><li>Point your mouse to the border of the said cell and make sure that the pointer changes to a four-headed arrow. See sample below.<br />

<p>This was very helpful, except one hiccup, and I'll bet the OP had the same problem: I'm trying to see April of 2017 through April 2018 and when I moved April 2018 to the end, it moves April 2017 to the end as well</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I drag one of those values, it moves the other to the corresponding place within it's year.&nbsp; I also tried flipping the order of the Month and Year, but then I can only move ALL of April combined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to make Excel recognize that these are TWO DIFFERENT MONTHS?</p>

<p>Hi jtbe7,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make a soft reset on your phone, by dialling <strong>*#7780#,</strong> followed by your security code (the default security code is
<strong>12345</strong>, unless you have changed it). This will reset all settings to their factory defaults, including the email client and all accounts you've added. After the reset, set up your email account again by following these instructions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Menu</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Mail</strong>&nbsp;&gt;<strong>&nbsp;New mailbox</strong>.
</li><li><span>Select&nbsp;Email provider&nbsp;from the list&nbsp;</span> </li><li>Enter your&nbsp;<strong>email address</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>password</strong>, select OK.
</li><li>The mailbox&nbsp;is created. </li></ol>
<p>The&nbsp;following email service types can be set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange ActiveSync (for corporate email) </li><li>Hotmail or Gmail using ActiveSync </li><li>Direct POP/IMAP connection to email server&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>All the mailboxes can be&nbsp;accessed in&nbsp;a single&nbsp;location in&nbsp;<strong>Menu</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Mail</strong>&nbsp;or via Inbox on the home screen widgets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your email service is not found in the list, select&nbsp;<strong>Other</strong>&nbsp;and enter you email address and additional info if requested. You can change settings later by&nbsp;by selecting<strong>&nbsp;Menu</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Mail</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;
 (mailbox name). The incoming and outgoing mail server settings can in this case be found in&nbsp;<strong>Mailbox settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Advanced mailbox settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia C3-00 Issue with camera</h2>
                    
<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a new nokia c3 in December 2010.&nbsp; I was really lucky to get an English only keypad for my handset. Within 40 days I got issues with my phone camera.</p>
<p>When I open the camera application the phone gets switched off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave it to the nokia care for repair. I got the handset after repair and I noticed that my keypad got changed to English-Hindi keypad and also hell lot of scratches on my screen. Even my screen guard also was ripped off. I don't understand the need of
 removing the screen guard to repair my phones camera..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nokia care people tells there is no c3 handset with only English keypad. They just rubbished all my claims and telling that am bluffing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then and there I called up the nokia care call center, the call center lady asks me to leave the phone in the nokia
 care centre itself &nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know any other place to lodge my complaints. All suggestions&nbsp; are welcomed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Removing the screen guard is because they use own ones when opening the phone. This is instruction used by service, so they removed Your and add own for the time when they will try to fix it.<br />
<br />
The keyboard change may be because You bought the phone at some GSM telecom place, where they got little changed ones or something like that. This is what could happend, but i may be wrong.<br />
<br />
Best way to show company that they didn't treat You as they should is to pay someone else next time.

<h2>            Batch convert Access 2003 &#40;mdb&#41; to Access 2010 &#40;accdb&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I need to convert hundreds of small databases from Access 2003 to Access 2010.&nbsp; Is there a tool to automate this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I could do it with a batch file (e.g. <em>CALL "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\MSACCESS.EXE" "h:\test.mdb" /convert "h:\test.accdb"</em>), but I haven't been able to get around the 'OK' button, which wants a response.</p>

            <p>I don't know of any tool, but it really isn't hard to create a procedure to do it.&nbsp; I don't have enough info (where are all the files stored, ...)&nbsp;to write a full procedure for you, but you can easily iterate through file using VBA and then simply use the
<span><strong>Application.ConvertAccessProject Method</strong> to perform the converion.&nbsp; Remember you can't do it to the open database.&nbsp; For more info look at the VBA help file.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I have seen mentioned using SendKeys "%(dk)", but typically SendKeys is a horrible beast to work with and should be avoided at all cost (just sharing information - do as you see fit).</span></p>
<p><span>I also have to agree with Bob.&nbsp; Why convert them at all.&nbsp; Unless there is a truly valid reason, like you are wanting to utilize some new functionality.... Otherwise leave them as is, Access 2007 and 2010 can both work with mdb without any problems.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, as with any other operation of this type, ensure you made backups before trying to perform any conversion, little alone a mass conversion such as the one you are proposing!!!</span></p>

<h2>            Excel error - There isn&#39;t enough memory to complete this action try using less data or close applications. To increase memory availability use 64 bit excel or add memory</h2>
                    <p><span>I&nbsp;</span><span>have a user who has been chronically experiencing this problem, he appears to be the only one and it persists regardless of spreadsheet size, and will appear even if excel is the only program open. It occurs
 at seemingly random times, and will be associated with copy paste (off and on) or sometimes it will just pop up while his spreadsheets are open. I have tried running the fix wizard in programs and features, as well as uninstalling and re-installing Office,
 neither worked. We have upgraded from 32bit processors to 64 bit and is now reading 12gb of memory. Everything is up to date, software wise, we even gave him a new PC. It is an office PC so is linked to a network. It causes him to have to close all spreadsheets
 and exit excel to then go back into all the spreadsheets. He doesn't have more than 6-7 open at a time and this will occur, and they are not overly big in size. This is something that has been ongoing for so long, and it feels like we have exhausted all our
 resources, and can not find anything wrong with the software. We have been advised against 64 bit excel as it could cause issue with Bloomberg and other applications used.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Lumia 950xl - continuous issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mtcdnp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950xl - continuous issues</h2>
                    <p>Really wanted to like this 950XL phone, bought it and have tried to justify the over $800 invested so far into it including leather cover (Mozo), connection box, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I bought this 950XL based on specs (camera, replaceable battery, usb-c, etc) plus compatibility with Exchange Outlook alone (attraction was contact sync).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have had the Lumia 950XL for over 2 months which has been a continuous struggle and after each update I have had renewed hopes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of my previous iPhones, Samsung S6 &amp; Note 4, has given me so much grief, none.</p>
<p>I have had to carry along with me the Note 4 working on wifi just for reliability of getting to emails when 950XL decides to freeze or reboot out of the blue.&nbsp; Lost many phone calls and 1/2 way texts &amp; emails.</p>
<p>Lack of apps is a known issue but keeping with me the Note 4 helped me get by.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to use map apps (bough all apps I could from store) is a hassle, terrible interface and gps location seems to be mostly off.&nbsp; Cortana is working part time and very slow most of the time.&nbsp; And multiple freezing...I got lost using more than I can recall
 using the phone as gps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It puzzles me that a company like Microsoft cannot afford to develop the software of the future when Apple is making most of its profits on phones...and Microsoft cannot even copy a proven success story...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I give up on Lumia 950XL I don't have the energy to keep rebooting a sub-par phone/system.&nbsp; Too bad I passed the 30 days warranty I wish Microsoft would give me credit for it plus I spent so much more in accessories (still could not find a replacement battery
 at decent price).&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'll go back to my oldie Note 4 which I can trust it will not let me down until the new Note 6 (unlike Note 5) will hopefully have a replaceable memory card and battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still wonder if it is only me that has had so many issues with Lumia 950XL or is it a common problem (yet an unreliable Win 10 or maybe hardware compatibility)??</p>

<p>Because you gave up already, just for the records:</p>

<li>Which network operator do you use, in which country?</li><li>All apps » Settings » System » About » More Info » (just) your ‘OS build’ and ‘firmware’, please.</li></ol>

<p>Wondering exactly the same. Even asking that question myself, gives me – as a manager – a&nbsp;suspicion in which miserable state the organization Microsoft and its subsidiary Microsoft Mobile are (for years). Questioning myself whether – after fifteen years
 of constant failure in mobile space – there is still any hope left.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still wonder if it is only me […]?</p>

<p>A lot of users like you have faced several but distinct issues. Nevertheless, the approach would be to dig into each issue separately. Actually, only before end of February (without firmware
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/f226b2b5-6deb-450b-9f61-12aabce9b298">
00038</a> and OS build <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/02/10/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build-10586-107/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
.107</a>) the Lumia 950 series was unusable for many. Again, nevertheless, the phone should be ‘quite’ stable with those updates now. Therefore, it would have been interesting to investigate in your case, if some bugs hid each other, perhaps something which
 is rather unique to only users who haven’t raised their voice, yet. The problem is: You gave up already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, my Lumia 950 cannot be repaired ever, never be my main phone, just because of its missing compass. So, I face a single never ending continuous issue with this phone, nobody was able to tell me beforehand. Perhaps that qualifies me to feel with
 you, at least a bit.</p>

            I can not get past how bad the Bluetooth is.&nbsp; Having to soft reset the phone a couple times a day seems silly.&nbsp; Yet that is always what the Microsoft people recommend.&nbsp; The device is supposed to be productive.&nbsp; How does having to reset the device everyday
 help you be productive.&nbsp; The Lumia 950XL is totally unusable for all the basic functions that a phone should be able to do everyday.&nbsp; Windows 10 mobile is a nightmare.

            <p>I am afraid I am with you, on all fronts. In fact writing this reply is now giving me grief, every backspace is taking 3 seconds delay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually think the phone is worse than ever. I am having to reboot multiple times a day to sort issues. On top of the above items, I get;</p>
<p>- Groove refusing to play a song. Hit play, nothing. Or today, no audio output to my headphones (wired).</p>
<p>- Groove plays different song to the one displayed. Not even from the same album!</p>
<p>- Bluetooth totally sucks. I mean royally. Trying to stream music to my B&amp;O Play device is random luck. Usually involves multiple pairing and reboot attempts. My wife's iPhone, never fails.</p>
<p>- Unreliable data connection. I can be sitting with 4G signal, no email or WhatsApp. The moment I connect to wireless, bang, updates galore.</p>
<p>- Random failure of page loads in native browser. Just get a white screen. Close and reopen browser to fix</p>
<p>- Nasty battery drain, I can't get a full work day without charging it. I now leave the phone on a wireless charge station in the office just to make sure.</p>
<p>- Tiles don't update. Really stale most of the time. Sometimes reboot fixes, sometimes not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so disappointed with this phone, I am fully invested into the Win10 ecosystem with a Surface Pro 4 and all the possible options. Microsoft have gone from huge promise with their new device offerings, to a massive disappointment. Not sure I can stomach
 this phone much longer and if they can't sort SP4 issues then that's another £1800 going out the window.</p>

            <p>I think the point is the phone and most importantly the operating software is not ready for everyday use.&nbsp; The answer should not be to
<strong>hard reset the phone</strong>.&nbsp; You switch Bluetooth devices and groove music stops working.&nbsp; No problem just
<strong>reset your phone</strong>.&nbsp; I am playing a Rolling Stones song and I get album art of Sheryl Crow.&nbsp; Not really important, but shows how the software is not close to working right.&nbsp; The point is if you sell a phone as the most productive device or to
 replace your PC.&nbsp; Then you should make sure the basic years old phone technology, such as streaming music and Bluetooth connections, that everyone else has incorporated in their products your product at a minimum is capable of matching.&nbsp; The answer should
 not be that it is fine, just <strong>restart your phone </strong>and then hopefully it will work.&nbsp; I am at my wits end why Microsoft believes that
<strong>restarting your phone </strong>3 to 5 times a day is an acceptable answer.&nbsp; How does that give anyone confidence in your products being superior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funny thing is Continuum, which I use exclusively when I travel, is very good.&nbsp; It actually is working so good that I do not travel with a laptop anymore and I am actually thinking about what options is needed for the next generation that would be awesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in conclusion.&nbsp; My Lumia 950Xl has replaced my laptop for my travel needs.&nbsp; I have had to just buy another phone, Samsung, to do all my the other productive tasks.&nbsp; Such as talking on a phone, streaming music, surfing the web, etc..&nbsp; My hope is Samsung
 comes out soon with an alternative to Continuum, which I am sure will be better, and then I will only really need one device&nbsp;for all my work, personal, and social needs.&nbsp; I think that device will be a Samsung Note 7.</p>

            <p>Me too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lumia 950, which isn't loaded with many apps, or strenuous activities, freezes sometimes 2-3 times a week. Doesn't sound like much but I can't recall many times my previous phones have had this behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could happen whilst browsing, being on a call, or simply trying to get through the main lock screen. The phone usually restarts itself but recently it just hangs and I need to do the volume + power button for 10 seconds to soft reset the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is disappointing for such a flagship version of the phone, with its specs should breeze through any hardware challenge so points to an underlying issue with incompatibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish I had more of a constructive post, than to add to the chorus of restart your phone.</p>

<p>- moved all of the apps to the internal storage</p>
<p>- bought a new SD card, Samsung Pro+ 64gb - which is supposed to be (and feels) blazingly fast.</p>
<p>- I let the phone format the card (it should know best, right?)</p>
<p>- only placed music and photos on the SD Card</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has made a slight improvement but I'm still getting issues with the phone freezing, or coming back to use it and only having a non-responsive black screen (how long had it been like that?).&nbsp;I've bought a watch as a back up for my morning alarms.</p>

            Not just you I have had problems with my 950xl since three days out of the box phone locks up black screen with lightning bolt and gear and phone wont restart for hours or days I have tried everything including clearing phone of all apps nothing has worked
 I contacted Microsoft weeks ago and still haven't gotten anywhere. on the good side I purchased my 950xl and they gave me the 950 for free which also has its issues but at least still works something tells me that this is a huge problem and they don't know
 how to fix it. I wish that I had&nbsp;purchased &nbsp;the s7 active. I had a 900 and 920 for years never a problem. 950 xl is garbage.

<h2>            Valid Win 7 activation key reporting as invalid following Win 10 Insider installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I doubt I'm the first to run into this but I didn't have any luck with my searches for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got an older PC purchased new in the box at Best Buy with <strong>Win 7 Home Permium OA Acer Group</strong> pre-installed. &nbsp;It's never had another version of Windows installed on it and has worked just fine from day one. &nbsp;The only significant change
 to the system was adding a second hard drive about six years ago and upgrading the video card about five years ago. &nbsp;Neither upgrade caused any issues with the Win 7 activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks ahead of the 7/29 rollout date for Win 10 I went ahead and installed the Insider version on that machine to test a couple of games. &nbsp;The install went just fine, the games worked and all was well and there were no activation issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That computer is left on 24/7 so it dutifully downloaded and installed all of the updates that MS rolled out. &nbsp;At some point on the 27th / 28th of July I started to get a warning that my activation key isn't valid. &nbsp;I've tried re-entering it from the COA
 sticker on the side of the computer but get the message&nbsp;<strong>This key didn't work, please check it and try again, or try a different key.</strong> &nbsp;I've dutifully re-entered it several times, taken the requisite photos of the COA so I can ensure that I'm
 entering 8 for 8 and B for B, and I'm still not having any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to correct this? &nbsp;I could try uninstalling the Win 10 preview but I'm concerned that now Win 7 will be busted so for the moment I'm mainly ignoring it, but I'm sure that's not a viable plan long term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any guidance you can provide.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>I appreciate if you could answer few questions to narrow down the issue and to provide you better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you getting activation error on Windows 10 or Windows 7?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are getting error on Windows 10 I suggest you to reinstall Windows 7 and upgrade to Windows 10 after activating Windows 7. To do so kindly follow the below given link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/installing-reinstalling-windows#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/installing-reinstalling-windows#1TC=windows-7</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to refer to the<strong> Windows&nbsp;7 activation error: invalid product key</strong> article to resolve the activation error:</p>

<p>
</p><p>After activating Windows 7 I suggest you to install all the update and upgrade to Windows 10 using either Get Windows 10 icon or by media creation tool. Refer to the following link to download Windows 10 ISO Media</p>

            You can not use your Win7 key for Win10. In fact, do not use any keys at all for the free upgrade offer. You should roll back / restore Win7 and then upgrade to Win10 (not clean install) then your activation should work.

            <p>Once you have restored Windows 7&nbsp;applied all the&nbsp;updates and SP1 then you should be able to upgrade to Window 10. If you don't get the upgrade through windows update then you can download the ISO and create a DVD or USB, just make sure you get the right
 version "Home &amp; 32 or 64 bit".</p>

            <p>Hi Parth, thanks for responding. &nbsp;The computer originally came with Win 7 installed and activated. &nbsp;I installed the preview of Win 10 which worked fine for a couple of weeks then a day or two before the go live for Win 10 I started getting a message indicating
 that my version of Windows wasn't activated. &nbsp;It appears I can't use the Win 7 key on the COA sticker on the computer to activate the Win 10 preview, which I assume is also preventing me from upgrading to the full version of Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the rollback suggested by baggadap and neilpzz but can't do so. &nbsp;When I try to start it I'm told I have to remove new accounts - specifically&nbsp;<strong>IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool</strong> but no such account shows up in the accounts tool, so I guess
 the question now is how can I either remove the account, or bypass the requirement so I can roll back to Win 7?</p>
        </p>

            How did you install&nbsp; the first version of windows 10 preview and was it home or pro,&nbsp;and did you check to see it was activated? also was your win 7 fully updated before you installed win10?

            <p>I was finally able to roll back to Win 7 - which is working just fine now - by manually deleting the&nbsp;<strong>IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool&nbsp;</strong>folder int he
<strong>Users</strong> folder. &nbsp;After that the roll back worked and my activation woes seem to be gone. &nbsp;I've even got a Win 10 reservation icon in the system tray now.</p>

<p>I have the same problem - I can't view attachments once they are in a conversation. All these replies tell me to go to options and 'group conversation and pre-load messages', but there is no option for this anywhere when I go to 'options'. Am I missing something?
 The only options it gives me under 'conversation settings' is to order the messages differently.</p>

<p>I downloaded WMDC 6.0 from the Microsoft web site.&nbsp; That was easy.&nbsp; However, uninstalling WMDC has proven to be impossible.&nbsp; I have used the uninstall programs functionality within control panel and that takes out the WMDC programs.&nbsp; I have
 then installed WMDC 6.0.&nbsp; The install goes great.&nbsp; However, the first time it use WMDC 6.0, Vista immediately installs WMDC 6.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programmer suggested I uninstall WMDC 6.1 and then delete the Windows Mobile folder.&nbsp; I kept having "permission" problems even though I am the only user and I am the administrator.&nbsp; (I'd like to solve this too!)&nbsp; The delete permission windows
 never give me an opportunity to provide my login ID or password.&nbsp; However, after about 10 tries, I was able to remove the Windows Mobile folder.&nbsp; (I doubt if I could repeat this!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted the WMDC 6.0 install again.&nbsp; It went fine except Vista again immediately tried to upgrade WMDC 6.0 to WMDC 6.1.&nbsp; I have no idea where the install program is for WMDC 6.1.&nbsp; As I am not connected to the Internet during the install,
 the update must be on my hard drive.&nbsp; Also, I have turned off Windows automatic updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea how I can successfully downgrade to WMDC 6.0?</p>

<p>The unlocker program is a great addition to my collection of Windows Tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I successfully unintalled the WMDC 6.1 update and WMDC.&nbsp; I successfully deleted the Windows Mobile folder from Windows.&nbsp; I successfully installed WMDC 6.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as soon as I plugged my Samsung WM6.0 SCH i760 into the USB port, WMDC updated again to WMDC 6.1!&nbsp; I was not connected to the Internet, and Windows update is set to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and

<p>Hello Marc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encounterd exactly the same problems. First&nbsp; my device stopped&nbsp;synchronising with WMDC 6.1. After I downgraded to 6.0 it worked fine again. However every time I plug my device into the USB port it start "preparing to de-install older version"
 and wants to upgrate to 6.1. As long as I'm fast enough to press cancel it's OK. If I'm too late it updates to 6.1 which bring me back to the start; synchronising failure- need attention 0x8503001c!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set Windows update&nbsp;to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who has the solution? How to stop VISTA try installing WMDC 6.1??</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankx for your reply. Yes, as I described I modified&nbsp;my Windows Update settings through&nbsp;<b>Start &gt;&gt; Windows Update</b> and set it to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I "played" a little further.... plugging in the usb connector does not give any problems anymore.&nbsp;The only moment when WMDC wants to update now is when I using the shortcut &lt;....\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs.WMDC.lnk&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have a look in ../windows/WindowsMobile/ I can see two files WMCD &lt;version 6.0.&gt; and a wmcdBase &lt;version 6.1&gt;. I had however deletes all files in this directorie before installing 6.0 again, except the *.mui in the&nbsp;nl-NL directory as they
 where blocked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it seem that Windows has stored the 6.1 version&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;and wants to install it again as soon as I start&nbsp;version 6.0. &nbsp;(or it's coming with the drivers which are installed again using version 6.0 for the first time???).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Christiaan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS hope there will be a working WMDC 6.2 soon, as everthing started there.....;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Did anyone find a solution to this problem yet?? I also cannot "downgrade" to 6.0 despite trying everything above, even using regedit to delete the Windows CE Services folder.<br />
<br />
Still cannot sync my HTC TyTN II using WMDC 6.1 (although 6.0 worked fine!!!)<br />
<br />
This is a serious, serious problem that MS needs to address asap.<br />

            <span>ok, I have successfully downgraded from 61. back to 6.0 twice (just to make sure of the process).<br />
<br />
For anyone else still having probs, here is my set-up<br />
<br />
1) Mobile Device = HTC-branded TyTN II (Kaiser) running WM 6.0 <br />
2) NEW HP tx2000 running Vista Home Premium SP2 32-bit and WMDC 6.0.6783<br />
3) MS Office 2007 SP1<br />
4) HTC device syncing to Outlook 2007 contacts, tasks, calendar, email (primary folder only)<br />
</span>
<div>No link to any Exchange server<br />
<span>5) Windows Update set to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them"<br />
</span>
<div>Recommended Updates box = Checked<br />
Update Service box = Checked<br />
<span><br />
Problem started when Windows Update upgraded WMDC to 6.1.&nbsp; After that, no sync possible.<br />
<br />
RESOLUTION:<br />
Roll-back to WMDC 6.0<br />
My Steps:<br />
1) Disconnect phone from computer<br />
2) Use Windows Task Manager (CTRL-SHIFT-ESC) to End Process Tree (right-click on process name to select) of "Windows Mobile Device Center" and "Microsoft Sync Center"<br />
3) Uninstall WMDC Driver Upgrade from Programs and Features Control Panel<br />
4) Optional re-start<br />
5) Uninstall WMDC </span><span>from Programs and Features Control Panel<br />
6) Delete Registry entries for Windows CE Services (see above posts).&nbsp; Be sure to delete relevant folder in BOTH paths.<br />
</span>
<div>a. HKEY_CURRENT_USERS<br />
b. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />
<span>7) Use unlocker </span><span>(see above posts)
</span><span>to unlock, kill any running processes spawned from this folder and finally delete c:\windows\WindowsMobile<br />
8) Restart PC<br />
9) Connect Mobile Device (my HTC phone) into the PC.&nbsp; NOTHING HAPPENs...which is good!!<br />
10) With the phone still connected, install WMDC 6.0 (which you can download from MS website)<br />
11) Once WMDC completes install, it should recognize your device and you set up sync partnership, etc. as a normal fresh install.&nbsp; Now everything is working fine and sync'd.<br />
<br />
PS Just as an experiment, I ran the 6.1 upgrade again.&nbsp; And again it created the non-sync condition.&nbsp; So I rolled-back to 6.0 and am staying there!!<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Lumia 720 - DIRECT sms backup &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I need a way to backup the hundreds of SMS on my (wife's) phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot use the associated account because of a forgotten password (and the mail adress associated to password recuperation is down, and as we never used this account we cannot provide sufficient details to access to alternate password recuperation
 procedure)...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually this is why we need the backup in the first place, to switch to another MS account (so we can update apps, which has become impossible since the last WP update : we need to reenter the live.com passwod we never used)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there any clever PC software that knows how to extracts these SMS from the phone ? Is there any subtle phone procedure that could help ?? We cannot use the cloud not install an app, are we stuck ?</p>

<p>Thanks 93tid for your answer, it led me to the solution...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sms actually are accessible from the live.com account (using outlook.com access, for whatever reason). Not all of them (only 3 months back, only received ones) and in a pretty weird way (filtering changes, one must ask to view its contacts first) but
 they are here, readable, that's a start. No mention of a way to send them back to the handset though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe you ment I would not be able to access the complete lot of messages, or maybe we are not talking about the same thing, not a big deal because YOU SAVED MY DAY !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave a llok at the "transfer my data" app on the app store. Actually, I had it already installed, and tried to use it but fell on the bluetooth connexion that did not fit my needs. Yet online I noticed the app store desciption of this app mentioned a possibility
 to transfer FROM and TO a SD card, strangely hidden under the "..." option instead of simply being accessible after the "begin" main button. Another ergonomy fail IMHO (and thanks to the commentator who mentioned this in the app store), but once discovered,
 it does the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exactly what I was looking for in the first place, it saves messages on the card, in a "backup/data/(transfer_date_and_time)/sms folder, as a big "sms.vmsg" file, text format, directly accessible. We should now be able to reset the handset and connect it
 to a new account, linked to a working email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It still is a pity how simple things become so complicated on WP8 (not to mention weird ergonomy choices), and somehow it's strange how the solutions are not widely known. But once again, mccbleue and you, thanks for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1.</p>
<p>1.1</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com export to .ICS &#61; Wrong Time Zone on Outlook Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to subscribe to my personal outlook.com calendar on my work (Windows 7 + Office 2010) PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For starters I have double checked and triple checked that the outlook.com time zone, my desktop PC windows timezone, and my outlook 2010 times zones are all equal to Mountain Time (UTC-7:00)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I subscribe to the .ICS file for my outlook.com calendar on my desktop PC Outlook 2010 account it appears in the calendar 6 hrs too early. &nbsp;For example, kids soccer correctly shows 6:00 pm in outlook.com but I go to Outlook 2010 on my desktop
 and see the same appointment scheduled for 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting and re-adding several times but get the same result. &nbsp;The same issue happens when I try to add it to my iPhone (events are 6 hrs too early).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm out of troubleshooting ideas and need your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You would need to set your time zone in Outlook.com synchronized with the time zone set in your Outlook 2010. To set your time zone in Outlook.com, kindly do one of the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Regional</strong></p>
<p>OR</p>
</li><li>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt;
<strong>Region and time zone</strong></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us with the result. </p>

 a fourth time zone setting somewhere that I am missing.</p>

            <p>Kindly remove the time zone set up for Outlook.com and Outlook 2010. Configure your Outlook 2010 time zone first; then synchronized the same time zone to your Outlook.com account again. We also suggest that you run the Office Repair by simply following the
 steps provided <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I will go there and look for answers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I still find it very puzzling how sync'ing from an Outlook.com calendar can be 6 hrs off when trying to sync to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlook 2010 desktop</li><li>iPhone 6 on corporate network.</li><li>iPhone 6 using only internet service provider.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>All set to Mountain time and all devices show the 6 hr offset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only one that shows it correctly is my Outlook 2016 desktop client that has my Outlook.com account setup and the built in Mail/Calendar application.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<p>I read the articles Anne recommended and although they certainly sound similar to my problem, they have still not lead me to a solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more piece of information to add.&nbsp; As I struggle with subscribing to my Outlook.com .ICS I have successfully subscribed to several other ICS calendars from TeamSnap for my kids sports team.&nbsp; All 3 of them came in fine with the time zones all correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me everything works fine except for when Outlook.com is involved so doesn't that imply the problem is with it?</p>

<h3> chelsea_888  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cannot get any templates for Microsoft Office to download in any MS Office 2016 application.</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded and installed MS Office 2016 Standard today, along with separate installations of Access and Project.&nbsp; I cannot get any templates.&nbsp; For Project and Access specifically I needed some of the generic templates that come with the software. But they
 don't appear and I get an error message saying "Sorry, we had trouble getting the featured templates and can't show them right now." When I search for one, it immediately says "Your Internet request timed out. The service might be temporarily busy." Note that
 I am logged in and online right now and no problem with my internet connection at the same time that I am getting this notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem in Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint, Publisher, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent 2.5 hours on the phone with MS "Customer Service" today being referred around and around and around only to be told they wanted an additional $500 to even discuss the problem with me -- even though I just bought the license and haven't even
 used the software once! Horrible, disgusting service.&nbsp; Its like buying a lemon at a car dealership and them wanting to charge you triple when the car you just bought won't start! And actually the only advice they gave me was to uninstall Office! Whaaa?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway...&nbsp; does anyone have any idea how to get the templates?&nbsp; Oh, and the MS site page for templates does not include any templates for MS Project that I could find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information, I am on a completely brand new computer running a new installation of Windows 10 pro, new installation of Office 2016.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Chelsea, 
<br />
<br />2 things I’d do to start. 
<br />
<br />1, check for updates 
<br />
<br />Settings - Update &amp; security - windows updates - see if office has updates pending. If so, install and try to get the templates again. 
<br />
<br />If no dice, 2. I’d Uninstall office, reboot, and then reinstall. I just had an issue today with an office 2010 installation. Troubleshot for about 15/20 before I yanked it out, and then reinstalled it, fixed the issue. 
<br />
<br />Give these a shot and let me know!
<br />- C

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a volume license so I can only update through Windows update. That said, I did check and it didn't particularly seem like there were any missing updates for office but I did install everything available just in case.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling, rebooting and reinstalling -- no change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any webpages where I can directly download them from MS?</p>

</p><p>In Microsoft Project 2016, click File &lt; Options.&nbsp; In the Project Options dialog, click the Save tab.&nbsp; In the Save Templates section of the page, click the Browse button for the Default Personal Templates Location field and select a folder on your PC where
 you would like to be able to save personal templates.&nbsp; After selecting a template, click the OK button and then exit Microsoft Project.&nbsp; Launch Microsoft Project again and click File &gt; New.&nbsp; You should now see a bunch of templates from Microsoft, available
 for you to use.&nbsp; You may need to repeat this process with each of our Office 2016 apps.&nbsp; I tried the preceding steps and they worked for me.&nbsp; Hope this helps (and saves you $500).&nbsp;</p>

            So I’m striking out on finding any downloadable templates.. but I think I started thinking outside the box on why the problem is happening in general.

<br />And look at Steve823’s answer. Some network setting is blocking those from loading...
<br />
<br />Let’s check here first - control panel - internet options - connections tab - then click on LAN settings, what boxes are checked in there? 
<br />
<br />let me know!
