            Hello kurthepschmidt,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for bringing this up. Let's sort this out. However, to be able to understand the issue better, can you give us more details by answering these following questions:<br />
<br />
• When was the first time you have noticed this issue?<br />
• Can you tell us the current Windows 10 OS Build of your Surface? To do this, type 'winver' on the Search bar/Cortana.<br />
• Have you tried performing a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
two-button shutdown/restart</a> to see if it helps?<br />
• For us to verify this on our end, can you send us a screenshot of the issue?<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know so we can help you further.

<p>I first noticed the issue after a Windows update.</p>
<p>version 1803 build 17134.48</p>
<p>No. I didn't do the two button shut down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how to do a screen shot. It happens when I boot up computer. I first click the desk top then the sign in screen appears. I proceed to sign in. It used to go right into windows but now a screen comes up that prompt me to sign up for 'Windows
 Hello', I clicked do later because there is no other options then the next screen appears to put a 'pin in' which I don't want so I cancel and select 'do later' so I can work on my computer. This is a PIA and I don't want it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into settings 'sign in options' to but my screen just shows "set up" with no remove button, same with the pin. I just want this to go away. After a windows update I shouldn't be FORCED into options I don't want.</p>

<h2>            Problems updating to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8.-</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Free upgrade messes up; Microsoft support asks for $99 to fix it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently tried to upgrade my laptop from Windows 8 to 8.1. &nbsp;Installation messed up somehow, so now my laptop will only go to a blue page with "Choose an option" at the top and Continue, Use another operating system, Troubleshoot, and Turn off your PC as
 the options. &nbsp;Trying to boot 8 up will just result in the laptop sitting around with a blank screen for 30 minutes or more before returning to the blue options page. &nbsp;Yeah, yeah, stuff happens. &nbsp;I need a laptop for school, so I borrow one to use in the mean
 time. </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just now, I received a requested call from Microsoft about how to fix the problem. &nbsp;After explaining what the laptop was doing, the representative said that apparently the only way to deal with this is for me to pay $99 for extra level technical support.
 &nbsp;After stating that I was not going to pay $99 to fix an error that free software has caused, I was advised to go to this website, where my problem would be fixed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I didn't have a laptop borrowed for classes, I would be quite a bit more irritated by this. &nbsp;I can't help but be amazed that I am expected pay money because of defective software. &nbsp;All of my important documents are on Dropbox, etc., so I don't care
 if I have to lose data or anything. &nbsp;I just want a functioning laptop again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone else ended up stuck on this blue options screen? &nbsp;Any ideas?</div>
                </div>

            Do you have media to reinstall Windows 8 with? If you dont have to much stuff saved on the computer I would do a reinstall of 8 and then try upgrading again. Sometimes your installed apps will prevent the upgrade from beeing performed properly.

            I agree with the original response.&nbsp; The upgrade to 8.1 was a part of my "update".&nbsp; Downloaded and installed and now one account is updated while the other account "sits and spins".&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 8 has had nothing but negative reviews.&nbsp; As an avid and faithful
 user of Windows, I have sat back and just listened but now I am complaining.&nbsp; You have got to do better for your customers.&nbsp; Fixing what you have created should and must&nbsp;be your number one priority.

            If they are there, then that means you should be able to access them on your Phone too. You are likely seeing the effects of Microsoft winding down support for Windows Phone 10 devices. Microsoft has recommended users still on Windows Phone 10 devices switch to an iPhone or Android and use Microsoft apps there. 
<br />
<br />My recommendation would be to reset your Windows Phone, sign in with your Microsoft Account then see if they sync.

<h2>            Windows 10 Interface wont respond to mouse clicks. Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having problems lately with my mouse where out of no where Windows will not respond to my mouse clicks. When I hover over the taskbar icons or anything that the cursor touches it would do its animation like it would light up or something, but wont
 let me click it. On desktop I can click and drag but that's about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way for my to fix this which so far is a temporary fix to sign out and sign back in again. I have tried a different mouse which was Bluetooth connected and that was working fine till left click stop working. I tried the Bluetooth mouse on my laptop
 and had same problem but strange how out of no where it stops to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that I most likely have to uninstall drivers for my USB ports? Uninstalling the mouse drivers didn't work by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Why is Windows 10 Search So Bad At It&#39;s Job&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ginkner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 10 Search So Bad At It&#39;s Job&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Windows 10 for a while now. For the most part, I like it. There have been some good additions like virtual desktops, the merged Win8 start screen and Traditional windows start menu, and it's got some nifty internal stuff going on. The most
 obvious flaw is the search feature.</p>
<p><br />
I get it. It would be nice to have a search bar that let's you type stuff in and search your apps, your files, and the internet all at once. In theory it's an interesting tool. "Cortana", however, has some glaring issues that make it basically useless for everyday
 use. If going into my "All Apps" section to find what I need is easier than searching, you've failed.<br />
<br />
Issue 1: Incremental Results<br />
Again, this seems like a cool feature: change the results on the fly as I type in what I want to search for, then stream in results as they come in rather than posting a progress bar. Seems like it would be neat. It's not though, since there isn't any way for
 me to be sure that the search is complete, and incoming results change the position of the currently displayed results. That means if I've already found the app I want and am trying to click on it, it can suddenly be replaced with a completely separate app,
 or file, or website. This defeats the only practical benefit of HAVING streaming results in the first place.&nbsp; Add to that a system that gives you just enough time to refresh after typing additional search words to move your mouse to a result that's about to
 disappear, and you've got yourself a frustrating and useless feature.<br />
<br />
Issue 2: Failure to detect exact results<br />
This is a big one. There are a large number of times where "Cortana" will fail to detect exact matches in the start menu, instead suggesting obscure system/program files. This is the MINIMUM a search feature on the start menu should do. This alone gets the
 system an F. <br />

Issue 3: Bing and Edge<br />
I don't know why Microsoft thought they needed a web search engine, but that's fine. Forcing me to use it is NOT fine. It is the furthest thing from fine I can imagine. Forcing users into a single web search provider is anti-competitive, pointless, and cripples
 the usefulness of the feature to the point where it's basically useless. Add in the fact that it launches Edge instead of the default browser, and you've turned your search feature into an invasive parasite.
<br />
<br />
Issue 4: Greedy Indexing<br />
Indexing the file system can be a lot of work. USUALLY this runs when the computer is idle, but I've had many instances where the Indexing Service decides to run in the middle of a hard drive speed test, or during a game, ruining both. Some other new services
 also seem to have a hard time detecting whether or not the computer is being used.
<br />
<br />
These things need to be fixed. I'm sure people have other complaints, as do I, but these are the major ones that make the current system a mess to use. What do other people think? What other improvements could be made?<br />

            <p>I like the O/S generally but hate the way it fails so often when searching for files and documents on the PC it allegedly operates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely don't like the way it updates as and when it sees fit rather than waiting until I choose to apply the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not like the way it merges my skype accounts regardless of my choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help function redirecting to the MS forums where MS reps can chose their own replies as answers does not work too well either. Just like the site busy fault that often occurs.</p>

<p>I'm really frustrated with the search on Win10 - thanks for articulating the issues I am experiencing. You can't even turn off the web search anymore ( or adjust it to use a different search engine ). This feels like one of the common mistakes that MS makes
 - changes feel like they are fueled by business development instead of usability.</p>

            Issue 2 is huge, and you hit the nail on the head. If I type the exact file name down to the case and still don't see the expected result, the entire search function is a failure. For the life of me I don't see how this version of the search bar has made
 it into release mode with such glaring issues.

<p>I Agree, Issue 2 is a big headache for me too.&nbsp; I often find cases where a Windows feature or app simply does not show up on search results.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, I start to type what I am looking for and see it flash up while I type and disappear once I have completed typing my search term.&nbsp; eg. If I want to get to Devices and Printers,&nbsp; if I type DEV I can see it pop up.&nbsp; However, if I finish typing the
 word DEVICES it disappears leaving only Device Manager listed.&nbsp; This really doesn't make any sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is very inconsistent.&nbsp; The search behaviour works differently when I use it on a different machine.</p>

 with it.&nbsp; So, in order to get to the control panel I have to search for it inside the new settings GUI. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendation to Microsoft is to allow ALL apps and settings that are available on the operating system to come up on the search results regardless if it's old or new GUI.&nbsp; Let the user decide which one they prefer using.&nbsp; It doesn't hurt and makes it

<p>I am replying to this comment, since the date demonstrates that Microsoft have still done nothing about the useless Search which only offers to take you to Bing. I am wanting to search
<strong><em>my PC not the Web</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you adjust the Search Box items to Folders/Files/Music etc, it says there are no files of the name you want in any of these areas.</p>
<p>All you can do is go to File Explorer (very slow) or, better still, to main folders where you know the item might be and use its own Search facility (Upper right hand corner). That usually works.</p>
<p>But why did Microsoft change a working system to this pretty useless one some weeks ago?</p>

<p>Cortana is the box in "Dumb as a box of rocks." Doesn't know what hardware is running. Cannot go beyond 'look in control panel.' Instructions finally found to hide the drooling helper don't work. WTF? You (Micro$not) have released some pretty bad OS's since
 74 but this one hits a new low. Creator update took it from bloated parody of OS to not worth it. Putting the lock on hard drive tells me you damn well know it too. Win 10 desperately needs another year of serious design regroup. Flow and intuitive navigation
 just aren't there. It attempts to work on any hardware and ends up not working well on any. Again in local patois, WTF?

</p><p>To DFroggatt, it can't tell you what it runs on, seems to have no knowledge of bios linking hardware, doesn't know CPU names, gens, can't identify versions and is basically clueless on drivers. Go to system in settings is stock answer. This for anything

<p>Problem solved, by luck!</p>
<p>W10 now limits what it will search for, presumably to ensure it runs faster and doesn't waste space on keeping a large index on the PC.</p>
<p>However, if you go into the Cortana search box and enter the magic word 'index' (without apostrophes), it shows 'Indexing Options' as the top search result.</p>
<p>Click on this and it takes you to Control Panel Indexing Options, which shows you what is indexed - very little.</p>
<p>But, by clicking on 'Modify' at the bottom you can add to its sparse list very easily.</p>
<p>I entered all the partitions I wanted covered, with no exceptions (other than programs) and let the PC get on with it, which took well over an hour, even with a fast processor and plenty of RAM.</p>
<p>It then announced it had completed indexing 235,000 files, images, videos etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search Box can now find virtually anything I want very quickly, just like the good old days.</p>
<p>It won't find photos by Tags, but File Explorer Search (in the top right area of the page) will, once I am in the right partition where I keep my photos.</p>
<p>Making a PC do what you want, keeps the intellect ticking over - particularly when you get to your eighties!</p>

<p>Watching that search bar sit at the almost complete point for ages, is bad enough. But then it does not come up with the file that I can find via manual review of the folders! Attach to the same storage array with an old XP box, and the file is found ( in
 less time!).</p>
<p>I also noticed the control panel is being deprecated. Now you have to search for it. (with a search function that has trouble finding things!).</p>
<p>They have done the same thing with many other items.</p>
<p>The best example is the print queue. That actual window has not changed since Windows 2000, but they keep burying it under new layers of the GUI. Now to get to it you have to go Windows Flag / Settings / Devices / Printers &amp; Scanners / Pick the one you want
 / Open queue / .... phew!</p>

<h2>            Error 0x800705aa during file transfer across wireless network in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting this error with an accompanying message that there are insufficient system resources to complete the service requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs when copying files from a Windows 10 laptop to a Windows 7 desktop, across a wireless network, at home. The laptop is a couple of years old and this error started happening about 3 months ago. Rebooting fixed it on that occasion. It has recurred
 a couple of time s since and rebooting no longer fixes it. Even rebooting both machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error arises when I try to copy some files from the laptop to the desktop, using drag and drop or "File...Move to" or "File...Copy to" in Windows Explorer. The error usually is preceded by the file transfer initially running at about 70% maximum speed
 then slowing down, experiencing intermittent stops of several seconds (i.e., transfer rates drop to 0 b/s for up to 10 seconds or so) then resuming, stopping and eventually failing altogether, with the above error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, some files are copied before the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a couple of hours transferring several hundred files yesterday, with none of the slowness and no failures such as this. I was able to do a couple fo hundred files this morning and now cannot do any transfers without the error arising. I've rebooted
 both machines (laptop and desktop) and the error persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a diagnosis or a fix for this error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>No sound from external speakers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tiksunila  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound from external speakers</h2>
                    I have done what was suggested on this but it didn't manage to help me out. I have a AsRock M3A770DE Motherboard with realtek audio hardware integrated and the hardware is windows 7 ready. Now the problem is the same that Seals was. I have my speakers
 plugged in and it shows that it produces sound. However that is only virtually and my speakers stay mute. And this only occurs in &nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 7 with windows xp and vista there was not trouble at all. now the problem is that i have tried to apply the drivers
 from the manufacturers site and they doesen't seem to work i have tried the windows update and those drivers doesen't work i have done what you have wrote above and nothing seems to work so i call for help because this is getting really annoying. Oh yes I
 didn't upgrade I fromatted my hard drive and installed Windows 7 on new platform. oh and it is giving sound to spdif but i want it on jack not coaxal and it doesen't eaven give me jack plug-in opportunity. Thank you for readin

                    I would really appreciate it if someone who still has windows vista could convert the file for me on windows dvd maker since microsoft decide t make the software incompatible with windows 10 and didn't warn anyone who upgraded. This file contains precious

<p>No it doesn't. A file with the MSDVD file extension is a Microsoft Windows DVD Maker project file. The
<a href="http://fileinfo.com/extension/msdvd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MSDVD XML file format</a> does
<em>not</em> contain the actual video media. Locate all the original data (videos, images etc.) on the old PC (or look inside C:\Windows.old if you upgraded), copy/move it all over to a new folder in Win10 and then use an

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>There are many possible causes ranging from calibration to hardware or Firmware. Some issues can be rectified by installing the latest
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updates</a></strong> on your device.
</span>If the issue still persists, you may try a different approach to resolving this issue by following the steps provided below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Clean the Screen. </span><span>Use a dry cloth or screen cleaner to clear the screen of any debris, or smudges that may be impacting touch functionality.</span></li><li><span>Restart the Surface. </span><span>Restarting the Surface refreshes the drivers for the device.
</span><span>If this recovers touch functionality, make sure you tries this step in the future.</span></li><li><span>Perform a Two Button Shutdown. </span><span>With the device turned on, press and hold the Volume up &amp; Power Buttons for 15 seconds, or until the device shuts off.
</span><span>If the device boots to UEFI, go to Exit and Restart the device. </span>
</li><li><span>Disable and enable HID-Compliant Touch Screen Driver in Device Manager.
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026149/windows-open-device-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager</a></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Go to <strong><span>Human Interface Devices</span>.</strong></span></li><li><span>Look for <span><strong>HID-Compliant Touch Screen</strong></span>.</span></li><li><span>Right click and then choose <strong><span>Disable</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>After disabling, right click on the driver and choose <strong><span>Enable</span></strong>.
</span>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong>: There may be two <span>HID-Compliant Touch</span> drivers. Disable both before enabling</span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
</li><li><span>Disable and enable HID-Compliant Touch Screen Driver in Device Manager.
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026149/windows-open-device-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager</a></strong></span>.</span></li><li><span>Go to <span><strong>Human Interface Devices</strong></span>.</span></li><li><span>Look for <span><strong>HID-Compliant Touch Screen</strong></span>.</span></li><li><span>Right click and choose <strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>After uninstalling, restart Surface.</span></li><li><span>After the first restart, restart once more, for a total of two restarts.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Reset Touch Screen Calibration</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to start, and type in <span>Calibrate</span>.</span></li><li><span>Locate <span><strong>Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input</strong></span>, and then select it.</span></li><li><span>Click on <span>Reset</span>.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong><span>Yes</span></strong> button to confirm reset, and follow on screen instructions.</span></li><li><span>If the reset button is greyed out, continue to Step 7. </span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Check for electromagnetic interference. </span><span>Sometimes, other electronic devices can negatively influence touch screen performance.
</span><span>To test this, move to a location that has minimal electronic devices in the environment and test the touch screen.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us. </span>

<p>When we request to add as contact again, no accept button appears. I've look through the history, and can't see a button there either.</p>
<p>We are not blocked, we can call each other but not message.</p>
<p>We used to be able to until 1st November 2017.</p>

<h2>            How to install Bios Files in Windows 7</h2>
                    Currently I am getting a black screen on both my laptop and monitor. According to other forums this is a software issue and to update my bios. I have downloaded the correct bios for the laptop model and windows 7 64bit. How do I install these files to
 update the bios with a file extension .211? Any help would be most appreciated.

<p>It sounds as if you have misunderstood some advice.&nbsp; BIOS updates (a) are not specific to any particular version of Windows and (b) generally are not installed "in Windows" but either directly from the existing BIOS or by using a bootable CD or USB flash
 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some manufacturers do provide Windows-based flashing tools, which you run on the Windows desktop to flash your BIOS and then reboot.&nbsp; Even the manufacturers who provide these tools usuaull caution against using them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flashing your BIOS from within Windows can result in more problems.&nbsp; All that software running in the background—including security programs that may interfere with writing to the computer’s BIOS—can cause the process to fail and corrupt your BIOS. Any system
 crashes or freezes might also result in a corrupted BIOS. It’s better to be safe than sorry, so use a BIOS-based flashing tool or boot to a minimal DOS environment to flash your BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file extension 211 probably refers to a version number.&nbsp; You'll need to use some sort of BIOS flashing tool.&nbsp; Generally, this will be described in a README.txt file that accompanies the BIOS update file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to be quite careful when updating the BIOS.&nbsp; If you do things wrong, you can render your computer inoperative (this is called "bricking" your computer; in other words, making your computer about as useful as a brick).</p>

<div>First of all Norton and Windows Mail don't work very well together.&nbsp; See<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Second, most ISPs limit the size of messages that you can send, so even if you were to be able to overcome Norton's restrictions, the message would still get kicked back by the recipient's email provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So if you really need to send such a large email, and you are&nbsp;sure the recipient won't curse you, then you can go to Tools | Accounts | Mail | Properties | Advanced and check the box to break apart messages larger than a certain size (try
 1 megabyte), and then the message will be sent in pieces that will combine themselves at the recipient's end, if their email program is compatible with such messages.</div>

            Hi,<br />

Check with MSI Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board<br />
and separate device drivers. Of course the WiFi and Camera drivers.<br />

Thank you for your suggestion.<br />

 hardware problem.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Good news on the camera and since the driver didn't help with the WiFi it probably is hardware.<br />
<br />
Definitely power off the modem and router - then power on the modem - when it is up and running<br />
power on the router - when it is up and running reboot the computers. That is known as a hard<br />
reset and may help.<br />
<br />
Also check in the MSI Forums to see if there are any known issues with that model and possibly<br />
a solution. If your WiFi device has an OEM maker such as Intel, Realtek, Atheros, or others check<br />
with their sites to see if there even newer drivers available.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Installation error &#58; The configuration data for thie product is corrupt. Contact your support personnel.</h2>
                    I tried to install a game named Guitar Hero World Tour the second time on my computer. The first time I didn't delete it correctly: I deleted it first from the folder than from the Add or Remove Programs and now when I start the installation of the game
 it gives me that error. Can you please tell me what I need to do?

            You could try and use this to clean up any leftovers and then reinstall.<br />

            Driver updates may be required to achieve full compatibility with Windows 10. &nbsp;I would suggest trying the PC/Mouse manufacturer's Support Site in preference to relying solely on Windows Update, as Microsoft can only distribute generic drivers plus those
 drivers that manufacturers have supplied to them.
