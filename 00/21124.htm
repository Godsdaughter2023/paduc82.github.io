            <p>No.</p>
<p>Only upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10 is path to get free license for Windows 10.</p>
<p>It is same path for Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 Insider Preview.</p>
<p>When it is done you can reset Windows 10 without fear to loose license, even clean</p>
<p>install with USB stick or DVD, cause license is valid for your motherboard now.</p>

            <p>Thanks Jo</p>
<p>But my only problem is the free upgrade app in win7 &nbsp;is not updating it the Win10 upgrade file and keeps bringing this error 820..D. This is taking long and I have tried all possible ways to get it fixed but it seems it's still stuck there with that error.
 Any help?</p>

<h2>            Overriding Office Update settings in original configuration.xml&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We're on a domain and deployed Office 365 Pro Plus using a configuration.xml file containing:</p>
<p>&lt;Configuration&gt;<br />
&lt;Add SourcePath="\\server\share\O365deploy\" OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;<br />
&lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;<br />
&lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/Product&gt;<br />
&lt;/Add&gt; <br />
&lt;Updates Enabled="TRUE" UpdatePath="\\server\share\O365deploy\" /&gt; <br />
&lt;Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" /&gt; <br />
&lt;Logging Name="OfficeSetup.txt" Path="c:\temp" /&gt; <br />
&lt;/Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>But never got so far as putting any updates in that path.</p>
<p>I'd now like to get clients pulling updates directly from the internet but I'm unclear how to override the settings used when the original deployment was done.</p>
<p>Can we do this?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, how do we get the updates into the path specified as the <strong>
<em>UpdatePath</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>path above please?</p>
<p>I see there is an Updates subfolder in&nbsp;"\\server\share\O365deploy\" but it's empty.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>The update settings in the configuration.xml file are applied to Office 365 ProPlus when you use the Office Deployment Tool to deploy Office 365 ProPlus. If you decide to change these settings, you must update your configuration.xml file, and then run the
 Office Deployment Tool again.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to re-deploy it, you can use the Office Deployment Tool to download updated versions of Office 365 ProPlus from the Internet to your local network. After it’s downloaded, you can place the updated version to the folder.</p>
<p>For more information, you can refer to the following articles.<br />

    <title>Weird battery behaviour on Lumia 1520 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stabes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird battery behaviour on Lumia 1520</h2>
                    <p>I've seen a few posts about strange battery behaviour on the Lumia 1520. I will add to the discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running OS 10586.164, my phone seems to behave completely differently on any given day. I've had the phone for about 18 months and have been running all the Win10 Mobile Insider previews, and up until this releease, my battery would easily last a day, sometimes
 as long as two days if I was very careful. Today for example, I unplugged the phone from its charger, it showed 100%. Within an hour it was down to 55%, and for the next 4 hours it's only drained another 3%. Weird.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the drain seemed to be as I'd expect when suddenly at 36% charge remaining, the phone warned me that the battery was critically low, and simply shut down. Incidentally, it has been doing this recently - no warning, just a message and then shut
 down. I always used to get a critical message at 5% remaining but I was allowed to continue to 0%. Now the phone simply shuts down.</p>
<p>As I said, one day the phone will run the battery down in 6 hours, the next day it could last an entire day -&nbsp;without me doing anything different in terms of usage. And of course the very odd battery charge levels being shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mart</p>

<p>1) All apps » Store » Options » Downloads: Are there any pending downloads?</p>
<p>2) All apps » Settings » Update » Phone update: Is there any pending update?</p>
<p>3) To determine the problematic app, did you try the app&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh58t2h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Diagnostic Hub</a>&nbsp;already?</p>

<p>5) All apps » Settings » Time &amp; language » Keyboard: Which keyboards are listed?</p>
<p>6) Are you using E-mail accounts via POP3 instead of IMAP or EAS?</p>

<p>3. No, but will.</p>
<p>4. Yes. No change.</p>
<p>5. English (US)</p>
<p>6. 4 POP3 accounts. Have always used these 4 POP accounts since using this phone, so that should not have changed battery usage.</p>

            Well, in the current OS build, there is a known regression that certain (all?) POP3 accounts do not sync correctly and therefore drain the battery. Therefore, please, remove all POP3 accounts and try again. Did that ‘fix’ your issue?

            <p>Being part of the Windows Insider Slow Ring, I updated to&nbsp;WM ver 14295.1000 at the beginning of last week.&nbsp;Behaviour is still the same. I keep thinking my battery is dying, but why would the phone just turn off with no power&nbsp;when there is still 36% reported
 on the battery level? When I restart the phone the battery level then reports 2%. Very strange.</p>

            <p>I doubt this POP3 issue is different in the current development branch, but I have not double-checked myself. Anyway, that software bug was not mentioned yet officially. That other issue with your percentage might indicate a hardware issue with the battery.
 If you are still within warranty, going back to Windows Phone 8.1 via the <a href="http://download-fds.webapps.microsoft.com/supportFiles/phones/files/recovery/WindowsDeviceRecoveryToolInstaller.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery Tool</a> might help to isolate that issue. Or stated differently: You might face two different issues here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, because you are part of the current development branch, I would go for the button Edit on my initial post and change the category to: Windows Insider Program » Preview » … » Phone.&nbsp;Simply to increase the visibility of your question.</p>

            <p>I wondered about that.&nbsp; But now it's Tuesday here.&nbsp; For us a long Thanksgiving weekend usually runs from Thursday (Thanksgiving day) through Sunday.&nbsp; Unless she took this whole week off.&nbsp; But I also saw the thread had been marked 'Answered', so I have become
 concerned that maybe she had done that and considered the issue closed.&nbsp; I have no way of telling for now if the lack of any further responses is because of that or just that maybe she's on vacation this week.&nbsp; And this forum site doesn't provide information
 for sending a message directly to someone.&nbsp; I find that frustrating.&nbsp; I'm sure it's to prevent users from overwhelming support people individually and I understand.&nbsp; However, that solution then also leaves someone like me at unsatisfactory disadvantage.&nbsp; I'm
 a legitimate Microsoft customer with a product problem and I have no formal way of helping myself confirm the status of the support process I'm working through with you all.&nbsp; I'm going to go further and say that this seems like a magnificant opportunity for
 an IT company like Microsoft to shine by recognizing that problem and coming up with a solution to it.&nbsp; I think that's what the big bucks should be going toward paying for! ;)</p>

</p><p>I install it off of my account page online. When I open something (say, Word) it asks me to give an email. I put it in, then follow the prompt to sign in. After I do that, the box goes away, and nothing happens. I can go through the process of signing in
 as many times as I like, and still nothing happens. If I open a document, it asks me to activate the product still. I've carefully typed all my information in again and again, and have used it to log in online to make sure it still works. My account only shows
 2 of my 5 installs used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also ran the Fix It tool to remove all software traces, and reinstalled. I get the same issue. Nothing seems to work. If anyone could help, that'd be great. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Either you have Office 365 <strong>Home</strong>, which does allow activation on 5 machines, or you really do have Personal, which allows activation&nbsp; on
<strong>only one machine at a time</strong>.&nbsp; From your description it sounds like you have Home.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please clarify which you have!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have Personal, you do have the option of playing "musical chairs", or computers in this case, with that one activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will install and activate normally on the first machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On subsequent machines, you have to log in to the MyAccount page, go to Install, then find the current machine it is active on and "deactivate" it.&nbsp; Only then can you continue with the install and activation on the next machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select the option to deactivate it from a machine, Office remains installed, but it is switched to limited function mode.&nbsp; You can open existing files and print them.&nbsp; You cannot edit/change existing files nor create new ones until you move the
 activation back to that machine. </p>

</p><p>According to this card that I used to activate my first copy of all the Word etc Office programs, it says Personal. and on my Microsoft account online it's also under Personal. However, under my Office account settings for my subscription, it says I have
 two installs used, shows both computers it's installed on, and activated and working well on both machines (the Win8.1 and Win10). It was installed on the two within an hour of each other, so I though maybe it got confused and didn't stop me from activating
 on the other, but since the site seems quite aware that I have it on two (with the names etc of both computers) I'm not sure what's up with that.</p>

</p><p>I guess if it was a fluke I'll just put Word Starter 2010 on this one though.</p>

            <p>Hey Missy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like you lucked out. Buy a lottery ticket.&nbsp; &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Office 365/2013 came out I've collected several similar posts. People with strange install counts. The "best" one was "8 of 5 used" on a 365 University license that only allowed 2 activations. Really.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't bother replaceing one of the 2 365 installations with 2010 Starter. Just keep using both machines until MS figures it out. Then you can add Starter. Enough other people have been ripped off by MS "losing" their licenses that you getting a bonus for
 a while is only a trivial restitution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: in this situation I would not recommend playing "musical chairs" to use 365 on the 3rd machine. That might eventually trigger the system to figure out you are getting the bonus.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: you don't have to reply separately, especially if you are just repeating the same comment. Everyone who provides replies gets a copy of all subsequent replies.</p>

            <p>Are you sure you are login in with the same email account on both machines, to access the same OneDrive?</p>
<p>
They should be able to "play together", so you should not have to replace 2013 with 365.&nbsp; Actually the apps in 2013 and 365 are supposed to be identical, so in theory this would not fix your problem.
</p><p>
</p><p>Actually, there is a published technique to attach 365 to an Office 365 installation so the apps do not depend on the internet connection...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly which model of Surface do you have? Is it the Pro or the RT (ReTard) model?&nbsp; RT apps are not identical to "Pro" or normal apps so maybe that is the issue.</p>

            <p>Rohn007,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. Much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my Surface Pro (Office 365) and Desktop (Office 2013) now seem to be accessing my OneDrive OneNote notebooks (though both were having trouble finding them and syncing for some reason). I hope opening and closing the notebooks has resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I bought Office 2013 last winter, I did not realize Office 365 would have been a better option if I was going to work using multiple devices. Live and learn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any downsides, however, in creating an extensive contact list and mail folders in Office 2013? Will I lose all this content if ever I decide to move to Office 365 for all devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot seem to find any specific info about installing 365 over Office 2013, including the pros and cons of doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>G.</p>

            <p>Glad you found a simple fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to the applications in Office 2013 they are essentially identical to the ones in Office 365.&nbsp; At least they started out identical. MS claims it will add "some new features" to 365 before updating them into the local install 2013/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cost benefit has been calculated to kick in around 3-4 computers assuming that you buy at the start of a release, like Jan 2013 for Office 2013 and now for 2016 and plan to buy the next version immediately when it is released. That also assumes you do
 not assign any value to the "extras" in 365 like skydrive space, skype time etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, there is no downside to using Office 2013 and the downgrading to Office 365.&nbsp; If you install over 2013, or even do the control panel uninstall, 365 applications will pick up customizations, like email, from the old version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already have paid to own 2013, there is no advantage to replacing it with 365.&nbsp; Actually there are some advantages to attaching 365 to a local install of 2013.&nbsp;

</p><p>Thank you Rohn007 for your comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, the OneNote syncing problems are back. Opening and closing OneNote notebooks on my desktop only helped one time. Now OneNote thinks my desktop computer is not connected to the internet (not true) and no notebooks will load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My online research tells me many others have experienced this problem, without getting a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably better to give up on OneDrive and do everything in OneNote locally. :-(</p>

            <p>There are 2 advantages to having a local install of Office attached to 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One is performance (granted, in most cases this is trivial). Although 365 apps are downloaded to your machine, they still have that connection through the internet for features you have not yet used. The local install is "all there" (if you have installed
 it that way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is independence from internet connections.&nbsp; 365 has to reconnect to the internet every 30-39 days.&nbsp; If it does not make that connection to MS, those trusting bean-counters at MS
<strong>ASSUME</strong> that your license has expired or been revoked and drop you into limited function mode, regardless of the time left on the keep-paying-forever-subscription. Anyone traveling to places where they don't have internet connections is S.O.L.
 .&nbsp; This problem was brought up specifically by a person who was looking to get the Military discounted package of 365.&nbsp; Many military users are regularly out of internet contact for extended periods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, turning on VPN breaking OneNote syncing does make sense.&nbsp; It appears to be another symptom of not having what MS considers a "good" internet connection.&nbsp; It seems that 365 simply cannot handle many types "indirect" internet connection well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We often see essentially the same issue when people are trying to install Office 365.&nbsp; If they do not have a wired&nbsp; connection directly to the internet they often get strange errors. The errors go away when they establish a wired connection, rather than
 using WIFI, (yes I know wifi is not a vpn, but it is also an indirect connection) or move from inside a corporate network using "Proxy" server.

<p>
</p><p>I will keep the Office 2013 desktop, but attach it to Office 365. I was hoping Office 365 would somehow get around Office 2013's inability to send an email using an Alias: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/how-to-send-emails-from-outlookcom-alias-in/91fe4b8a-4d67-4873-ba5d-db0fc5058a30?page=18</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe MS would be so unhelpful for small businesses which need to send professional looking emails using their business domain (work around is to use the Alias from outlook.com, but what a hassle!).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not only will Office 2013 not sync if I use a VPN, but I also cannot log onto Skype (this was before it went down worldwide today). If VPN does not work, this makes MS products unusable on the road, unless I am prepared to risk unsecured hotel wifi connections.

<p>Hi guys</p>
<p>I have 2016 on my PC, but no Publisher. Have purchased 365 and was wondering how to get Publisher, which is included in 365, without removing 2016? Could I just reinstall 365 over 2016 without loosing outlook settings, email etc; Could I extract Publisher
 only fro &nbsp;365 and install it in addition to 2016?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Simple answer is just install Office 365 "over" 2016.&nbsp; It will pick up the current settings and emails in outlook.</p>

</p><p>No, you cannot simply install Publisher from 365.&nbsp; MS has eliminated that option in 2016/365.

<h2>            E52 Message Editor&#58; Already in use &#40;error&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this message editor error in the E52?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this even before the FW update and even with the current FW 022. It still doesnt solve it. Whenever i try to reply to someone, it sometimes gives me a message box with an error message stating: message editor: already in use. I have tried to recreate
 the scenario but couldn't. i have also tried looking for patterns whenever it occurs but i haven't found one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anybody experienced this error too, was yours resolved after the FW update? Or is there anything that I can do to resolve it? It's really annoying. I bought this so i can make calls and send messages, other features come in second -- basic features should
 at least have been perfected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To all those who will share their inputs, i will be really grateful. Thanks!</p>

<p>hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>plz check whether the email application is running in the background. in the E52, i've noticed that until u explicitly exit the application by clicking 'exit', the application is left running in the background. it might be the cause since the email and text
 message application uses the same message editor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>We are using office 365. We found that when we received a calendar with attachment, we can see the attachment when we read our outlook calendar at our PC/laptop. However, when we use our mobile client, the attachment is not shown. Please advise how we can
 solve this problem. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Yoke KhuanChan,</p>
<p>To look into the issue, can you please confirm the following information?</p>
<p>1. By saying “when we received a calendar with attachment”, do you mean you the meeting request with attachment?</p>
<p>2. What’s the mail client in your mobile, the built-in mail app, Outlook for iOS/Android or OWA for iOS/Android?</p>
<p>3. Does the issue occur to all the meeting events or some specific ones?</p>
<p>4. If you remove your account and re-add it, does the issue persist?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Please see below reply for your questions:</p>
<p>1. By saying “when we received a calendar with attachment”, do you mean you the meeting request with attachment?</p>

<p>2. What’s the mail client in your mobile, the built-in mail app, Outlook for iOS/Android or OWA for iOS/Android?</p>
<p>Outlook for IOS/Android</p>
<p>3. Does the issue occur to all the meeting events or some specific ones?</p>
<p>All meeting events and happen to all users</p>
<p>4. If you remove your account and re-add it, does the issue persist?</p>
<p>no different</p>

<p>hi yoke,</p>
<p>thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>based on your description, we can determine the issue is related to the outlook for ios/android itself but not your office 365 account.</p>
<p>we have a dedicated support where you can use the in-app support to report any issues or feedback regarding the outlook for ios app. the relevant team would like to hear from you.</p>
<p>*note when using the in app support.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that the user turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.</p>
<p>2. if you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you should see a response from the technician.</p>
<p>3. it is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77bf2f1d-0804-45c8-81f1-9a34f29ee5f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77bf2f1d-0804-45c8-81f1-9a34f29ee5f6" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27cc2668-db66-4693-b145-9db8138ca9a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27cc2668-db66-4693-b145-9db8138ca9a2" /></a></p>

<h2>            Access 2016 Subview Control</h2>
                    
<p>hi,&nbsp;<br />
i have created a form which uses two subviews with related data from 2 separate queries.</p>
<p>as an example:</p>
<p>the first subview is of a datasheet of tasks that are due "today"</p>
<p>the second subview is of a datasheet of tasks that are "past due"&nbsp;</p>
<p>i setup a on click macro on the "past due" data sheet that adjusts the tasks due date from "past due" to "due today". after the macro executes, the past due subview refreshes and the record is removed. however the "due today" data sheet does not refresh.
 even though a new record was added to that query since there was nothing calling that query, it will not refresh. my question is, is there anyway to make a subview refresh from the main form that it lives on.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2011 crashed - lost identity database&#40;&#63;&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 crashed - lost identity database&#40;&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    I've serached this forum, but I believe all references to similar problems belong to older versions of Outlook than mine [v.14.3.7(130812)].&nbsp; I did try rebuilding the database but ended up with the error "your database could not be rebuilt [-18000]".&nbsp;
 I thought "Perfect! ... I have a recent backup of my identity folder!"&nbsp; However, when I copied that identity folder back to the computer, I still ended up with lost local email folders ( ... and rules, signatures, ...), and a lot of emails as far back as last
 year came streaming back into my inbox.<br />
<br />
Why in this day and age can I not backup everything in my user folder on a regular basis and expect something like my Outlook identity&nbsp; and files to be reliably saved??&nbsp; Of greatest importance are all the local folder that I used to save important correspondence
 that I hoped would be saved and backed up locally.&nbsp; I suspect they still exist in the original database which I duplicated--how do I get these back?<br />
<br />
TIA for your excellent support!<br />

            Outlook now supports Time Machine and incremental backups which somehow eases the pain for backups.
<div><br />
<div>I'm not 100% I understand exactly what's wrong with your restored identity.</div>
<div>In theory, if you restore the identity as a whole in ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities, Outlook should be able to see the restored identity and use it.</div>
<div>It sounds to me like it did that, but is missing some items.</div>
<div>Are the missing items e-mails you received after the last backup of files that should have been there?</div>
<div>If the later, launch Outlook pressing the Option key down to try and rebuild the restored identity (which might have had some corruption too)</div>

            Thanks Corentin for a prompt reply!<br />
<br />
The missing emails are what had been organized and retained locally off IMAP accounts, so they existed before the crash.&nbsp; I had local folders in which I would save emails after "purchases" or "registrations".&nbsp; These folders did return (some did not), but not
 all emails returned to these local folders, and I'm missing some important and relatively new emails.&nbsp; I can search the identity database for similar emails and find them in the archive, but while they are newer than anything in my current identity, they are
 located in strangely named subfolders (e.g., "OT").&nbsp; I can only suspect they are there and retrievable if I only knew how.<br />
<br />
My campus email IMAP account is severely limited for capacity, and I try to copy important emails to a local Outlook forder for saving them before I purge them from the IMAP account.&nbsp; These folders would have been names (e.g.) "MUN_2011_2", which happens to
 be the only one to return from the archive.&nbsp; I suspect the others are in the archive, but have no way of knowing for sure.<br />
<br />
I tried your "launch Outlook pressing the Option key", but no dialog opened--is it supposed to rebuild the DB in the background?&nbsp; In any case, the archive folders did no return.<br />
<br />
Another strange thing is that the "modified" date associated with the Identity folder is more than a year old, and is apparently really the creation date.&nbsp; Why doesn't the modification date change when Outlook writes to it??<br />
<br />
Thank you for your excellent support!&nbsp; :o)<br />

            If the e-mails pre-existed, then they should physically be in the backup. I wouldn't worry about the structure of folders and subfolders in there: it's a mess and not meant for "human intervention".
<div><br />
<div>Rebuilding the database forces Outlook to look at each and every file in the identity and remaps it where it should be, so if anything, this is the operation that could bring your e-mails back to life.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm surprised pressing the option key down didn't work. You're supposed to press the key as you double-click the icon application and keep it pressed until the app launches.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If that doesn't work, you can do it manually by launching:</div>

I was using the option key with single-clicking the Outlook icon in the taskbar.&nbsp; Opt-key + dbl-clicking the app worked, but I still get the message<br />

            That's an unusual error message. It could be the sign of a deeply corrupted database, but I was wondering… Do you have a lot of space left on the drive? It could be that the process is running out of space while it's attempting to rebuild.

<h2>            Excel 2016 document won&#39;t open in Excel 2007</h2>
                    <p>I work IT at a company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my end-users in Finance is trying to send a spread sheet to someone in her department.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently upgraded her to Office 2016. (Note: She is still running Office 2007 in some aspects)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person she is trying to send the document to has Excel 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the spreadsheet opens a window pops up that says "Excel found unreadable content in '-------.xlsx' Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click yes the spreadsheet pulsates from bright to dim and at the bottom it looks it's trying to "Open and Repair" the document with multiple attempts that go up to about "Attempt #16".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while it stops and another window pops up that says "The Workbook cannot be opened or repaired by Microsoft Excel because it is corrupt."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would just think that the file is corrupt but via trouble shooting I've found that some computers in our office are able to open the document just fine and some are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some specs about the computers: Some running Win 10 and some Win 7 all 64 bit. All have at least 4gbs of RAM. All of them were custom built by us and have similar hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOS!!!!</p>

                    When running the Windows 10, desktop, web based, or Android editions of Skype automated answering systems do not respond to Skype touch tones (A.K.A. DTMF). I have tried multiple versions, including "insider" or "preview" and different computers. I have
 also been reporting the issue to Skype for a couple weeks now via their feedback option. Is this a known issue?

<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, yes, this is a known issue. I would reccommend reporting it via the client, and doing so will let the Developers know just how many people this is affecting:-
<br />
<br />1) Launch Skype
<br />2) Click on your round profile picture at the top left hand corner of the screen.
<br />3) Scroll down to 'Help &amp; Feedback' and Select it 
<br />4) Scroll down and Select 'Report a Problem'

 bring it back?I make my own mess because I know how to get into root programs...I was looking for a local folder that wasn't showing up, so I right clicked on my user name and clicked on hidden and clicked on advance and made them all visible (now all is shared
 I think) But now, any personal preference that do throughout the computer doesn't save to anything because there no user name anymore except public. How do I reinstall or get it back, short of a complete reinstall, which I would lose a lot of work I installed
 already. Please help!

<p>I have linked data from an Excel worksheet to my Visio shapes, but am having difficulties with the Data Graphics.&nbsp; No matter what I select, my text is right-justified in the shape.&nbsp; I want it centered or left-justified, but it just won't do it.&nbsp; I've tried
 selecting other options, applying, then switching back to left-justified, but it remains right-justified no matter what I do.</p>

<p>Data Graphic items are defined as (hidden) Masters in the Document Stencil once they are defined for a drawing.&nbsp; In theory, you can edit the provided ones, and add your own.&nbsp; If you want to make significant changes, I suggest adding your own and leaving
 the default ones as they are, but any changes you make in a drawing will be local to the drawing.&nbsp; If you need to create your own Data Graphics / items, I would suggest reviewing the MSDN documentation from Visio 2007 here :<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa468596(office.12).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa468596(office.12).aspx</a></p>
<p>For a Text DG item, for instance, the text blocks for the Label field and the Data field are protected by formulas which calculate the position and size based on content.&nbsp; If you wish you can edit the Masters and replace the PARAGRAPH / HALIGN formulas with
 static formatting (such as Left or Center justification).&nbsp; However, you may find that the DG items no longer automatically adjust in relation to the shape or the other objects on a page, so proceed at your own risk.</p>

<h2>            Word&#39;s auto space management</h2>
                    I had a need to print barcode thru a doc file.I cud download the barcode fonts. They automatically convert the char string to barcode. but has a problem in printing due to Word's automatic adjustment of spacing between characters. Spacing is a parameter
 in barcode hence barcode printed thru Word are not being read. I have solved this problem by using wordpad. But any clue as to how to stop Word's auto space management. Any help on this please? Thanks

            I don't believe this is possible. To achieve this, you must use a monospaced font such as Courier New or Letter Gothic. Proportional fonts will never be evenly spaced.

Barcode character spacing is controlled by the barcode font itself, not by some other word feature.

            That would have been my assumption as well. And there are numerous barcode fonts, used for different purposes. In addition, I think some bar codes can't be created using a font alone (if they could, my clients have been wasting a lot of money ordering
 EAN-13 barcodes, though I see I have bookmarked a site, <a href="http://www.tux.org/~milgram/bookland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.tux.org/~milgram/bookland/</a>, that will generate them free).

In that case, I suspect the issue is that your barcoding is picking up extra characters (eg preceding/trailing spaces or a trailing paragraph break. Either that, or some odd formatting (eg bold font) has been applied. Check also that each end of the barcode
 range has an asterisk.</p>
<p>FWIW, I've found that embedding the barcode expression inside a QUOTE field, with a Charformat switch to apply the barcoding, works reliably. In field display view (controlled by pressing Alt-F9) such a field would look like:</p>
<p>{QUOTE "*123456789*" \* Charformat}</p>
<p>with only the 'Q' in 'QUOTE' barcoded in the size you want. You can create such a file manually by pressing Ctrl-F9 to create the outer pair of field braces, then typing the details, after which you press F9 again (with the insertion point in the field)&nbsp;to
 update the display.</p>

<h2>            Yosemite &#38; Office for Mac</h2>
                    <p>So far it appears that none of the Office programs work with X10.10.10 (beta 3)</p>
<p>after several reboots, they work for a bit (Excel, PowerPoint) but then crash.</p>

            <p>No one knows. Perhaps because V.10.10 is getting away from Objective C and C++ and going to swift code language . Maybe this is the reason why MS is Taking so long to come out with a new version. WE are coming up on the 4 year mark. I am hoping that MS doesn't
 decide the effort isn't worth it and decide to quit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then too, you have to remember &nbsp;that you are using a Beta system and their could be many changes before they come out with the finished product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are a beta Tester I'd recommend send report to Apple That the beta version you have is bombing out Office2011 and needs to be fixed before hitting the airwaves.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>VBA SumProduct With 2 Variables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roger pitcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA SumProduct With 2 Variables</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, Bernie gave me the answer to Subtotaling a vertical range subject to criteria in an adjacent vertical range</p>
<p>Disp4 is a Range E5:E1005 containing values</p>
<p>Disp3 is a Range C5:C1005 containing month names</p>
<p>Bernie's solution:- Debug.Print Evaluate("SUMPRODUCT(SUBTOTAL(109,OFFSET(Disp4,ROW(Disp4) - MIN(ROW(Disp4)), , 1)),--(Disp3 = ""January""))")</p>
<p>Work's perfectly - however, I tried to modify it to introduce 2 Variables - the month name &amp; the Subtotal formula number as in the Sub below</p>
<p>Sub SumProdWithVars()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim WF As WorksheetFunction ' ............................................. Abbreviate Application.WorksheetFunction<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim F As Single ' ................................................................. Variable "F" Is Formula Number For Subtotal - "101" Average - "109" Sum Etc<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim M As String ' ............................................................. Variable "M" Is Text For Criteria To Be Totalled - "January" - "February" Etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Rng1,Rng2 as Range ' ......................................... Variables "Rng1 &amp; Rng2" To Be The Target Ranges</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Rng1 = Range("Disp3") ' ................................... Set Rng1 To Be Range("Disp3")</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Rng2 = Range("Disp4") ' ............................... Set Rng2 Ro Be Range("Disp4")&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set WF = Application.WorksheetFunction ' ..... Abbreviate Application.WorksheetFunction<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F = 109 ' ...................................................... Set Formula To Be "Sum"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M = "January" ' ........................................ Set Criteria To Be "January"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print WF.SumProduct(WF.Subtotal(F, Rng2.Offset(Rng2.Row - WF.Min(Rng2.Row), , 1)), --(Rng1 = M))</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
I have messed with the syntax to no avail - it dont work!</p>
<p>Is what I am trying to do possible?</p>
<p>If so, what would the correct syntax be?</p>
<p>Thankyou in anticipation - Rog</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10547 - Upgrade stuck</h2>
                    <p>Hello there</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like I have a problem when upgrading my PC from build 10532 to 10547. The upgrade progress gets stuck at 93% overall (Configuring settings 75%) and it has been like that for around one hour or two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do but to wait impatiently and stare at the screen. I am considering staying on 10532 until the next 105xx build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hard drive light blinks, but it only blinks once every few seconds which causes me to worry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, a program called mcbuilder.exe opened before progress gets stuck there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any fixes for this issue, please reply below. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I have tried once to upgrade to Build 10547 and was stuck at the same point in the installation, which otherwise would have taken less than 1 hour to complete. I restarted the computer which rolled back to Build 10532 and have tried the upgrade again. It
 is STUCK at exactly the same point (93% completed and 75% configuring settings. The last build installation stuck at 99% complete and 96% configured. YOU ALL MUST TAKE MORE TIME WITH THIS ASPECT OF THE UPGRADES! Lots of time is lost, especially when there
 is very little information coming in with the new builds. I WAS NOT ABLE to view the information on the Insider Hub pertaining to this build! I generally like being an Insider, but these new builds need to have the bugs worked out of the installation process.
 I will check out the link to see if this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After viewing the link, it would appear to be a lot of work to get this upgrade to work. I am hoping that Microsoft takes a good look at this build and the problems with it and perhaps issue a revised update.</p>

            I also would like to know if there is an ISO for this build. I had better success installing previous builds from DVD. Perhaps, when new builds are ready, we should automatically be sent an e-mail with a link to the corresponding ISO. It seems like more
 than one of us has had problems upgrading via Windows update.

            <p>Build 10547 finished downloading on my desktop and my laptop at about 2 am this morning. &nbsp;At 7 this morning both installs were stuck at 97 percent. &nbsp;I restarted both computers and they were automatically rolled back to Build 10532.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 10547 is now downloading again on both computers. &nbsp;If it fails to install this time I will just stop insider builds...it isn't worth the hassle.</p>

            <p>I am also wondering if this upgrade would work better with a clean install. I was thinking about the sheer number of updates that have occurred as an insider and just wonder if there is something left from those updates that could be impacting this particular
 upgrade and the previous one for that matter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, is there a particular page where we can download ISOs of the current build. As mentioned above, I am thinking about trying a clean install. I am also wondering if I would need my old Windows 7 key in order to install it.</p>

            I agree! A lot of useful information and feedback is gathered from those of us who are insiders. It is a bit frustrating when one cannot run the newest BUILD. It would seem that there would be a great deal of time spent on testing the installation process
 and anticipating some of the problems beforehand. Furthermore, there probably should be more technicians on the forum when new BUILDS are released.

            <p>UPDATE: After having another yet failed upgrade, I am greeted by this error. The error is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xC1900101 - 0x4001E</p>
<p>The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during PRE_OOBE operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if this helps in any way towards the solution to the problem. This issue has actually happened to one of the earlier builds before, and it's back. So I have no idea why it's happening again.</p>

            I wonder how many are having trouble with the update have taken the time to look and see what changes they have done to the system since the last upgrade such as
<strong>Virus programs, Malware programs, speed boost programs</strong>, and other
<strong>3rd party software </strong>that has been added, Just saying, as I have 6 systems two on the public build, and 4 on the preview and all 4 upgraded with out a hitch, all 4 are running Defender and no 3rd party virus, malware, speed boost, I did install
 Google Chrome 64bit on 2 and 32bit on the other 2, all have Open Office, Libre Office, VLC (not the one from the store) and a few games from the store, all systems except 1 custom built are Dell OptiPlex 1,&nbsp;760 &nbsp;3, 780 all have E8400 cpu's with 4gig of ddr3
 memory, and 500 Gig spinners HD.

    <title>Why does my picture quality diminish on export or printing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does my picture quality diminish on export or printing&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I work in Publisher, the image quality is fine, yet upon export to PDF or printing, the quality diminishes drastically to the point that the text in the image is illegible. The native text prints fine, so it is not an issue with my printer or
 with Adobe.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.S. this issue would not be so bad for me if there was an equation writer in Publisher like there is in Word

            <blockquote>I am using Publisher 2010, on Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium.
<div>To export to PDF, I am using the "Save as PDF" option under File.</div>
<div>I am not given a quality option.</div>
<div>I have Adobe Acrobat X Pro.</div>
<div>The images are exports of formulas typed in the Insert Formula Tool in Microsoft Word 2010.</div>
<div>They are small, as in 1 KB each, but I cannot find a way to see the dpi for the images&nbsp;within&nbsp;publisher.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your response.</div>

It sounds like you are using Acrobat to create the pdf. Try using the Office tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to File &gt; Save &amp; Send &gt; Create PDF/xps &gt; below 'save as type' look for 'optimize for' and the options button and choose 'high quality' or 'commercial'.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can save the formula images as .png files by right clicking them in Word, save as a picture and specifying a png, then insert into Pub, you might get better results.</p>
