<p>2. !!! DO NOT CREATE EA ACCOUNT ON PC... See next step.... !!!</p>

<p>Yeah its stupid you cant log into EA from your xbox on BF3. Half the folk playing the game cant get on battlelog. You can also use games like tigerwoods.etc... &nbsp;</p>
<p>EA did have a page that you just add your xbox persona to your account but it hasnt been working since BF3 was released!!!!</p>

<p>You have to make sure your Origin email is the same as your Xbox Live Email. If you have an email associated with your Origin account that is different from your XBL account, then its not possible.</p>
<p>I had to create a new Origin account. They can change your XBL email to match your existing Origin account, but you loose all of your DLC and Gamerscore associated with your XBL. So I recommend having two Origin accounts instead. The lesser or two evils.
 Sucks monkey balls.</p>

    <title>windows 7 cannot resolve ip addresses from domain names - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakusus  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 cannot resolve ip addresses from domain names</h2>
                    I have a desktop that I built from components purchased at a major computer store. &nbsp;I've had this system running fine for several months, now. &nbsp;Recently, however, I encountered an issue with one of the 2gb memory modules. &nbsp;I removed it (as it turned out
 to be defective) and, shortly AFTER removing it, have another issue with internet access domain name resolution. &nbsp;I should say that I also have installed my old Windows XP as an alternate OS and updated it to sp3 (this is, in fact, what I'm using to access
 the internet and write this query). &nbsp;As you can see, in XP I have no problems with name resolution or internet access. &nbsp;There are two other systems connected to this home network via wi-fi (one running Windows Vista and the other a tablet PC running Windows
 XP Tablet Edition) and neither of them have any problems accessing the internet. &nbsp;I have ran ipconfig /release and then /renew with no result.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have done all of the following: netsh winsock reset catalog</div>
<div>&nbsp;netsh int ip reset reset.log</div>
<div>&nbsp;netsh int ipv6 reset reset.log. &nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>Still no access.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I opened regedit and went to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters and set the following registry value:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Value Name: IPEnableRouter</div>
<div>Value Type: &nbsp; REG_DWORD</div>
<div>Value Data: 1 (this is the only value I changed - from 0 to 1)</div>
<div>I then quit regedit and rebooted...still no access. &nbsp;BTW: I've now noticed that this entry (IPEnableRouter), nor any of its values, no longer even exists in my registry. &nbsp;I believe this has something to do with my Cisco Linksys E1000 router changing settings
 to enable me to access my home network. &nbsp;Also, even though it says I'm connected to my home network and router, I cannot see the other two computers in the network, only the items that I share from my desktop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've changed the "Preferred DNS server" to 208.67.222.222 as instructed in a possible solution I found on the web (in XP, of course) and, when that didn't work, changed it to 208.67.220.220 as instructed, but nope. &nbsp;Still nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can access any website...IF I KNOW THE IP ADDRESS! &nbsp;Unfortunately, my mind isn't powerful enough or endowed with enough RAM to remember all the IP addresses that I ever go to, let alone every single IP address in the internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I'd remembered to I would've copied to notepad (so I could then copy to here) the results of an ipconfig /all command, but I didn't. &nbsp;If that will help, let me know and I'll retrieve it and post it. &nbsp;I do know that some of the errors I've received are
 "Windows could not automatically detect this network's proxy settings" and "Registration of DNS records failed. &nbsp;The parameter is incorrect" and "An error occurred while releasing interface Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1: The system cannot find the file specified."</div>
<div>Some of the results from an ipconfig /all command I did write down, such as those that stuck out as strange or possibly wrong. &nbsp;They are as follows:</div>
<div>IP Routing Enabled: NO</div>
<div>WINS Proxy Enabled: NO</div>
<div>Host Name: (Blank)</div>
<div>Primaty DNS Suffix: (Blank)</div>
<div>Node Type: Hybrid</div>
<div>DNS Suffix Search List: kc.rr.com (yes, I use Road Runner through Time Warner and no, they weren't able to help, at all)</div>

<div>Other results:</div>
<div>Tunnel adapter isatap.kc.rr.com</div>
<div>Media State: Media disconnected</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tunnel adapter Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface</div>
<div>Media State: Media disconnected</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please keep in mind that all other computers connected to this wireless router have no issues with accessing the internet and this computer can access it in Windows XP, just not Windows 7. &nbsp;This means there is nothing wrong with the router and nothing
 wrong with the wireless network adapter. &nbsp;Besides, I've tried rebooting the router and even resetting it (much to the chagrin of my significant other as she was not pleased about not being able to access the internet until I was finally able to re-install
 the router!). &nbsp;I've also turned my system off, removed the wireless adapter card, waited for about 15mins, re-inserted it into the PCI slot, and turned the system back on. &nbsp;This, of course, didn't do anything, either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After searching for many days and trying various tactics and fixes as suggested all over the web, I am at the end of my limited knowledge and patience with this issue. &nbsp;Any help that will fix this and allow my Windows 7 to access, again, the internet would
 be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;As a last resort I may have to re-install Windows 7, but I've also read posts where others have done this, but to no avail. :(</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>

            Actually, I have since fixed my issue. &nbsp;Believe it or not it wasn't any major, detailed process. &nbsp;It was a very simple thing that NONE of the resolutions I read about even suggested might be the cause, so I didn't even think to check it. &nbsp;Apparently, at
 some point about a week ago, or so, something erased my COMPUTER'S NAME! &nbsp;I forgot how I found this out, but I think I was going to my device manager by right-clicking "Computer" icon and selecting "Properties" and happened to notice that, under "Computer
 name, domain, and workgroup settings", the "Computer name:" and "Full Computer name:" fields were blank!
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;SO, I clicked "Advanced system settings" on the left of the properties window, selected the "Computer Name" tab (1st one at the top on left of the window that popped up) and, down at "To rename this computer, click Change."&nbsp;I clicked the "Change..."
 button.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next window that popped up I re-entered the name I'd originally selected for my desktop, clicked the "More..." button and entered "kc.rr.com" in the "Primary DNS suffix of this computer:" field (as this is my Internet Service Provider - others
 may be different) and made sure the "Change primary DNS suffix when domain membership changes" checkbox was checked.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;I then clicked okay on that window. &nbsp;I then made sure the "Workgroup:" radio button was selected and typed "WORKGROUP" into the field under it, then clicked "OK".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the original "System Properties" window I clicked "Apply" and "OK", then rebooted my system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;As Windows 7 was loading, suddenly all these programs that had been dormant for the past few days started popping up and loading and updating! &nbsp;YAY!! lol</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the reason I went into detail on how I fixed this is in case anyone else has this same issue, they can check and, if the computer name has also been deleted, follow these steps to correct the issue. You will, of course, have to contact your service
 provider (if other than Road Runner through Time Warner) to obtain the primary DNS suffix. &nbsp;Hopefully this will help others not have to go through the terror I went through from not having internet access. &nbsp;Aaaaarrrrggghh!! &nbsp;I GOTTA have my internet! lmao</div>

            I think it's very good, but I liked Windows 8 as well.<br />
<br />
8.1 adds boot to desktop if you want it, better Skydrive integration, and unifies the desktop and Metro sides a little more. For instance, your wallpaper is not visible on the Start Screen, giving a slightly more uniform experience.
<br />
<br />
Basically if you like Windows 8, you'll probably like 8.1 as well. If you don't care for 8, the improvements might not change your mind.<br />

<h2>            Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware &#40;Code 37&#41;. Unable to use Microsoft Wireless Receiver.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Xbox360 Wireless Receiver Driver issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows XP, Service Pack 3, I bought the Microsoft Wireless Receiver, installed it with the packaged disk, and after install, in Device Manager it is recognized, but shows the yellow exclamation. Under Device Status I receive this message"Windows cannot
 initialize the device driver for this hardware. (Code 37)". I have tried downloading the newest driver from Microsoft and running it, but no changes. Uninstall reinstall, nothing. Always tells me Windows cannot initialize the driver. I tried removing all hardware
 connected to usb ports but the receiver, even bought a powered usb hub. Still no change. Contacted Microsoft support twice, only gave me the usually generic response, didn't even address my issue. Please someone help!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Asgardfury,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s try these steps &amp; check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1</span></span></strong><span><br />
<br />
<span>a) If you have installed any software for the Wireless Receiver, you may uninstall it from Add &amp; remove programs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to change or remove a program in Windows XP</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Additionally, also uninstall the drivers of the Wireless Receiver from device manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>a.</strong> Click on ‘Start’, type devmgmt.msc in ‘Run’ box and hit Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;In device manager, expand the
 wireless controller listed in the device list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c.</span></strong><span> Right click on it, click on
 Uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to manage devices in Windows XP</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also run System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer which will replace the missing or corrupt files. Then check if the
 issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To do this, follow the steps given below:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><span><span>Click the Start button.</span></span></li><li><span><span>From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories.</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option.</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the ‘Command Prompt’ window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter.</span></span></li><li><span><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Be patient because the scan may take some time.</span></span></li><li><span><span>If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Windows XP CD for this process to continue.</span></span></li><li><span><span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity
 violations".</span></span> </li><li><span><span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></li></ol>

            Thank you for the response Cari, yes I have. I tried removing from Add/Remove programs, as well as uninstalling from Device Manager. I then scan for hardware changes and first a bubble pops up saying "Found New Hardware Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows.
 " Then, a few seconds later, A second bubble pops up saying "A problem occured during hardware installation. Your new hardware might not work properly." I then try running the driver update, but to no avail. This is the most frustrating thing. I have now sent
 back and forth 3 messages with Microsoft Support, and all they send is the same generic response. Worthless.

<p>Got yet another reply from Microsoft. Here it is....and nope, didnt work.</p>
<p><span><span>Please try&nbsp;choosing to manually locate and install the drivers.&nbsp;Choosing 'have disk' and navigating to "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Xbox 360 Accessories\Xusb21.inf" and choosing
 the appropriate driver.&nbsp;Check if it will resolve your concern. If after doing the said steps and still you are unable to use your&nbsp;Xbox 360 wireless gaming receiver, you may need to call our phone support&nbsp;line directly so that further assistance can be provided&nbsp;to
 you regarding your concern.</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>when I do this, after selecting the driver, it starts to run the setup then a message pops up saying A problem occured during installation etc..&nbsp; Can anyone tell me
 why?!?</strong> <br />

            For anyone that might be having the same problem, I wiped my HD, reinstalled windows and everything works fine now. Obviously there was some kind of registry problem, but alas, no one at Microsoft had a clue how to fix it. Now I just need to spend some
 time loading my HD back up with my stuff and I'm golden! Thanks to the ONE person who responded. Too bad micro gave up on me after the first attempt. Nice.<br />

    <title>How do I uninstall the internal webcam and mic, every time I use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> solace the white wolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I uninstall the internal webcam and mic, every time I use device manager, they reinstall by themselves.</h2>
                    A friend recently wanted me to get skype, but I don't want them to be able to see, or hear me, only for me to see and hear them. I am trying to use device manager to completely uninstall my built in mic and camera, but when I do, it disappears as though
 it worked, and then reappears when I select scan hardware for changes, how is it reinstalling itself on its own, and how do I stop it, because I never use either device.<br />

            Well, problem with this is, uninstalling was my last resort already. You see, the webcam and mic seem to be force detected by skype even when disabled. Another thing is, it isn't privacy I am concerned about, I want to communicate in a way that I get video/audio
 from them, but they receive none from me, one way conversation, basically, I want skype to act as it would if I had no webcam or mic, since I only got skype because my friend hates typing. Specifically, I communicate with him in my world of warcraft game,
 but he wants to communicate through voice. Unfortunately, my relationship with him is based on illusion, I don't want him to hear my voice, or see my face, but I do want to hear and see him. So what I ask, is that since disabling the drivers seems to be ignored
 by skype, is there a way to prevent skype from recognizing my webcam and mic?<br />

<h2>            unmountable boot volume stuck in &#34;Choose your keyboard layout&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I have had Windows 10 for about 3 months and up until now it has been great. A few days ago, there was an automatic update with the windows security and adobe security. After that update, my desktop became really slow in responding in simple commands
 such as keystrokes. So I checked my CPU usage and ran an anti-virus software, and they checked out ok. I figure that the updates must be the issue since that problem started after the updates took affect. I uninstall the updates. The next morning, I wake up
 to my computer being at a blue screen that says "Choose your keyboard layout". </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33945821-61d8-4a1a-a976-7c96ed6080cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33945821-61d8-4a1a-a976-7c96ed6080cb" /></a>There
 is a list of options, but my keyboard and mouse is non responsive. I seem to not get pass this point. I try restarting my computer and windows says there was an issues and that they will need to restart my computer, and it ends up here. I reviewed other people
 having similar issues, but none of there solutions worked for me because I have a Dell XP Studio desktop. If anyone can help that would be great. Thanks.</p>

            I did attempt to boot from CD drive with the link that you provided. It did seem to do something differently at first, but eventually it ended up back at the "Choose your keyboard layout". It doesn't give me these options or any option at all. Once the
 software (windows) starts running, it attempts to fix the issue or issues itself and fails every time. I even tried to boot with a Windows 7 disc and that never finishes reinstalling. It always get stuck.

<p>My dad recently changed the setting on my C drive to make it more private when I was using a shared network.&nbsp; Unfortunately, something he did made it so I can no longer access my drive.&nbsp; When I check the owner of the drive it says it is "unable to display
 current owner."&nbsp; The blue and yellow shield are on all the edit and security buttons making it impossible for me to click them.&nbsp; I have even tried reinstalling windows from my disk, but the computer says I am not authorized to do this.</p>
<p><br />
Other things I have tried:<br />
Using command prompt: takeown /f C:\ and then when that didn't work, C:\ /G everyone: F</p>
<p>I even set up the built-in administrator account, but the blue shields are on the buttons there too.<br />
<br />
I do hope you can help,&nbsp; I am quite desperate at this point!</p>

    <title>Will the Zoo Limit be increased anytime soon&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will the Zoo Limit be increased anytime soon&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing this game too much or something because it bugs me that the zoo limit is so low. I'm pretty sure other players feel the same way since this topic is found on other boards and communities too.</p>
<p>Anyway, are there plans to update the game so that the limit is increased anytime soon?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game was developed by Frontier Development and published by Microsoft Studios. I'm not sure who's responsible for future content and updates and neither have responded to players about it.</p>

<p>I've been wondering this too. I think the limit should stay in campaign mode but should be removed or increased for free mode. Free mode already has infinite money so that way you'd be keeping the campaign challenging (I thought it had just the right amount
 of difficulty when I played through it - not too easy and not too hard) whilst pleasing those that want sprawling zoo's in free play.
</p>
<p>Maybe soon we will get an answer *hopes* :P</p>

<p>The problem is Frontier tells us to contact Microsoft and Microsoft tells us to contact Frontier. It's an endless circle that results in no answers.</p>
<p>The Zoo Limit should definitely be addressed in the Xbox One version of the game given the specs compared to the Xbox 360. At the very least for the Free mode as previously suggested.</p>
<p>It's a fun game but trying to farm/max/maintain a big/varied Zoo is impossible.

<p>The zoo limit is a game breaker for me.

<p>Exactly. &nbsp;Having to sell habitats to put in smaller habitats is stupid. &nbsp;Every damn zoo ends up looking the same since you need to optimize and only put in small enclosures. &nbsp;Ridiculously poorly thought out game. &nbsp;Could have been so much more</p>

    <title>Canon Digital Professional ver 4 has a problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oddzon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon Digital Professional ver 4 has a problem</h2>
                    I use Windows 10 on my pc and I have downloaded and installed Canon Digital Professional version 4 software to use with the images from my Canon camera, however, I cannot run it. Every time I try to use it, it loads OK and then I get the following message:
 'Digital Photo Professional 4 has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.' Does anyone have any idea how I can correct this problem? Incidentally, version
 3 works OK but judging by the wording of the message, I guess Windows 10 is closing the version 4 program because something is incompatible or some small program like flash player is missing. Is there a tool/program I can run that looks at this sort of problem?
 Has anyone else had a similar problem?

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hi</p>
<p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>I have tried several times to run version&nbsp;4, but, I have never got it to open, Windows says there is a problem and shuts it down.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 version is 1703 and the OS Build is 15063.726</p>
<p>As far as I am aware the Windows 10 computer is up to&nbsp;date and uses the automatic OS updating process.</p>
<p>In the email I received you also asked 'Have you checked for updated driver from Canon's website for this software?' The answer&nbsp;is yes, I downloaded their latest software today, but, whilst it loads, again windows says there is a problem and shuts it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to any suggestions you might have</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>

<p>Hello, <br />
<br />
After reading through the thread, it does seem to be due to a possible incompatibility between the two software.
<br />
<br />
Since you've stated that you've been having this issue and still can't launch the said software in Windows 10, we recommend checking with the software developers of Canon Digital Professional as they could have a workaround or provide a more established resolution
 to this hindrance. <br />
<br />
Moreover, make sure all drivers are all up to date. We recommend manually downloading the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s website to make sure the one installed on your PC is updated. Outdated or incompatible drivers could cause issues such as this
 one. Here's an article for guidelines: </p>

<h2>            Connecting to an HDMI computer monitor w&#47; built-in speakers&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm sorry if this is a little redundant but I just wanted to get a definitive answer before I go out and spend any money. I wanted a smaller TV to bring to college with me, but not to watch cable TV. I wanted to be able to hook up my Xbox 360 so I could
 play games and watch Netflix. I'm afraid hooking it up to a small non-HD tv with the standard component cables won't give me a clear enough picture to make it worth while, so I'm considering getting a larger (and cheaper, yet still slim) alternative - a computer
 monitor. I know if the monitor doesn't have built in speakers, you'll have to use the HDMI cable for the video and then the red and white component cables plugged into a seperate speaker set for audio. That seems like a big hassle, so I was wondering if I
 get a monitor with built-in speakers, will plugging in the HDMI cable give me both audio and video?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>Yeah it will. I game on a 1080p monitor with built in speakers. I use HDMI obviously, but I recently got a 360 E so I use the 3.5mm jack on that, with a decent bass unit and speakers, to provide the sound, and I've muted the monitor.</p>
<p>Doesn't seem to matter how good the monitor is... the sound is pretty tinny on them. Up-side is, when they have speakers, they also have a headphone jack, so if you have a decent set you should get rich quality sound and be fine.
</p>
<p>My monitor is insanely slim... I guess there's not a lot of room for quality speakers. I'd suggest you get a demonstration of the monitor's sound before you throw down your cash though. {=D</p>

<p>Thanks so much! One more question, when you connect the monitor and the xbox with the HDMI cord and turn the monitor on, the xbox home screen should be there, right? With the TV I know I have to change the input setting before I get a picture, but since
 the HDMI will be the only thing plugged in I should be good?</p>

<p>Yeah that's right. New monitors go on standby when whatever is plugged in is switched off and the monitor can't find anything to display. So when you turn on your 360 your monitor will fire up too - you won't even have to touch it. =)</p>

    <title>What is this Folder and can I delete the subfolders without messing up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meyouknowwho  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is this Folder and can I delete the subfolders without messing up my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Pro 64bit. I have noticed the following folder.</p>
<p>C:\Users\(MyName)\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Tiles</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "Tiles" folder contains several dozen subfolders all beginning with name&nbsp;"pin" followed by several numbers (each folder has a different set of numbers after the letters "pin").</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I deleted all these subfolders before. Several months ago, I had a technician to reinstall Windows because Explorer got corrupted. I have not deleted any of these "pin" subfolders since then. The earliest dated one goes back to that date when Windows
 got reinstalled several months ago. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The files in the "pin" subfolders are either a single file named "misapplication.xml" or 3 files, which are the "misapplication.xml" file and 2 .png files: "hires.png" and "logoimage.png" Some of the pin subfolders have just the .xml file, and some have
 all three. I have opened and viewed the .xml files, and they appear to be remnants of Internet Explorer website codes, sites I have visited probably on the date when the .xml file was modified or created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .xml files seem to refer to shortcuts I saved on those dates. But I saved them as actual internet shortcuts (URLs) and not "pinned" links. So, I don't know why they are in folders named "pin" (followed by the numbers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it ok to delete these "pin" folders (but keep the "Tiles" upper level folder, of course). Does this happen everytime an internet shortcut is saved, whether a URL or a pinned link? These .xml and .png files seem totally useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for replies. Please use simple English, because I don't understand complex tech talk.</p>

<p>Hi, Shawn. Thanks for replying.&nbsp; You use the word "pinned." But I never use the pinning function. I never save shortcuts as pin-type files. I don't like pin files. I always press "shift" before I drag the URL from the browser address bar, to the location
 where I want to "save" the shortcut (whether in my "favorites" pane or to a folder of research files, etc.).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked open some of these "pin-" folders to see the shortcuts. I experimented by deleting the most recent one from my favorites files (from the favorites pane, left side of my browser). I then closed all browser windows, reopened IE 11, and tested the
 favorites shortcut. It still worked. It still opened the web page ok. So, I'm not convinced that deleting these "pin" folders and the .xml files in them will cause all those "saved" (not "pinned") shortcuts to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I back up all my favorites to an external drive, then delete all my favorites from my resident hard drive ("C"), then delete all those "pin" folders, I can restore all my favorite shortcuts from my back up drive. Or if I don't delete all my favorites
 from my resident HD, but just delete all the "pin" folders, I believe the URL shortcuts will still work. But if they don't, I can restore them from my back up drive, and they will work. I've done that before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saying that a URL shortcut will not work because its "pin" folder got deleted does not make sense. If I use a URL from a back up drive (flash drive, etc.) without first copying it to the resident hard drive, the URL will still work and open the web page
 on my resident HD. I don't need to have an already existing "pin" folder with an .xml file in it, to make the URL shortcut work from the back up drive to open a web browser and web page on my resident HD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another reason I don't believe that deleting the "pin" folders will cause the shortcuts to fail is that I back up all my files regularly, including my "favorites" folder. On my back up drives, I usually keep the last few back ups. Those backed up copies
 of the shortcuts URLs still work even if I've deleted the originally saved copy of the shortcut from my resident hard drive ("C" drive).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is the issue of those "pin" folders and their .xml files remaining in the "Tiles" upper level folder, after I've deleted the URL shortcuts from my favorites folder (or wherever I originally saved them to). I looked at the oldest ones, from the
 date when Windows was reinstalled, some of the favorites shortcuts that come with IE 11. I don't use some of them, so I deleted them. But their "pin" folder remains&nbsp;under the "Tiles" upper level folder. So, does that mean, even if I delete some URL shortcuts,
 their "pin" folder does not automatically delete? Some of them, I delete because I no longer want them, and I don't want them&nbsp;cluttering my hard drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to recall why I don't like "pinned" shortcuts. One reason is that their properties box would not show me the original internet location (the URL). I want that information. (I've used Windows since version 3.1, and I'm used to having various
 information available. I don't like newer versions of Windows that take away user capabilities and that hide information from us.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, can you please explain your original reply more thoroughly, or help me understand further, based on my reply here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I tried an experiment. I deleted the shortcut URL (not a "pinned" link, which I don't use) from my favorites folder. Then I deleted its "pin-" subfolder under the TILES upper level folder. I closed all browsers and ran CCleaner (to clear out any cache of
 that web site or that URL shortcut). Then I copied the backup of that shortcut URL from my flash drive back to my hard drive favorites folder. I&nbsp;clicked the link, and it opened an IE 11 browser window and went right to the web page. It worked. I looked to
 see if a new "pin-" folder was created under the TILES upper level folder. A new "pin" folder does not appear for that shortcut URL. But the new copy (from the backup drive) now exists on my resident hard drive ("C") and is working fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the "pin" folders are not necessary for the shortcut URLs to work. I think the "pin" folders are simply obscure folders that are similar to Temporary Internet Files (TIF).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Tiles\pin folders seem to serve no significant purpose other than leaving a trace (trail) of saved and pinned web sites. It's another location where a computer user's privacy can be traced, and many users are not even aware that the folder exists and
 is keeping track of their saved or pinned sites. The Tiles\pin folders remain even after the shortcuts are deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, since I don't like saving internet shortcuts as "pinned" files, and always try to save them as actual "internet shortcuts" (URLs), I also don't pin anything to my taskbar. Instead,&nbsp;I save shortcuts of program and app .exe files to the taskbar.

<p>Shawn, thanks for your reply. Your wording is rather more technical than I'm familiar with. However, I think the gist of your meaning is that you agree with what I wrote in my most previous response. These Tile\pin folders containing the .xml (and sometimes
 .png) files are something like browser cache for occasions when URL shortcuts are saved to Windows Favorites.&nbsp; And if I delete the "pin" folders, or even the entire "Tiles" upper level folder, that action will not damage my saved URL shortcuts in my Favorites
 folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also aware of the separate folder for pinned shortcuts in the folder you mentioned above. I frequently check that folder and delete all the pinned shortcut cache there. I do not like the pinned feature at all. To me, it is useless and annoying. If I
 make a shortcut from a web page, I want a properties box that shows the internet address. The pinned shortcuts do not display such properties. (I do understand that items other than internet URL's can be pinned. But I use .lnk shortcuts for program and app
 shortcuts to executable files, to open programs. I think the "pinned" feature is a dumbed-down feature.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tried one last experiment. I saved some URL shortcuts directly from the IE 11 browser address bar to folders other than the Favorites folder. I used "shift" plus click &amp; drag (to make it a true URL shortcut and not the useless "pinned" type). I looked
 in the Tiles\pin folders. No .xml file or pin folder was created for the URL shortcut I saved to a folder that is not the Windows Favorites folder. Then I clicked the "saved" (not "pinned") URL shortcut in the folder, and it opened the browser window and web
 page ok. This would be essentially the same as if I were using URL shortcuts on an external drive, or recopying the URL shortcuts from a backup drive to my resident hard drive "Favorites" folder. There&nbsp;are no "Tiles\pin" folders and no .xml files being created
 in these instances. And yet, the URL shortcuts work just fine, as normal. Hence, the "Tiles\pin" folders containing the .xml files are not essential, not necessary, and it is ok to delete them. (Again, they exist only to provide a way to trace user activity.
 And many users, if not most, are unaware of these folders.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for replying, even though you didn't definitely answer my question, as to whether it's ok to delete these "pin" subfolders under the "Tiles" folder, without damaging the Favorites shortcuts. But I think I am correct. It is ok to delete them.
 The Favorites URL shortcuts will still work as normal.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You may think that when you set your Internet Options to delete temporary internet files when you exit your internet browser, but Windows merely saves the stuff in lower-level caches, even in folders that deny user access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Microsoft builds a trace of everything you do, every web site you visit, every document, picture and video that you open, etc. ... then probably illegally feeds it to the FBI and NSA overnight, unbeknownst to you.&nbsp; After all, why does the hard
 drive access indicator light blink constantly when you are doing nothing?&nbsp; No, it's not automatic de-fragging of your hard drive ... it occurs all the time, even when your hard drive is 100% de-fragmented.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 running extremely slow after updates.</h2>
                    I have a new computer running Windows 7 Home premium x64. My computer is running extremely slow. At first it was only showing a black screen with a removable cursor so I thought it had crashed. The manufacturer recommended reinstalling the OS so I did
 it seemed to be working fine until the last set of updates. Now the problem is back. It takes several minutes for a mouse click to take effect. Every time I try to click on an application I get the rotating circle for 3 or 4 minutes. Also, all my virus and
 spyware stuff is turned off and inoperable. Computer usage is only around 5%.

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did you upgrade to Win7 or is it a new computer?</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application or a McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>Assuming the preinstalled Norton free-trial period had NOT expired by the time you replaced it with (and/or purchased a subscription for) Norton Security Suite...</p>
<p>Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not upgrading (or uninstalling) cleanly.</p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. If a Step says to reboot, reboot.]</strong><br />
<br />
1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:&nbsp; 
<span>ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</span></p>
<p>2. Close any open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall all Norton software (including&nbsp;<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> and any&nbsp;<strong>Norton Add-ons)</strong> via
<strong>Control Panel | Programs | Uninstall a program</strong> (or&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel | Programs and Features</strong>, if using Classic view).</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Enable the Windows Firewall immediately after rebooting.<br />
<br />
<strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING else online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!</strong></p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.&nbsp; Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Do a clean install of&nbsp;Norton Security Suite&nbsp;(using your Product ID, if need be)&nbsp;&amp; reboot;&nbsp;cf.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE: Do&nbsp;NOT enable or install any Norton Add-ons (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.<br />
<br />
</strong>7. Manually and repeatedly run (Norton) LiveUpdate until you get a "no more updates" prompt.</p>
<p>8. Reset IE Advanced settings&nbsp;per &nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings</a></p>
<p>9. Open Internet Explorer (32-bit) only&nbsp;to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a> [ignore APPLIES TO section] &amp; run the Fix It in DEFAULT and then AGGRESSIVE modes. [1]</p>
<p>10. Reboot one last time&nbsp;&amp; test.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
[1] Full Disclosure: Running the Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode will delete your Update History but not the list of Installed Updates.</p>

            Thank you all for the suggestions, but my computer is running so slow that I have not been able to do any of them. I had to do a system restore back to the factory settings, then I started on PA Bear's steps. I have done steps 1-7 and now I am in the process
 of performing the 90+ updates. When I did this yesterday the computer was fine up until the last few so I unchecked those and will attempt to create a restore point there before I finish the updates. I think that the malicious software tool might have something
 to do with the problem that I am having. What do you guys think?

<p>A1a. 90+ updates is a lot of updates! When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>A1b. Had the preinstalled Norton free-trial period&nbsp;already expired by the time you replaced it with (and/or purchased a subscription for) Norton Security Suite?</p>
<p>A2. If the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) caused a problem, it was because your computer was infected and the&nbsp;MSRT detected &amp; removed at least some of the infection(s).</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

the quality of the media center interface (and windows itself) is great - it's running at 1920x1080. however, the quality of video playback is lacking. it's perfectly watchable but if i stream the same video direct from the tv (using dlna) then the quality
 is much higher.<br />
is there anything i can do to improve the quality using the media center interface as it's definitely the interface of choice.
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>thanks for the response.</p>

</p>
<p>1. I used to watch all videos through media center, but since I upgraded my TV to a DLNA compatible device I've noticed the difference, so it has always been this way with the current setup</p>
<p>2. No changes (apart from a more powerful graphics card - HIS ATI Radeon HD5450)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the output from media center is fine and I wouldn't be asking the question if it wasn't for the option of DLNA. I'm just wondering why the DLNA route produces a better quality output than using media center. It's possible it's to do with the way the TV handles
 the VGA input (although the media center interface is very high quality) or perhaps the graphics card/CPU can't quite handle the files (no noticeable high CPU during playback).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'll try the original graphics card and see if there's any difference.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>cheers</p>

This was a desktop that I had a problem with. &nbsp;It went though the download of the update and said restart. &nbsp;I selected restart now and it just hung up on do not turn computer off for over an hour and fifteen minutes. &nbsp;Saw online to turn it off with power and
 it rebooted at that point. &nbsp;Downloaded update the second time and if worked fine but it did take a very long time to what has normally been coming though as a single update. &nbsp;My wife has the Lenovo laptop and will try it today or tomorrow. &nbsp;It is not downloading
 automatically on either machine even though the setup is for automatic.&nbsp;
