<h2>            How to remove My documents icon from the desktop in windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, so I have a quick question. On windows 10 I have a "documents" icon on the desktop and a file explorer icon on the toolbar. I want to get rid of the documents icon because I think it is cleaner to just open it from the toolbar, but I am worried that
 if I put the documents icon in the trash it wont just remove the icon, but it will remove the contents of the folder. how do I just get rid of this icon on the desktop? Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>see below the taskbar icon that I want to keep and the desktop icon I want to remove
</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a second question which is, is there a way to add a favorites section to the start menu on the left hand side where it says most used? I know how to pin items to the start menu, but that adds them to the right hand side where all the tiles are. I
 want it on the left side where the most used icons are</p>

      I don't know any way to do what you want with favorites. Myself, I
      added the Quick Launch Toolbar to the Taskbar and put it next to
      the start button and have some favorites there. <br />

    <title>Issues with unwanted Ease of Access and Computer lock shortcuts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with unwanted Ease of Access and Computer lock shortcuts</h2>
                    
<p>Sony Vaio Laptop Model: VGN-N21E/W</p>
<p>My toddler has somehow managed to activate shortcuts as follows:</p>
<p>when I press the 'u' key when entering my password at the start up menu the Ease of Access menu appears, and the only way to get past it is to select something from the&nbsp;menu and then un-select it.&nbsp; I know I could reset my password, but I would like to get
 the problem sorted.</p>
<p>once access to Windows Vista is gained, whenever I press the 'L' key, the computer locks and I have to enter my password again, which then brings up the Ease of Access menu.</p>
<p>To say this is driving me mad, would be an understatement.&nbsp; I've had to copy the l and paste it whenever it's needed!</p>
<p>Any help would be very much appreciated</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>It sounds like your young one hit just the right combination of keys to enable hot keys.</p>
<p>Click the Start button and type&gt; 'turn on' &gt; and select Turn on easy of access keys' from the list.</p>
<p>Uncheck all options and select 'Apply' then OK.</p>
<p>Did that help?</p>
<p>Please let us know</p>

<p>For some unknown reason, yesterday (and today) when I attempted to log off my computer, the options appear, but they don't do anything when I click on them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The same thing happens when I attempt to shut down.</p>

</p>
<p>I even tried doing it after doing a CTRL ALT DEL, but nothing happened then, either.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have continuously been having problems with both my connection from my Windows 8.1, Asus laptop, to my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and also to my headset. Therefore, I have decided to reset my computer to factory settings hoping this will resolve any possible&nbsp;driver
 or other problems.</p>
<p>I collected my necessary&nbsp;files but then when I wished to reset I was told that it wasn't available when Windows to Go was running.</p>
<p><span>I have never heard of this till now and have never used it in the past. I did some research into it and decided to pull out all external connections to see whether those might be considered windows to go

<span><span>usb</span></span><span>'s</span><span>. Unfortunately, none of them worked. I tried to do the
<span>regedit</span><span> with no success. I didn't expect this much hassle<span> :C. Additionally it is important to note I recently installed a new

            <p>Hi Calum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Windows To Go workspace won't start, your PC might have a different type of processor than your Windows To Go USB drive. Processors come in 32-bit and 64-bit varieties, and if your PC's processor type is different than your Windows To Go drive, you
 won't be able to create Windows To Go workspace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to the links to get the details on <strong>Windows To Go workspace</strong>:</p>

            <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p><span>To confirm I have never heard of Windows to go till now and had no intention in downloading it. &nbsp;It has only become apparent now that my windows system believes I am running an windows to go workspace when trying to reset to
 factory settings. &nbsp;I believe that it is possible that Windows is recognizing my new ssd as this windows to go device as it is my os drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I have tried to go around this through the boot menu although it doesn't give me the option to reset. I am now going to try to insert the windows disk with my windows 8 product key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the continuous support.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Calum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologized for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try performing a Reset using the Windows 8 installation disc and it's respective product key? If yes, was it successful?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't tried, I would like to inform you that the performing a "<strong>Reset</strong>" will remove all of your personal files and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. Only apps that came with your PC will be
 reinstalled. Refer to the link to get the details:</p>
<p>Refer to the section "<strong>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</strong>"</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than performing a Reset, you might try a "<strong>Refresh</strong>". If your PC came with
<span>Windows&nbsp;8, </span>you might be able to restore it back to <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span>&nbsp;by refreshing your PC. Your personal files won't be affected, but apps that didn't come with the computer will need to be reinstalled. You may refer to the section "<span><strong>Refresh your PC without affecting
 your files</strong></span>" to get the details on Windows Refresh. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not interested to perform a Refresh or Reset, you may want to describe the details regarding the issues that you are facing at the moment. It's better to troubleshoot the issue instead of losing data and application on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need more assistance in this case. We will be glad to help you.

            If you mean that the the Printers and Faxes window is empty and that you can't install a printer by clicking on the Add a Printer wizard, then the Print Spooler is not running, probably because you have a corrupt printer driver or a corrupt print job.<br />
<br />
There is an easy fix for the above, but rather than confusing things by providing a solution to something that may not be your problem, please explain what you mean by "can't find the printing folder."<br />
<br />
Explain how you reinstalled the driver.<br />
<br />
Printers usually are not shown in Device Manager.&nbsp; They are shown (and configured) from the Printers and Faxes window.<br />
<br />
What version of Windows XP (Home, Pro, Media Center) and service pack (none, 1, 2, 3) do you have?<br />
<br />
What is the name and version of your antivirus program?<br />
<br />
What other security programs are installed?<br />

<p>Was Windows ever installed on your computer?&nbsp; If so, and if it was pre-installed when you bought the computer, there should be a COA with a Windows product key stuck to your computer.&nbsp; On laptops, look at the bottom or in the battery compartment; on desktop/towers,
 look on the sides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Windows 7 COA, you can download a genuine ISO file corresponding to the version of Windows shown on the COA and do a clean install of Windows 7.&nbsp; See
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-7/0ae269fd-167e-423b-94ef-26133f89e10c">

<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a Windows 7 product key, then as Ken says, you'll have to buy a copy.&nbsp; NewEgg currently has Windows 7 Pro for about $140 and Windows 7 Home for about $95.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Before you buy, make sure that Windows 7 drivers (of the appropriate 32-bit or 64-bit architecture) are available for all of your hardware.</p>

<h2>            How to set order of Drives in File Selection window&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently, for no reason I have been able to determine, the standard File Selection window has been openning with my disk drives listed in order of free-space, rather than alphabetical by drive letter. &nbsp;I have not been able to discover how to change this
 back to the (for me, at least) normal order. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone guide me?</p>

            <p>When you have the window up, select&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; View -&gt; Details</p>
<p>This will show your drives with headers "Name", "Type", Total Size", "Free Space" and "Comments".&nbsp; Click on the header&nbsp;"Name".&nbsp; This should sort them alphabetically. If it is sorted in reverse alphabetical order, then click on "Name" again.&nbsp; Once it is sorted
 like you like it, select:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View -&gt; Tiles</p>

            <p>Thanks. &nbsp;I tried that, although I like the final display to be in "list" form. &nbsp;But it doesn't "stick". &nbsp;I have to do it all over again each time the window is displaying the "My Computer" contents. &nbsp;That is even more annoying than having to find the "K"
 disk (or what ever).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It took me a moment of searching for the (non-existent) View drop-down, until I remembered that it would appear by right clicking in the File Select pane in an area that wouldn't pick an entry. &nbsp;That is a bit tricky, as there is no overt indication of where
 it works!. &nbsp;Once you GET the View menu, right-click menu, "Arrange Icons by" is a better choice than View, as it works without having to change the View setting.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, no solution yet, as the initial open seems to be sort by free-space, and it doesn't remember your changes. &nbsp;Note that it is only the next-to-top-level that is affected, the one which has (in list mode) one line for each drive (plus a few other odds and
 ends). &nbsp;Once you descend into a directory, the sub-directories and files are ordered by name, unless you change that, and that change isn't remembered either. &nbsp;(The disks, when selected are effectively directories as well.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there some value in the registry that i need to tweak?</p>

<p>BTW: You can also get "View" to appear by selecting an Explorer window and then pressing and releasing the "Alt" key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your symptoms are not normal and&nbsp;likely fall under the following KB article:</p>

            I looked at the support page, but it is talking about directory views in Windows Explorer, as far as I can tell. &nbsp;My problem is in the File Selection Dialog window. &nbsp;Is that governed by the same registry entries as WE?

            <p>Somehow I missed that this is in a File Selection Window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you right-click in an empty space and get the "View" entry you mentioned earlier, look directly below "View" and you should see "Arrange Icons By" selection.&nbsp; Hover your cursor over "Arrange By" and select "by Name".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should stick between uses, but if not it wouldn't suprise me that it is connected to Explorer and try the fix mentioned in my last post.</p>

                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10. I'm sure Skype has been working on this machine, but when I went to run it today, it's not working. I reinstalled it from the app store - no difference. It appears to start up, but all I get is a blue window with the
 skype logo. On first installing it, I got an information dialog telling me that it was logging in as me - hasn't made a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>If WMI Service is not listed at all, then update your AV program and run a full scan, as a missing update related service can sometimes be a symptom of malware. If it is listed but not running then try starting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the AV scan finds no malware, then download, install, update and run a full scan with free

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try working through this article -&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors</a> which hopefully may assist.
 If you decide to try step 5 then backup your system, at least your important data, first. Or post back here before doing Step 5 to see if anyone else has another solution to try first,</p>

            <strong>I needed net frame work v4.5.2 to launch/install a certain game. The reason why I wasn't able to download net frame work is because I needed Windows modules installer. I simply reinstalled Windows and that specific problem was fixed. Now I'm dealing

<h2>            Does everyone realise that MS&#39;s Peer-to-Peer Updating is paid for by them&#63; Win10</h2>
                    <p>Prior to my foolish 'Free' upgrade to Win 10 in mid-December, my monthly broadband usage was between 5GB and 8 GB a month. December's was 21GB and my current January figure is 44.52 GB.</p>
<p>I thought it was caused by programs now being accessed via the internet, not stored on my PC, so I created this thread
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/which-apps-are-cloud-based-in-win10/2d7359f2-01d6-469e-9f04-053b6760996d?tm=1453909705679">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/which-apps-are-cloud-based-in-win10/2d7359f2-01d6-469e-9f04-053b6760996d?tm=1453909705679</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I saw this thread </p>
<p><a href="https://community.bt.com/t5/Bills-Packages/Can-I-really-have-used-30gb-of-broadband-in-less-than-a-week/td-p/1581578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.bt.com/t5/Bills-Packages/Can-I-really-have-used-30gb-of-broadband-in-less-than-a-week/td-p/1581578</a></p>
<p>where someone had a similar situation. In that thread a very helpful person gg30340 asked if it might have been caused by Microsoft's Peer-to-Peer Windows Updating which according to this How To Geek article</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/224981/how-to-stop-windows-10-from-uploading-updates-to-other-pcs-over-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/224981/how-to-stop-windows-10-from-uploading-updates-to-other-pcs-over-the-internet/</a></p>
<p>allows Microsoft to update our PCs at our expense not theirs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this true, Microsoft? If it is how is it permissible? Isn't it comparable to criminal deception?</p>

            <p>Most broadband packages only use Downloads as a limit&nbsp;in their terms. You computer will only download updates once from the internet and peer to peer sharing&nbsp; means that if you have multiple computers you may only download it once through your internet connection
 for all of them. P2P sharing if enabled (it can be disabled) may well result in it being uploaded many times but this normally would not be included in your usage stats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With more than one PC on your network it should actually reduce your potential network usage to the internet.</p>

<p>Hello Shenan. HairyFool's reply gave me a contrary impression to what I had from the HowtoGeek. It was a genuine question - I've had to upgrade my broadband package because of how the Updates are now delivered. The retailer didn't alert me to it, neither
 did Microsoft.</p>

            You had to upgrade your broadband package why? I am not sure you have narrowed down what is actually using your bandwidth yet...
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;If you change the update option (you pointed to one of many articles that show you how), it doesn't work any differently than before (you download updates and that is it.)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have multiple machines on your LAN with Windows 10, you could even configure the settings in such a way to SAVE bandwidth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am unsure how the reply you got here was interpreted as contrary to the article you linked to. Seems to say the same thing, just in a less wordy fashion.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as alerting you to the different options for updates - you are correct. &nbsp;It is left to 'personal discovery', which can cost something extra for a bit (the timeframe dependent on several factors) for those who have limits in transfers such as yours.
 &nbsp;That's likely why articles such as the one you linked to and others that have even more outrage embedded in them exist. &nbsp;Also, for every one that did notice, there is probably another than won't. &nbsp;The default should definitely be 'the way it was before' and
 let the user choose in this case. &nbsp;I would say during the initial setup, but on new systems, the initial setup is determined by the OEM, not Microsoft - so informing people the option exists is a non-universal proposition.</div>
<div><br />
<div>How would you liked to have been informed of the dozens of different settings (likely hundreds, but...) that could affect you in various ways? &nbsp;(Your voice being sent to some cloud location for study to make voice recognition better, your searches being
 sent to some cloud location to better 'customize your experience' on your system, the several ways to change how updates work, etc.). Would you want a class, a decently long instructional video, a CD/DVD with a PDF on it or said video or both, a printed book,
 etc.?</div>
<div><br />
<div>All of that would miss some people and, actually, I personally believe it would miss most and the situation would be the same as it is now with the changes except someone could say, "Didn't you watch the 'things you need to know video'?" To which some
 would answer, "why should I HAVE to watch a video to use MY computer the way I want?" (So another element gets added to the argument, really. Hah)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Really though, for you, what would have worked for you? &nbsp;Keep in mind that what you have here (update distrubution change) is only one of many 'contraversial' settings in Windows 10 - or those some people have expressed concern over for one reason or another.
 &nbsp;Also keep in mind that not everyone would get Windows 10 in the same manner - so there isn't really a universal way to make sure YOU know the information is available or which topics would affect YOU - so it's a watch/read all and comprehend all - or nothing.</div>

            <p>Thank you, Shenan. I cannot hope to respond to your comments with any degree of knowledge/expertise - you are an MVP and someone who has had/is still having a huge input into Windows 10.&nbsp; On the other hand, I am just a customer, an Outsider, someone who
 is struggling to get to grips with Win10, probably made harder because I moved from Win7 and so did not experience changes made in Win8 and Win8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched to the extent of my expertise and found other possible causes include:</p>
<p>(1) my Broadband carrier's Usage Monitor is wrong or they have made a simple mistake by connecting my circuit to the wrong port in their exchange.<br />
(2) Someone has got access to my hub/WiFi and is using my WiFi connection.<br />
(3) Some programs I use on my TV are eating up the usage and<br />
(4) Some Apps here are affecting it, hence my other thread to which I referred in my initial post.<br />
You've added a fifth - blame the OEM so I'll ask them too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the Title I gave this thread is a tad inflamatory and has resulted in my being on the wrong end of what the football world knows as the "hairdryer experience". ;o) I really am&nbsp;sorry if anything I've said has upset you but let me make it clear that
 this was a question to which I was seeking answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What absolute proof have I that Microsoft is to blame? None but the facts speak for themselves: prior to my foolish 'Free' upgrade to Win 10 in mid-December, my monthly broadband usage was between 5GB and 8 GB a month. Since the upgrade, December's was 21GB
 and my figure at the 27th January was 44.52 GB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ask why I had to upgrade (to Unlimited). That should be obvious - to avoid any further penalty surcharges while I'm trying to figure out what's
 caused this huge increase in Usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;referred in an earlier reply&nbsp;to 'legalities' - perhaps I was over-the-top in talking about "criminal deception". I withdraw that but in its place I would suggest that Microsoft's advertising wouldn't stand up to scrutiny in the UK (Advertising Standards
 - you must have something similar in the USA?). Take a look at Microsoft's current advertising
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"It’s the Windows you know, only better/Familiar and better than ever/Windows 10 is familiar and easy to use,
<strong>with lots of similarities to Windows 7 including the Start menu.</strong>"</p>
<p>Many customers have been asking 'what Start menu' - I'm sure your familiar with the "Start Menu doesn't appear" and "Critical Error - Start Menu and Cortana aren't working" huge threads.</p>
<p>That page carries many testimonials from Insiders - if you look at the first of the two threads I mention (in the Insiders Forum)&nbsp;you'll see quite a few of them saying the launch should have been delayed until problems were fixed.</p>
<p>I'm sure that Win10 when fixed will be a huge improvment on what went before but for now Microsoft have alienated many customers and still even now give the impression that they couldn't care less. They've moved on to making a buck on newer products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry but I see no point in commenting on your last four paragraphs. It seems to me that&nbsp;you think all this is my fault, not Microsoft's.</p>

            You have misinterpretted.
<div>
<div>MVPs are, like everyone else here, peers, people just like you. &nbsp;Just willing to give time and effort.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Influence into Windows 10? Hahah. That is funny. &nbsp;No more than you would.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I said you had not narrowed the reason for your bandwidth usage, well, because as far as I see you have not (at least not to the point you indicate in this thread.) If you changed the update settings on the system in question since the upgrade and the
 bandwidth usage is still large, then you are now changing your found cause...? &nbsp;(You initially blamed the updating system method of distribution.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just watched a youtube presentation that presented the UKs take on advertising in comparison to everywhere else (USA in particular) and - no - there is no place (I believe) with quite the restrictive laws for advertising as the UK. &nbsp;The one or two line
 fix (powershell) for the missing Start Button Menu and Cortana issue and the fact that it is such a small percentage (actual individual computer issue and not even close to a majority) is affected might somewhat cripple the case a bit, but in the past th UK
 has sued and won some crazy stuff (IMO), so... Who really knows?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Giving the undertaking, I don't know that delaying would have helped all that much. &nbsp;When some decided (and that could be considered the foolish part) that they would be trying to change the OS remotely (without actual control) on millions of systems that
 will all be different in terms of hardware, software, maintenance level, etc. - the small group of people who would volunteer for testing (whose systems might be better maintained than some others) and even the extended group who will grab anything that is
 free without much consideration for consequences is not going to uncover all the problems. &nbsp;Even for the ones that are uncovered, if the cause is outside of your control in large part, a decision has to be made on whether to release anyway and deal with it
 or not (is the percentage small enough to handle quickly enough that in the long run, all will be fine...?). The same decisions that face even those doing similar rollouts on a smaller scale in a business environment - keep fixing or get it out there and really
 see how bad it is and get it done...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am NOT justifying anything - just being realistic. &nbsp;I couldn't justify anything, I am not in control or even have a say. &nbsp;Also, it's all an educated guess from this point, based on experience and seeing what is actually happening and has happened in
 the last two decades.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The last paragraphs are an honest attempt to get you to tell everyone what method would you have like to have seen to inform you of the changes and consequences of those changes in Windows 10? &nbsp;An honest request for a real discussion. &nbsp;I went ahead and
 pointed out all the possible issues in many distribution/presentation methods I could think of - but I was hoping that perhaps you had an idea of what method YOU would have found utility in and possibly had known about these things beforehand if said method
 of communication had been utilized...? &nbsp; &nbsp;No other motive. &nbsp;Things do not get better in situations like this without discussion, ideas, plans - and you are certainly not the first to say something similar (I have been involved in discussions about missing
 manuals for OSes and the likes for years now - it is not a new topic.)</div>

            <p>C'mon -&nbsp;I didn't misinterpret. I actually said that "you are an MVP and someone who has had/is still having a huge input into Windows 10". And I do understand that you give your time, that you're not an employee, Nor was I&nbsp;being sarcastic - as an MVP, an
 Insider and someone who has contributed to the launch of Windows, you have played a part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or as Microsoft says in the link above:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>"What you can do as an Insider:</em></strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
</span></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Help shape the future of Windows</span></em><br />
<em>Be a part of the ongoing process of improving the features and functionality of Windows.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Be a part of the community</span></em><br />
<em>Connect with people who are as into technology as you are. Join the forums, swap advice, and learn about upcoming Insider-only events.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Get early access to releases</span></em><br />
<em>Download the Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview and get ready for the coming PC builds."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>But as a cynic with experience of how large companies operate I also understand how some of them set up a think tank/expert user group, Insiders by a different name. Sometimes it's just window-dressing (Windows-dressing) and do they always listen to what
 this group proposes? Only if it suits their plans and business model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only comment that I really and strongly object to is "keep fixing or get it out there and really see how bad it is and get it dine...". Using paying customers to sort the mess, many of whom have small businesses, really sucks - in my opinion. How many
 new WIn10 PCs or Upgrades to Win10 if Microsoft had had the bells to say in their publicity "You must have our revamped Windows 10 because . . .&nbsp; You will probably find all the programming faults that we missed but hey that's life."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're correct in saying I haven't checked Usage but I promise you that I will and get back. My usage limit is based&nbsp;on both Uploads and Downloads by the way - incidentally that How to Geek article is only one of many such sites on the Internet pointing
 out the same thing - but theirs is reasonably east for dumbos like me&nbsp;to follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I really have to go now. The latest batch of Windows Updates (heralded as <strong>
fixing 36 flaws) </strong>has in fact screwed up many many more PCs. I've lost all of my Files and Folders in Documents, and all of my Pictures. That's on my NEW PC. On my upgraded-to Win10 PC
<strong>I've lost the Start menu on another UA</strong>. ) Sounds familiar that!)</p>

<p>I just bought live and a new GT change and I go to sign in it says "xbox live is not available on consoles in your region". I go and check everything to see what is going on to find out the location of my account has been changed which I did not do and I
 am now forced to wait 3 months to change this until I can play xbox again and my live to disappear. Extremely annoyed for this to happen for my first day back in a long time just for xbox to take my money and tell me I need to wait 3 months.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; It happens on web pages, Word, and Outlook.&nbsp; Also, when I use my mouse to highlight words or phrases, it doesn't work.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to try to highlight something several times and then it will finally work.&nbsp; For the most part
 I've reverted to keyboard shortcuts for highlighting, copy/past/cut.&nbsp; I spoke to another person having the same issues.&nbsp; Go to insert something into an e-mail message and the cursor is suddenly in a completely different spot than where she left it.&nbsp; It's like
 the computer is possessed.&nbsp; I have an Asus laptop&nbsp;running Windows 10, the other person I referred to is using a Toshiba laptop&nbsp;on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my updates for Windows and Defender are current and successfully installed.&nbsp; For me this just started in the last 4 - 6 weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I worry about malware?&nbsp; I didn't think of that since I thought Defender was supposed to protect against malware and spyware and it updates daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help with this!</p>
