<h2>            How to play games but avoid frying the graphics card&#63;</h2>
                    I have just got my new Acer windows 10 laptop yesterday. Today I installed two of my old games on it and they worked fine. I have been playing them. But I need some tips. On my desktop computer I fried the graphics card a few years ago from playing too
 many games. It was replaced and works alright. I was just wondering how can I play all my games on my new laptop without frying the graphics card. the laptop was $500. So could someone please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you. From Timothy Balla.

<h2>            trying to leave feedback on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This may&nbsp;seem like an opinion, but are&nbsp; actually true facts! The Windows upgrade&nbsp;10 is now an&nbsp;app, they got rid of Windows Media Player, so all your saved memories get wiped, and you can only use them on Media Player. Second, they jumped on the lets turn
 everything into an app bus! I play all my games on console, and seen how bad&nbsp;they can screw it up, trying to&nbsp; downgrade everything to an app... like I'm gone play call of duty on my cellphone! &nbsp;So my answer is NO! I don't want your crappy App&nbsp;to replace a
 way better program already on my system! My question is... how do I get MSN to stop begging, and recommending, and asking, and offering, and conning me to switch to their crappy app? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience. I would like to assist you with further information from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you want to be not notified by the upgrade notification of Windows 10 in Windows operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not interested in Windows 10, you can remove this program from your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, you need to&nbsp;access the <strong>Task Manager</strong> (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + Del) and inside the
<em>Processes</em> tab, scroll until you find the the process called <em>GWX</em>. Click&nbsp;on its name to select it, and then press
<em>End task.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Further on, follow the below steps to uninstall the WindKB update which installs the Get Windows 10 app.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Launch <strong>Control Panel</strong> and&nbsp;click on <strong>Programs</strong>, then choose

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note</span>: &nbsp;Also, you need to hide the update again in windows updates to prevent it from auto installing again since this is marked “important”.</p>

    <title>I installed the WRONG version of Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron_42  say:</h3>
<h2>            I installed the WRONG version of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Here is the story: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop hard drive was failing (At this point had valid upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10 from Windows 7 home)</p>
<p>Cloned to new hardrive and install (no issues)</p>
<p>I created external media to do a clean install of windows 10 because I wanted to start fresh but I accidently CLEAN INSTALLED WINDOWS 10 PRO instead. I have tried every official iso download. They claim to give you the option for both Windows 10 verisons
 (home or pro) but it only will allow me to reinstall PRO. My product key is invalid for pro but was fine until I messed up with installing the wrong version for my clean install. I know its my fault but this is ridiculous, I have done clean installs before
 after putting in new hard drives and the only thing I need for my computer to be USUABLE again, is Windows 10 HOME!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me? Also I am unable to roll back to Windows 7 obviously because of the clean install. I don't want to buy a new key and I don't really need Pro either. I just want Windows 10 home back!&nbsp; : )

One of the welcome improvements is the compliance check when qualifying for the Windows 10 upgrade. Previously, Windows 7, Windows 8.0 and Windows 8.1 users needed to have either of those versions Windows installed and activated in order to qualify for the free upgrade offer. For persons who needed to perform a clean install of Windows 10 from the outset, it was a two step process of first validating the machine through the upgrade routine, ensure the Windows 10 Upgrade was activated, then proceed to perform a Reset. With the latest November Update (1511), users no longer have to go through this process. In this article, we take a look at how to install and activate Windows 10 using your Windows 7 or

            <p>Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If any cloning lost the Recovery Partition then try contacting your OEM for the Windows&nbsp;7 Recovery Media.&nbsp; For a small charge they should be able to supply you with a copy on DVD or USB.&nbsp; This will allow you to reinstall Windows&nbsp;7 to factory settings as
 of day one.&nbsp; You can then get Windows 7 upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The above would be the same procedure as if you had corrupted, lost, or replaced, a faulty hard drive, which often happens.</p>

really </strong>want you to use the Windows 10 mail app. I gave up shortly after the first post by Coynegen. Someone is using this as a psych experiment, like shocking mice to see how long until they stop doing a particular thing.

            <p>I ran into this same problem when trying to remove a name from the suggestion list and I noticed that the windows 10 client does not allow you to delete names from it. Obviously it is annoying that you cannot delete items from that list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that you cannot find the list on your PC, is because it is not on your PC, it is on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can work around the problem as follows:</p>
<p>1) log in on the website Outlook.com with your microsoft ID.</p>
<p>2) you will see your inbox and it will have the same contact list you want to change.</p>
<p>3) click new to write a new email and type the letters so your contacts appear.
</p>
<p>4) Notice that behind all the name entries there is a little cross!!!</p>
<p>5) Click the cross to delete an entry. You cannot modify entries, just delete them and the correct ones will reappear when you send them mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Has any one found an Intel HD Graphics Driver that will function with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rcl24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has any one found an Intel HD Graphics Driver that will function with a Windows 10, 32bit Lap top.</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have problems viewing objects in the 3D Builder since the Windows 10 1511 update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusion is that it is related to the fact that my Dell Vostro 3500 is a 32bit laptop, and I have been unable to find an update Intel HD Graphics Driver that is suitable for a 32bit system and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the current driver in case it had got corrupted and the laptop has reinstalled latest driver, but this is actually the same version of driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I did not have 3D builder before the first upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, but it did function OK with visible objects after Windows 10 was installed until the update to 1511 last month., and I did try to get an answer via Microsoft Chat,&nbsp;but
 they were unable to find a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is only 3D Builder I appear to have problems with. All the other programs I use seem to function OK. When I deleted the Intel HD graphics driver and the laptop functioned temporarily on a basic graphics driver, I did a quick check and found that objects
 on the 3D Builder were visible, but as soon as the Laptop re-installed the Intel HD Graphics driver they disappeared again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing a 32bit Intel HD Graphics driver said to be OK for Windows 8, but that would not install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I appear to be looking for an Intel HD Graphics driver for Windows 10 32bit operating system, but Intel do not as yet seem to have one on their site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I say it only appears to be 3D Builder that is being effected, and it does not warrant looking to change laptops just for that!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In truth I can live without 3D Builder if necessary, but I wonder if other programs are updated they may suffer in the same way at some point&nbsp;in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one know a solution? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I selected the "Games"&nbsp; App Category on this website as I believe this is what Microsoft deem it to be.</p>

            <p>Hi Nachappa CK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read&nbsp;the statement I made I would have hoped it was quite clear&nbsp;that my problem is with Microsofts 3D Builder, which as Microsoft have supplied it as a Windows 10 App, I would hope they had checked it was Windows 10 compatible! I also sated I only
 selected the "Games App" category on this website as when discussing the problem with Microsoft Chat, they implied this App came under the heading of Games Apps.</p>

            There has to be a problem with microsofts end for this many people to have the same problem starting the same time.&nbsp; I have tried using the "new" sunset edition of money plus with no online services, same problem.&nbsp; I've tried importing into a Quicken program,
 same problem.&nbsp; I've tried all 3 backups and another copy of money, same problem.&nbsp; I'm currently using a password restore program (paid for by me) to try and crack whatever password has been placed on my file.&nbsp; I'll see how that works.

<p>Well, MS Money is basically going to become a doorstop in less than two months anyway (Jan 2011), so it's possible they flipped the switch early. &nbsp;You did know that, right? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/money</a></p>
<p>I've been (unsuccessfully) trying to switch to Mint.com, but there really isn't any alternative. &nbsp;We all need to get used to it, though. &nbsp;In a few days (if not right now), MS Money will no longer support any online functionality.</p>

            Same issue here.&nbsp; As to completely shutting down use of Money, we were supposed to be able to still have access to the software, but there was going to no longer be access to data downloads and so on.&nbsp; Accessing the use of the software was not suppose
 to go away.&nbsp; This is very troubling.

 and unusable. I did a clean install of W10 1803 from USB on this PC when it was first released without any issues or system changes etc but repeating the process as used before, remove all partitions, recreate them then install 1803 kills the PC when downloading

            Hi Tony
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />If necessary, click on the Processes Tab
<br />
<br />Click on the Disk Column header, so that arrow faces down
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your PC
<br />
<br />When your disk is at 100%, what are the top 5 processes listed?

<p>Unfortunately the PC in inoperable at the moment but from memory the top processes run on and off at 1-3% CPU usage and the highest is Task manager its self. I have already tried the suggestions posted here&nbsp;https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager-software/fix-windows-10-100-disk-usage-in-task-manager.html
 to no avail. The disk at 100% colour is mainly pink and sometimes red. I am running no other non OS software. I have not noticed the issue in Safe Mode, when I can get in it and the problem mainly appears when I connect to the internet to download updates.</p>

            The easiest way to find drivers for your laptop is enter the Tag # from the Dell label at the following web site.<br />
http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/04/DriversHome/NeedProductSelection<br />
<br />
Note however, that the driver should already be there.&nbsp; Are you sure this is a driver problem? Since this is a new laptop, I suggest you call Dell support for assistance.<br />

    <title>My Surface Pro 4 will not connect to hotel wifi. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Surface Pro 4 will not connect to hotel wifi.</h2>
                    Whenever I try to connect to my hotel's wifi, it, after saying it reached the wifi, tries to pull up the log-in and terms of the wifi on the web, but cannot complete the process, and remains on a blank web page (trying to load, but not making progress).
 How do I fix this problem? I have tried restarting my computer, and many other simple things, but nothing works. It still cannot load the web page--for the wifi log-on. If it helps, I have this problem particularly in Hampton Inns, Homewood Suites, et cetera.

    <title>Cannot open My Documents or My Computer in Windows XP. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot open My Documents or My Computer in Windows XP.</h2>
                    I have Windows XP on my PC. When I try to open My Documents or My Computer from the desktop icon, all I get is a white screen. If I let it sit for a while, I get the message:&nbsp; Windows Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close". I cannot open
 from the Start Menu either. The only way I can get to my documents/photos is through outlook express by attaching a file to a new message...or through Word. I cannot start Windows XP in safe mode, the directional arrows will not work once I am at the screen
 to make that choice. I have no idea what happened...we have made no changes to our software or hardware. Thanks.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I did a fresh start yesterday,,, oh my!!! I wish I hadn't. All because I saw that it was recommended. I've been trying to fix my batterey only charging to 58% and it came up so I thought, why not if it needs to.</p>
<p>It's wiped my google chrome &amp; my Norton protection to name a few.</p>
<p>My Norton security now will not perform a fix which is very worrying, &amp; the google chrome just will not install.</p>
<p>It was taking ages last night so I left it installing overnight, &amp; it's still not doen it.</p>
<p>This Microsoft bing runs very slow. It's awful.</p>
<p>How do I install google chrome, is there any way &amp; can revert it back ??&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions &amp; help.</p>

            Hi Jeany, 
<br />
<br />Did you do a reset? If so, did you choose to keep your documents, or remove everything? 
<br />
<br />With everything going wrong, I’m going to entertain we run another reset and remove everything. Even if we were to get chrome installed, it sounds like the OS is still having issues. This process should help the PC perform better, and usually does. 
<br />
<br />Let me know about the questions above, and we’ll go from there. I’ll do whatever I can to help!
<br />- C

<p>I have a little sd storage chip thingy I could use to transfer them all on to if it is going to delete them all.</p>
<p>I'm really upset about this happening. We are currently travelling ( in Bali at the moment) having left the U.K 2 months ago and it really is disconcerting that this has happened.</p>
<p>I would have just left things be had I known that this would happen. I thought Microsoft was really reputable.</p>
<p>The laptop is running really slow now too &amp; that Bing is something that I deleted ages ago because I didn't like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help. 😊</p>

            Hi Jeany
<br />
<br />A Windows Reset is a one Way operation . .. 
<br />
<br />If that restore did not resolve this for you, your best option is to clean install Windows 10 to get your system running correctly. It will be a it of work, but worth it . .. 
<br />
<br />Backup your data before proceeding!
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<p>Oh My.... !! This is double Dutch to me DaveM121….thank you for helping, but I really haven't a clue... I've moved all my photos to one Drive, this is all I'm really bothered about.</p>
<p>If I do the factory reset, will the photos still be on One drive when I turn the computer back on after factory reset.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>How will I know it's the same version. ?? </span></p>
<p><span>It installed automatically when in did the "fresh start"</span></p>
<p>I can follow your response from the email on my phone. but I'm scared to factory reset in case I lose them all. I don't even know if I've saved them correctly.</p>

            Hi Paul.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Homegroup is removed in Version 1803.  
<br />
<br />What's working most for network detection issues caused by Version 1803 is here:  <a href="https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/network-computers-no-longer-present-in-file-explorer-on-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/networ...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />There are Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409269...</a>

<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>

<p>Hello Greg and Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now been through bother of your links and have made a few updates. Many of these I had previously done in my own earlier research.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a summary of what I have found:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I discovered that my Desktop PC has lower case letters in the computer name (Home-PC). Not sure if this needs to be changed with Win 10 (1803)? When I tried to change it, it asked for the Primary DNS suffix of the computer that I cannot find)<br />
</li><li>I have not disabled my Firewall. Should I do this and run a new test?</li><li>I see some differences in the links regarding the N/W setting:
<ol>
<li>Private N/W: Turn Discovery on or off?</li><li>All N/Ws: Turn on or off Password protected sharing?</li></ol>
</li><li>Yesterday, I could see all the computers that I expected to see (except for the
<span>NetGear ReadyShare drive.</span>
<ol>
<li><span>It seems that I have to often run \\ReadyShare to see that drive. </span>
</li></ol>
</li><li><span>When I try on the laptop to access a shared folder on the Desktop I get "Network Error - Windows cannot access \\HOME-PC\Sharing".</span></li><li><span>When I try on the Desktop to access the laptop shared files I get the same error with the different folder name.<br />
</span></li><li><span>Going back to the use of "Everyone", I see it used in the link. What I would like to know is this just an example or is Everyone required?</span></li></ol>
<p>Any feedback/advice that you can provide would be welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below you will see some background on my environments:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Home Windows 10 Home (Version 1803) network using NetGear C7000 modem/Router with McAfee Security software.</span></li><li><span>Two PC on the network with several other remote iPhone, iPad, tvs, etc. devices</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Custom Windows Desktop (Gigabyte Motherboard, AMD Athlon II X4 630 processor, 16 GB memory, Solid State HD)</span></li><li><span>HP 15 laptop</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>HP PhotoSmart C7250 printer</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Three current problems:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>We have three devices on our network to share folders (Desktop, Laptop and a network drive).</span>
<ol>
<li><span>We do not have access to all these shared files; access is spotty.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Our Router NetGear ReadyShare drive is not always accessible.</span></li><li><span>Our HP Photosmart C7250 printer is currently configured for wireless access and works fine from the laptop.</span>
<ol>
<li><span>However, I have not been able to print just a test page from the Desktop</span></li><li><span>Background:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>We previously had this printer working fine from the Desktop using a USB cable.</span></li><li><span>I have tried numerous times to install the latest HP software from the HP site but I have never been able to get the software complete installed; I can get a test page to show up in the print queue but never printing wirelessly.</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>

            No  you do not need to share with Everyone, but should have skipped that step to do what you want in the next steps which is Share with Specific Users.  
<br />
<br />Did you try the fix that works for most others?   <a href="https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/network-computers-no-longer-present-in-file-explorer-on-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/networ...</a>

<p>Hi Louise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you have tried the steps to troubleshoot the Skype Meeting Add-in. Firstly, you need to make sure you are using the same account on both Outlook and Skype for Business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, may I know if you can find the New Skype meeting button? If not, you need to make sure you have configured the account as Office 365 type. Then you can go to File &gt; Option &gt; Add-ins &gt; Com Add-ins &gt; Go. Make sure the Skype Meeting Add-in is enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can find the button but cannot create the meeting invitation, may I know if there is any error message? If so, please provide a screenshot of the error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>
        </p>

            Which version of Windows 10 is installed?
<br />Have you tried reinstalling application?
<br />
<br />Have you contacted the developer to find out about updates and patches?
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<p><span>Is it possible to save a TV show viewed on the Windows Media Center&nbsp; directly to&nbsp; A) a DVD RW disc? or B) a Flash pen drive? or C) an external hard drive; &nbsp; If so, how can I do ithat? &nbsp; Where can i read about the necessary steps

<p><span>Can anyone please put it in point blank form?&nbsp; Step by step please as im not too versed in computers. Any one could coach me with answers in here, this forum?<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A) With Windows 7 you can burn a recorded TV show to DVD within Media Centre by selecting "burn cd/dvd" from the Tasks menu strip.</p>
<p>B&amp;C) To copy to a flash drive or external hard drive (or even if you want to use alternative DVD burning software) the default location where the recorded TV files are saved is "C:\Users\Public\Recorded TV". Look in that folder and you'll find one file per
 recorded show, with the filename giving the name and date of the recorded show. Single clicking a file in Explorer will show more programme details to help you find the right file. Then just copy the file to the flash/external drive as you would do normally.</p>
<p>D) CDs don't have the capacity for recorded TV, you'll need DVD. Plus or minus won't matter.</p>
<p>E) Recorded TV files are just files to Windows so you can treat them the same as any other file for how you upload to online storage. Be warned though that the files are massive so I'll be impressed if you find an online storage site that will take them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>not sure what you are trying to do. the DRM protection may prohibit streaming</div>
<div>from the web and with certain copy protected shows, they may only play back on</div>
<div>the computer that recorded them. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>it looks like you are looking for portability. what is it that you are trying to</div>
<div>achieve?</div>

<p>Thanks <span><span>TGBmark1234</span><span>for
 your quick response. I havent been able to try any of your suggestions as yet, i hope to do that tomorrow. I wewanted to thank you immediately, just saw your answers and I would like to show my appreciacion for your time and good will. I also wanted to inform
 you (and whomever else might follow this thread) that there are a few places that offer 2 to 10 Gigabytes online storage for free.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But there is one other place that offers a whopping 50 Gigabytes storage space for free, and those 50Gb limit is per each e-mail address-. they use client's e-mail address as the account's "user name"-, so in theory you could have any number
 of 50 GB free accounts for each different e-mail address you register with them; in case you have never heard of them, they have been around for a number of years, so it seems they are solid and growing. As usual they also have in their line of products other
 premium account levels for which they will charge you. The place is "Adrive.com" -minus the " "- (a well kept secret) cause even PC World magazine to which I am&nbsp; suscribed&nbsp; did not include it amongst their best recommended Web sites of 2009 (they did include
 one of the free 10GB sites instead).</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information now is of some use to you and/or others.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you again<br />

<p>thank you for your response Barb Bowman. the main reason for my help request is centered on the need to free 116 one hour TV shows which are now recorded on my Hard Disk taking lots of space. So if i could record the WMC recorded shows directly into a flash
 drive or a re-writableDVD&nbsp; without me having to do that manually by transferrring them from Hard Drive to DVD&nbsp; or flash drive it would be ideal.&nbsp; And regarding my question E) in the original posting if i could by-pass recording to my main Hard Drive by recording
 to an External secondary HD, or by burning directly into my DVD&nbsp; or saving into my Flash Drive..&nbsp;&nbsp; it would be my ideal solution.&nbsp; So if i could achieve to record TV show directly via WMCenter&nbsp; to a web site....&nbsp; or even to an External hard drive DVD RW disc
 or flash drive I would be better off than what i am now.&nbsp; Hope i have now clarified the motives and my expected goals. If you meant "portability" by any of that, then i am ALL FOR IT .... smile</p>
<p>Thank you again Barb.</p>
Note: Regarding video&nbsp; streaming, i have already saved manually to Flash drive and it does play from there to my desktop compute monitor. Goes without saying my PC has an (Haupppage 1250) HD digital tuner

<div>so no, you cannot record to a DVD. I'm not sure about a flash drive. If it is</div>
<div>plugged in, you can go to tasks, settings, tv, tv storage and see if it is</div>
<div>recognized as a place you can select. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>streaming from a drive connected to your computer is different than streaming</div>
<div>from the Internet. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might consider a large capacity USB or eSata external hard drive. </div>

                    <p>OT: Solid State Drive Boot Problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have recently purchased a Samsung 120GB 840 Evo Series SSD in order to boot my OS and general programs faster than my current hard drive. I want to keep my 2 TB hard drive for mass storage (videos, music etc..) but I want to migrate my OS to my SSD. I
 have copied my Program Files 86x to my SSD and I have gone into the BIOS and set my boot option #1 and Boot priority #1 to my SSD however, after I save and exit the BIOS, I am greeted with the message of "Boot MGR Missing - Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete to reset"
 and now I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Any tips would be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
