<h2>            Video Call over 3G Network from Lumia 535</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Lumia 535 Dual SIM. I have 3G activated in my device. But I found no option to make video call over 3G network to another user. I found even cheap priced 3G supported Android devices has video calling option in Phone dial-pad. Kind of like below
 picture (notice the icon marked in Red color):</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cf0b3e4-008b-4f73-b3e7-6de41b7c061c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But Lumia 535 has no such option. It has only Skype/Viber video call facility, no 3G video call. It's a big problem for 3G user IMO. As many of my family member don't have skype or viber to make video call. 3G video call could be an option to call them.
 is there any option to make video call without Skype/Viber? I mean any third-party customization or something to add 3G video call option in phone book like Android? Thanks.</p>

<p>3G video call is not an option in Windows Phone, we are supposed to use Skype or other apps.</p>
<p>Third-party developers are not allowed to make such customization to core Windows Phone features, and Microsoft is not going to implement it, despite many feature requests i.e.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 error</h2>
                    <p>Comcast made a change to their server settings. now on my 2nd email I get 16999 on every new incoming mail. &nbsp;It says:</p>
<p>No such blob: mailbox=75339, item=233700, change=1665900</p>
<p>I have searched to find how to interpret "blob", item#, and change to no avail. &nbsp;I can log in to online server no problem it is just on download to Outlook. &nbsp;Settings for both accounts are identical. Default account has no problem. &nbsp;Comcast is useless for
 support "error? we don't create errors! What did you call about? I'll put you on hold for another hour before I disconnect you". &nbsp;So any clue as to how to determine blob or change or how to fix receive settings for second email?</p>

            <p>It was Comcast new release error and has been corrected. &nbsp;Like so many companies, testing for Mac is low if existent.</p>
<p>I believe it was tied to assumption of 1 to 1 account to email, not providing for more than 1 email per account. Online clue was that instead of identifying by name as usual in upper right, it said "guest". &nbsp;Thanks for your interest. &nbsp;I guess found their
 "blob".</p>

<p>Hi Lief Fox,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use Office 365 Device Based Activation, we need to have Education Plus Student SKU. It contains the related license for Office 365 ProPlus. When we sign up for Office Device Based Activation, we can click Get license if we don’t have Education Plus license.
 You may also contact support who approve your Education license, check if you can sign up for Education Plus license for your school.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2827e7f6-fa3b-4c9b-96d4-7bad4cffdb8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2827e7f6-fa3b-4c9b-96d4-7bad4cffdb8f" /></a></p>
<p>If you already have Education Plus license in your tenant, I’d like to confirm the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you add Office 365 Education and Education Plus? I don’t find the related steps from the article mentioned in your post.</li><li>What is your Install and activate command? You may mask your tenant ID and key number. Do you get the error message when using cmd to run that command?</li><li>Your tenant information. We may need to check it from our side. For privacy protection, I have sent you a private message to collect the information. You may find it via the URL

<p>As we discussed above, we need to have Education Plus student SKU (STANDARDWOFFPACK_IW_STUDENT) for device based activation deployment. We may need more information to move forward. Please access

            You can start the Marketplace application on the phone and shop for games there or you can browse the Marketplace from the Zune desktop software (downloadable from http://zune.net).&nbsp;

    <title>Problem connecting to SMTP mail server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon doe senior  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem connecting to SMTP mail server</h2>
                    In Outlook.com I get the "There's a problem connecting to the SMTP mail server." error message when trying to add a send-and-receive account. I use the POP and SMTP settings exactly as the "Find POP or IMAP server setting" defines them in Office 365 support.&nbsp;
 I have tried multiple times over several days.&nbsp; The problem is always the same.&nbsp; Any thoughts on what the issue is?

</p><p>Are you trying to configure office365 or outlook.com in a browser?&nbsp; If a browser these are the settings.&nbsp; If Office please repost this in the office section</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div><strong>If you’d like to manage your Outlook account using an email app, you’ll need to set up your POP3 or SMTP server and port settings
 in your email app. You’ll need the following info:</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POP3 server: pop3.live.com (port 995)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMTP server: smtp.live.com (port 25)<br />
<br />
<br />
<div><em>Choose the Secure Sockets L</em><em>ayer (SSL) option for both POP3 and SMTP connections.</em><br />
<em>Choose the SMTP authentication for SMTP connections.<br />
Choose the outgoing server requires authentication option. (In most email apps, this option isn't checked by default.)</em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User name: Enter your full email address.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password: Enter your Microsoft account password.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If you don’t want email messages to be permanently deleted from your inbox after
 you download them to your mail program, select the Leave a copy of messages on the server option.</span></strong></em><br />
<br />
<strong>Prevent losing email in Outlook.com when you've set up POP3</strong><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Outlook.com
 has a feature that prevents losing email messages if you accidentally set up POP3 to delete them after reading them on the server. Here’s how it works:</span></em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time that Outlook.com receives a POP3 instruction to delete email messages after reading from an email app, Outlook.com won't delete the messages. Instead, Outlook.com moves the email messages that were successfully downloaded by the email app
 into a POP folder and out of the inbox. The POP folder is available in the Folders list.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlook.com keeps the email messages in the POP folder until you sign in to your Outlook.com account and verify whether Outlook.com should respect or ignore the POP3 delete command.<br />
<strong><br />
To verify your POP3 settings:</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the upper-right of the Outlook.com window, click Options, and then click More options.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Managing Your Account, click Pop and deleting downloaded messages, and then select one of the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Don’t let another program delete messages from&nbsp;Outlook.com. (If your other program is set to delete messages from the server, we’ll simply move them to a special POP folder. They won’t be deleted.)<br />
<br />
Do what my other program says—if it says to delete messages, then delete them.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Save.</strong></div>

            <p>ZZ,</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I use my outlook.com to store and create email.&nbsp;I access it through IE11 at onedrive.live.com. &nbsp;I want to use&nbsp;office365 to receive/send and hold email for retrieval by outlook.com. I am trying&nbsp;to configure outlook.com to look to office365&nbsp;to
 send and receive. (If it means anything, I access office365 through sso.GoDaddy.com.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office365 says to set POP server to: outlook.office365.com, Port 995, SSL and set SMTP&nbsp;to smtp.office365.com, port 587, TLS. This results in the "There is a problem connecting to SMTP mail server" error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the settings from your reply (pop3.live.com, port 995, SSL and smtp.live.com, port 25, SSL), then the error message is "It looks like you're trying to add another Outlook.com account with POP. There's a better way.&nbsp; Add your account as Send-only,
 then sign in to the other account and set up Email forwarding."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I try that let me just step back for one second. I have an HTC phone running Windows 8, a Surface RT running Windows RT 8.1, and an HP laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium (SP1).&nbsp; The phone and the Surface send/receive email, and access People/Contacts,
 Calendar, Notes and Photos. The only problem is the HP laptop in Windows 7. If I use IE11 to connect to Outlook.com, then I have access to&nbsp;People/Contacts, Calendar, Notes and Photos&nbsp;but not email.&nbsp; If I use IE11 to&nbsp;connect to Office365, then I have email,
 but no People/Contacts, Calendar, Notes, or Photos.&nbsp; So close, but so far . . . away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to set up a "Send only" account, the dreaded "There is a problem connecting to the SMTP mail server" error message returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does all this suggest where the problem may be?</p>

</p><p>I have a business essentials account with my own domain setup and I want to synchronize one of the email addresses from there with my personal address (hosted at outlook.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue and I went to the business support. After several hours of speaking and explaining they said that i should speak with the outlook.com support. Which I did...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with someone from outlook.com support and after 2-3 hours he went to the Tier 3 engineers. They agreed that this is an issue and they said that they will look into it. After the fix is applied, i will receive an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was happening last week, but i'm still waiting for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I get a reply, i will come back with some additional information.</p>

                    Probably my own fault with mucking about but I keep getting a list of access points coming up when I make phonecall or when I end phonecall. I may have changed a setting regarding access points but I have gone through everything to try and get rid of these
 darn things 'cause it's getting on my quite considerable **bleep**. Anyone offer any help in the form of step by step. I'm not that intelligent you see.

            Hi<br />
<br />
Have looked at these and cannot find anything that I have changed from berfore this started happening. It is really getting on my nerves as the phone, whenever anyone phones, messages or when I phone or message (Before message and after) tries to connect searching
 for access points. It even cuts things off occassionally which isn't fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas?

            Try checking your connection method for text messages, in Messaging -&gt; Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Text Message -&gt; Pref. Conn. and change it to "GSM/UTMS" if it isn't already.<br />
<br />
Check the access point for multimedia messages too.<br />
<br />
Do you have "Reject call with SMS" option turned on in Settings -&gt; Call ? If so, it might be related to the above idea.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I can't think of much else to try.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are experiencing issues with Cortana using the microphone. Let me try and assist you with the issue you are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if you have installed the Italian language pack?</p>
<p>It could be possible that language pack is not downloaded but only the Italian input language is set.</p>
<p>a. From Start, click on 'Settings'.</p>
<p>b. Go to 'Time &amp; language' and click 'Regional &amp; language' and click 'Add a language'.</p>
<p>c. Here, check if Italian language pack is downloaded and installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, go to Speech recognition setting and check if Italian language is shown there.</p>
<p>a. Press 'Windows key + X' and choose 'Control Panel'.</p>
<p>b. Now, type 'Speech Settings'.</p>
<p>c. Click on 'Speech Recognition' and click 'Advanced speech options'.</p>
<p>d. Under Languages, check if Italian language is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 - &#34;Curly quotes&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pretty rudimentary question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to get cruly quotes and not straight ones ("x" and 'x') in the document formated in Slovenian language (Slavic lang.), which uses chevrons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tryed multimple optiones e.g. AutoFormat and AutoFormatAsYouType, but to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can have curly quotes but I have to:</p>
<p>1. Change WORD interface into English (settings in AutoFormat change for smart quotes from
<span>
<span>
»x« into </span>"x", where I can chech "x"; smart ones)</p>
<p><span>2. Format languge in ENG and then applay replace "" for "".</span></p>
<p><span>Well this is not he most elegant solution, becuse during
 writing I still need SLO for proofing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The past part is that in the past I somehow managed to do that, but I forgot how.</span></p>

            <p>Well it does work if I switch to number mode (fn + key) on the keyboard but it is using key as m, n ,l, k, j....as numbers, so I have to switch it all the time. Very inconvinient.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>LibreOffice has optins to choose the quotes regardless of the language... and you can use defalut keyboard settings.<br />

            Perhaps you can re-map the keyboard so that, for example &lt; and &gt; are replaced by those characters.

                    Skype has just updated on my MacBook and iPhone. I've logged back in and all my contacts and chats have disappeared. I have two hotmail accounts and tried logging in with both so that's not the problem. How do I sort this out?

<p>I used to have a Skype account with many contacts, which I started in the 2000s. I had money on my account and then I was told that I would have to verify it. &nbsp;When I logged in to Skype it was the account that has only two contacts, very recent, and I was
 told that I have a 00.00 balance and nothing to reinstate. &nbsp;What happened to my original account, and how can I get my balance reinstated?</p>

<div>You don't seem to have used any of your Skype Credit in a while. It becomes inactive if you haven't used it in 180 days. But don't worry - once it becomes inactive, you can reactivate it whenever you're ready to use it. Simply

How do you keep your balance active? It's simple. Do any of the following and your Skype Credit balance will be active for another 180 days:<br />

So I have two accounts, neither of which still had my credit. &nbsp;How can I get only one Skype account and transfer the few from the latest Skype account to my former account, which should have the credit still. And why is there no phone support?!?

            <p>Hi Joanne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basic problem here is that Windows OneCare no longer exists (<a href="http://onecare.live.com/standard/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/standard/en-us/default.htm</a>).&nbsp; This may be part of why you became infected.&nbsp; But Microsoft
 offers other options.&nbsp; I strongly suggest installing Microsoft Security Essentials as the best replacement.&nbsp; I'll address installation in a moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are currently infected, it's not really a good idea to install MSE under those conditions.&nbsp; Hence, I recommend the following to clean-up the system first:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span>
 and then run a full Safety Scan from Microsoft:</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a><span>. (Later, you may want to run these periodically as a backup
 for MSE to catch anything it may have missed - I personally do so weekly).&nbsp; These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected,
 you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you
 can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*********************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the system is cleaned, here's how to prepare the system, download, install and setup MSE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To determine your version of Windows, go to Start / Computer / System Properties and it should tell you the name and version and if it is 32-bit or 64-bit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>All you need is to prepare the computer, download and install MSE, update and configure the settings on MSE (including scheduled scans if you want and I suggest and making sure real-time protection is checked along with check all downloads and check
 all files and programs), update the definitions, and run a quick scan to be sure you're clean (or a full scan if you have the time) and you'll be good to go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</span></a><span>
 - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></b></a><span>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.&nbsp; This certainly means at least OneCare in your situation.&nbsp; Here's how to do that:
<a href="http://onecare.live.com/standard/en-us/install/uninstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://onecare.live.com/standard/en-us/install/uninstall.htm</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install, go to </span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span> and click on languages and locales
 at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it).<span>&nbsp;
</span>When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is
 as safe as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine
 and save.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining
 the infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*******************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            The functionality which you are seeking is no longer possible. Excel starting 2013 has implemented SDI (single document interface) as opposed to earlier MDI (multiple document interface)

            Actually, I thought I had separate instances on Excel open, but I didn't.&nbsp; I have since figured out how to open a separate instance, and now I can open each file with the same name in the separate instances....my problem is solved!&nbsp; Thanks.

                    Hello, Since IE8 was installed in our company (previously we had IE6 and not that problem), on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 Pcs, the following issue appeared : When users try to preview a long page (more than 1 page) before printing it, only the first
 page is displayed in the preview (and if they print it's the same, only the first page prints). This issue doesn't happens on every long web page. Most pages are ok, but some have this issue, and when they do, it's systematic (every time and on all the machines).
 I've noticed that the 'simple layout' pages (pure texte listing, etc) are always ok, it's when the page has more complicated layout, for exemple several tables included the ones in the others (a big table contains for exemple 2 smaller tables which, each,
 contains several even smaller tables) that the problem occures. The issue can be reproduced on ANY printer, including virtual printers such as Adobe Printer. To launch IE8 without addon doesn't change anything. Run IE8 in compati

<li>Verify that you've done all of the steps in Shauna Kelly's article.</li><li>In the document you're working with, click the Multilevel List button and click the Define New Multilevel List item at the bottom of the menu. (A dialog will open with whatever list definition already exists in the document.)</li><li>In the dialog, click the More button to expand it.</li><li>Press the Alt key and the Print Screen key together, which puts a screen shot of the dialog on the clipboard. Then cancel the dialog.<br />
</li><li>Start the Microsoft Paint program, and paste from the clipboard into the blank canvas; then save it as a .jpg file on your hard drive.</li><li>Reply in this thread. Mention which version of Word you're using. Click the 'Add image' button in the toolbar of the Reply box, browse to the file containing the screenshot, and upload it. Then describe (or show screenshots) how the numbering appears in
 the document versus how you expect it to appear.</li></ul>
<p>With that information, I (or someone else here) can help you get the results you want.<br />

<h2>            E-mail attachment limitations &#63;</h2>
                    Salutations, Nokians !<br />
<br />
Im looking to buy another Nokia from my 2 year-old nokia 6021. But this time a high-tech one that allows me to work away from a net conection but still ship work to the office. Which Nokia can fixes my problem which follows:<br />
<br />
Im off to vacations in a place with no net or computer - im taking along with me my Macbook in order to do office work such as an Autocad .DWG drawing with 5Mb and want to ship that file trough my nokia as an e-mail attachment into the mailbox of my office.<br />
<br />
Which of these Nokias does such kind of e-mail attachment (other than the basic .DOC, .XLS, .MP3, .JPG): Is it the N70, N73, N80, E61, N65 or 9300 ???<br />
<br />
Regards, Alexa.

            hello Niaz - are you saying that sadly only the E61i can handle ZIP files? Darn... and i thought all E series (for being office tools) could do all extensions like Doc, Xls, Pdf, Ppt, Mp3, Jpg and Zip. So, not even my favorite model, the E65? *sigh*

            Why not just use the Nokia phone as a (bluetooth) modem with your MacBook? Then what files the phone can handle does not matter.

            whats only possible on a macbook and a celular phone (no matter if its nokia or my motorola) is the use of iSync app. and that is only to copy/paste or backup the adresses and contacts from the MD card - but its not an interactive program like nokia´s
 phone tools that manages internet and modem setup also! since nokia and motorola dont have tools to work with apple (nor any other brand other than apple iphone), i must have a windows OS in order to plug and set my motorola as modem and only then foward a
 zip attach within an email from a phone.

    <title>Having problem using Mailgun to send emails to Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neptuneqiu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having problem using Mailgun to send emails to Outlook</h2>
                    Our company recently move our mail service from AmazonSES to Mailgun. We bought a dedicated IP to send our email (this IP has never used to send emails before, no records in SendScore). After using Mailgun it's working well when sending email to yahoo.com,
 gmail.com, etc., and even hotmail.com. But when we send email to Outlook there is a problem. The server response code was 250 and returned no SMTP or any other error. But we can't find the email in the Outlook account, neither in Inbox nor in Spam. It just
 get lost. But if we use a shared IP (other domains have used it for sending for a long time) instead of the new dedicated IP, Outlook can receive the email correctly. The DKIM is set correctly, SPF is softfail but it works well with the shared IP. What should
 I do to make emails sent from our new IP can arrive at Outlook?

<p>Thanks for response!,<br />
Yes i have new sim card but with my colleague sim card the same effect- no difference.<br />
Nokia Care suite? from where i can take it?<br />
<br />
i recover two times that phone and still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>once it works once not. I observe that after once it's recognize song it recognize every time up to switch off app<br />
i'm pretty sure that it's some problems with software but i don't know this is windows problem or shazam encore problem. this phone have 4 mic's so probably software cant support it properly.<br />
<br />
unfortunately on guaranty i can only give phone if it don't work permanently everywhere but dictaphone and most calls work normally. this only time to time problem- shazam it's mostly but this not on guaranty...<br />
<br />
this one from many bugs in this highest model from microsoft... it's still good phone but i'm disappoint- because always i have flagships and this one it worst from each....</p>

            <p>When it comes to Shazam, there is that ongoing thread without any solution yet. The community is not sure whether that is a software or a hardware issue. All we can do is waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in this thread, I am concerned about your call issue:</p>
<p>Officially, the Nokia Care Suite is not available to use end-users, officially. Anyway, if you went for a new SIM and you went for the Recovery Tool, still calls have this issue, I would return that phone. Even if that cause is randomly for you, you are
 entitled for guarantee because some hardware issues depend on certain circumstances, end-users like us cannot double-check or reproduce. Anyway, in such a case like yours, please, make sure to include a
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/using-bug-reporter/problem-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
detailed error report</a>—especially 1) that you used the tool, 2) tried a new SIM 3) different SIM, 4) and with which operator(s) you experience this issue.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 deleting email after 24 hours - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christieciesielski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 deleting email after 24 hours</h2>
                    Recently updated to Windows 10/Office 2013. &nbsp;Emails in all folders including my inbox are being deleted approx. every 24 hours. &nbsp;Was told a back up should have occured during the update but that was not the case. &nbsp;All email lost for good!!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;Tech
 Support claims to have created a rule to solve this issue (Ill have to wait and see tomorrow). &nbsp;They were not able to find the 24 emails that are mysteriously in limbo in the trash folder. &nbsp;Apparently they know this has been occuring since the upgrade. &nbsp;Tech
 Support transfered me to someone in the 'Windows department' where there was another convenient 45 minute wait, did not have an opportunity to speak with anyone as I was immediately disconnected after a recorded message said 'we cannot take your call now'.
 &nbsp;All in all, I spent 3 hours on the phone just to find out noone knows how to fix this.. Hopefully too many others are not experiencing this as its frustrating to know school and work info

            <p>Which mail account type are you using? POP3, IMAP, Exchange, Outlook.com, other...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook doesn't have an "auto-delete" function without you configuring it first (AutoArchive and even then the default is to store it in another pst-file and not to delete it).</p>

</p><p>If you are synching with a mail server, are these emails still available in webmail?</p>

            IMAP... &nbsp;Email is syncing to webmail, provider does not have my emails on their server any longer. &nbsp;I use the word delete because ALL of my emails are gone 24 hours after receipt, read or not.. and surely not deleted by me.

            <p>Do you perhaps have this account configured on another device as well?</p>
<p>When that is configured as a POP3 account, then that device will remove the items from the server when it isn't set to leave a copy. As IMAP syncs with the server,&nbsp;the deletion&nbsp;will then of course also sync back to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't directly remember which other device your have configured with this account, your ISP&nbsp;may be able to&nbsp;see in their logs which computer initiated the Delete command for your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to check the Windows Mail app as well since that also supports POP3.</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All accounts are configured as IMAP accounts. &nbsp;I do appreciate your insight as Ive found some other small glitches such as my sceen saver. &nbsp;It says it is set to 'trigger' at the 5 minute mark, however it does not. &nbsp;I am assuming there is a secondary setting
 causing the screen saver not to 'deploy'? &nbsp;</p>
