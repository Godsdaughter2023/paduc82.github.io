                    <p>Canon iPF8400... Trying to re-install printer driver, which was working previous to my getting a printer offline message. So I uninstalled the driver (confirming it's not showing in the Control Panel)... But upon trying to re-install the driver, I get a

</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to remove any printer wires or cables from your computer and check.</p>
<p>Also If it still won't work, try running the <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Open&nbsp; <span>Start,</span> enter <span>Devices and Printers,</span> select it from the list of results, and select your printer.&nbsp;Then select

<p>
</p><li>
<p>If Windows doesn’t automatically find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their installation instructions.

            <p>Joy- Thanks for the reply. Yes, I've deleted the printer through the control panel before restarting the computer, at which point I check my printer listings to make sure it's not shown. I still get that 'printer driver in use' error when I try to re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link to the printing troubleshooter. When I run it, low and behold, the iPF8400 is still showing in that list, but the utility runs into an 'unexpected error,' and has to quit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem persists. I'll try to restart my computer and run the troubleshooter again. Fingers crossed.</p>

            <p>You suck big time. You know that ??</p>
<p>Windows 10 OS is random behaving, not predictable. MS can learn a lot from other 'recent' entrants in to OS arena like big 'G'. Even after 30 plus years of start of 'windoz' Operating Systems to squeeze public's money, your software is no where near ready
 for general use.</p>
<p>I have been trying to install this Brother printer which is supposed to be PnP, but Win10 doesn't recognize it, but just gives a small sound that printer has been connected and nothing else. No installation of default drivers. Even when I install manually,
 it doesn't print a test page. If I want to uninstall it says 'printer is still in use' and can't be uninstalled.</p>
<p>More painful is your retarded answers to the simple questions.</p>

<p>Hi Jessie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Floppy disk drivers has been removed for certain build versions of Windows 10. We are currently looking at the possibility in bringing this back on the future builds, but it is still uncertain as to when will it be completed. You can check out
<strong>Eliyas Yakub [MSFT]</strong>'s answer from <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_devices/usb-floppy-disk-drives-not-working-in-windows-10/ba036314-5987-4293-9223-0c053335d5f4">this thread</a></strong>
 for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, your laptop's manufacturer might have installed a working floppy disc driver, hence it's working on your laptop, but this might not be the case for your PC. We suggest that you try checking for driver updates, but we cannot guarantee that this
 will work for your PC.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Cannot Connect to WPA2 Enterprise or prompted for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff cooper k2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Cannot Connect to WPA2 Enterprise or prompted for credentials.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo E545 with Windows 7 Pro (not upgraded, it came with this).&nbsp; Drivers up to date. Cannot connect to a WAP using WPA2 Enterprise (RADIUS).<br />
<br />
Apple computers connect fine, as do iOS devices and Androids.&nbsp; When setting up the connection, I have disabled auto-logon using windows credentials, I have tried leaving user credentials blank (I don't get a prompt no matter what I do) and tried enter my credentials
 which work on other devices.<br />
<br />
Encryption type EAP, tried unchecking Validate Server Certificate.&nbsp; Every other device, at worst, brings up a certificate with a warning to let you override. This doesn't even give a message to let me know whether or not the problem IS security related. It
 just says "Windows was unable to connect..."&nbsp; The troubleshooter has no idea why either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeff</p>

<p><strong>Alright, So I uninstalling Comodo Time machine. It gave me an error.. I restarted...</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I&nbsp;finally&nbsp;got it uninstalled(I think)&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>But the computer would not boot. I used some repair program(forget the name) to repair the MBR(boot thing)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>It repaired it and I restarted.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>When I start it it gave me the options to start normally or start system repair.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I clicked system repair.. it said it was repairing the hard disk for errors and it stayed that way for 12+ hours.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I restarted and the same options came up.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I clicked start normally.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>It said "Windows starting" and then it would restart.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Is there anything I can do?</span></strong></p>

<p>Hello derik123derik12,</p>
<p>Now your system is up, I suggest you try a System Restore point to before you uninstalled Comodo TimeMachine.<br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type “System Restore” and hit enter<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option “choose a different restore point” and hit next</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.<br />
<br />
Then check and see if this helps to resolve your issue of not being able to start your computer.</p>
<p>Check with Comodo to see if they have a recommended uninstallation of their product.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further assist you, we need to ask you the following questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the name of this app?</li><li>When was the last time it worked?</li><li>Have you done any updates or upgrades on your Windows version before this issue started to happen?</li><li>Have you tried reinstalling the app again to see if it will work?</li></ul>
<p>

<p>Not OP but having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC scan and it found no errors, I then tried uninstalling and reinstalling Plex (in case it fix it), but no dice. Same error "MfPlat.dll missing", how on Earth does this happen so frequently? Can you guys just release working updates for crying out
 loud?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I incorrectly marked your response as helpful. If you have any voice at all shout to the monolith to fix their [stuff] and stop releasing half-baked updates without a media package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to your update history and check the version number you were last updated to.
<br />
For me it was 1703.&nbsp;</li><li>Search Google (not Bing) for the update number and media feature package for N<br />
For me it was "Media Feature Pack for N version 1703"</li><li>Install the version that relates to your OS (x86 for 32bit or x64 for 64bit)</li><li>Optional: Spit on Windows and go to Linux, it's almost more user friendly than this</li></ol>

<p>I am <strong>totally </strong>surprised that Microsoft has managed to release a half-baked update
<strong>once again</strong>. By the way, I <em>will </em>be posting to this thread every time this happens. If you lock this thread I will just go somewhere more public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would think that if my computer has the media package, Microsoft&nbsp;wouldn't just remove it every time they have an update, but apparently, that is too hard for them to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to your Win button</li><li>Search "Windows Update settings", click it&nbsp;</li><li>Click on "View installed update history"</li><li>Find the version number of the update, for me it was 1709</li><li>Go to Google and search "Media Feature Pack version 1709"</li><li>Click the top link and download 32bit or 64bit depending on Windows type</li><li>Sigh at how frustrating Microsoft is, while you install something they remove from your computer every few months.</li></ol>

<p>We have been saving the game files to the hard drive (NOT cloud) and I tried to find the game saves on the xbox and cloud when loading a game save. &nbsp;For some reason I remember the game saying it was syncing with the cloud at one point and I have no idea
 why. &nbsp;I would not think that would delete local saves????</p>

    <title>Why can my Surface Pro 2 now not wirelessly connect to my TV&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesonthesurface  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can my Surface Pro 2 now not wirelessly connect to my TV&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was extremely pleased when I discovered I could simply add my Sony Bravia TV as a wireless display.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that when I did this, my TV showed up as a play device and as a display. Then, a few weeks ago, my Surface Pro 2 stopped connecting to my TV as a wireless display and only allowed me to use it as a play device, which is far less desirable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I try to add it now, I can see my TV in my add a device options, but after displaying "connecting" for a long time I get the error message "Try again, and make sure your television is discoverable."
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I haven't installed any additional software on my surface to do with wireless displays and the TV has the same settings as before. I am concerned that some how this feature has been taken away in an update, as when I search for videos or answers on forums,
 I get people talking about using Intel WiDi or some other casting options.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was delighted to find that the surface I bought was able to do this out of the box, and I am a little frustrated (as I have tried to fix this myself for quite a while) but mostly disappointed as I loved this feature.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If anyone could assist me in finding the solution to my problem, or provide me with a reason this will not work, I would really appreciate it.</p>

 from my mobile phone.&nbsp; I'd like to know if there is anything that needs switching on within my PC to gain the Miracast functionality and thereby send a Miracast to my TV, or if there is anything that I can buy to plug into the desktop PC itself to give it
 the functionality to produce a Miracast output.</p>

<p>Hi Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the reply, I'd found the second link earlier today, but not the first.&nbsp; Currently this is the situation I am in (taken from the first link)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If you don’t see “<strong>Add a wireless display</strong>” when you tap the <strong>
Devices</strong> charm and tap <strong>Project</strong>, try going to Windows Update and downloading all available updates (including optional drivers). If you still don’t see it, check for additional updates on your PC manufacturer’s support site, or contact
 them to ask how you can get this feature on your PC. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all the updates and still don't see 'Add a wireless display".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You put above that I will need to buy a Miracast adapter.&nbsp; That's the conclusion I'd come too so it's good to see that confirmed.&nbsp; However, I can't seem to find one.&nbsp; There are plenty of Miracast adapters for putting onto things like&nbsp;TV's to make them able
 to receive a Miracast signal, but I don't need one of these - my TV (a modern Sony Bravia seems perfectly happy with the concept when sent to by my Android phone.&nbsp; It's a Miracast&nbsp;SENDER that I need to find and I think even in those linked to articles they
 only recommend receivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sort of hoping that something like a plug in&nbsp;Miracast sending dongle or maybe a USB Miracast sending device which would plug into a PC would be made, if anyone had links to something that would be suitable for plugging into
 a Windows 8.1 HP Pavillion desktop I'd be very pleased to hear from them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>NB.&nbsp; I am away over half-term so please&nbsp;don't worry if I appear&nbsp;to abandon the thread.</p>

            Buy a Wireless device that supports Miracast.
<br />
<br />Be sure to check with the System Maker to see their recommendations
<br />Make sure your video device and driver support Windows Display Driver Model - WDDM 1.3 or later 
<br />
<br />You need a Windows 8.1 compatible (most will be) USB Miracast Transmitter.

            HI XG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />2) Is this only happening with Office files?  If so try repairing Office at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Modify &gt; Repair.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4)  If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi XGabriel
<br />
<br />1.
<br />If this is only happening with Office Files, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .
<br />
<br />2.
<br />If this is happening all the time with all types of files:
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />If necessary, choose the processes Tab, then click the CPU column header, so that arrow faces down
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When your CPU is at 100%, what are the top 5 processes at that time?       
        </p>

<p>Did not fix the problem, when I select an office file word, excel etc explorer gets stuck not responding and when I pull up task manager this is what i get, very high power usage, which does not make sense its a brand new computer with 512g hard drive the
 files are not heavy, then the only way out is to x on the windows explorer window which then makes all icons disappear for a bit and then back to normal</p>

<h2>            Mouse stickiness change with multiple monitors after Windows 8.1 Update 1&#58; Bug or feature&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There is a new bug that won't let the mouse to the other screen unless you move the mouse quickly across the monitor edge. Before, this would only happen on the corner edges to allow easier access to the charms and apps bar. Now, it happens to the whole
 edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">These four videos demonstrate that the mouse stickiness issue happens in both desktop and metro mode and that it is inconsistent - only happening sometimes. I hope these videos help paint a clear picture
 of what is going on.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Is this issue already known and will there be a hotfix, or is this a new feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>November&nbsp;12th 2014 Update</em></strong></p>
Mouse stickiness still a problem as of today for Windows 8.1. As of Windows 10 Build 9879 which was released today, the mouse stickiness is fixed! This mouse stickiness only happens when dragging a window around and is used to assist in snapping windows. Outside
 of this, the stickiness issue is gone! I think this was what Microsoft intended to do with the mouse stickiness, but I believe it was a hard bug to diagnose, but they finally fixed it!
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>November 2nd 2014 Update</em></strong></p>
Mouse stickiness still a problem as of today for Windows 8.1. As of Build 9860 of Windows 10 Technical Preview, the mouse stickiness bug/feature has started happening.
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>June 9th 2014 Update</em></strong></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Still no official word from Microsoft. I have found a fix, but it is more of a workaround. Just don't use any metro apps, and it should be fine. Very rarely you will get the&nbsp;stickiness&nbsp;again.
 If it does occur anyways just press WIN + P&nbsp;and click Duplicate. After all monitors are duplicated, press WIN + P again and then click Extend to go back, and the mouse stickiness issue should be gone.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>May 16th 2014 Update</em></strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7f0aae79-fedb-4efc-a2b0-00e7e76111e6" title="Shawn">
Shawn "Cmdr" Keene [MVP]</a>&nbsp;at the end of page 2<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>, this is NOT a bug and it is an intentional&nbsp;design. I
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">hope that Shawn is incorrect</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;and would like further verification by an employee of the Windows development team.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There is also a "fix" by editing some registry values, but this removes the mouse&nbsp;stickiness&nbsp;on the corners and makes it very hard to access the apps and charms bar&nbsp;in between&nbsp;monitors. I
 do not believe this is a fix to the&nbsp;problem.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>May 5th 2014 Update</em></strong></p>
<p>Still no word from Microsoft that this is a bug or feature.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply. I tried what you suggested, and it still does not work, unless I go through quickly. Compared to showing the taskbar while in a Metro app, I have to apply a relatively faster speed to move my cursor to the other monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon trying to duplicate the problem, I found out that this only happens sometimes. The only requirement for all instances&nbsp;that occurred was to&nbsp;have a Metro app
<strong>running.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple ways to duplicate this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest is to open a Metro application, and try to drag it to another screen. You will see the issue that I linked to in my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second way is to swap from desktop to a Metro application. It does not matter how you do it. While the header bar is displayed, the issue will occur. When it disappears, the issue also disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above two ways don't always work, but when trying it, the issue happened most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Playing around with the issue, I realized that I need the same amount of mouse speed to go to the other monitor when the "Task Manager" or Charms bar is open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this, I deduce the issue has to do with the new header bar in Metro applications and the protection of the mouse going onto the other monitor while the "Task Manager" or Charms bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe Windows 8.1 Update 1 is falsely detecting that the "Task Manager" or Charms bar is open, and it is prevent my cursor to go to the other screen unless I apply a reasonable amount of speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps the people that fix these issues,</p>
<p>PhamAP</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm this issue. I have 3x monitor and I just updated to W8.1 update ~1 hour ago.</p>
<p>As soon as I went to desktop and opened something, I was trying to move it to another monitor and faced this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Behavior BEFORE W8.1 update (i.e., w8.1):</p>
<p>there is a small area from top and bottom (~100px height) of each left/right edge of all monitor where your mouse cursor will get stuck if you are moving it slowly. This has been done (on Windows 8.1) to help activate charms for mouse users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Behavior AFTER W8.1 update (I.e., w8.1u):</p>
<p>1. The stickiness level has been increased a little</p>
<p>2. The small area (~100px height) has been changed to 100%.</p>
<p>#2 is the real culprit. This is almost a deal breaker. I am having SERIOUS issues moving windows from one monitor to another. And often, the cursor would just get stuck in the edge while going from one to another monitor just because im not moving it really
 fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ideally, I'd like an option somewhere to configure the stickiness and height of that area.</p>

<p>I can also confirm this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 3 monitor system; I installed the update this morning and the issue is so terrible that I decided to hit the forums to log a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't figure out the logic completely, but the problem definitely seems to get worse when I have a metro app running; butting up against either side of the screen causes the mouse to stick, and I can't move it across the boundary with out jittering the
 mouse to keep trying to push over the boundary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that the problem has a delay on it. It seems as though when the minimize/close bar is visible that it's impossible to move outside the boundaries of the monitor it's on completely when the app is maximized again from the taskbar.
<br />
<br />
ONE scenario repro:<br />
<br />
1. Maximize a metro app on any monitor (close/minimize bar appears at top of metro app)</p>
<p>2. Notice the stickiness of the mouse unable to cross boundaries until it hides itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen it in other scenarios but I can't figure out how to repro. A few more hours of usage I'll have it dialed in.</p>

<p>Now change duplicate back to extend &gt; apply.</p>

</p><p>Cursor stickiness back to Windows 8.1 style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing this "fixes the issue"...kinda...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After setting the setting to duplicate, and reverting (you don't have to accept, then go back to extend), the issue appears to go away. &nbsp;However! &nbsp;If you at any point either enter a metro app (for example, I use the default Mail app) and then minimize it
 or go back to desktop without closing it, put your computer to sleep, or restart your computer, the issue returns until I once again set my desktop to duplicate and revert again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: &nbsp;After the issue presents itself, even if you close all metro apps, the issue does not go away. &nbsp;If you close the metro app via the 'x' in the top right (without at any time prior having left the metro app), thus dumping you back to the desktop, the
 issue does NOT present itself.</p>

            <p>I have been able to successfully repro this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<p>1. go to start screen</p>
<p>2. click a metro app (onenote in my test case)</p>
<p>3. move mouse to top left corner and click so it switches app (to desktop or to another metro app; doesn't matter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now mouse will be sticky thru out ALL edges of the monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really seems to be a bug that happens when you use the metro app switcher or something to do with top left corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Temporary Fix when this happens:</p>
<p>1. switch to any metro app</p>
<p>2. move mouse to top so the (useless) titlebar pops up.</p>
<p>3. move mouse away</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes you need to close all metro apps instead of just the above steps.</p>
<p>The extend desktop/duplicate desktop switching also works.</p>

            <p>Right click on the Start button and select open Windows Explorer. <br />
When Windows Explorer is open, go to the right hand corner, and when you hover over More Options, click on the drop down arrows. Select Details.
<br />
<br />
Then see if you find the file info.txt. <br />
If you know it is to be on the desktop, you can select Dektop on the left hand side, and then again select Details.
<br />
You can also do a search for *.txt and it should list all of your .txt files on your computer on the desktop.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

                    I am trying to install .net framework 3.5, it is a required program to run turbotax. The Turbotax CD has tried to install, but has been unsuccessful. Also, I have tried to intall from microsoft.&nbsp; After many times, finally the program was installed, but
 when I try to intall TurboTax, it states the program&nbsp;still needs to be installed.&nbsp; I can't find it in my programs, either. So I am assuming it did not install correctly.&nbsp; I don't know what else to do, thought maybe I might need to update windows vista?

<h2>            Error&#58; not enough hard drive space during file transfer using Windows Easy Transfer </h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Windows Easy Transfer from XP Computer to Windows 7 computer - problems</p>
<p>I used Windows Easy Transfer to transfer all of my files and settings from my old XP computer to my new Windows 7 computer. It was about 180gb worth of stuff. I used an external hard drive to do the transfer. With only a few minutes left in the 4 1/2 hour
 &nbsp;transfer, it stopped and said that there was not enough hard drive space. &nbsp;I checked and saw that there was still plently of room but I still deleted a bunch of large video files just to be sure (and yes, I did empty the Recycle Box). &nbsp;I pressed "retry" and
 it still came back with the same message. &nbsp;Deleted some more and still the same result. &nbsp;I then pressed "cancel".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed quite a few of the files were saved on the new computer twice. Now I have most of my stuff on my new &nbsp;computer but I don't know what stuff did not make it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do? Should I run the Windows Easy Transfer again? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi glasstumbler,</p>
<p>1. Do you have multiple partitions on your XP computer?<br />
2. Are you transferring the data only from C drive or from multiple drives?</p>
<p>Windows Easy Transfer maps the old computer drives to the new computer drives while transferring data, i.e If you choose to transfer files and settings from the C and D drives on your old computer, but your new computer only has a C drive, then you will
 be asked to select which drive on your new computer you want to transfer the information to, however if both computers have the same drive letters, you will not see this page. Instead, information on each drive on your old computer will be transferred to the
 respective drives on your new computer. For example, if your old computer has C and D drives, then information on those drives will be transferred to the C and D drives on your new computer.</p>
<p>If the size on the other partition doesn't have enough disk space then we come across the error: "Not enough hard drive space available"</p>
<p><strong>We&nbsp;would recommend:</strong><br />
a. Click on Advanced when transferring files from the old computer and select the only files and settings that you want to transfer, if other partitions are selected make sure to uncheck them if it’s not required for you to transfer.<br />
b. If you would like to create new drives or increase drive space on your new computer, do it before starting the transfer.<br />
c. Try to transfer one partition data at a time and check.</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>Once the transfer process is successful or failure, you can anytime view Windows Easy Transfer Reports to know the details about the transfer.<br />
