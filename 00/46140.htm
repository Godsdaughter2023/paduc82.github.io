            Hi Saurav,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.</div>
<div><br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>Do you get any error code or error message, while connecting to an ad hoc network?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>An ad hoc network is a temporary connection between computers and devices used for a specific purpose, such as sharing documents during a meeting or playing multiplayer computer games. You can also temporarily share an Internet connection with other people
 on your ad hoc network, so those people don’t have to set up their own Internet connections. Ad hoc networks can only be wireless, so you must have a wireless network adapter installed in your computer to set up or join an ad hoc network.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows 10 misses the ability to set ad hoc network feature, But Windows 10 has the Internet Connection Sharing or ICS feature that permits your PCs internet connection to connect with the devices, though you cannot share the internet as it does not permit
 to set up a wireless network connection. The ad hoc wireless connection switches your PC to a virtual Wi-Fi router permitting internet connection to other devices, although each with a different IP address. Today in the article of Windows 10 we will show you
 Create Wireless Ad Hoc Internet Connection on Windows 10 but make sure that your network adapter is updated to the latest version.</div>
<div><br />
Let’s try to refer to the suggestions provided by ThofikhAhamad replied on August 23, 2015, to fix your issue.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Won&#39;t Refund My Accidental Purchase and Won&#39;t Tell Me Why - Just Keep Closing the Case</h2>
                    <p>So I accidentally bought Star Wars Battlefront 2, I thought I was just downloading a game I had already purchased and didn't realize I was actually buying it. I then realized my mistake and tried to request a refund; after about 2 days I just got an email
 telling me the case was closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then contacted support and they told me to try again and to reply to the case closed email, which I did and then got no feedback until a couple days after that I just got an email again telling me the case was closed.</p>
<p>I then contacted support again and they told me that they can see the refund was denied; however I hadn't had the game open for more than 20 minutes and I requested the refund on the same day I had bought it, so there's no way I had exceeded any of the restrictions
 for a refund.</p>
<p>I have now sent another email and am awaiting a reply.</p>
<p>I just don't understand how they won't send me any information except telling me the case is closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>***UPDATE***</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted support again just now and was told once again to just send an email. After calling his supervisor, he also told me to send an email. I told them both that I had already sent numerous emails and that I was getting no reply and they just told
 me to carry on sending emails.</p>
<p>This is honestly ridiculous as it seems like they can only read from a script and can't actually help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games and apps are only eligible for a refund within 14 days of purchase, and only if you've played less than 2 hours across all accounts.

            I would maybe say changed my mind on purchase? Instead of accident? As rules state if less then 2 hours played and 14 days from purchase you can request a refund. Good luck!&nbsp;

            That would then detract from the entire point of the refund request. There is a section on the refund form specifically for accidental purchases.

</p><p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AteMIMr1aMUOhnq08zwGdewvSJi0<br />
</p>
<p>The first/oldest 3 files are just ones from random crashes that happened while i was browsing the web or gaming or just beeing idle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last mini dmp and the large dmp file are from when I ran the driver verifier test on Windows. It immediately crashed right after restarting&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/097c5252-2186-4bfe-94c7-16bb0970f4d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/097c5252-2186-4bfe-94c7-16bb0970f4d9" /></a></p>
<p>Stop Code: DRIVER VERIFIER DTECTED VIOLATION<br />
</p>
<p>but it didn't say which driver was causing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already done a complete fresh install of Windows 10 but after a day or so (I ofcourse already had all my programms installed again) it started crashing again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me fix this because I do not know how to open and read the dmp files and I have tried so many things but it keeps crashing my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

    <title>External Monitor Turns Off With Lid Close on Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colinwtx  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Monitor Turns Off With Lid Close on Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>Current Setup:</p>
<p>- Microsoft Surface Pro (2017)</p>
<p>- Surface Dock</p>
<p>- External Monitor (LG Widescreen, HDMI to Display Port Adapter connected to Dock)</p>
<p>- Wireless Keyboard/Mouse (connected to Dock)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to close the lid on the Surface Pro and utilize the external monitor. I have changed the Power Settings to ensure that when the Surface Pro is plugged in and the lid is closed, it is to do nothing. I am able to operate with the Surface Pro lid
 closed and use my external monitor for only a brief time before the external monitor returns to a blank screen and the Surface Pro reverts back to its own screen. I've tried the Windows button + P to set the Surface Pro to use the second screen only but it
 does not work (it always reverts back to using the Surface Pro screen).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers for the monitor are up to date. Surface Pro is fully up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What settings do I need to change to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Free 35 000 VC with 3 month Xbox live subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pjthestar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free 35 000 VC with 3 month Xbox live subscription</h2>
                    While on the home of my xbox one X. I noticed a promotion stating that if i bought 3 months of xbox live, I would get 35000 VC for NBA 2k19. 4 days past and I noticed I still havent got it. I called xbox support only to find out that it was a US only promotion.
 Im in canada and I do not switch IPs. The supervisor named Armando who was very rude and super monotone told me that I was basically out of luck and there is nothing I can do. He couldnt even issue me a refund for my 3 month subscription. What happened do
 the days where xbox actually cared about its customers? Give me a refund or give me the VC as promised.&nbsp;

<p>Fair enough. Just good to know microsoft has no proper way of making up for their mistake, other than offering a refund through a delayed, abnormal process. Im not here to say what the proper resolution should have been. But saying it was a glitch, taking
 no responsibility, and offering a refund through that rediculous method is pretty lame. Any reputable business/ company will honour in the customers favour for any false advertisement or misleading promition. I would expect no less from microsoft. &nbsp;10 year
 xbox user/customer here. &nbsp;Will definitely be remembering this kind of treatment and policy in the future. &nbsp; Thanks for your responses. Hopefully I can get a refund, or hopefully someone reading this can admit there was a problem and can turn an upset frustrated
 customer back into a loyal one. If that even matters anymore..&nbsp;</p>

            On any promotion it is helpful to read all the information and fine print before buying into a promotion. Hopefully the info that smwutches provided will help you get the Xbox live issue resolved.

            I did read all the fine print before purchasing. On the console. There is no section for fine print. On the website there is fine print. 100% garanteed you have only seen the website promition which has the fine print. Trying to make me seem stupid for
 not reading it. Again, trying to pass the blame to the customer. If I thought for even a second that this was an error on my hand, I wouldnt be trying to get this fixed. &nbsp;Ive tried contacting support. They tell me to come to the sales and promotion forum.
 I come here and you tell me to contact support again. &nbsp;Microsoft has really lost its way on how to help people.&nbsp;

<p>The promotion appeared on my xbox one x console. You know in the bottom right hand of the home screen? There is always alternating ads/ promotions there. One showed up. Promotion said. Buy 3 months of xbox live gold @ 40% off and recieve 35 000 VC for free
 (NBA 2k19). I went through with the renewal on the console. I was charged 17.99 cdn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was not 3rd party. Didnt do it on a mobile device/ PC. &nbsp;Did not say US only. Did not say wait untill 12/31/2018. &nbsp;My region is Canada, always has been.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Hard drive at 100&#37; utilization but IO stops and freezes machine</h2>
                    <p>I have been struggling a bit here and I need help.&nbsp; I have a relatively new (was installed clean a few months back for my wife but not used much) install of windows 10.&nbsp; The main system drive is a WD Raptor SATA drive.&nbsp; She had it off for a while (1 month
 or so) and when windows did its automatic updates it has been screwy since.&nbsp; I have narrowed it down to about 2-5 minutes after starting windows (after logging in) the Hard drive utilization is pegged at 100% and the disk IO just stops.&nbsp; At this point the
 entire system is unresponsive.&nbsp; Safe mode works fine.&nbsp; Safe mode with networking works fine.&nbsp; Uninstalled my AV (thinking that may have been the culprit).&nbsp; Unplugged the network cable, command prompt (admin) and stopped the background intelligence transfer
 service and win update service...system works fine.&nbsp; Deleted the software packages\download director contents (perhaps corrupted update download)... kind of stuck here.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event manger shows no errors in system or application logs.&nbsp; check disk shows no errors or problems...&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; This is un-useable now and I can't figure out the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to try to use system restore and go back to a point like 7 weeks ago and has
 been sitting for ~2 hrs with the bar going back and forth.&nbsp; Have no clue if that has hung now too or not...going to bed and hopefully it worked over night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions??&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all in advance.</p>

            <p>I've been using and fixing issues with 10 for a while and this 100% disk usage appears to be a new(ish) one.&nbsp; The listed "fixes" appear to be quite a few.&nbsp; Hope this isn't as bad as the Startup/Cortana freeze issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fixes I've seen:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Disabled superfetch&nbsp; (greatest success)<br />
</li><li>Disabled Windows search</li><li>Disabled all notifications (try 'Show me tips about Windows' first)<br />
</li><li>Disabled pagefile (be careful with this one; if you manage your own make sure its big enough); I've certainly seen systems that appear to think they've run out of memory and start wildly accessing the pagefile and actual memory usage has been minimal.</li><li>disable MSI mode https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3083595</li></ol>
<p>If no luck with these then its restoring back to a previous time; 10 refresh (keeping data); 10 reset (losing data) and finally clean 10 install.</p>

            <p>Not sure what the startup/Cortana freeze issue is, have a link or a name I can search to find it and the solution?&nbsp; I disabled all that on my main system but left it on in case my wife wanted to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Watching the resource monitor it appears to "****" out when downloading/installing a bunch of updates.&nbsp; If this wasn't win 10, I would manually download 1 update at a time, install, and see which one is causing issues.&nbsp; I can't seem to find a way to do that
 in windows 10 unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will attempt the 5 fixes you mentioned here before I do what Nachappa C K said.&nbsp; If I do that, I would assume I may run into the same brick wall when Win 10 updates bulk updates I have no control over except many more hours of work involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had a chance to do it yet, but I will this week and update accordingly.&nbsp; Thank you for the information and help.</p>

            <p>The Start menu/Cortana issue was no reponse from left-click Start menu/Cortana/Notifications.&nbsp; Appears fixed with the latest updates.&nbsp; So nothing to do with this disk utilisation issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've solved this for one client by doing a Windows10 refresh (keeps data) but you lose program installs with this.&nbsp; This is a highly&nbsp; recommended move for people who have previously upgraded.&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Ensure you have the license details of any important programs
 which you may have to reinstall again**</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore (to an earlier point in time) may also fix this issue but I cannot confirm any success using this function.</p>

            <p>Ok, sorry for the delay, didn't have much time with work this week to work on the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is fixed, but these solutions didn't directly help...but it did give me another thought process to tackle the issue.&nbsp; So thank you for that.&nbsp; To give you a recap of what I did and observed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-Disabled SuperFetch:&nbsp; Locked up doing it outside of safemode.&nbsp; After I did it I saw no change in the system behavior.&nbsp; It may be coincidental, but it may have lasted a minute or two longer but I don't feel it really did much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-&nbsp; Looked at the MSI mode and some of the other errors that were mentioned.&nbsp; Those seemed to be SSD focused so I didn't try doing that since it is not an SSD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3-&nbsp; Watching resource monitor more closely I noticed that it did "fail" on me (disk IO to zero, disk utilization to 100%) while it was doing the automatic updates in the background.&nbsp; But the MsMpEng.exe was often popping up toward the top of total disk IO
 along with various updates.&nbsp; Just before it fails the hardfaults for that process shot up 100+ then it failed.&nbsp; That made me think that perhaps it isn't the update mechanism or any of the other "features" such as superfetch, etc.&nbsp; So I disabled the windows
 defender and after 2 reboots I let all the updates process.&nbsp; They all worked fine except KB3149135 which kept getting an error (don't recall, one that requires you to clear the state).&nbsp; After running the win update troubleshooting tool a few times and still
 having an error.&nbsp; I rebooted to safe mode again, deleted the contents of the \software distribution\downloads directory.&nbsp; After it re-downloaded that update it installed fine.&nbsp; I then reinstalled McAfee and updated everything and it appears to be running stable
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few note worthy comments:&nbsp; Had the issue with McAfee first (thought I didn't get as much data on the processes causing it.&nbsp; I was still mainly focused on the event viewer, etc) and then seemed to transfer to the built in windows defender.&nbsp; Something with
 the update(s) that were pulled down which caused the real time scanner to kill the system.&nbsp; Also Microsoft, if you are reading this...for the love of &lt;fill in the blank&gt; please give power users the ability to selectively download and install updates in windows
 10!&nbsp; I understand the main user base of "stupid" users whom didn't ever update and were part of malware spreading should have that "Forced" upon them.&nbsp; But give power users the option to "opt out" of this.&nbsp; I would have loved to grabbed 1 at a time, downloaded
 it, installed and identified which one was the problem.&nbsp; The logic of, "I have 5 updates to install, let me download them all, try to install.&nbsp; Lock up system, reboot, then repeat the same thing again." is painful...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thank you all in the community for the ideas, it really helped change the way I was troubleshooting the problem.&nbsp; I kept looking in logs, drivers, previous updates.</p>

<p>Blame McAfee and/or Defender then for not ensuring that only 1 AV is running at a time?</p>

            <p>Definitely didn't have 2 going at 1x.&nbsp; After you uninstall your own and reboot, windows automatically re-enables win defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I removed McAfee I was focused on trying to get into event viewer and monitoring processes and having to constantly hard-restart.&nbsp; Then thinking the HD was damaged b/c of it so trying to do disk diag.&nbsp; So I didn't have enough data to see if the McAfee
 real time scanner process was to blame there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to point out, ran for months without issues.&nbsp; It was something with this group of updates that I pulled down.&nbsp; Without fine grain control of selecting 1 update at a time to DL and then install I can't go further.&nbsp; Again, logs told me nothing
 :\</p>

    <title>KMS activation error 0xC004E003 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iofhua1  say:</h3>
<h2>            KMS activation error 0xC004E003</h2>
                    I am trying to activate a PC with a KMS key, and I have run into a strange error. It is giving me "Code: 0xC004E003, Description: The software licensing service reported that license evaluation failed."<br />
<br />
The key I am using is for Windows 7 Pro, and it has worked fine on over 200 Win7 PC's in my building. The particular PC I am trying to activate used to run Windows XP Pro, but I had to upgrade it for something that the user wants to do on it. I have done some
 searches on this error, and several articles I have found suggest that I should rename a file called "tokens.dat" on the KMS Server, and then run "slmgr /rilc" via command line to generate a new tokens.dat file on the server. However before I go and do this,
 I want to know if there are any possible consequences? Is this safe to do? I didn't create this server - I am a new hire, and I don't want to risk breaking something I can't fix. What is tokens.dat, why does the server need it, and what happened to it that
 now I need to replace it? Do I need to replace it at all? Can I fix this without mucking around on my KMS server?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />

            I wonder if it's because the workstation previously activated with a Windows XP install? Would the KMS server keep a record of it's MAC address or something, and now when I go to activate Win7 on this workstation, the KMS server is getting confused, because
 it's a different install with a different key?<br />
<br />
Just grasping at straws...<br />

<br />If your tablet or laptop has more than one camera (like a front-facing and a rear-facing camera), you can switch cameras before taking a photo or video. Open the Camera app, and then: 
<br />
<br />•In Windows 10, select the Change camera button at the top of the screen. 
<br />•In Windows Phone 8.1, select More (the three dots), and then select front-facing or main camera.
<br />•In Windows 8.1, swipe in from the bottom edge to see the app commands. (If you're using a mouse, right-click within the app), and then select the Change camera button. 
<br />
<br />If you are using a different app, unless the app supports a similar means of switching cameras, you may not be able to switch unless you disable the camera you don't want to use.

    <title>Failure to Activate Windows&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amitg43  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure to Activate Windows&#33;</h2>
                    <div>I upgraded from Windows 7x64 to Windows Pro 8x64 accepting the initial promotional offer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Product Key for Windows 8: xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-J8CKV</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I successfully installed Windows 8 (after some initial glitches and a fresh download using the product key and upgradation of BIOS).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Subsequently, I installed Windows Media Center pack which was offered free.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows Media Center Product Key: xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-HQTB3&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My screen now shows at bottom right corner "Windows 8 Pro with Media Center build 9200".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On the task bar, the flag on solving PC issues shows pending messages. When clicked, the message shows "Activate Windows now (Important)".&nbsp;</div>
<div>A click on it took me to to Windows Activation window (Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Action Center &gt; Windows Activation) that displayed following messages:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows isn't activated</div>
<div>The product key didn't work. Try a different key or buy a new one.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Current edition</div>
<div>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Current product key</div>
<div>*****-HQTB3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I clicked on "Activate with a new key" to insert the key ending in -HQTB3,</div>
<div>a message displayed that the key works!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But after going through the process, it threw up the following message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Error Code: 0xC004C003</div>
<div>Error description:<span> </span>
The activation server determined that the specified product key has been blocked</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I tried with the original key ending in -J8CKV, an "Invalid Product key" message box appeared with message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The product key you have entered will not work with this edition of Windows 8.</div>
<div>You must either run Windows 8 set up or enter a Windows 8 Pro with Media Center Product Key.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I certainly do not want to go through the set up again. But as explained above, the attempt with Windows 8 Pro with Media Center Product Key was also unsuccessful.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My laptop (Dell Inspiron N5110) is otherwise apparently working OK. Does it mean that I don't need any further activation and the message is a false one?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do I disregard the message or do I still need to do something?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            Sorry for this late reply but this was due to my persistent effort during these days to make your suggestions work!
<div><br />
<div>Being in India, I called up the number 80 40103000 through my mobile and did not press any option even when the IVRS repeated the message 3 times. It then transferred the call to customer support, but that was the end of it - I continued to wait for response
 and after some time the line got disconnected. I tried during different periods on successive days but the result was same!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Today I decided to choose options - 1 for home user, then 1 for windows and activation and 1 again for customer &nbsp;support - and got someone on line!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I followed all that he suggested, giving him the product keys for Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8 Pro with Media Center, the set of nine 7-digit numbers obtained by running slui 4, and the product ID after he told me how to get it. I tried the Activation procedure
 as suggested by him but though my Media Center key was reported to be working, there was an error message that the particular key had been blocked! The customer support guy also confirmed the same and asked me to get in touch with 1-800-102-1100 number.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have an independent broadband connection but my landline is very noisy (all the rain may have affected something!) which the line people are trying to rectify. As it stands&nbsp;now, it will be difficult for a hearing-impaired seventy-year old to follow instructions
 on phone. Couldn't I get instructions on my email? In fact, I got my installation software on line and the product keys through email (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please suggest what to do next. I can provide all the above information mentioned in the 4th paragraph if the information remains secure.</div>
<div><br />

            <div>I've now found the source of the problem by going through the small prints at the bottom of the message from Microsoft when delivering Media Center Pack, particularly where it says that the '<b>product key must be activated no later than February 1, 2013</b>'.
 The full text of the message is quoted at the end. My problem arose as Media Center Pack could only be installed after installing Windows 8 Pro and I could install Windows 8 Pro only on August 10 this year as explained below! If the Media Center stops working
 without activation, I'll accept that, provided my Windows 8 Pro continues to function. If it is possible to uninstall Media Center, thereby restoring my original Product Key, I can do that also. Please suggest how I should proceed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>
<div>The Windows 8 Pro obtained from Microsoft India initially failed to install even after 2 attempts without giving any reason for such failure, reverting to my Windows 7 Home Premium. During a subsequent visit to USA this year, I used the Product Key to
 download a fresh version on August 10, 2013 on the same laptop. This also failed initially, but this time it suggested upgrading my BIOS as it was incompatible. I contacted Dell to upgrade my BIOS from A10 to A11 and thereafter the installation of Windows
 8 Pro went smoothly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After installing Windows 8, there was no problem in its activation. But I was waiting with my Media Center pack as I wanted to see if any issues developed with the new OS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>About a fortnight back, I installed this Media Center pack on the one and only laptop where Windows 8 Pro was installed. The installation proceeded without hitch and my desktop screen at bottom right corner displays
<b>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center build 9200</b>. But a few days later, I noticed a flag asking me to activate windows.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I inserted the original Product Key (as indicated in my initial post), I got a message that 'the key works' but after a delay, I was told that the Product Key does not work with the existing version of Windows. So I repeated the process with the Media
 Center Pack key (given in the message below). It was first reported that 'the key works' but a later message informed that the Product Key has been blocked!</div>
<div><br />

            was there a solution to this problem.<br />
<br />
I've tried phoning the activation number from slui.exe 4 but not pressing anything eventually causes the call to end and not to go to a customer services representative.<br />

Help, really dont want to re-install windows 8 pro.<br />

            It is some consolation to know that there are fellow sufferers!
<div><br />
<div>Mr. Andre Da Costa, in a separate mail, suggested the procedure by which Media Center could be uninstalled without a need to set up Windows 8 Pro from scratch. But the process is long including some tinkering with the registry and finally to follow some
 additional steps through a link to another web page. I was apprehensive that I might mess up further in doing all these. So, I decided to go for buying a new Product Key.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I could get customer support person on 1-800-102-1100 and we had a talk for nearly 25 minutes. But he finally admitted that my best option would be to go for a new key which would cost around USD 10. I was asked to go through the Activation process till
 I got the screen where "buy a new key" option appears and follow that link. I tried at least 5-6 times on different days and at different periods, but I always ended up with a message: "<b>Sorry you can't buy a key online at the moment. Please try again later
 or buy Windows from retailer near you</b>"! Very helpful indeed!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I sent an email to Customer Support in India and he suggested that I could buy the Key through the Activation settings (which I had already tried) or go to&nbsp;<font><font><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/feature-packs</span></font>&nbsp;</font>(it
 was a dead end) or to contact&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;</span>(my mail was returned undelivered)! What a support! It is no wonder that today I read
 an article in ZDnet newsletter that Windows 7 was outpacing Windows 8! I now feel like an idiot to go from Windows 7 to Windows 8.</div>

            I ended up following a tutorial on how to revert back, used my original pro key and back up and running and activated without media center.
<br />
<br />
If only i'd seen the warning <b>product key must be activated no later than February 1, 2013</b> before i had set about using the MC key in the first place.<br />

            Hi,<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.<br />More improvements are coming to Windows update soon. <br /><br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: <br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a><br /><br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.<br /><br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-windows-10-stopupdates10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-win...</a><br />Please let us know if

            Hi  Sulaimon
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Please note, Microsoft's approach to updates is very different that earlier releases. They are basically mandatory because of Microsoft's past history with customers sometimes failing to install important updates.
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.
<br />
<br />stop-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= disabled
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= disabled
<br />net stop dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />start-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= auto
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= auto
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= auto
<br />net start dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />Now you can simply right click on stop-updates.bat and select ‚Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Source: <a href="http://sdbr.net/windows-10-update-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdbr.net/windows-10-update-failure/</a>
<br />
<br />Option 5.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 6:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 7:
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won't get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase. 
<br />
<br />Option 8:
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 1903 when it becomes available over the coming weeks, this will let you pause updates for up to 7 days or more.
<br />

<p>Hi Sula, I am an IT Professional&nbsp; and previously employed as a Developer of Assembler C++ , C and Cobol to name a few.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can inform you from my own findings the only way to stop these updates that I currently know of&nbsp; is to install NTLite and pay $300 a year support for the privilge. There is a thread about NTLite but there is some discusion of it not working after 1809
 update . Currently I am 1803. I telephoned Microsoft today in regard to my query which covers your too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a serious error with no current remedy in Windows Professional 10 If you have Intel x64 Based PC CPU . As Microsoft updates are providing only AMD64 updates only&nbsp; in 57,000 files dumped to my software distribution folders.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this helps</p>

</p><p>If you follow this procedure and have Microft Office Installed then you will be wasting your time as It produces an error in the Office Install which it then repairs reinstating all changes that you have done. This did not halt the updates in my case at
 all. </p>

<h3> peterturnbull1  say:</h3>
<h2>            No internet access after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I let Windows 10 update assistant carry out a 5GB update on my PC and now I cannot access the internet on the PC. The Network status says "Your device is connected, but you might not be able to access anything on the network."</p>
<p>I have tried the Windows troubleshooter but this just says "Local Area Connection doesn't have a valid IP configuration." and follows this with "Not fixed"</p>
<p>I have checked for a fix online using another (non-Windows) machine but none of the suggestions work. How do I reinstate my internet access?</p>

<p>Hi Peter, </p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why this issue occurs is when your network driver is corrupted or incompatible. This can also be caused when your DNS settings has been reset after the update. We'd like to know if you've already reset your router. Also, have
 you tried resetting the <strong>Winsock</strong> <strong>catalog</strong> and <strong>
TCP/IP</strong> stack? If not, we recommend that you follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>PowerShell</strong>, right-click it, then select
<strong>Run </strong><strong>as</strong><strong> administrator</strong>.</li><li>Type the following commands, one after another:<br />
<br />
<strong>netsh winsock reset</strong><span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong><span>.</span><br />
<strong>netsh int ip reset</strong><span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong><span>.<br />
</span><strong>ipconfig /release</strong><span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong><span>.</span><span><br />
</span><strong>ipconfig /renew</strong><span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong><span>.</span><span><br />
</span><strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong><span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong><span>.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Once done, close the <strong>PowerShell</strong>, then check if the issue is the same.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><br />
Please post back with the result.</span><br />
</p>

    <title>Windows 10 complete backup procedure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 complete backup procedure</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just looking for some direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to backup my Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the following, what I've done, correct to enable me to recover Windows 10? And is there any improvements that I can make to my system?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Created system image to 128gb 3.0 USB flash/pen drive using network location method.</p>
<p>2. Created repair disc for Windows 10 64bit using DVD.</p>
<p>3. Copied all personal files to 16gb 2.0 USB flash/pen drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I require a product key for the repair disc?</p>
<p>Can I prepare the 3.0 USB flash drive to be bootable or does that not make sense since I have made a repair disc?</p>
<p>And is one repair disc all I need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

<p>Then Backup all data/information/user folders&nbsp;files to one partition?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, or use two physical drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An image of a system partition is bootable because it includes the disk metadata; you would store the image on an external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, and store it on an external drive. You can store the backups on the same external drive that you use for the system image backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic idea is to store your backups somewhere that isn't in your computer, so you're covered if your computer is lost, destroyed, or if you spill orange juice on your laptop. (Who would do such a dumb thing? Don't ask.)</p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Windows 7 Home Premium Version cannot be used to connect to other computers and can only be used to connect and be controlled as it does not have the Server/Client features of the Remote Desktop Protocol.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please find the details on how to use and Configure Remote Desktop on a Windows Computer and Supported Versions in the Links Mentioned Below.<br />

<h2>            Access 2000 database in Windows 7</h2>
                    I just upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; I use an 2000 Access Database which works excellent in Windows XP.&nbsp; After I upgraded to Windows 7 Pro and tried to access the database I started getting this error<br />
"your database or project contains a missing or broken reference to the file "comctl32.ocx" version1.3".<br />
I can still use this database in XP, what do i need to do for this database to work correctly in Windows 7 Pro.

<p>Hello Linn County,<br />
<br />
Access 2000 is not compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp;Since you have Windows 7 Professional you can take advantage of using Windows XP mode.<br />
<br />
Running Windows XP Mode requires:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate editions.<br />
2. A computer capable of hardware virtualization. This means your computer has a central processing unit (CPU) with either Intel-VT or AMD-V virtualization features.<br />
3. Virtualization features turned on in your computer’s basic input/output system (BIOS).</p>
<p>Please look at the following website for information:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7#section_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7#section_1</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To determine whether your computer’s CPU is capable of hardware virtualization, go to the Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC support website and download a utility that can check whether your Intel or AMD CPU is compatible.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To find your brand of processor so you can download the appropriate utility, click the Start button , right-click Computer, and then click Properties. Under System, next to Processor, you can see what type of CPU you have.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Even if your CPU can run Windows XP Mode, you might also need to turn on virtualization settings in your computer’s BIOS. Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions</a><br />
<br />
This should help you to get it working within Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>
