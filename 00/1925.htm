<h2>            Issue with missing information on Outlook calendar meeting</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>We have a user who has&nbsp;notiticed a problem when trying to make a meeting room reservation in Outlook calendar. The puplic calendar shows the "detailed" subject for all the users instead of just the name of the organizer. Most of the times the problem exists
 for a while after the reservastion is created, eventually the view will normalize.<br />
I have tried to check all the calendar options but I cannot figure out the reason. And I have heard that some others have experienced the same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the picture below you can see the correct format Name (Mari) and then the name of the meeting room. On the right side is the issue. It shows the subject not the person who created the meeting.</p>
<p>This does not occur on my computer, the correct format shows, Name and Meeting room. User has latest Office 2016 May build (broad)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help.</p>
<p>Br</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just tested it in my lab. All the subject and name shows correctly on the new item I created. No matter on the sender's or the recipient's side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be an expected behavior. In recipients' view, the new item will only show the subject and not the person immediately when you create it. However, all the previous items show correctly. And this only exists on new meetings or if you update an existing
 meeting in the calendar. Generally, it won't take too long to normalize the view. How long it takes depends on many factors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>HHmmmmm. So maybe this is a bug because it always used to show the correct meeting information straight away (the name of the organiser and the meeting room name).&nbsp;When I arrange the meeting the correct details are seen straight away&nbsp;Can you tell me some
 of the "many factors" on why&nbsp;there is a gap between creating the meeting and showing the correct details so I can pass this on to the user?</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this situation, I suggest you check whether the issue occur in Outlook Web App as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you can also hover over the calendar event or open the event and switch to Scheduling Assistant view and check if the organizer is the correct person.</p>

<p>HI</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply but again this is not how its supposed to work as it was working fine before. Even if I hover over the calendar of the meeting room that has been added it doesn't show that I organised it.
</p>
<p>The schedule assistant works but this is not user friendly as you have to open the meeting and then then the schedule assistant rather than just seeing all the details on the calendar like it should be.</p>
<p>I have yet to run the tool but I will try to contact the user today and do so</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>The future of Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cvpsmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            The future of Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>I'm reading a lot about today's announcements regarding the refocusing of the mobile strategy, and I have to say that it's getting a bit ridiculous (I'm looking at you, Wired!). &nbsp;I think the "mobile wars" are far from over and, in fact, I think that Microsoft
 is currently working on the very technologies that will position it to make gains in this war. &nbsp;Those that have been paying attention will agree that Continuum for Phones is potentially a game-changer. &nbsp;This is the feature that everyone really wants (even
 if they don't know it yet!). &nbsp;It is the truly portable computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current choice of phone is the LG G3 (Android). &nbsp;It has a very nice display. &nbsp;It has a good camera, although I'm not much of a picture-taker. &nbsp;I have a 128GB micro-SD card in it which means that I can take most of my files with me, wherever I go (it's
 also the reason I dumped iOS a long time ago). &nbsp;It is a very nice phone. &nbsp;What it isn't is a good desktop replacement, though there is very little reason for this. &nbsp;Give me a phone that I can use as a desktop, in conjunction with an HDMI monitor and BT peripherals
 (and hey, how about a simple [and profitable] docking station?) , and I'll drop this phone tomorrow. &nbsp;With a portable desktop computer like that, I could even smirk at the Macbook Air owners around the office! &nbsp;<strong>This</strong> is how you win the smartphone
 wars, and you don't need a huge hardware division to do it. &nbsp;It requires a paradigm shift to the platform, which is exactly what Microsoft is working on. &nbsp;I just hope it gets to market soon enough...</p>

            <p>That may be so, but the timing for this couldn't be worse, in my opinion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This should have been done at least&nbsp;6 months after Windows 10 for phones was finalized, if the phone sales were still not satisfactory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure the other manufacturers will be able to fill the gap left by Microsoft by reducing the number of models.&nbsp;In the value&nbsp;market especially, having a variety&nbsp;of models at various price points is a must.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the other manufacturers don't release a variety of cheap&nbsp;and mid-range models this will&nbsp;result in an even lower market share. And that may mean the end of Windows on phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I'm only interested in flagships, so short term&nbsp;this doesn't directly affect me. However, after the latest news, I fear for the future of the platform.</p>

            <p>I don't know why Microsoft is doing this so fast. Build the brand. Maybe, maybe advertise the phones (I realize this is a lot to ask from Microsoft as their marketing is simply awful). I have the Lumia 635, which is good (note: I really wanted the 1320 or
 1520, but I just can't work with AT&amp;T without laughing), through T-Mobile. My previous phone was an Apple 4s, and I hated the IOS. I guess if I was an 15 year old girl, it may be ok, but not for business. I looked at Android phones, and, sorry, but the OS
 looks like a 5 year old developed it. Its a mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an old Windows 6.5 phone which I loved, so I was happy to get the 635 (8.1). I'm sure I'm alone in absolutely loving the 8.1 OS. On my phone, my apps work perfectly and they correspond with those on my Surface rt, laptop, and desktop, all running 8.1.
 I love the Metro startup. Everything is right there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10- I like it, not as much as I do 8/8.1 (I actually like 8 better than 8.1, but I had to upgrade, so...). In reading through some of the comments for the preview, I chuckle when people want things on 10&nbsp;that 8/8.1 already has.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what the top brass at Microsoft wants. Do they want a phone line or not? If so, why are we not hearing about the Windows 10 phones now? They could have 5 or 6 models, perfect them, promote the heck out of them, and change them out every 12-18
 months. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft dropped the ball on not&nbsp;sticking with the Windows 8 OS line. I know some wanted the W7 start menu. Fine, give it as an optional update. But 8/8.1 is a great system for the mobile market. It works, its easy, has good core apps, and it is
 fantastic to sync between hardware. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I am rambling, but I am actually a bit worried in Microsoft's overall direction. I've stuck with them since Windows 3.11, and I'd like to see them regain their former glory. Don't know if they will under the current management.

            Interesting perspective. &nbsp; So as a power (business) user like myself, what do you think of the "desktop in your pocket" approach with Continuum? &nbsp;Would you be interested in a phone like that?

<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 for desktops will launch July 29th, the Mobile will then get more development focus and launch at a later date. I'm guessing end of the 3rd quarter/early 4th quarter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No OS will every be the wonderful, perfect thing people expect. It's strange to me people come into the Insider forum just to ramble on about how bad Microsoft is and how much 10 sucks. That's cool dudes, but if you feel that way, perhaps you should just
 stick with Windows 7 and your other devices and be happy. Constructive complaints &gt; Constant whining.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if its needed. In my head, I'm thinking no, because should a phone be that "busy"? Doesn't it make more sense to sync data between phone apps and desktop apps and/or programs? The reason I love 8/8.1 on my phone is that it does a&nbsp;great job of
 this. Yes, the apps don't have all of the options as a desktop might, e.g., the mail app versus Outlook 2016. (On a side note, Outlook is becoming much too option heavy again.) This works both ways. If I can IM on my phone, allow me to IM off my desktop or
 laptop. If I can print off my desktop natively, why not allow my phone to print through my desktop via Onedrive (for example).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO, a mobile phone needs to be a phone first and foremost. My phone does this great (except for Wi-Fi calling. If you lose Wi-Fi in the middle of a call, it may drop the call. Fix this, MS!!) Stop re-inventing the wheel every 2 or 3 years. Best as I can
 tell, Windows 10 is being released because its not 8/8.1, not for some great leap forward</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, I do like 10, as it does have some nice new features, such as Edge. I do like Cortana for small tasks, but I haven't yet used it fully like I should. That's on me. It is really ideal for phones. It does look to be fairly stable, at least
 on my stuff. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy to see 10 released at some point this year. I don't know if it is the end all of OS&nbsp;phones, but I do hope it does well.
</p>
<p>

<p>I don't know why Microsoft is doing this so fast. Build the brand. Maybe, maybe advertise the phones (I realize this is a lot to ask from Microsoft as their marketing is simply awful). I have the Lumia 635, which is good (note: I really wanted the 1320 or
 1520, but I just can't work with AT&amp;T without laughing), through T-Mobile. My previous phone was an Apple 4s, and I hated the IOS. I guess if I was an 15 year old girl, it may be ok, but not for business. I looked at Android phones, and, sorry, but the OS
 looks like a 5 year old developed it. Its a mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an old Windows 6.5 phone which I loved, so I was happy to get the 635 (8.1). I'm sure I'm alone in absolutely loving the 8.1 OS. On my phone, my apps work perfectly and they correspond with those on my Surface rt, laptop, and desktop, all running 8.1.
 I love the Metro startup. Everything is right there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10- I like it, not as much as I do 8/8.1 (I actually like 8 better than 8.1, but I had to upgrade, so...). In reading through some of the comments for the preview, I chuckle when people want things on 10&nbsp;that 8/8.1 already has.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what the top brass at Microsoft wants. Do they want a phone line or not? If so, why are we not hearing about the Windows 10 phones now? They could have 5 or 6 models, perfect them, promote the heck out of them, and change them out every 12-18
 months. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft dropped the ball on not&nbsp;sticking with the Windows 8 OS line. I know some wanted the W7 start menu. Fine, give it as an optional update. But 8/8.1 is a great system for the mobile market. It works, its easy, has good core apps, and it is
 fantastic to sync between hardware. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I am rambling, but I am actually a bit worried in Microsoft's overall direction. I've stuck with them since Windows 3.11, and I'd like to see them regain their former glory. Don't know if they will under the current management.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>I'd used Windows Mobile 6.1 for a while. It's a good system, not very stable but I liked it.</p>
<p>I like Windows 8 for its brand new features and Flat Design.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;8.1 added the Start Button, still acceptable.</p>
<p>But KB2919355(quite impressive number) added something I really hated. So I didn't install KB2919355 until last October.(So stubborn I am!)</p>
<p>Then this summer I was curious about the current status of Windows 10 so I updated my Windows 8.1 Pro to 10130 via Windows Update. There are pros and cons.&nbsp;Windows 10 is&nbsp;a good OS overall. But I don't think Microsoft made a right decision to give up all
 these design ideas of Windows 8. Look at the Start Menu on Windows 10 now. What a weird UI design! If I wanna know what exact apps I've installed on Windows 10, it'll be an uncomfortable experience even if I enable the Start Screen on Windows 10. Back to the
 Windows 8.1, a&nbsp;clear full-screen app list is MUCH BETTER than this Start Menu ****!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your English is wonderful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I like 10, and when I buy new stuff, I will have no problem using 10 on everything but my phone. To be very fair, I know what I looking at right now will be very different with the final release. There are some issues that I have sent to Microsoft
 that I feel will make it a better OS. I just don't see a reason to upgrade on my phone to make it less useable. But, if Microsoft takes the time to make sure its good, then I will no problems upgrading.

            <p>Agree. I don't think that any phone is going to replace a PC for everyday use. But, If I'm in a meeting or at lunch, its nice to have the ability to conduct business. I use One Drive all day on my phone and PCs. I like the mobile office programs well enough,
 although I wish PDF files could be opened in them, as opposed to opening another app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be right that a phone could replace a laptop for mobility. But I still love a desktop! I'm thinking that I'll replace my laptop with the next Surface line. My only apprehension is that my eyesight is not as good as it used to be.

<p>I am not able to delete emails left behind by Gmail after I disconnected my Gmail account from my personal Outlook OWA account as Gmail overflowed my mailbox. All items and folders are stuck in Deleted Items no matter how times I delete, it comes back in

            <p>Hi Irfan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Let us&nbsp; run the system file checker scan and check if it helps..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>SFC (<strong>System File Checker) </strong>is a tool which scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Tushar.</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p><strong>sfc /scannow</strong> as admin gives the error <strong>Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation</strong>. Incidentally, I couldn't complete SFC in Build 10041 or in the earlier Build either&nbsp;both of which were in place
 upgrades, while a <strong>chkdsk</strong> scan shows no errors. My system is pretty advanced &amp; new, so new in fact that&nbsp;it's first OS was the first build of Windows Technical Preview.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Fax &amp; Scan </strong>App works perfectly. I directed the output folder of<strong> Scan
</strong>app to Scanned Documents in <strong>Documents</strong> folder, I continue to get the error "<strong>You don't have permission to save to your current destination folder. Please change the destination folder and try again.</strong>"</p>
<p>Yesterday, I did a system Reset to see if things change for better, nothing happened except that my C drive was lighter but I had to re-debug&nbsp;the Mail, Calendar &amp; People apps as well as Words, Excel &amp; PowerPoint Previews.</p>
<p><strong>SFC</strong> in<strong> Safe Mode </strong>gives the error 'Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation' after verification was 18% complete. Can someone please suggest something other than SFC?
</p>
<p>I wish MSFT would give out ISOs while leaving the option open for upgrades while releasing a new build. A clean install is so much less of a pain.&nbsp;In upgrades you inherit some of the parent's flaws, it seems.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Word Duplicate TOC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc-may  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Word Duplicate TOC</h2>
                    Hopefully this post finds its way to those who need it. I have had issues with the Active TOC duplicating itself. It's not the TOC that is the issue, it is the Heading 1 format. I changed all of my chapter titles in my novel to the "Title" identification
 in the "styles" format bar. Once completed, right click on the Heading 1 style and you will see how many hidden instances of the style is present. I had 2832 instances. Once I selected all and deleted they went back to the original. Side note: I also had all
 of mine in text boxes for use with a custom picture for effect. I think part of the issue was copying and pasting the text box and picture. While trying to rid myself of the obscene amount of "Heading 1" instances, anytime I would delete them and then undo
 they would duplicate. Basically changing them to another style, then removing all the duplicates works to get the TOC back to where it needs to be. Hope this helps.

<p>Since a table of contents, by default, is created based on heading styles, you will have to re-format a paragraph which should not be in the TOC by applying a different style. Just modifying the direct formatting (such as font and size) won't suffice, as
 you may have noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, note that if you are depending a lot on text boxes in your documents, I recommend that you reconsider that design. Any document which contains a large number of objects in the drawing layer is more likely to become corrupt.</p>

<p>I did try to re-format and no, it didn't work.&nbsp; I misspoke when i iterated "format" I was referring to the style itself. While I didn't have to chose the "title" style, it made the most sense, as that is essentially what it is, and left them that way. I
 didn't have any paragraph included with the "heading 1" style, so that was not a contributing factor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the heads up on the text boxes. I currently have one novel written and used 28 pictures with embedded text boxes and no issues, but then again, I didn't put the TOC in until i was done. In this second book, I currently only have 20 instances,
 but i started the TOC from the get go. The page placement wasn't quite right so I used "undo" instead of "remove table" and that's where the issue started. I'm not sure when overuse would come into play, but I'm more inclined to think that with this number
 the issue lies more with using "undo" when initiating a TOC. Maybe a combination of text boxes, styles, and manipulating them using the standard cut/paste/undo commands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, I appreciate the response...and yes, I like "quotes". :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Title style has an "Outline level" of 1, by default, which means that it will be included in the table of contents. You can modify the style and change the "Outline level" to "Body Text" (Modify Style dialog box &gt; Format &gt; Paragraph).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can quickly (re-)apply the Normal style to selected text paragraphs by using the built-in shortcut Ctrl+Shift+N. Doing so ensures that the paragraphs are excluded from the TOC.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Text boxes, like other objects in the drawing layer (such as images, shapes, charts, etc.), contribute to document complexity. That is probably why they increase the risk for corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, part of my point was that you shouldn't need a lot of text boxes in Word. Pictures can be positioned "In line with text" which is safer (less complex).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if/why Undo would cause trouble. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To work around (suspected) corruption, you can always copy document content, minus the final paragraph mark of the document, into a new, blank document and see if that improves the situation. (To see paragraph marks, ¶, as well as other nonprinting marks,
 click the ¶ icon on the Home tab.)</p>

    <title>Can Presenter View be configured in any version of Powerpoint&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasperdog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Presenter View be configured in any version of Powerpoint&#63;</h2>
                    I read an MVP blog touting the improvements in Powerpoint 2013's "Presenter View" aka Presenter Mode. But apparently, it is still not possible to actually configure the visual elements on the Presenter's monitor. Even PPT 2007 allows you to configure the
<em>printed</em> speaker's notes, i.e., you can adjust the size of the slide image, notes area, and even include graphics elements&nbsp;unrelated to the audience content of&nbsp;each slide. But no such capability exists for the Presenter's View itself, at least AFAIK.
 Please, tell me I'm wrong and it IS actually possible to do this!

<h2>            2330-c2 Sound problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I own a Nokia 2330 c-2 .I am not being able to hear anything when I make/receive a call in the normal mode whereas it's perfectly audible in the loudspeaker mode.In the normal mode, when i'm trying to increase/decrease the volume by scrolling up/down, beside
 the Volume bar a 'star' symbol is showing whereas there's no such symbol while adjusting the volume in the loudspeaker mode.</p>
<p>Could anyone plz suggest what can be done.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi tumba,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scroll up to increase or down to decrease the volume of the earpiece or headset during the phone call. If the problem still persist, I suggest sending the phone to the Nokia Service Center for a check-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck :)</p>

    <title>Object Linked to GIF, JPG or PNG file does not show image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> svend-excelan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Object Linked to GIF, JPG or PNG file does not show image</h2>
                    <p>When I try<em><strong>&nbsp;Insert</strong></em>,&nbsp;<strong><em>Object</em></strong>,
<em><strong>Create from File</strong></em>... browse to the file location and pic an image file&nbsp;, then check the
<strong><em>Link&nbsp;</em></strong>box; I just end up with a tiny square set of borders with no image displayed. This only occurs if the&nbsp;image file is GIF, JPG or PNG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works fine for BMP files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a brand new test installation. The only thing on the workstation so far is Windows 7 and Office Pro 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that for earlier office versions we needed Microsoft Photo Editor installed from an older Office&nbsp;CD to get this to work. I don't wish to deploy new workstations with a 10 year old, un-supported application so I want a proper fix for this. Does anyone
 know the answer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer has Paint, IE&nbsp;and Office Picture Manager installed and all of these are perfectly capable of rendering GIF, JPG and PNG files if that is the problem so&nbsp;I can't understand why I cannot insert the links and have them display in PowerPoint?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Svend.</p>

            <p>If you have the budget for a bit of custom programming (or the ability to do it in-house), you might be better off with an add-in to help with this.</p>
<p>It could allow the users to choose a GIF file, insert it and automatically size/position the GIF as required.</p>
<p>In the process, it could record the location/filename of the original source file of the image and when the user requests it, go out and update the images (either wholesale or by checking to see if their dates have changed since originally inserted).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Or you could insert the images as linked or linked/embedded and then use an add-in to unlink them when you don't want them to update any further.&nbsp; The free demo of my FixLinks add-in does this, in fact.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.pptools.com/fixlinks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptools.com/fixlinks/</a></p>
<p>Or if the images are linked/embedded, you could move the original source images to another folder.&nbsp; PPT would then be unable to find them, so wouldn't try to update the links and would simply display the embedded copy.</p>

<p><span>Hi Angela,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can’t reproduce the issue by my side. My OS version is 10.12.6 and Chrome version is 68.0.3440.106. I test with both a work or school account and a Microsoft account.
</span></p>
<p><span>We would first suggest you update your OS system to the latest version 10.12.6. Update your Chrome browser, sign out the OneNote Web Clipper add-in, clear the browser cache (resetting the browser will be better
 if it is convenient for you), then sign in again to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please provide us the information below for more investigation:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Your Chrome version.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The screenshot about the “Default location” list.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To check whether the issue is related to the account, change another account to see the result.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Rena</span></p>

<p>Hi:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have about 5 months with my htc s621, and even that&nbsp;I found it great, I also got a big disapointment from it. I had an Ipaq H1910 before, and it was great to read ebooks. When I got the S621, the first
 thing I did when I conected it to the computer, was try to Install the microsoft reader (wich was impossible, because the version doesn't support smartphones). On the other hand I loaded a .pdf book, and when I tried to read it, The clearview pdf reader sucked.
 It&nbsp;is a lousy pdf reader, at least for&nbsp;ebooks. I tried to uninstall it and install the adobe reader, unsuccesfully. What can I do?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a Skype Number subscription expires, it is reserved to the same user for the next 90 days then goes back to the pool if not renewed.</p>

            Nothing here worked, and one link took me to a toxic program called reimage repair that took me all night to uninstall, it was horrible. I feel like I'm worse off now, sorry, I think installing that program slowed down my computer. I checked and my Word
 program has no add-ins. And it still crashes if I run spell check. How do I fix this problem?

            Well, thanks Doug. I checked out your link but nothing there fixed the "Word has stopped working" problem either. I uninstalled and reinstalled Office 365, activated it, and the problem was still there. But I kept trying stuff and did fix it. I opened
 my Quick Access Toolbar and removed "Spelling and Grammar" then added it back from the list. And then it worked. Now it's fine. So, apparently there's more than one solution to this, different causes, different solutions. So if anyone else is reading this,
 try that fix as well before you give up and take it to a pro.

<h2>            How can I restore the win10 installation when &#34;PC setting&#34; is unavailable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>my win 10 installation (build 9879) is not working properly. I guess it was the update that introduced the insider hub that failed, because since then I cannot start the modern apps for mail, store, PC settings and some more. Some modern apps are still working
 as well as the traditional control panel.</p>
<p>I would like to restore the installation, but I cant start PC settings. Is there any other way to trigger the win 10 restore function?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have not made any restore point so I cannot use the old system restore in the control panel)</p>

            PC Settings is now called just <strong>Settings</strong>. Click on the Start Button to find it at the top of the list. Or just Search for Settings in the Search box. Be aware that Return to previous OS on the sign in page doesn't work right yet and might
 not work at all for you. You also might need your Recovery media.&nbsp;

<h2>            Recover a OneNote notebook from cache files on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I executed an upgrade of my office suite from office 2013 to Office 365. In the process my onenote notebook has been lost. I can find the cache files that were created on the local "C" drive but that is all. It is a series of ".onebin" files with GUID numbers
 for the front part of the file name. I also found a OnenoteofflineCache.onecache file which is much larger and appears to have references in it to all of my pages and sections. I also found the same file with a second extension of ".lnk" .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway to use these files to rebuild my Onenote notebook ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a really bad upgrade. I would advice everyone to do a full hard drive backup before you attempt this upgrade. So many things do not work as you would expect.&nbsp;</p>

 then click File&gt;Open to chose your notebook to open. Please have a try and share with me your result.</p>

<p>**********My original post *************</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I appreciate the suggestions however, if you read my post closely you will see that I DO NOT have a notebook to open with any client. All I have left to work with are the cache and cache bin files. I have tried to rename the main cache file extension to
 just a "one" extension versus the "onecache" extension and then open this file with Onenote for windows 10 which is the only version I can download from O365. It would not open it providing a message that I might find a file converter on Office.com that could
 convert it. I also attempted to open the same file with Onenote for 2016 on another computer but it provided the same message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a post online that indicated someone was able to restore a notebook using cache files on a Mac and some file utility on a Mac. If someone can figure it out for a Mac and I am confused why MS cannot figure out how to rebuild a OneNote notebook from
 cache files on windows 10 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have any way to rebuild this notebook from Cache files. I have all the cachebin files for each section/page and the top level master cache file for this notebook and I can look at each file with a text editor and find some key words
 so I know they are the right files. I just need someone to turn these cache files into a notebook, section, pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great.</p>

<p>Forget your cache files, the cache files of OneNote 2013 are incompatible with the current OneNote 2016 from Office.</p>
<p>You didn't tell us where your notebooks originally had been stored. On OneDrive or locally.</p>

<p>My notebook was stored locally in the normal place on C drive. I thought I had the backups going to my D: drive however, I had NO backups that I could find in the folder where they should have been. Evidently when the Delete office utility was run on my
 machine in preparation for the install of the new O365 Office it wiped out the directory with my notebook. I looked in the directory you mentioned and there is nothing there with the exception of the new notebook I have started in OneNote plus the Quicknote
 default notebook. I cannot find any other files with an extension of .one anywhere on either drive. Since you are saying the cache files are useless and you have no way of recovery my notebook from those files correct ?</p>

<p>Hi Victor,<br />
</p>
<p>Based on my test, OneNote file wouldn't be deleted when I uninstall Office suites. I'd like to suggest you search your notebooks' name on the File Explorer search box to see if you can find them. If you still can't find them, that means they may be deleted
 by other operations. As a workaround, I'd like to suggest you save your notebooks into OneDrive or SharePoint to keep them safe. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Any word from the "Product" team on the ability to rebuild a notebook from onecache and onebin files ?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Victor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstall Office suits 1809(Build 10827.20150):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c285f1b0-c065-4e1e-b4a1-577997082cfd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c285f1b0-c065-4e1e-b4a1-577997082cfd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The local notebook files&nbsp;were on my desktop .onepkg for notebook and .one for OneNote page:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/883f2b48-44cd-49a4-be9a-2403a342aa03?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/883f2b48-44cd-49a4-be9a-2403a342aa03?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling, they are still there and become like that:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43e0ca4d-c16f-4f00-b64b-b084b0cdf396?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43e0ca4d-c16f-4f00-b64b-b084b0cdf396?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I'd like to suggest you follow my suggestions above to search your notebook on your computer. If you can't find it, it is not feasible to recover them via cache files.&nbsp;I appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you use the <strong>Windows Recovery Tool</strong>. Start by downloading and installing&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a> (for Windows 10, 8.x and 7).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the installation has finished, start the application and the main screen will appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a499bdc-01c5-4849-a517-eb1c798aae2e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure to restore your phone using&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect&nbsp;the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).</li><li>After a few seconds the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.</li><li>After a few seconds more the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the '<strong>Install software</strong>'/'<strong>Reinstall software</strong>'&nbsp;button to flash your phone</li></ol>
Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Note!</span> Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

                    <p>When I post an issue on the Issue Tracker app it asks me for a date created. It has become rather tedious to enter the date time and time again. Is there a way to auto populate the date and time field?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Michael,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Issue Tracking app in SharePoint Online is also a list. We can configure its columns in List Settings.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For example, we can let <strong>Due Date</strong> column always display the current date as default value. When we create a new item, the<strong> Due Date</strong> column will use the default value.<br />
1. Click the <strong>LIST </strong>tab&gt;<strong>List Settings</strong>.<br />
2. Find and click the <strong>Due Date</strong> column in the<strong> Column </strong>
section. <br />
3. In <strong>Default value</strong> section, choose <strong>Today’s Date</strong>.<br />
4. Click<strong> OK</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If anything is misunderstood, please share with us more details about “auto populate the date and time filed” (e.g. what date do you want to populate? Which column is it?). We appreciate it if you can capture some screenshots of the Issue Tacking app in your
 tenant. It can help us understand the requirement better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim

            <p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm probably going to catch a lot of heat for saying this...but it looks like you need to contact the person who created this list and ask them to remove the "Date Created" column to create a better end user experience.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I can tell that someone modified this from the default&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>The default issue tracker does NOT have a "Date Created" column</li><li>All lists have a native "Created" column which automatically captures the date the item was created</li></ul>
</li><li>I suggest meeting with your site owner/admin and ask them to remove the "Date Created" column
<ul>
<li>If the site owner/admin needs to see the date the item was created, ask them them to modify the view and select the "Created" column. This will show the automatically captured date</li></ul>
</li></ul>

            <p>Thank you very much for the reply. I had already tested your proposals, but with no succes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find the solution however, as it was as simple as this: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded the Soundmax driver for&nbsp;Win 7 &nbsp;from the HP homepage (32 bit version for one PC and 64 bit for the other). Installed and it all worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is only a little frustrating that I have to reinstall each time I get a new update for WIN 10 (Had to reinstall the latest Win 10&nbsp;update for my ordinary Win 10, as the first&nbsp;update destroied my automatic Google Drive sync together with other apps.)</p>
