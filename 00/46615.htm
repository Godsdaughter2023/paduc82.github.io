<p>The message says - Since windows was first activated on this computer, the hardware on the computer has changed significantly. Due to these changes Windows must be reactivated within 3 days. Do you want to reactivate Windows now?

    <title>Access to System image backup folder blocked when trying to re-image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> puma912  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access to System image backup folder blocked when trying to re-image  my Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>My system hard drive failed a few weeks after upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I had earlier created a Windows System Image so I replaced the faulty drive with a new one, downloaded Windows 10 directly to a USB Flash Drive from microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO
 using a second PC and then moved the flash drive to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Altered boot preference in Bios so this flash drive could be used, followed screen directions until "Repair your computer" was offered and selected it. Progressed through 'Troubleshoot', 'Advanced Options', 'System Image Recovery' and 'OS selection', which
 led to "Re-image your computer". Next requirement was "Select the location of the backup".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my image backup was on my Buffalo LS421DE879 NAS, I clicked on 'Advanced' to add a network location. This leads to "Re-image your computer" where the location of the System Image has to be specified. The network folder in my case was \\LS421DE879\imagebackup
 which I entered. A Windows Security window then asked for my network credentials to connect to the LS421DE879 which I entered as required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a brief "connecting to ........." display window before a new window pops up with the information "A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated (0x80070520).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can find about this error refers to a difference between the credentials used to log on to the PC and the credentials used to access the network device. Workarounds seem to depend on having an up and running system, so I am completely beached. I have
 had two lengthy exchanges this afternoon with Microsoft with the eventual advice that I should consult my PC manufacturer. Can any one out there help with this - would be more than grateful. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi Puma, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and for your interest in Windows 10. &nbsp;<br />
I can understand, how frustrating it can be, when things don’t work as expected. <br />
We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. <br />
I'd be glad to help you.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please answer these queries, mentioned below:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>What is your internet connection type?(wired or wireless)</span></span></li><li><span><span>Is&nbsp;your system connected to any domain?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Have you installed any third party antivirus on your system?</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Please follow these methods, mentioned below to resolve the issue:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Network troubleshooter:</span></strong><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open the Network Adapter troubleshooter by typing &nbsp; troubleshooting in the search box, and then tapping or clicking Troubleshooting. Tap or click Network and Internet, tap or click Network Adapter, and follow the instructions on your screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Disable Antivirus software</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, disable the antivirus software temporarily and check, if it helps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please feel free to contact us, if you face any issues with Windows.<br />

            <p>Thank you for responding to my query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re your questions :-</p>
<p>1) My internet connection is wired.</p>
<p>2) Unsure of what you mean by "is your system connected to any domain". I have a LAN in my home with all computers &amp; NAS on the LAN wired to a gigabit switch which in turn is wired to the modem router.</p>
<p>3) Antivirus on system. As I have replaced the old failed system HDD with a new clean disk there are (until I can get the system image on to it) no OS, programs or apps - anti-virus or otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re your suggestions :-</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1</strong></span>&nbsp;<strong>Network troubleshooter.
</strong>I do not think there is an issue with network connection as such. In the procedure I have been following, when I enter the name of the network folder containing the system image in "Re-image your computer", in the next window (asking for my network
 credentials for accessing the NAS), my user name comes up already entered, leaving just my password to be added. There is little doubt therefore that the NAS is being accessed across the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me the issue is with the Windows security requirement for a 'specified logon session' to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 2</strong></span><strong> Disable Antivirus software.
</strong>As mentioned in reply to your question 3 above, the system HDD is at present empty so there is nothing there to disable. A Panda anti-virus is part of the system image in a folder on the NAS but will not be exerting any influence from that location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further thoughts would be welcomed.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you again for your further attention to my query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder why you are suggesting a Startup Repair when the HDD concerned is new. As I explained in my first submission, I am not trying to revive the original System Disk that failed. I am trying to do a System Image Restore to the new HDD I have fitted in
 its place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, reading your instructions for creating a bootable drive, I wonder if you had taken on board the information I gave clearly stating that I had already created one on a USB Flash Drive and had used it to initiate the process of re-imaging from my Windows
 System Image to the new HDD. Clearly it would not have been possible for me to get as far as I did without being able to boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continue to hope that you will be able to address the problem issue of a "specified logon session".</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm in the exact same place as you and it looks like the Microsoft folks patrolling this forum don't do a very good job at actually reading before posting answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The image restore wizard is tricky in the sense that, even though it has not actually connected to the nas to be prompted for credentials, it is still capturing this information to pass over to the device once it connects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing the driver for my nic (I have &nbsp;a Dell), but it shows me 3 driver options repeated dozens of times. I tried installing several of these but got no love. Even though my nic showed a link and activity light I was not able to find that my
 system got a lease on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I backed out of the image restore wizard, opened command prompt and ran ipconfig/all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the recovery utility was detecting my nic after installing the drivers, but not getting an IP address. Even when manually attempting to assign an IP address I would get a message saying the RPC server is unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what I'm running into it seems like the Windows image restore utility is quite lacking in driver support and detailed information on what is actually going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you found a fix, please share it. Otherwise I may end up copying all the backups and recovery image from my nas to an external drive and restoring that way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Copying to a external drive may be a good idea...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I have noticed is that if there is even the slightest name change in the folder containing the image it won't be recognized...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my images ended up in a folder " WindowsImageBackup"... and it needs to be that to work... It may be that something in your Network is messing that up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you originally create the image on this same Network drive ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I should mention... I found out the hard way that Win 10 recovery media is not capable of, or refuses to use, a image made by a previous OS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, I had to use Win 8.1 Installation Media to recover an image made with 8.1... The Win 10 Media wouldn't recognize the image...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That sounds like an option... The only question I would be asking myself is which is fresher... the old hdd or the image...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a remote possibility that the image won't go to another drive of a different size anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently tested this and it wouldn't work... I even tried going to a LARGER drive, not smaller... no go...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same image restored to the original&nbsp;drive perfectly...</p>
<p>I would guess based on this that the new drive would need to be the same size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was kind of ticked that I didn't have a same size to test...</p>

            <p>Yes to all of your questions. In Fact i've ran the app diagnostic several times still it shows the same even after restarting the computer. i want to get win10. Any other way of getting win10 without app and reservation? I've surfed the whole internet for
 this problem and tried various solutions of getting that win10 app but nothing is helping even though my computer meet the requirements. I know the one and only problem and solution is to make KB3035583 run. I'm sure it will solve the problem just make it
 run anyhow. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT : Today I ran the windows update again and saw the KB3035583 in the optional updates. It installed successfully but didn't said me to restart the computer. I restarted the computer on my own but still no win10app. I once again ran the diagnostic but
 it still says the same "KB3035583 has not run".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: When I try to unzip the KB3035583 files it says it can't open the path and access is denied but im the administrator of the computer . How come?</p>

            I've done everything multiple times and every time, I get the error that KB3035583 has not run. I also get an error that the Get Windows 10 app needs to be updated. I don't understand because I just downloaded it yesterday. I don't understand what the
 issue is. Even the update troubleshooter states that I have no issues, but when I try and run the Get Windows 10 app, it just keeps telling me the same error that I listed above. Seriously, is there a fix for this or what?

            Try opening any of the Office applications in safe mode:

<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-o...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a repair:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<h2>            Redeemed Gift Card shows balance at live.com but not on xbox 360 profile</h2>
                    
<p>We recently purchased a $25 (Canadian) gift card from 7-11 and redeemed it on xbox.com The $25 appear in the account without problem. When we went to the profile on the xbox itself, balance was $0. Returning to xbox.com the $25 still appears. Deleting the
 Profile, and re-downloading it doesn't help. Technical support bith in live chat at xbox.com and getting them to call my home was useless.</p>
<p>I have been backwards and forwards through the support forums and FAQs and have not found a single person with this exact problem. I have found similiar issues, like people getting gift cards from the USA and ending up with a balance they can not use because
 thier region is Canada or viseaversa, not straight like this.</p>
<p>I do have some clues however....</p>
<p>We currently live in an RV and travel often between Idaho and Canada. So we tend to switch our region between the USA and Canada a lot. But we have never bought a gift card in the USA for xbox, and only used our Canadian credit card, or Canadian based paypal.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub</a>&nbsp;we appear to have TWO profiles, one is Canadian, the other American. The only thing I can think that could have caused this is the fact that we only get
 US Dollars into the paypal account even thou it's Canadian. That being said however, the history on that URL shows that we have only ever used the Canadian account with Canadian funds, and the $25 is in the Canadian account...</p>
<p>Ready for another twist?</p>
<p>On the xbox itself, we tried ADDING a new payment option and although our region is set to Canada, it will only let us enter US addresses for the Credit card to be added, and will not accept the canadian paypal!</p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure when these issues started to boot...</p>
<p>We only noticed this as an issue when the xbox one was released, while xbox support was down because they were releasing the xbox one, we were in the middle of it because we had just purchased the gift card from 7-11. So my first guess was that something
 screwed up because of the changes they were making due to the new xbox one.... however...</p>
<p>A few months ago my son purchased a game online via the xbox using the paypal account connect, it ended up being a real pain for me because the money in paypal was ear marked for something else, so I canceled the token for the subscription at paypal for
 xbox to use the paypal account, and because there was no password between the xbox by default for new purchases, I did the same for the credit card.</p>
<p>As a result of that, the xbox live gold expired, and we still some how ended up with another month before getting cut off. So when the it did finally catch up, I went out a bought a three month subscribtion for xbox live gold and added it to the account.
 After a brief contact with support one month of the card was killed (with my approval) and we went on our merry way. However, now it's only been one month and we should have one month left, but that's gone too. So figure maybe the tech guy made a typo in the
 MySql database when he deleted one month from the card, and now everything is screwed up.</p>
<p>Any one have suggestions? Help is useless on this, and I have gotten to the point of taking them to small claims just so they don't get away with the $25 and 1 month.</p>

<p>UPDATE: After many contacts with dealing with xbox, we received the equivalent to the 1 month and the $25. However, come April, we will be back in the same boat as the profile on the console still dictates that we are in the USA. We can now add more xbox

<h2>            What is the best and most trustworthy PC &#34;cleaner&#34; out there</h2>
                    <p>My windows 7 computer has been acting like a slug since i had a virus on it a few months ago and got rid of it. Have have here about programs (3ed party and such) that will clean out usless files and end pointless processes, etc. Ones that make your computer
 not take 10 minutes to open large files and freeze up all the time. </p>
<p>But i have no idea which ones are not a scam and which ones are better than others. Does anyone have any ideas from personal experiences or their computer expertize that would greatly out-match mine?</p>

    <title>Directx 11 and Shader Level Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylorc157  say:</h3>
<h2>            Directx 11 and Shader Level Issues</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded&nbsp; a game from EA, Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning, and was attempting to open it for the first time when I received this error message: "Requires a graphics card that supports vertex shader 3.0 or higher."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seemed like a straightforward error, I verified I'm using a Directx v 11.something and that should mean I have shader level 5.&nbsp; Still, I checked for an update for my driver for my vid card and there isn't one, I also rebooted my pc and downloaded and ran
 the <em>DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer </em>which states I have the newer version and it can't help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped here, I suppose I could uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it's just a glitch, but hoping not to have to do that as I really feel it's something internally in the windows software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; I don't play with drivers too much, is it safe to 'uninstall' or 'disable' then reboot reinstall/re-enable the driver?&nbsp; A bit concerned over doing that but if it's definitely safe it's worth a try.</p>

            <p><em>"I verified I'm using a Directx v 11.something and that should mean I have shader level 5. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Win 7 and 8 both have DX 11 (and DX 9&amp;10), but the error is more likely to do with your</p>
<p>graphics card not supporting Vertex shader 3.0. However, it would be a very old graphics card that</p>
<p>does not support shader 3.0. Some 'older' Integrated graphics chips may not support shader 3.0 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I checked for an update for my driver for my vid card and there isn't one"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>No Win7 driver at all, or just nothing more recent than what you have installed ? If there are</p>
<p>no drivers for your card that suit Win7&nbsp; you will need a new card (or possibly a new system)</p>
<p>to play most games.</p>
<p>- More details of your system specifications may be helpful to determine what the problem is.<br />
With the make and model graphics card your machine uses, we should be able to confirm if it uses Shader 3. This is your main consideration as this game will run on XP which means it uses DirectX 9&nbsp; ( XP does not have DX10 or 11).</p>
<p>The cpu model would also be good to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I don't play with drivers too much, is it safe to 'uninstall' or 'disable' then reboot reinstall/re-enable the driver?&nbsp; "</em></p>
<p>Graphics drivers are frequently updated, but with old cards they don't generally offer much advantage as driver optimisations are mostly for newer cards.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- Note that graphics drivers that may be installed automatically when you uninstall and reboot are</p>
<p>Window generic VGA drivers, not the drivers for your graphics accelerator (graphics card or integrated graphics chip) .&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When running on Windows VGA drivers your graphics card is not functioning.&nbsp; It is only acting as a connection to your monitor for Windows VGA graphics (so no shader 3.0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>While updating drivers is quite safe you do need to follow the correct procedure.</p>
<p>- Two methods of updating drivers that you should <em>not</em> do with graphics drivers are</p>
<p>1) Update via Device Manager</p>
<p>2) Update via Windows Update ( this is found in the 'Optional' Windows updates and should</p>
<p>be disallowed by hiding the update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The best procedure for updating graphics drivers is to uninstall them via <em>
Programs and Features</em></p>
<p>and Reboot. </p>
<p>After rebooting the resolution may be very low (depending on your system), but you can re-set
</p>
<p>it to at least 1024x760 while you go about reinstalling the drivers you have downloaded</p>
<p>(Right click on the desktop and click on Resolution in the drop down menu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Drivers are best downloaded from either the mfg of the graphics card, or in the case of laptops,</p>
<p>from the mfg of the laptop. </p>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to download the graphics drivers from the mfg of your PC if you</p>
<p>are using an OEM machine (DELL, HP, etc.), as they often use their own OEM versions of various</p>
<p>graphics cards and modify the drivers to suit.</p>
<p>.</p>

<h2>            Some Music CDs Distorted When Played or Ripped</h2>
                    <p>I have a new PC I built last year with Windows 10. I just recently tried to play a music CD I bought in 1987 using both an external LG blu ray player/writer and a Sony DVD writer (which are both several years old). In either case, the music has a constant
 crackly static. I ripped a track as 192 Kbps and 320 Kbps and a WAV. All three play back with the distortion. To rule out my 5.1 speakers, I uploaded one of the MP3s to my Amazon Drive and played it on my phone. Same distortion. I even tried using EAC and
 got the distortion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried three more CDs: one I bought in 1987, one I bought in 1988, and one just a year or two old. The other one from 87 sounds distorted but the other two are fine. YouTube sounds fine as do WAV files I bought from HD Tracks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the various suggestions (update drivers, turn off enhancements, etc.). Nothing works. Because I was able to play and rip this same 1987 CD on my old laptop several years ago, I got it out and found that if, I play the CD through the external Sony
 DVD writer, distortion occurs. If I play the CD through the laptop's internal disc drive (hp DVDRAM GU70N SATA CdRom), no distortion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it likely I need an internal drive and not USB, or is it the type of drive (i.e., my internal drive was designed more for playing music and movies rather than writing DVDs)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any advice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jon Owens 1966,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are some factors that might cause audio distortion, like a damaged disc or file, settings applied, or at times, it might be the DVD drive that's causing the problem. Let's narrow down the issue. In order for me to have a better idea on your concern,
 I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the issue also happening when you try burn your files on a disc?</li><li>Have you tried checking if file audio or video files have the same issue?</li><li>Are you using <strong>Windows Media Player</strong> when you rip audio files from your discs?</li><li>What is the version and build of your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?
<ul>
<li>You can have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box, then type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you run the <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_wmpdvd10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter for DVD in Windows Media Player</a></strong>, to automatically find and fix issues that could cause the distortion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep me posted on the results on your thread.</p>

 if the computer or NAS sharing the drive has an ip address of 192.168.1.2, you would type
<strong>\\192.168.1.2</strong>&nbsp;(dont forget the slashes) in the address bar in file explorer and then hit enter.

            <p>I have almost the same issue.&nbsp; I am not part of domain, I have a workgroup, but no matter how may times I try the system insists it is a business machine, not part of a home network, and even though I get the expected "Welcome to the X Workgroup" and get
 prompted for a restart, it comes back insisting the computer name is the name of the domain, and although I can see the other machine, it insists on asking me for network credentials.&nbsp; I had it working for a second when I turned on Homegroups and logged both
 machines in to it, but this is NOT the solution I want, because it limits me to looking at files instead of swapping back and forth etc, plus it limits me only to music etc - I open my Public Folder and I can only see a fraction of the directories that are
 actually in it.&nbsp; I really don't like this, it's driving me nuts.&nbsp; I did not have Homegroups turned on before, and I could do whatever I wanted between the two machines.&nbsp; I am kinda disappointed that the systems, which are both now running 10, didn't just take
 and use the shares I had before.&nbsp; Any ideas? </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is make my two computers part of a workgroup, and be able to share files between them (read/write/create) without having to enter network credentials or use a Homegroup.&nbsp; This is what I had before upgrading.</p>

            Hi cosmoliz,
<br />
<br />You may have installed VPN software that was bundled with another. Whatever the cause is, you can indeed remove it completely, not by going the regular route, but you can use 3rd party uninstaller software like Revo Uninstaller, it'll delete registry keys and other traces associated with the program, this is one of the better ways to remove traces of an especially unwanted program: <a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! Let me know if there are any concerns or questions.

<p>thank you will let you know if it work ,</p>
<p>Not a techie so hope this does not sound dumb. I believe Microsoft has added something or has something called atom in the pc,&nbsp; if I go to the site and delete registry will it show atom vpn?</p>
<p>Concerned I may delete the wrong item.</p>
<p>There is an uninstall on the vpn listing in settings of my computer(windows 10) for the atom vpn-am I correct in thinking if I use that it would still leave stuff in pc</p>

            cosmoliz,
<br />
<br />Atom wouldn't be Microsoft's doing. But, I would say most of the time it will leave traces if you uninstall the traditional way. That's why you have to use third-party software like Revo Uninstaller to perform a deep scan of these traces in the registry and other stuff (normally that would be okay to not do so, but if you really want it gone without a trace, Revo Uninstaller is your best bet).
<br />
<br />Let me know if there's anything else.

    <title>Bluetooth keyboard and mouse stop working, cannot be removed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nousoul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth keyboard and mouse stop working, cannot be removed</h2>
                    My Logitech MX Master mouse and K380 keyboard suddenly stop working. They still showed up in the Bluetooth settings, as "paired", but there was no possibility of reconnecting, even when turning Bluetooth off and on. Just "paired". Then I tried unpairing,
 so I could re-pair, but unpairing keeps failing. Even in Control Panel &gt; Devices &gt; Hardware, no way to unpair. Then after a restart, the Bluetooth tile in the notification pane completely disappeared, and in the Bluetooth settings menu the option to turn Bluetooth
 on and off was totally missing. The only fix I've found is to just keep re-pairing the devices each time they disconnect, adding duplicates to the "paired devices" list.

            Hi Nousoul.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give all possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority:
<br />
<br />Make sure you're pairing correctly as shown here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/...</a>
<br />
<br /> See Fixes here:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth,Keyboard and Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooters at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Touch Keyboard and Wireless Keyboard typing different characters for Japanese Input Keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EDIT:</span> After some endless Googling, and no help from Microsoft except being told repeatedly "add the Japanese language pack to your PC" (even though that is the first thing I mentioned that I have done)
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/keyboard-is-typing-wrong-characters-for-japanese/b6ffa648-13d1-4606-ab17-51564e13eff1?db=5&amp;auth=1http://">
I finally found this page</a></strong><strong> which explains what to do, will also apply to Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Windows 10 you just need to go to options on the Japanese language pack, click on the Microsoft IME, select options, under "Hardware keyboard" I turned off "use kana input" and under advanced settings in the "general" tab, select the input method
 to romaji.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If kana input is selected it will type the letters out as individual "letters" and you will get some weird, possibly really long sentence for a short word lol</strong></p>
<p><strong>Though if you are trying to type "konnichiwa" with this all applied, you have to type it as "konnnichiha" to get the correct characters as otherwise it will type it as "ko-n-i-chi-wa" (こんいちわ) which isn't correct lol</strong><br />
</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently leaning Japanese and in doing so I want to be able to type using hiragana/katakana/kanji on my PC.</p>
<p>I have installed and added the Japanese language pack to my PC and when I wish to use it I change the language over to that.</p>
<p>With this, I have a problem and so far I haven't seen anything, anywhere, to do with a similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I use the touch keyboard (one I rarely use) and type out, for example, "konnichiwa" (hello in Japanese), the characters and text I see on the screen in say, Microsoft Word, are the correct characters which are the hiragana for "konnichiwa".</p>
<p>However, if I use my wireless keyboard to type, a much easier and faster way for me to do so, the characters which are written out on the screen are incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As an example:</strong></p>
<p><em>Touch Keyboard -</em> こんにちは</p>
<p><em>Wireless Keyboard -</em> のらみみにそくにてち</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it seems to do is not combine the letters (as for example 'ko' doesn't become 'こ') into a single character, and types the letters out individually, and at that they aren't even correct to begin with when translated.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Just to add, this is when using the keyboard setting of typing in the romaji form (as in me typing 'konnichiwa' into the QWERTY touch keyboard onscreen) instead of individually selecting the hiragana
 from the split, touch keyboard.</strong><br />
<strong>I am only doing this at the moment to help myself understand the relation between the romaji and hiragana as I am a beginner still.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas how to fix this very obscure problem?</p>

            <p>As said in my original post, I have changed my PC to the Japanese keyboard and made Japanese an additional language on my PC, so everything is already set up, downloaded and installed.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems to be a problem with my wireless keyboard not typing the correct characters when typing in the romaji form (the form which uses Latin lettering) and it will simple not combine the letters to create the correct character for two letters combined.
  <br />
The example I gave above was me typing using the touch keyboard and then the wireless keyboard and as you can see they are not the same as the wireless keyboard's output is incorrect.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as as an additional thought it would be nice to access and type with the the hiragana flick settings from my wireless keyboard anyway but I could not find a way of doing so do instead I have to continue to use the touch keyboard to access this typing
 option.  <br />
Also at that, like with a lot of other language keyboards I have on other devices, it only shows the hiragana and no katakana and there is no way of changing this, even though after changing the touch keyboard format to either half-width kana or full-width
 kana. Neither actually have katakana characters.&nbsp;<br />
Unless this is something I missed even though the kana option is also enabled in the settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p> Just to also point out when also using the touch keyboard to type 'konnichiwa' and it showing the hiragana characters, it doesn't use the correct characters for the final result.&nbsp;<br />
The example I used in my original post I had to change as the characters were incorrect as it typed it out as: "こんいちわ" where it is actually "こんにちは" as it doesn't seem to include the second &nbsp;'n' after 'ん' and uses the character for 'i' (い) rather than 'ni' (に)
 and at that uses the character for 'wa' (わ) rather than the correct way to write the word in hiragana using 'ha' (は) at the end of the set of characters (as there are different grammar rules as to when to use 'wa' (わ) and 'ha' (は) in sentences and words).&nbsp;<br />
Just thought I'd point this out.&nbsp;</p>

                    <blockquote>
<p>The full text of the error message is in my initial post.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here it is again:</p>

<p>
</p><p>But I have very good news.&nbsp; Our 3 HP laptops were all printing just fine until this morning (after a Windows update) and they suddenly started getting the same error.&nbsp; The research provided by the compatibility site for Microsoft said this printer is compatible
 for Windows 8.1 with a "Free Update".&nbsp; That "Free Update" is actually a firmware update for the printer.&nbsp; I've applied it and now all our Surfaces and all our laptops are printing just fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for much for this article and all the answers to so many questions.&nbsp; I have found it very helpful</p>

<p>Oh dear it has happened again.&nbsp; My HP Folio was printing just fine and now I am getting a cheettext error again.&nbsp; It is a slightly different error from last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full text of the error is:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Error: IllegalFontdata</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; File Name: cheettext.c</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Number: 1453</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to print a web page.&nbsp; When it didn't print, I saved it as a pdf and tried to print that and got the same error.&nbsp; I was able to print the pdf from a different computer.&nbsp; On my computer I was able to print a Word document, a pdf that had no graphic,
 and a different pdf that had a graphic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is HP Folio 13 -1020us (64bit).&nbsp; It was originally Win 7 Home Premium and was upgraded to Win 8 and Win 8.1.&nbsp; All&nbsp; updates are applied.&nbsp; HP issued a firmware update for the printer in the past week or so and that is applied.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are facing this issue with the <strong><em>HP MFP M175NW</em></strong> Printer connected to your HP Folio 13 -1020US laptop. I also understand that you have already installed the latest firmware for your printer model from the HP website
 and the issue still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know – </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2) Did you try uninstalling and reinstalling the printer drivers on the computer and check if that helps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since, you have already installed the latest firmware updates for your Printer model from the HP website, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 1: Run the Printer Troubleshooter </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This troubleshooter is an automated Windows 8 inbuilt tool which finds and fixes the common issues with the Printers connected to the computer. Perform these steps to run this tool and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>c) In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View</em></strong>
<strong><em>All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</p>
<p>d) Click on “<strong><em>Printer</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>e) Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>
<strong><em>as</em></strong> <strong><em>Administrator</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>f) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check the troubleshooting report and share the details with us. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue. If that doesn’t help, then try the next method.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Printer Drivers</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 1: Uninstall the Device Drivers</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on “<strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong>” from that list.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Search for the Printer device from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong><em>Delete the driver software for this device</em></strong>”
 you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the restart, please open the <strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong> again and then click on the “<strong><em>Scan for hardware changes</em></strong>” button. Check if Windows 8.1 detects the Printer device and installs an appropriate driver
 automatically. If the issue still persists, then try the next step. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 2: Update Driver Software from the HP website:</span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visit the HP website and then download the latest Windows 8 compatible drivers for your printer model and then install them on the computer by following the instructions given on the website. Now, check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the results.</span>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>Try the troubleshooting steps in the below methods and check if they help in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Method 1:
</b><br />
You may try starting the windows defender in a clean boot state.<b> To perform the clean boot follow the step 1 mentioned in the below article and then try checking in this clean boot state -</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>If the issue gets resolved check which non-Microsoft service is causing the problem; referring to the article and following other steps.<br />
<b>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</b></span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the below links for assistance -<br />

<p><span><b>Method 2:
</b><br />
You may also perform a SFC (System File Checker) scan. It will list any issues and helps resolve them –<br />
<b>Follow the below steps to</b> <b>perform a SFC Scan</b>&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click &nbsp;<b>Start</b>, click&nbsp;<b>All Programs</b>, click&nbsp;
<b>Accessories</b>, right-click&nbsp;<b>Command Prompt</b>, and then click &nbsp;<b>Run&nbsp;as administrator</b>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;<b>Allow</b></span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><span><b>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -<br />

<h2>            Lost archived emails when changed from MSN Messenger to Windows Live</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not sure if I am asking this in the right place and I hope my explanation makes sense to someone. &nbsp;I previously accessed MSN Messenger through an icon on my desktop (which has now&nbsp;disappeared) and quite a long time ago I was asked if I wanted to automatically
 archive my emails, I selected yes and all was fine with them being available in a storage folder below my main inbox, providing I accessed my own PC. &nbsp;When away on holiday and accessing through Windows Live I could only see the main inbox, which wasn't a problem.
 &nbsp;But now I can only get in through Windows Live on my PC and therefore cannot find the storage folder or access the emails. Can anyone help with retrieving them or is there a way to go back to MSN Messenger?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Tracey,<br />
<br />
We need to verify if you are referring to the conversation history of Windows Live Messenger 2011. If not, please provide us the version of Messenger that you previously used in your computer. Can you also verify if the Messenger that you previously used is
 still installed in your computer by checking the programs in your Control Panel.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <span>Hi Gerard</span>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Thanks for the reply.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
No it is not the conversation history, it is actual emails that were in my hotmail inbox.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Sorry I am going to be really vague now, I do not know what version it was, all I can tell you is that it was the latest one before Windows Live Messenger. &nbsp;Have had a look in 'add or remove programs' and cannot see anything, but maybe I am looking in the wrong
 place?<br />
<br />
Kind regards</div>

            <p>Hi Tracey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in responding to your concern. </p>
&nbsp;
<p>Have you checked your emails using web-based access Hotmail? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also mentioned from your previous post that you can only get in through Windows Live on your PC and cannot find the storage folder or access the emails. It is possible that your Live Mail isn't synching your emails. In that case, please try these following
 steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Remove the account from Windows Live Mail.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on the account as displayed on the folder pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong><span>Remove</span></strong> account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Confirm the action by clicking
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Add the account again by following the steps on this

<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on the account as displayed on the folder pane.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Download all folders.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Wait for Live Mail to download all your folders and email headers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check if all your folders have been downloaded. If it does proceed to the next step if not go back to step 1.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>10.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press on <b>F5</b> on your keyboard or click on
<b>Send and Receive</b> button to synch all your emails to Windows Live Mail.</span></p>
<p><span><span>11.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Wait until Windows live Mail has finished synching your emails. This might take a long time depending on the size of your accounts inbox.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>Let us know if issue still persists.</p>

            <p>They're the same thing basically. The Scorpio is just a limited edition version of the One X that was available for pre-order and at launch.

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection Freezes Randomly</h2>
                    <p>Well, the subject says it all. For some reason, the new Solitaire Collection just keeps on freezing at random points. All you can do is undo or go back to the main screen. But when you go back to the main screen, the entire game closes. There is no error,
 no nothing. Just poof, you can no longer play cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any ideas on what the deal is? Yes. It is up to date. Haven't gotten any updates to it in a while.</p>

            I'm glad to see, even if this is a late response, that there are other people out there without answers or actual consideration from Microsoft. I can't believe that thye want us to either pay them $100 an hour for phone support where they have full remote
 access to our computers by our consent or they give us no solution through here. My Win 10 upgrade has been a nightmare and continues to be a nightmare and yet I cannot get any help unless I spend enough money to buy a volume license. LOL. Way to go money
 hungry Microsoft. Either over priced service or no resolution. :)

            <div>Solitaire still freezing until today Sept. 28, 2016. It does not look like Microsoft found a resolution to this issue. I am using Windows 10 and when playing Spider Solitaire the complete system freezes and nothing resolve it unless I shut down the computer
 by pressing on power button for 30 seconds, yeah by the way, using Surface Pro 4 with latest build from Microsoft.</div>

<p>Since you did not post your command we cannot tell you where you went wrong. This example proves that the switches work when the destination file is locked.</p>

<p>Your command is</p>
<p><span>robocopy \\server1\database \\server2\database /IF be_data.accdb</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can easily verify that be_data.accdb is the source file. If</p>
<p><strong>\\server1</strong>\database\be_data.accdb</p>
<p>does not exist then the robocopy command will fail. Hence&nbsp;be_data.accdb must be the source file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of the above, robocopy, when used with the /r and /w switches, will move to the next file when dealing with a locked file.</p>

<p>Have you tried un-installing and reinstalling it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, you are probably better off asking McAfee support via their web site -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/contact-us.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/contact-us.aspx</a> for your region of the world.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype for Business brokes RDP-connections and turns ping answers to IPv6</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We had Skype for Business meeting yesterday and after that remote desktop connections to servers didn't work anymore and ping answers were IPv6 addresses. We have used SFB before that and everything has worked after those meetings. RDP works normally from
 those machines which were not connected to SFB meeting.</p>
<p>Looks like SFB uses IPv6 but only when asked. Wer have not asked and we do not use IPv6. Direct Access is only IPv6 application what we use but it changes IPv6 to IPv4.</p>
<p>What happened and why and how to fix this?</p>
<p>~ Jukka ~&nbsp; </p>

<p>Direct Access NLS-certificate was the reason. Nothing to do with SFB :)</p>
