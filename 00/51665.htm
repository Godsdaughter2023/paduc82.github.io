<h2>            Restoring &#34;Permanently Deleted&#34; Files&#63; &#42;Desperate&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Last night, I accidentally "permanently deleted" files upon files, including mainly photos, videos, and word documents. Unlike what I thought, these were not backed on any external source whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to reset my computer to a previous version like a family member recommended, however, this did not recover any files. Then today, I installed "Recuva" and went through a deep scan as it was largely recommended on many forums like this. After
 nearly three hours, it has showed thousands of files, however, I'm not sure how to read them. They commonly hold unidentifiable names such as ".log" or ".tmp" file marks, there are no previews available, and when I attempt to read through it for more information,
 it doesn't list anything I can comprehend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm desperate for help. I deleted extremely valuable school work, a film I was in the midst of editing, and countless of precious photos and videos. I'm looking for any recommendations on this subject, and I worry that I've already over-written most of the
 files I need. I appreciate any input on the subject, thank you so much.</p>

<p>What you need is the Product ID.&nbsp; Did the XP software come&nbsp;installed on another computer by the amnufacturer?&nbsp; If&nbsp;so it cannot be&nbsp;installed on ANY other machine (even if uninstalled on the original.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;called an OEM license and that's how it works.&nbsp; There
 is no such thing as a Confirmation ID in the activation process - whatever it says it isn't required to activate.</p>
<p>If it's a retail version of the software it can be moved but installed on only one computer at a time.</p>
<p>To manually activate, proceed as follows:</p>
<p><span>To manually activate, go to start, search box and type in slui 4 and enter.&nbsp; Enter your country and press next.&nbsp; You'll be on a screen with a phone number and
 a bunch of codes at the bottom.&nbsp; Call the number and wade through the automated prompts until you reach a human.&nbsp; Have your product code handy as it will be requested.&nbsp; Explain the situation but it's the same PC and only installed on that one PC.&nbsp; They should
 give you a code to enter on that screen to activate Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

                    My storage space on my PC keeps filling up for no apparent reason. I'm using Windows 10. Most files are "other". I did a search on .cab files after seeing another fix (which didn't work) &amp; have 417 winzip files. Is this likely to be the problem &amp; is it
 safe to delete them?

            Hi  FreeRangeRC
<br />
<br />It depends, where exactly are those files located and what are those files named like?
<br />
<br />Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove and indeed what the underlying issue may be . . .

            Hi FreeRangeRC
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You can execute following to gain space on your computer
<br />
<br />1. Use Storage Sense to delete unnecessary files
<br />Type Storage in Cortana Search Box &gt; Click Storage &gt; Click Change how we free up space &gt; Down below there is button Clean now under Free up space now which you should press
<br />
<br />2. Use Disk Cleanup
<br />Type Disk Cleanup in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Disk Cleanup &gt; Check relevant options (you can also clean system files)
<br />
<br />3. Analyze disk space
<br />You should analyze your existing space with help of third party softwares and remove un-necessary files. TreeSize is most popular one and is a Microsoft Store app.
<br />

<br />
<br />4. Check for log files in CBS directory
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Check the size of CBS.Log and if size is huge &gt; 
<br />Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Delete all of the files in the CBS folder (or rename and move to a backup drive) &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update. 
<br />
<br />5. Microsoft has also some suggestions to improve disk space.

<p>Hi johnandjulie13,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Worries, let’s try to fix one note opening slowly issue. Before we begin let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this issue occur only with OneNote or also with other Office applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s check if OneNote starts fine in safe mode.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press Windows Key + R Key.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type safe/onenote and press OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue doesn’t exists peform clean boot to determine if any third party service is causing this issue</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to perform clean boot:</span></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type
<b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</p>
<p>c) Click the <b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck
<b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</p>
<p>d) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option
<b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option <b>Load startup items</b> check box.</p>
<p>e) On the <b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the
<b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click <b>‘Disable all’</b>.</p>
<p>f) On the <b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’.
</b>In the<b> Task Manager window </b>under<b> startup tab, </b>
right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></p>
<p>f) Click <b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </b>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</b>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing
 the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
</b>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type
<b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</p>
<p>c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the
<b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>‘OK’</b>.</p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click

            <p>Thank you for the response.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am running into some hurdles that are preventing me from following your instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, yes I am also having issues with the Mail Ap in that it takes a really long time for it to sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, entering "safe/onenote" at the run dialog box returns an error "Could not fine safe/onenote"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, I then rebooted into Safe mode to try to see if OneNote would work but I would get the error: "Cannot run program using the built in Administrator Account.&nbsp; Please login in as another user and retry"&nbsp; I would get this same error on any "Metro" Ap.&nbsp;
 All of my desktop Aps (Outlook, Word and Excel) all worked fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, Since I could not get the program to run in Safe Mode, I went to your instructions for a Clean Boot.&nbsp; Following your instructions, with all services disabled (including Microsoft services) and all start items disabled, I continued to have the problem.&nbsp;
 As a result, I am not able to isolate the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why am I having these issues?&nbsp; About a week after installing Win8, my user was freezing after startup.&nbsp; I was instructed to create a new user and copy my files to the new user.&nbsp; Is this part of the problem?</p>

<h2>            Blue square now appears on my document icons</h2>
                    recently all of my documents now have a bright blue square with 2 "greater than" symbols in it. I see this on my documents when i open windows explorer and am viewing all of my documents. This has happened in the last couple of weeks. I have a dell computer
 with Windows 7. Any ideas what started this?

            Thank you for your reply - I googled my question and found out that Norton anti-virus was the cause of this issue, I turned off a setting in Norton backup and the blue square dissapeared.

<h2>            hotmail email page won&#39;t load&#47;display</h2>
                    <p>The topics list for the question didn't offer an appropriate subtopic for my issues...i put the closest one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just set up my new windows 8.1 computer a couple of days ago. I set up a Microsoft account..seems we have to with the OS. So that has it's own hotmail address. I set up a local account, which is the one I use, and want to access my decades old hotmail
 email I use all the time. &nbsp;<br />
Since this computer, I cannot reliably load my hotmail email acct. It's my primary email, so this is a big issue.<br />
<br />
All other websites are loading just fine.<br />
<br />
When I go to load my hotmail email, I keep getting this message:<br />
The connection was reset while the page was loading..... or for I.E: This page can't be displayed. The address is correct, all other pages load.
<br />
<br />
These same messages have loaded when I delete emails or move emails from inbos:"connection has reset.........".&nbsp; The dreaded message.<br />
<br />
When I check hotmail status, it says hotmail is up.<br />
Other webpages are loading just fine.<br />
<br />
I have AVG internet security 2014. Not sure if firewalls is enabled. Still learning the program, but hotmail seems to be the only site that I am consistently getting this message for, although it did come up once for yahoo email.
<br />
<br />
The other trouble I am having, if I do get into my hotmail email:<br />
I have to rush to get stuff done, because sometimes in as fast as a minute, I'll get a message&nbsp; above hotmail folders/etc., saying we connect right now to outlook right now... please try again later. This happens when I try to delete or move emails from my
 inbox, try to attach images/files to an email, or when I go to send a composed email.<br />
<br />
All in all, hotmail's been a very frustrating experience of late. Any suggestions?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I had already put the latest edition/release of Yahoo messenger. My issue wasn't with yahoo. My issues is a result of having installed yahoo, which resulted in all this trouble. &nbsp;As soon as that was installed, the issues of loading hotmail, and these other
 microsoft related websites returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then Uninstalled yahoo again. After that, I installed CCleaner from piriform, and, using the registry, option, it found the remaining bits of yahoo code scattered on the computer, and fixed those issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That did not resolve the issues created though. I'm still having a hard time to view hotmail/outlook/microsoft sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read up on doing a clean boot. The process doesn't seem that hard, but once it boots up that way, exactly what would I be looking for? What's the purpose of that clean boot? Am i then to try and load the sites i'm having issues with or what? Is that doable
 in clean boot? <br />
<br />
I also read how to then get it to boot up normally. I'm just wondering what to be looking for once it clean boots? Soon as I know that, I'll do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How long will this post be kept active? I'm going away for a couple of weeks and won't have access to this computer during that time. If the issue isn't resolved yet, I'd hate to see this thread get 'lost or buried'. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree will all of the above as I have had the same problem and tryed all of them.&nbsp; The commect about another program lead me to a solution.&nbsp; Knowing the date the prablem started I looked at the installed programs and found "Trusteer Endpoint Protection"
 loaded on the date hotmail stopped working.&nbsp; I uninstalled that program and hotmail now works fine.&nbsp; I do not know where the program came from.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update problem &#40;Vista&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I know there were many other posts about this issue but it doesn't seem to be the same problem I have, plus, I've tried many suggestions and none of them solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using <strong>Vista 32bit SP2</strong>. I didn't use this computer for a while then the WU (Windows Update) stopped working, failed to fix it so I reinstalled Vista from the disc and manually installed SP1 then SP2 but WU still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WU is checking for updates but nothing happens. In the log file I find these errors reported:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p><strong>...Agent&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;WARNING: Failed to evaluate Installed rule, updateId...</strong></p>
<p><strong>...Driver&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Matched driver to device PCI\...</strong><br />
<strong>...Driver&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Status: 0x180200a, ProblemNumber: 00000000</strong><br />
<strong>...Handler&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FATAL: UH: 0x80070490: EvaluateApplicability failed in CCbs::EvaluateApplicability</strong></p>
<p>"</p>
<p>I tried many suggestions I found on the net, including MS Fix It (MicrosoftFixit.wu.MATSKB.Run.exe) which didn't work, it's telling me it failed to download one or more components and currently couldn't run Fix It [<strong>code: 80070578</strong>]. Other
 suggestions also failed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see this error on the WU log file:</p>
<p>"<strong>Agent&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; * WARNING: Failed to filter search results, error = 0x8024000B</strong>"</p>
<p>I tried but fail to fix that one too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest I can do?</p>

<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without </em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Is it a Vista 32-bit or a 64-bit computer?&nbsp; See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
1c. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Lenovo; Toshiba)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d.&nbsp;When (exact date) did you "reinstall Vista from the disc?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>1e. Did the disc come with the computer-in-question or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Were SP1 and/or SP2 offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Is Internet Explorer 7 (IE7), IE8 or IE9 installed?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply PA Bear MS MVP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. 2007</p>
<p>1b. 32bit computer and 32bit OS. BTW it's Vista Home Premium, language Hebrew.</p>
<p>1c. It was&nbsp;assembled<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> </span>from different parts from different manufacturers by the store I bought it from.</p>
<p>1d. May 2nd 2016</p>
<p>1e. It's an original disc which came with the computer when I bought it, it's an OEM version and there's a sticker on top of the computer with the product key which I reconfirmed as genuine after reinstalling and reactivated it.</p>
<p>2. Norton Internet Security. I'm on automatic renewal. It's the only security application installed. BTW Of course I tried both before and after reinstalling Vista to completely turn NIS off and it didn't help WU work.</p>
<p>3. Older versions of NIS and maybe other Norton products I can't remember.</p>
<p>4. NIS came on the Gigabyte disc that came with the computer. I didn't install that one after reinstalling Vista. I can't remember if I installed it when I bought the computer.</p>
<p>5. I searched for SP1 and SP2 on Microsoft Download Center, found them, downloaded them and installed them. I also tried to download and install other updates from MDC but none of them was helpful so I removed most of them.</p>
<p>6. IE7. I read upgrading to IE9 might help so I managed to upgrade to IE9 after installing some updates but it didn't help at all and it was only in English and no Hebrew so I removed it and went back to IE7.&nbsp; I'm using Firefox 46.0.1 now because IE7 isn't
 good for much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? Do you have more questions? I'm really glad you're trying to help me.</p>

            <p>1. No, I used a nice looking Windows Vista disc which has shiny signs, 2 signs are "Microsoft" that change to "GENUINE" when I move the disc. 2 others are the windows logo.</p>
<p>2. I guess a few hours. I'm not sure exactly. When i'm not on the computer I usually make it go to sleep or turn it off.</p>
<p>3. SP1 and also SP2. Both on May 2nd. </p>
<p>4. May 3rd. I downloaded it from Norton's website from my Norton account and installed it.</p>
<p>5. The expiration date is May 13th 2017.</p>
<p>6. No, I have never tried the Norton Removal Tool. I will try it and let you know the result.</p>

            I've tried to Norton Removal Tool. Removed NIS. restarted my computer. Checked for updates on WU. Nothing happened. Looked at the WU log file - same errors. Downloaded and reinstalled NIS. So I don't think Norton is the troublemaker in this case. Do you
 have more ideas? more questions?

            <p>1. I don't know because when they gave me the computer Vista was already installed. Here in Israel most people buy desktop computers from a couple of big chain stores that build the computer for you (Ivory and KSP) and I bought it from one of them and it
 has good reputation.</p>
<p>2. Mostly its Hebrew on the disc. It says in Hebrew "allowed to be&nbsp;distributed only with a new computer" and "for support for the product, turn to the&nbsp;manufacturer of your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think removing all updates (I installed without WU) including SP1 and SP2 may help?</p>

            <p>I think it's an original Microsoft disc. Does MS burn on their discs Norton/McAfee free-trail software?<br />
</p>
<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with this disc because I used it a couple of times in the past to reinstall Vista on my computer and everything was good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my computer on a daily basis and never had a problem I failed to solve until now. Never had to ask anyone for help to solve a problem with my computer. I didn't use it for about a month because I was away from home and when I came back WU didn't find
 new updates and installed one old update from the time before I left home and it got stuck and I turned off the computer, then WU just got stuck when looking for updates. I tried to fix it and things only got worse so I tried to reinstall Vista and that didn't
 help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any more ideas what I can do? Maybe you know someone in this community who may be able to help me here? It's not just WU that doesn't work, it's also "MS Fix it" that doesn't work and I don't know why.</p>

<p>Discs marked "allowed to be&nbsp;distributed only with a new computer" and "for support for the product, turn to the&nbsp;manufacturer of your computer" are OEM (not Microsoft) discs created by the OEM - so yes, Norton/McAfee free-trialware may be included &amp; installed
 by default.</p>

 when looking for updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Win10 being "pushed" to Win7 &amp; Win8.1 computers as a Recommended update, Microsoft change a lot of things on their end while you were away. (So did Norton.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you'd choose to replace the computer [Extended Support for Vista SP2&nbsp;ends on 11 April 2017!], I&nbsp;think you're best bet would be
<em>formatting the hard-drive</em> and then doing another clean install of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tips:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After completing the clean install, download/run the <strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> [&lt;=direct download link] - followed
 by a reboot - and then run the <strong><a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</a></strong> (followed by another reboot) BEFORE installing your anti-virus/anti-malware
 application (e.g., Norton Internet Security or, preferably, the free <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/security-essentials-product-information#tabs1=features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a></strong>)
<em>AND BEFORE</em> installing or attempting to install <em>ANY </em>updates (including SP1, SP2 &amp; IE9). [1][2]<br />
<br />
</li><li>Once you've gotten SP1, SP2 &amp; IE9 installed manually (i.e., via the Microsoft Update Catalog), you'll need to install
<strong><a href="http://download.windowsupdate.com/windowsupdate/redist/standalone/7.6.7600.320/WindowsUpdateAgent-7.6-x86.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Agent v7.6 (x86)</a></strong>&nbsp;[&lt;=direct download link] before you'll be able to manually
 (or automatically)&nbsp;check for &amp; install updates via Windows Update.<br />
<br />
</li><li>You <em>MAY </em>need to install <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB937287</a></strong> manually, as well, before using Windows Update/Automatic Updating.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Prior to formatting the HDD, you may wish to backup personal data (e.g., contents of My Documents folder; IE Favorites; Contacts; email) to an external drive (e.g., flash drive)&nbsp;or CD/DVD. You MUST scan the data (i.e., the external drive or disc) with at
 least two (2) reputable online scanners (e.g., ESET; Kaspersky; Bitdefender - NOT your installed AV app) before restoring the data to the HDD.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you need additional assistance with the clean install,&nbsp;please begin <em>your own new thread
</em>in this forum&nbsp;[since the <strong>Repair &amp; Recovery</strong> forums are no more]&nbsp;and ask for guidance:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_install">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_install</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>=================================================</p>
<p>[1] Download the removal tools using another computer then transfer them to the Vista computer via CD/DVD or a
<em>brand-new, never-been-used</em> flash drive.</p>
<p>[2] The computer should not be connected to the internet until you're reading to install your chosen anti-virus/anti-malware application,</p>

    <title>Importing Windows live mail messages from windows 7 to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dondunlap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing Windows live mail messages from windows 7 to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;just got a new computer with Windows 10.&nbsp; I have my old computer and have tried exporting&nbsp;from that and importing this into Windows 10. I have had NO success whatsoever.&nbsp; I had a mobile computer repair guy come out and he had no success either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One problem making it difficult is the size of the file, which is quite large.&nbsp; I got to 9 Gigabytes once and ran out of space.&nbsp; what would probably be the easiest method would be able to copy from Windows&nbsp; 7, all files associated with mail messages and
 then copy that to Windows 10.&nbsp; I saw one post that alluded to that but it was a little&nbsp;too complex to follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any relatively simple way to do this.&nbsp; I have switched systems in the past,&nbsp;also with problems&nbsp;but nothing of this difficulty.</p>

            <p>I think that it might work if you are only working with one computer, but I have two computers involved. &nbsp;I want to export from the old computer into the new one, &nbsp;I only have one network cable in the room and can't hook both up to the network. &nbsp;I would
 have to export to a file and then copy that file to flash drive and then move it to the new computer and import it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this several times and gotten different results many times. &nbsp;The most successful was when all of the folders got transferred, but there was only ONE email in each folder. &nbsp;Usually it won't recognize the file properly or some other problem crops
 up when I try different permutations. &nbsp;I am stumped and had a technican from a computer assistance company have the same problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I made myself clear? &nbsp;I'm old and forgetful but have been in the computer software business since 1967. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you have a desktop computer, remove side panel,&nbsp; ( unplug power), then remove coin shaped cmos battery, leave out for 60 seconds and then put cmos battery back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will reset bios to defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the other way is to enter bios at boot (f8 or del see manual on entering bios) and set bios to defaults and save on exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If resetting the bios does not work , set bios boot order to 1st device to boot cd-rom/dvd, save changes, exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Then you would be able to put an install dvd in and do a repair or reinstall of the upgrade.</p>

            <p>Hi Nathaniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We suggest that you bring your Surface Book to the nearest Microsoft Store and have it checked as it might be an issue with the hardware (screen) already. Our support staff at the store will surely assist you on the next process. If your Surface Book is
 still under warranty, you can request for a replacement once the staff checked your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any further concerns.</p>

<h2>            SfB call history showing incorrect name when calling mobile number, or direct number&#39;s forwarded to mobile</h2>
                    <p>I have a strange scenario in which any call to a&nbsp;users mobile, or direct number forwarded to any mobile number, shows the name of the caller&nbsp;(not callee) in the call history list. The contact card shows the correct callee&nbsp;information and the email in outlook
 is correctly populated. The&nbsp;only difference within the email, is that it shows only the caller as a recipient, and not the callee.&nbsp;This problem is global and there's no difference if the mobile number is from AD or entered manually in the SfB client.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Alienware Support, their&nbsp;on-line documentation, and ask in their forums.<br />
<br />
Alienware - Support - Drivers and Downloads<br />
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/alienware_support/alienware_support?s=dhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/alienware_support/alienware_support?s=dhs</span></a><br />
<br />
Alienware - Community Forum - Club<br />
<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/owners-club/alienware/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://en.community.dell.com/owners-club/alienware/default.aspx</span></a><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/Diagnostics/us/en/19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a><br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;the System Maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and
<br />
ask in their&nbsp;forums about any known issues. Update BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and
<br />
the&nbsp;major&nbsp;on-board device drivers. If no Windows 10 versions exist try the latest Windows
<br />
<strong>8/7</strong>&nbsp;versions.&nbsp; Be sure to ASK&nbsp;their Support and in their forums because there are likely to
<br />
be known&nbsp;issues.<br />
<br />
<strong>May need to re-install the latest available&nbsp;camera&nbsp;drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager -&nbsp;Imaging Device&nbsp;- write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Dispaly Adapter, Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, <br />
Mouse and Keyboard if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any <br />
other major device drivers&nbsp;you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<h2>            Multiple displays on windows 10</h2>
                    I have a set up at my desk with two&nbsp;displays however at this moment the projected image on my wall is desktop 1 and the monitor is desktop 2. I have the display set to extended however when I try and open a program on desktop 2 it will open on desktop
 1. this is very annoying for me and I would like to know if it is possible to make items opened on desktop 2 open on desktop 2 itself rather than desktop 1 without mirroring the displays.

            Hi Bob-M2,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />It's not like you really have a choice on the amount of threads being used. Check the CPU and memory usage in Resource Monitor, what are they like? When in the Processes tab in Task Manager, what takes up the most CPU/memory?
<br />
<br />Let me know, thanks.       
        </p>

<p>There are 2 columns, one for Mem, where the winner is Service Host: Sysmain</p>
<p>and in the CPU column, it jumps around, but System and Windows Explorer, which I am not using.</p>

            Bob,
<br />
<br />Personally I think CPU but excessive RAM usage can also cause a great deal of slowdowns.
<br />
<br />What is your uptime? Go into the Performance tab &gt; CPU and look at "Up time". It should be in a format like days:hours:minutes:seconds.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

            Bob,<br /><br />Indeed when a computer is on for a long time, it does get less stable and a restart flushes volatile memory that is accumulated as the computer was on. It entirely depends on what hardware you’re on, what CPU do you have and how much RAM do you have on it?<br /><br />Thanks for keeping me posted.

            Bob,
<br />
<br />It seems to be a lower-end CPU, so performance will scale lower, and that Windows 10 can be more resource intensive than Windows 7.
<br />
<br />8 GB of RAM is the bare minimum these days and you only have 6, I recommend you upgrade your RAM configuration if you're handy with that, also consider switching from a hard drive to a solid state drive (if you want help specifically with that, let me know, it's a harder task than the former).

<h2>            Synaptics Corrupted File</h2>
                    <p>So, I have a Synaptics Touchpad program, and I don't think that it's the correct one for my computer. I tried to uninstall it, but it said it's not a "valid Win32 application". I read around on some items, and I believe that it's corrupted because it's not
 compatible with my computer. <br />
</p>
<p>Additional Information: </p>
<p>HP 2015&nbsp;(Windows 10) </p>
<p>Synaptics PS/2 SMBus Devices 19.01.19.1 </p>
<p>
</p><p>If more information is needed, please ask.&nbsp;Another way around my problem would be if anybody knows how to disable PalmCheck. It's not showing up on my Synaptics settings, and disabling SmartSense is very temporal. Thank you!</p>

            Thanks for trying to help, but I can't install it again. It just says a newer version is on, and if I want to install something else I have to uninstall the first program. Of course, I can't do this because it's not a valid file.

    <title>SD Card Detection Issue in Windows Installed on MacBook Air - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SD Card Detection Issue in Windows Installed on MacBook Air</h2>
                    I installed genuine copy of windows in my MacBook air. I am having issue with the SD card slot. When the computer goes in sleep and awakens back, the SD card slot stops working. SD card reader doesn't show even in hardware list at that time. I tried everything
 but couldn't get it fixed until rebooted.&nbsp;It doesn't seem to be a hardware issue since&nbsp;I don't face such problem when I login through MacOS. I have seen SD card slot working perfectly continuously for hours/days but just sleep causes trouble. I have to reboot
 to gain access again.

            I have installed windows 10 pro 64 bit. There is no error message (until I open some shortcut that targets in the SD card). That location is simply disappeared. Earlier I thought it is issue of SD card, but later I found that SD card slot is itself not
 even there in device manager. No prompt on reinserting any card. The hardware (on board card reader) is lost somewhere as if it is detached from PC. And the issue occurs only when I return from sleep.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In all other cases, card slot works perfect. I don't understand what sleep does to the card slot so that it requires a reboot. Its an every time case. I also found that if I hibernate and starts computer again, card reader comes back to work.<br />
<br />
Hundreds of people have this problem shared on Apple forums, but for no outcome. I believe Microsoft team is better competent to find a fix.<br />

Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Select and click <strong>Hardware and Sound.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Next.</strong></li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter. </li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists then follow the other steps. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>Run the<strong> Power Troubleshooter:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to<strong> Search </strong>or<strong> Cortana </strong>box and type<strong> Troubleshooting.</strong></li><li>Select and click <strong>System and Security</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Power</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter. </li></ol>
<p>Check to see if these helps and gets fixed. If not, try the following below: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>Switch or change the power management settings:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Type </span><strong><span>Power Options</span></strong><span> in the search box and select
<strong>Power Options</strong> from the search results.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Change plan settings</strong> next to the power plan you wish to use.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the SD card and <strong>“+”</strong> sign.
</span></li><li><span>Choose the settings to <strong>Enabled</strong> then click
<strong>Apply</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>OK</strong> to save your changes.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 4</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Modify Device Manager settings:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on <strong>Start Menu</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select<strong> Appearance and Personalization</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>File Explorer Options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong>View </strong>and uncheck<strong> Hide Empty Drives.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click<strong> Ok </strong>to save the changes<strong>. </strong></span></li></ol>

            <p>While Step 1, 2 &amp; 4 didn't fixed the issue, I stuck up on step 3. In advanced power settings, there was no option of SD card. Please check below.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I also researched a bit more. I opened Device Manager. As usually, I saw no Card Slot option there. Then I selected
<strong>More Actions &gt; View &gt; Show Hidden Devices. </strong>Then I saw the options of Apple SD card Reader &amp; few other devices that were disconnected to the computer. I clicked on
<strong>SD &gt; Properties. </strong>There I found that the device was not connected to the computer. Please check this:<br />
<br />

It seems like the SD card is not powered up. This doesn't happen anytime using any other OS. Just in windows.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Some more updates from the apple forums on this from me (its not about a MacBook Air its about a retina MacBook with a Broadcom chipset, but I think its the same problem. Anniversary edition now can't see any sd cards at all on [an unknown number of] MacBooks</p>

            <p>Hi John</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 3+ years of this issue being manifest and reported by users, the number of users facing the issue, the variety of their hardware, and successive versions of Windows making the issue worse, sorry but I don't consider your one-liner appropriate in those
 circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've raised the issue with Apple under bug ID 29809345</p>
<p>https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7352538?start=0&amp;tstart=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>here are some things Microsoft might do to help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Say WHY you think it is Apple's problem alone ie: technical details and contact history</p>
<p>* Investigate the posts I linked for details, and comment on them</p>
<p>* there's been similar problems with SD Card readers on non-Apple hardwares with both Windows 10 and Anniversary edition, say something about this and how it might affect our issue? In particular, can you suggest any workarounds?</p>
<p>* Say HOW you are prepared to help Apple rectify the issue (or what you have already done)?</p>
<p>* Post any technical assistance that may assist those solving the issue?</p>
<p>* Chase Apple on behalf of affected users</p>
<p>* Actively troubleshoot the issue in a lab</p>
<p>May I request further details please?<br />

<p>Bug ID: 29809345</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Mac Problem</p>
<p>Classification: Serious Bug</p>
<p>Reproducibility: Always</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Title: MacBook Pro Retina Bootcamp USB set address failed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>For over three years now (see date of first post on first link below), a wide range of Macbook users have reported severe problems with the bootcamp SD card driver, we think for a particular Broadcom chipset. The issue got progressively worse with the release
 of Windows 10, and now with the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition (1607 release) the SD Card is inoperable: on boot we receive Set Address Failed (see last link for latest post) and no known workaround exists. Please see the following links for a large variety
 of users posting detailed reports on this issue:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<p>Boot into bootcamp on a Macbook pro Retina (other users have found the problem in Macbook Airs also - see posts) which uses the affected broadcom chipset, running Windows 10 Anniversary Edition. Try to access content stored on an SD Card using the inbuilt
 SD Card reader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expected Results:</p>
<p><span>Device Manager (and an OS-desktop popup) will show "USB Set Address failed" as detailed in
</span><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/31154740#31154740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://discussions.apple.com/message/31154740</a><span> and included in the attached files</span></p>
<p>On a previous version of Windows you may instead suffer the SD card not resuming from sleep or some lesser issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actual Results:</p>
<p>Device manager shows "USB Set Address Failed" and no known workaround is applicable. On older versions of windows you may experience a lesser issue that still renders your SD card unreadable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuration:</p>
<p>See the below configuration of my mac, see also all included forum links for many other hardware configurations where this occurs and the general conclusion that this affects the Broadcom SD-card driver chipset</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hardware Make and Model &amp; OS X Version/Build</p>
<p>Model Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MacBook Pro</p>
<p>&nbsp; Model Identifier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MacBookPro12,1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Card reader: </p>
<p>&nbsp; Product ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x8406</p>
<p>&nbsp; Vendor ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x05ac&nbsp; (Apple Inc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.20</p>
<p>&nbsp; Serial Number:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 000000000820</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS: El Capitan 10.11.6 and Windows 10 Anniversary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<p>See all the links mentioned. Note the number of users affected, the diversity of their hardware, the amount of time that has expired since reports came in and the perceived lack of faith from users in a resolution due to Apple
 and Microsoft (for whom users are both paid customers) not seeking to resolve the issue. Hence I would suggest this is very urgent.</p>

            <p>I pretty much have the exact same issue.</p>
<p>I used to have it on Windows 8.1 and now on Windows 10 (1607).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting the machine solves the problem for me, and the SD card shows up again.</p>
<p>Hibernation also helps (yet today Windows does not want to hibernate, it appears to shut down, but then shows the sign in screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SD card&nbsp;<strong>always</strong> works when used under OSX, so it is not a hardware issue. It is a Windows/driver issue.</p>
<p>The APPLE SD Card Reader USB Device driver is provided by Microsoft, so it's up to Microsoft to fix it, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case this is a prime example of users being left in the cold between using Apple and Microsoft. I thought the cold war was over and we as consumer could feel the joy of using Windows on any hardware we want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointed with the treatment and progress on this issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP Pro Stand By Power Option for Sony Laptop</h2>
                    I just installed Windows XP Pro on my Sony Laptop. I was using XP Home previously and in Home I was able to choose the "Stand By" mode under the power options when I close the lid of my laptop. &nbsp;Now in XP Pro that option no longer appears. &nbsp;How do I get
 my laptop to go into Stand By mode if it does not appear in the pull down screen? &nbsp;Thanks!

            Thanks! &nbsp;All I had to do was go to the Sony eSupport page, put in my laptop model and download the newest ATI Video drivers and utilities. &nbsp;As soon as I rebooted and the ATI video loaded the Radeon&nbsp;Mobil&nbsp;video software and drivers the Standby Option reappeared.
<div><br />
<div>They also had me download and set up other drivers and&nbsp;software&nbsp;to complete my&nbsp;re-install. &nbsp;Thanks again for the advise it was a big help.</div>

<h2>            Empty Alpha-Numeric Folders on Computer&#39;s Hard Drive</h2>
                    Are the empty alpha-numeric folders that I see listed on my computer's C:\ drive a result of Windows Updates that have been installed? &nbsp;An example of how they look is as follows: 369c016802283a3dd703535b093455 &nbsp; &nbsp;If these empty folders are no longer necessary,
 would it be all right to delete them? &nbsp;If they are not related to Windows Updates, could someone explain exactly what they are and if it is safe to delete them?

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Folders with alpha numeric names are typically temporary folders created during Windows Update installations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is safe to delete. Sometimes the temp folders during Windows Update installation don’t get deleted. You may delete or run

<h2>            Restore point fails.</h2>
                    <p>My PC has run into a problem while attempting to install Visual Studio 2017.&nbsp; I was clever and created a system restore point before downloading the VS installer.&nbsp; However, when I attempt a system restore, it won't let me:<br />
<br />
"System Restore did not complete successfully...<br />
Details:<br />
System Restore failed while restoring the directory from the restore point.<br />
Source: AppxStaging<br />
Destination: %Program Files%\WindowsApps<br />
An unspecified error occurred during System Restore.&nbsp; (0x80070091)"<br />
<br />
My only other option is a system reset, which is a tremendous hassle (I already had to do one earlier in the week when trying to install VS 2017).&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
