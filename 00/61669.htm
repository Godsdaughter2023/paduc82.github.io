    <title>Computer won&#39;t sleep if it needs to update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t sleep if it needs to update</h2>
                    <p>This is extremely frustrating issue that I can't seem to do anything about.&nbsp; My computer, whenever microsoft deigns to give us an update for windows 10, will not stay asleep nor go to sleep on its own.&nbsp; I will put it to sleep after I'm done with it for the
 night only to have it wake up on it's own 15 minutes later and continue to wake up each time after.&nbsp; I had done some research into this issue before and it seems the windows task scheduler (I believe) is scheduling "wake up and restarts" due to needing to
 update, but then fails to restart the computer.&nbsp; I can not modify these settings despite me building the comp and being admin and I'd imagine the sleep timer would activate again if it no longer needed to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this: How can I either get the windows task scheduler to restart my computer after it wakes it up for update or simply make my computer stay asleep until I choose to update it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Ian</p>

            Hello Ian, my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to help with your Windows Update problem. 
<br />I suggest that you schedule a time for when it's best that your Windows install updates, outside of the set time shutdowns and restarts proceed normally. 
<br />To schedule a time for Windows to update itself please follow these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Select the "Start button",
<br />2. Then select "Settings"  &gt; "Update &amp; security"  &gt; "Windows Update" . 
<br />3. Select Schedule the restart and choose a time that's convenient for you. 
<br />
<br />A side note: You can set active hours to make sure automatic restarts for updates only happen when you're not using your PC. Learn about active hours for Windows 10
<br />
<br />If the above process doesn't help fix the issue let me know!

    <title>Windows 7 Pro won&#39;t boot, black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> burntoast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro won&#39;t boot, black screen</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I recently procured a video card (XFX Geforce 8800 GTX) from a friend whose computer wouldn't boot Windows past the manufacturer's screen. I tried installing the card on my own computer and it seems that I now have the same problem. Before installing
 the card, I neglected to uninstall my old video drivers.</p>
<p>After installing the card, Windows detected that it could not boot properly, and it allowed me to troubleshoot through the System Restore/Repair options. However, I received an error while using System Restore and could not restore to a previous save point.&nbsp;Then
 I used the System Repair option and it ran for 30~ minutes (while according to the program, it should only have run for a few mins). I became impatient and promptly restarted my PC.</p>
<p>Now I cannot get the System Restore/Repair options to come up again. There is simply a black screen after the PC goes through the manufacturer's (BIOS, etc) screen. I am able to access the BIOS settings and the device boot menu, but&nbsp;repeatedly pressing F8
 to enter Windows Safe Mode does not work.</p>
<p>I've recently installed a new LCD monitor and a USB keyboard to my PC, and I've tried swapping out the monitor for my old CRT one. But that did not fix the black screen issue, and the keyboard works fine in BIOs. I've also tried reinstalling my original
 video cards, but Windows still does not boot.</p>
<p>I have a feeling it has to do with my video drivers, but I don't understand how my old video cards wouldn't work as well. I do not&nbsp;have the original Windows 7 CD and I'm attempting to create a boot disk on a laptop. Is there a way to boot Windows 7 without
 using F8/Safe Mode? Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>How does it feel when you wreck your own installation while trying to help a friend? Been there, done that! A good precaution consists of creating an image before experimenting. You'll find it in the Control Panel / Backup and Restore.</p>
<p>To restore Windows to its previous condition:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Safe Mode Command Prompt" when prompted.<br />
5. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
6. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
7. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
8. Set Windows back to a point before you started experimenting.<br />
9. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

<p>Thank you for the prompt reply, Pegasus. I was actually handed that card for free and could not believe my bad luck when I also experienced issues. :p</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the steps you've outlined did not work for me. What I did was create a working System Recovery Disk and booted it first on my PC. The System Repair option, like earlier, simply runs for an unbelievably long period of time and does not seem
 to do anything. System Restore/Image Recovery both do not work, either. The Memory Diagnostics Tools also fails to run, even when selected to run on restart. The "Safe Mode Command Prompt" is only accessible by pressing F8, yet I'm still unable to access the
 Advanced Boot Options. I am, however, able to access just the cmd prompt through the System Recovery Disk.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note is that the disk fails to find the OS for my computer under System Recovery Options. Upon clicking Load Drivers, I explored through the file prompt a bit, and my C:\ drive is listed as 0 bytes in size and that it needs to be
 formatted in order to be usable.</p>
<p>Edit: I now realize that drives are not listed correctly through the System Recovery Disk. Phew!</p>
<p>My next course of action is to use the cmd prompt in System Recovery to check my hard drives, scan for the OS, and to possibly fix my boot record. I'd appreciate any more help I could get regarding this issue, especially with using the command prompt to
 good effect.</p>

<p>It is normal for the drive letters to be different in Repair Mode as compared to Normal Mode. You often find something like this:<br />
* Drive C: - System Recovery<br />
* Drive D: - Windows System drive<br />
* Drive E: - Data partition (if you have one)<br />
* Drive X: - Repair Mode System partition (this is a RAM disk)</p>
<p>You can run commands such as chkdsk against drive D:.</p>
<p>If you need to recover any non-backed up files then you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work through the Command Prompt while in Repair Mode. </li><li>Boot the machine with an Ubuntu boot CD: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/) and use its GUI to save your files. Note that downloading the Ubuntu CD image of 720 MBytes can take
 a long time. </li></ul>

<p>Hello, I'm back with some bad news. I used the command prompt through the System Recovery Disk and proceeded to scan my C:\ drive (which turns out to be the actual C:\ drive where all my data is stored). Bootrec.exe /ScanOs did not find any OS on my PC.
 I managed to find out that my first hard drive is partitioned and well, but there is no partition for the second hdd. Chkdsk.exe does not work for the C:\ drive, since it's classified as a RAW drive. Specifically, the second hdd is listed as a RAW file system,
 while the first hdd has a partition under NTSC. Both are listed as Online. The two hdds were originally configured as RAID 0 and a single partition.</p>
<p>I think I somehow messed up my second hdd after running into problems installing that video card. I remember shutting down the PC, unplugging the power cord, forgetting to press the power supply's Off switch, and re-plugging the cord - multiple times. I
 also remember seeing a brief flash of light from the back of the power supply when re-plugging that cord. It only occurred to me to turn off the power supply after seeing this flash a few times. Would this short-circuit the computer and wipe a hard drive?
 I've had no issues with these hdds before this problem occurred.</p>
<p>At least this explains why Windows 7 would not load at all. Since the guy I bought this PC from decided to put the hdds in RAID 0, I guess most (if not all) of my data is now lost. I realize that I should have been making backups at least every other day,
 but I wasn't aware of the faulty nature of RAID 0 beforehand. Now I know!</p>
<p>I'm currently trying to find a way to recover my data from my drives if it's possible. Or if, by some miracle, the System Recovery utilities are simply misreading the second hdd as RAW because of a boot record (or some other) error. I've already tried using
 Bootrec.exe /FixMbr and /FixBoot, though.</p>
<p>If there's a way to fix the reading of my second hdd as RAW (in case it actually isn't so), I'd very much appreciate some instructions on how to do this. Meanwhile, I'll be tracking down a hard drive recovery program to see if any data is actually recoverable.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention something interesting (perhaps I'm being too hopeful). Disk 0 was listed as being zero bytes free, which I guess meant it was full on space. I remember having used up about half of the total combined C:\ drive space before. But
 this isn't possible since both hdds are in RAID-0, where all stored data is spread out between the two drives, correct?</p>

<p>
</p><p>5. How have you determined that the computer hardware (e.g., graphics) is fully-compatible with Win10 1703?</p>
<p>

<p>5. "How have you determined that the computer hardware (e.g., graphics) is fully-compatible with Win10 1703?"&nbsp; No way to know for sure.&nbsp; It was fully compatible with V1607 though.</p>
<p>6a. I mean Security Center, not Windows Defender.</p>
<p>6b. I ran msconfig and first ran w/o Start Items and non-MS Services; there were no changes.&nbsp; I then disabled all of the MS services that I know won't keep the system from booting to no avail.</p>
<p>6c. Yes, I run a full scan every week and I manually update them before I run it.</p>
<p>

    <title>using a system image backup &#38; re-activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyh msw7  say:</h3>
<h2>            using a system image backup &#38; re-activation</h2>
                    recently installed 64 bit Windows Home Premium.<br />
<br />
After I got time on a broadband connection to install the Windows updates, I created a system image backup and a system repair disk. I subsequently installed many applications without testing them beyond seeing that they came up and presented themselves properly.
 Some of these required “registration” with publisher supplied serial numbers and/or other data supplied when I purchased them, some required on-line activation.<br />
<br />
Then I found that the registration (enter ID and serial number) had not worked, or had been skipped, on a major component of my most frequently used software. I could not successfully enter it. Uninstalling the program and its plugins, then starting over, doesn’t
 work. The program accepts the registration information, says everything is great, but only runs in trial mode. Even invoking a restore point prior to the first install of the application doesn’t help.<br />
<br />
The possible problems thus seem to be limited to either some unidentified file(s) written somewhere else (i.e. somewhere I can’t find) or something put in the boot sectors. Reformatting the OS partition and using that system image seems like my only possible
 solution (aside from getting another computer and starting over).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I had not thought to Activate Windows until after I made that system image.<br />
-- What difficulties can I expect when I go to activate Windows this time?<br />
-- Is there any way to minimize the problems?<br />
-- What should I read to find out how to use the system image, and either the system repair disk or the original DVD, to perform the restore?<br />
-- Is there anything else I should do to assure success?

<p>Your activation is linked to your hardware. This means that you can restore images any number of times or install Windows as often as you like without running into problems with the activation.</p>
<p>You can use a Repair CD or your installation DVD to launch the image restore process.</p>

            I thought I had how-to-fix information coming, but apparently I was wrong. I need to know before I undertake the project so there is no chance of the problem still being there after I’m done.<br />
<br />
The installation may have put something into the drive’s boot sectors, something that is preventing the registration from working when I reinstall the program.<br />
<br />
Will reformatting the OS partition before I use the system image to reestablish the system, or just reloading the system with the system image, reinitialize the boot sectors to what they "should" be, or must I do something else to get rid of the obnoxious boot
 sector code (assuming there is something there)?

<p>On each and every installation I have performed, allowing the Windows installation process to partition and format the disk resulted in a working copy of Windows.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about this project then you should take into account the amount of time it is going to take and the cost of a new disk. The conclusion might be that replacing the current disk with a new one would be a very cost-effective method to guarantee
 success. The bonus is that your old disk is still available for data retrieval. You could then use the old disk as your backup disk, preferably installed in a USB case.</p>

            I’ve thought about that approach but there are certain difficulties. Aside from the money aspect that made me wait for quite a few years (since 1999) to update the hardware and OS from Win98, there is the Windows Activation hassle because of new hardware.
 I don’t really know anything about that except that there seem to be a great many posts on this forum and some others, about people that have been driven to the edge of sanity trying to get MS to accept re-Activation after making a change in their system.<br />
<br />
My question is not about a working copy of Windows, I already have that without any effort. The difficulty is with the software I’ve used the most for the past ten years, and upon which the work I do is dependent. It will not register and move out of demo mode
 after having been uninstalled once. Maybe because of something written into the boot area to prevent piracy.<br />
<br />
The software will work properly on Win7 (did work at first) but only the first time it is installed. Going backwards on the system files with a restore point leaves something behind that prevents proper registration again. Since the restore point totally replaces
 the registry, that could not be the problem.<br />
<br />
As far as how much effort, it is exhausting. I’ve spent many hours every day for a week trying different things to overcome the problem. Without that software the system is essentially useless to me. I don’t need a better computer than this Win98 system to
 do e-mail and use my word processor.<br />
<br />
So, the disk boot area is a big mystery? I’ve done some searches and found sites talking about repairing boots sectors but these were all dealing with virus attacks and seemed rather vague about what they could do even then. Maybe this company’s protective
 measures would be treated the same way as a boot sector virus, but I have no idea, nor how expensive it would be.<br />
<br />
From my viewpoint the ideal would be for all boot sector data be unconditionally rewritten to a never been used disk. However, I have so far found nothing that even talks about how that comes about to begin with. Is it initialized by the disk manufacturer,
 by the partitioning and formatting, by the OS installation, ... ?<br />
<br />
But thanks for responding. My efforts to gain information on other forums have met only silence.

<p><em>Aside from the money aspect that made me wait for quite a few years (since 1999) to update the hardware and OS from Win98<br />
</em>How much is an hour of your time worth? How much does a 250 GByte disk cost?</p>
<p><em>There is the Windows Activation hassle because of new hardware.<br />
</em>There is no problem with Windows when you replace a disk. It's when you replace the motherboard that you have a problem.<br />

<em>The difficulty is with the software I’ve used the most for the past ten years, and upon which the work I do is dependent. It will not register and move out of demo mode after having been uninstalled once.<br />
</em>Sorry, can't comment on this one. You need to sort this out with the software supplier. It seems insane that you are not allowed to install the software on the one machine any number of times.<br />
<em><br />
Going backwards on the system files with a restore point leaves something behind that prevents proper registration again.<br />
</em>Could be some online registration record.<br />
<em><br />
I don’t need a better computer than this Win98 system to do e-mail and use my word processor.<br />
</em>If it is that much of a hassle then I would stick with my Win98 system for the work-related software.<br />
<em><br />
So, the disk boot area is a big mystery?<br />
</em>I doubt it very much that the company writes data into the boot sector. The risk is far too great that someone else had the same idea and wrote his own details in the same place, causing a nightmare for the support staff.<br />
<em><br />
But thanks for responding. My efforts to gain information on other forums have met only silence.<br />
</em>You're welcome.</p>

<p>It is good to know that there should not be a problem if the hard drive had to be replaced. That isn’t the impression I had gained from a couple of sources. Another hard drive isn’t out of the question but, while this isn’t the place to air my personal difficulties,
 any money spent is a significant problem when one isn’t working and has very few resources. I have a great deal of time on my hands, however, even though I would prefer to spend it more pleasantly.</p>
<p>There is no on-line registration. Serial numbers and ID were e-mail to purchaser's.</p>
<p>However, this is the latest problem.</p>
<p>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/46c7f055-7249-423f-a4dd-e8c0078e4b9e</p>
<p><br />
I agree that not allowing a simple re-installation is ridiculous. Unfortunately the originating software company was bought out by another which doesn’t seem to want anything to do with supporting older versions. Anyway, this situation seems more likely to
 be a Windows 7 issue than originating with the application per se. For instance, Search finds the program name (apparently on reports meant for Microsoft, although I’m not certain) too many layers down<em>... Application Data\Application Data\Application Data\Application
 Data\Application Data\Application Data\ ...</em> for Search to fully display or for me to get to. I found similar long reiterative strings under c:\Users\me\ for a different program’s problem.<br />
<br />
Such places did not exist when the application was written. I’ve also found a few of the program’s files in other places that don’t seem to exist on my win98 system. Something else, that I<em>can’t</em> find, is the most likely cause of the difficulty.</p>
<p>A person on the user forum, associated with the current software owner, who has previously stated that he is prohibited from writing about some aspect of the software’s development and security measures, responded to my inquiry with an ambiguous statement
 that, while he can’t say yes or no about his company, some companies have been know to use the boot sectors for product security measures.</p>
<p>Sony’s well publicized automatic install root kit anti-copying measure a few years ago is probably the most widely know instance. They probably only backed down on that, after worldwide complaints, because their “security” also effected products from other
 producers.</p>

            Hi jackin 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since you are having many issues, I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>

</p><p>Currently, Windows does not have an option to export credentials. Usually, third party browsers like Google Chrome or Firefox can save your password if you signed in. So if you sign-in to that browser again on a different computer, it will sync all of your

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;From the past two days I am facing the problem of sudden screen hangup.I noticed that this is happening when I try to play flash game.Upon restart Windows notified me saying that You have a blue screen problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am having the dump file which is created upon this problem.I wish I could attach here but I see that I don't have a chance to attach it.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but I never faced this issue earlier, I strongly feel that after recent update of flash player and while I am playing the flash game the whole screen hangs up and I had to restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue of Blue Screen came only when I was playing <strong>Flash game</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I try removing flash player and install an older version of it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>Not sure if it has ever run right, as didn't use it until school. First got it and had school program installed and it&nbsp;would blue screen at start up or occasionally while running program. Uninstalled and still getting blue screen at log-in almost always.
 What can I do??&nbsp;Can't find these&nbsp;error codes to make sense of them.&nbsp;New system bought for school, and now this. Updates automatically and have Microsoft Security Essentials installed.</p>
<p>I write down the error code, and then roboot and it comes back on. Usually gives option to run in safe mode at that point, but no more blue screen.</p>

<p><span>Hi MrFr3drik,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have multiple sound cards installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 it a wired headphone or a Bluetooth head phone?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you trying to connect the headphone through Sound card or USB port?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may try to download the latest audio drivers from the manufacturer’s website and uninstall the drivers from device manager
 and reinstall the latest drivers for your sound card to check if it helps you fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While uninstalling the drivers from the device manager make sure you follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click on Start.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Access Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Hardware &gt; Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Open Device Manager and expand Sound, Video and Game controller.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Right click on the device and uninstall the device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While uninstalling the device, make sure you place a check mark against "Delete the driver software for this
 device".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After reinstalling the audio drivers check if you can set the headphone as default.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Newb Question - Should I Buy&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I generally do not like games that have no co-op or multiplayer of any kind but this game I have heard allot of good things about and is now only $20 brand new! I am just wondering how many hours of gameplay to beat main storyline and how many hours to do
 everything in game. Since it is an RPG I am guessing quite a bit of playtime can be gotten out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also are the 2 DLC worht buying? I will proablly not need them for a while as the game itself will last me quite some time I am just wondering for the future.</p>

<p>My first character has done most of the main story line and most of the side quests, plus the Dead Money DLC and has so far registered over 100 hours of game time. &nbsp;The main story can be completed in multiple ways, which adds replay value as you'll have
 to play the full game more than once in order to achieve the various endings. &nbsp;Second and subsequent characters should be quicker since you'll already know where most things are, but should still be good for quite a few hours of gaming. &nbsp;In total I spent about
 400 hours of game time playing 3 different characters in FO3, and expect to put in a similar amount of time on this one.</p>
<p>Dead Money can be frustrating at times, but is definitely worth the money. &nbsp;I can't comment on Honest Hearts as I have not played it yet. &nbsp;There are three more add-ons still to come planned for release over the next few months (1 per month, I think).</p>

<p>Yes, you can change the difficulty setting, though the game is not terribly difficult on normal. &nbsp;I haven't tried it myself, so I'm not sure how many settings NV has. &nbsp;If you are not used to playing this kind of game then I would definitely recommend you
 choose casual (vs hardcore) when you are prompted.</p>

<p>hands down yes. Id be satisfied with paying $60 for it, and i got it for 20. I sitll havent beat my first play through because I get side tracked with all the stuff I can do! PLUS I still have FO3 to play (which I got for $20) with all the dlc that came
 with the GOTY edition....</p>
<p>so so much to do this summer. =P</p>

<p>You might want to consider setting NV aside and playing the heck out of FO3 first. &nbsp;That way by the time you are ready to get back into NV more of the DLC should be ready. &nbsp;Never know, one of the ones that hasn't come out yet may have some game-changing
 goodies, not to mention the fact that every add-on for NV will add 5 levels to the cap.</p>

<p>That's probably somethiong of a loaded questiojn on these forums, but I'll try &amp; be as fair as I can.&nbsp; I prefer it vastly more to
<em>Fallout 3.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The game can be as in depth as you make it,&nbsp; If you go straight through with the storylines I imagine you could argueably finish the game by anywhere between levels 10 to 14 possibly less depending on what you do &amp; don't.&nbsp; I only have
 the Dead Money DLC at the moment &amp; it's a bit of a different take then the main game, more survival based.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advice that I'd give, save often &amp; have more then 1 save.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strengths of FNV</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to make things (<em>general aid items &amp; ammo</em>). </li><li>Karma isn't a blanket thing like in Fallout 3.&nbsp; One of the things that annoyed me in F3 was that if you were good you were known as good everywhere &amp; vice versa, even in places you've never been to before.&nbsp; In FNV just 'cause you might be liked in Goodsprings,
 doesn't necessarily mean you'll ne liked in Novac or by the NCR, etc.&nbsp; </li><li>Lot's to explore. </li><li>Enemes don't level with you, this annoyed me in Fallout 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p><strong>Weaknesses of FNV</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Glitchy/buggy.&nbsp; Prone to freezes once a savefile got over a certain size, typically over 4MB.&nbsp; the current patch (1.05) seems to be doing tis job though.&nbsp;
</li><li>Music was more varied in Fallout 3.&nbsp; </li><li>No Bobbleheads, I liked those in <em>Fallout 3</em> since they actually game you things (<em>either improved STATS or skills permanently</em>).
</li><li>They didn't go far enough with making things.&nbsp; I'd have adored to actually be able to make &amp; sell armor.&nbsp;
</li></ul>

<p>Absolutely, get the game, Idk about doing all of FO3 first like someone suggested, this game is expansive even w/o DLC. &nbsp;I got waaaay more than the 40 i payed for it out of it with no DLC.</p>
<p>My take on FO3 vs FO:NV:</p>
<p>Fallout 3 focus is on Karma (bad or good karma determines some side quests you can do, what areas you can go to, who hunts you periodically), is set in a ruined city setting, and, for the most part, you help the same people do the same thing at the end no
 matter what. &nbsp;The only variation in ending is a decision you make in the last 2 minutes of the game. &nbsp;Unlike FO:NV, you were able to craft custom weapons, some of which were pretty imaginative.</p>
<p>Fallout NV focus is on Reputation (things you do against a group of people can impact their reaction to you in numerous ways, even get you "shoot on sight" status or even hunted while out in the wastes), is set in a desert with the ruins of las vegas in
 the center (and as such, you can gamble in the casinos and such), and has 4 different endings, some with multiple paths to get there. &nbsp;You can feel an impact of your even early game decisions late into the game if you angered the wrong people. &nbsp;There are 8
 recruitable companions, each with a story to them, and quests you can do to help them with their personal affairs.&nbsp; What you do for them, and what you do in the process of some of the other quests in the game, will give closure and show subendings to said
 quests/people after the game is over.&nbsp; There is a hardcore setting in which you need to eat, drink, and sleep periodically to stay alive, companions can die permanently, health from stimpacks comes back gradually instead of instantly, and ammunition takes
 up inventory weight.</p>
<p>I personally enjoyed the NV story and ending(s) much more than FO3.</p>
<p>NV is buggy, but if you DL the update and keep autosaves on you'll be ok. &nbsp;I only had some freezes closer to the end of my playthrough.</p>

            <div>Hello Vidyashree,</div>
<div>In answer to your questions,</div>
<div>1. I am running Microsoft Windows Defender and do not have any third party Antivirus installed.</div>
<div>2. I am trying to sync the Microsoft Mail App with my Microsoft Outlook.com account - this has been working for the past several months.</div>
<div>
<p>3. What is the path to the Packages Folder.&nbsp; It is not showing up in the file explorer file.&nbsp; (Edit: I just found the Packages folder under the administrator account and the microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe folder is there, however the app
 is not appearing on the windows menu.)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I had a similar problem at the end of May and was able to recover from it by creating a new user profile.&nbsp; However I don't want to keep creating new profiles ever month or so, there must be a better solution.</div>
<div>Thanks for you help.</div>

<h2>            Atheros AR5007EG Wi-Fi adapter does not work after upgrade to Windows10</h2>
                    <p>After a couple of days trying I finally got my Toshiba Satellite 305 to update from Windows 8.1 pro 34x (upgraded from Vista) to Windows 10 in the latest phase of the roll out.&nbsp; Now my Atheros Wi-Fi adapter and Intel Display adapters do not work.&nbsp; I would
 rather have been told my hardware was not compatible yet and waited.&nbsp; Now I have a laptop that does not have working Wi-Fi and a display stuck in one mode and is functionally useless.&nbsp; Luckily, this is my back up laptop, due to issues with updates to the same
 Wi-Fi adapter in Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When can we expect working drivers for this hardware?</p>

</p><p><span>Since this issue has occurred after the upgrade to Windows 10, I suggest you to try the troubleshooting steps mentioned in the below article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Uninstall your network driver and try installing latest driver from the manufacturer’s website.

            <p>Thank you for the prompt reply, however having taken two days to get the laptop to even install the Win10 upgrade due to unknown issues, I realized I have run out of patience and so rolled back the update and went back to 8.1 for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manufacturer of both the PC (Samsung) and of the adapter (Qualcomm Atheros) were my first checks do not have any updates available.&nbsp; I will wait for the development teams to fix this issue and reinstall Win10 then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with the display cured with the first update run once I was able to find a cable to plug the laptop in to the net, luckily it was old enough to have a LAN plug.

            <p>I have the same old Toshiba Satellite. It was purchased with Windows Vista, and later upgraded to Windows 7 (both 32 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just ran a Windows 10 upgrade, and have exact same issue with my wi-fi adaptor. It does not work, and when I get into Control Panel -&gt; Device Manager, I see that the Atheros ar5007eg adaptor has a yellow 'problem' mark. When I get into its properties,
 the problem listed is 'Driver may be corrupted'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling it and rebooting. Windows still finds the same driver, reinstalls it with the same problem, and wi-fi still does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling the driver and installing the latest Windows 8 driver from Atheros support website. This caused BSOD on startup. Yeah, it's a new and friendly W10 BSOD with a smile, but it is still a BSOD. It gets computer into an infinite loop
 of reboots followed by BSOD followed by reboot, ad nauseam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I had to roll the computer back to W7. Everything works fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know when a working solution for this network adapter is available, because I would really like to bring all my home computers up to the same OS.</p>

            Well, I disabled the adapter and uninstalled it, but every time the computer restarted automatically loaded and installed it again (this stopped the upgrade): therefore I erased it (used the lan wire instead, during the upgrade). &nbsp;<br />
I managed to upgrade to windows 10 and the Atheros card works perfectly now.

            Tried again today on the side while doing other stuff.&nbsp; Once again the Atheros adapter will not property set up and the laptop has no working wifi as a result. Rolling back to Win 8.1 as in the current age, a laptop without wifi is a paperweight.

            <p>Whoever has this problem with wifi adapter: do not roll back to Windows 8 or 7--there is a simple solution. The problem with the adapter is most likely in the file that conflicts with Windows 10. Try this solution first, and if that does not help roll back
 to previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>Connect your computer to the Internet by Ethernet cable. In Device Manager (right click on Start button -&gt; Device Manager), right click on wifi adapter -&gt; Uninstall. In the confirmation window, make sure "Delete the driver software for this device" is checked
 (if available) before clicking OK. Click OK. In the main window of Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes. The adapter should reappear. Double-click on it, and click Update Driver in the Driver section. Select the first option "Search automatically."
 This will search through drivers that came with Windows 10 as well as Microsoft website (through your Ethernet cable). Currently, the unofficial Czech driver website does not have drivers compatible with Windows 10 for Atheros wifi adapters, but Microsoft
 does. Those from Microsoft work well with Atheros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please come back and write some feedback here if this solution worked or not.</p>

            <p>Sergei, The process you are describing is exactly what I attempted and the drivers either installed but the adapter did not function, despite Windows saying the device was "working properly", or the driver install failed on a time out error.&nbsp; Of course everything
 looks fine until the ethernet cable is detached but in all cases no wifi in Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both the internal MS drivers and the latest drivers that can be downloaded from the web - In all cases: No joy.</p>

                    <div>When selecting items on the desktop,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;simple white outlined box. I remember it being a blue transparent box. I'm no longer sure is it blue??? Selecting items though file explorer gives a bluish box. How can I change it back to normal?</div>
<p>
</p><p>When selecting with the pointer, I get the following white outlined box:</p>

    <title>Devices not accessible after Windows 1809 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j60  say:</h3>
<h2>            Devices not accessible after Windows 1809 update</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 1809 update installed on my Dell desktop PC (Inspiron 3847) on 27 December 2018.</p>
<p>I now see the message on taskbar "No Audio output device is installed" and no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On checking the Device Manager, four (4) listed devices show warning symbols -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sound, Video &amp; Game controllers -&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA High Definition Audio</li><li>Realtek High Definition Audio</li></ul>
<p>Imaging Devices -</p>
<ul>
<li>HP Officejet Pro 8620 (NET) (Printer no longer accessible to print).</li><li>Logitech QuickCam Exrpess/Go</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the Properties view in Device Manager for each of the above devices and the following message shows:</p>
<p><strong>"Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)</strong></p>
<p><strong>{Bad Image}</strong></p>
<p><strong>%hs is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status 0x"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the NVIDIA, Realtek and HP Officejet Pro drivers using the Device Manager Update Driver button and receive the message
<strong>"</strong><strong>The best drivers for your device are already installed".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice will be appreciated, thanks.</p>

            Hi J60... in device manager see if you can rollback the driver by right clicking the device and going to properties.
<br />Also, go to the manufacturers website for your device and download the drivers and see if that will work.

</p><p>The error message <span><strong>The non-volatile variable storage is about full</strong> is warning that your device storage is almost full.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For us to troubleshoot your concern, please provide the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your device?</span></li><li><span>What is the error when you connect your keyboard?</span></li><li><span>What operating system is your device running on? Please include the build version.</span></li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your device is running on the Windows 10 operating system and presuming that you are able to continue to Windows, you can clear the temporary files on your device by going to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>
Change how we free up space</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Since you are also using a tablet computer, I recommend that you get in touch with the device's manufacturer and ask if there is an option to increase the storage space on your device.</p>
