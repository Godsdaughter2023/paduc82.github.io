<h2>            Macro code for column width - can I pick up column width from a formula&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am coding a macro.&nbsp; I know I can set column width by code "Selection.ColumnWidth = 6".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have 3 columns, all of which are auto-sized, one is width 8, one 9, and one 9.5, I want all 3 as 9.75.&nbsp; I can write a formula that says =CELL("WIDTH",E1) to determine the width of D1 as 8, E1 as 9, and F1 as 10 ("width" determines in whole numbers),
 and then use a MAX formula to determine which is the biggest.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to combine code in VisualBasic "Selection.ColumnWidth = 6" with my oracle formula "=MAX(CELL("width",D1),CELL("width",E1),CELL("width",F1))" ?</p>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a selected set of columns this will set the column width to the widest in the selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub col_width()<br />
Dim c As Range, r As Double<br />
r = 0<br />
For Each c In Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If c.ColumnWidth &gt; r Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r = c.ColumnWidth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Next<br />
Selection.ColumnWidth = r<br />
End Sub<br />

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e2e2d114-8227-49b2-a6bf-4f96b5caede1" title="WayneLyall">
<p>
</p><p>In Skype for Windows 10, there is no option to configure the audio setting. Skype for Windows 10 will always use the default audio device of your computer, if the&nbsp;Logitech C270 is not set up as the default audio of your computer then Skype for Windows 10
 will not detect it as the audio device to be used in Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I can suggest is for you to install and use <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-windows/downloading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Windows Desktop(classic version)</a>, therefore you will have&nbsp;an option to configure your audio setting in Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. Thank you!

<h2>            Unable to install Windows 10 Technical preview</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to run win10 for 5 days now. for some reason it keeps removing my ACHI drivers and I have to repeatedly do a refresh, because automatic repair always fails after running for about 20 minutes. most for the time it doesn't recognize my install
 flash drive, even though I can do a reinstall with it. I know that this is a work in progress but this should be simple things to fix.</p>

            Hi John,
<div><br />
Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
Just a few questions to get a clear picture of this issue:<br />
1. What is the make and model of your computer?</div>
<div>2. Do you see any error code/message when you try to install the Operating system on the computer?</div>
<div>3. Are you trying to do a upgrade or a clean installation? Which Build of Windows 10 Technical Preview&nbsp;are you trying&nbsp;install on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the below link and check whether the computer matches the system requirements for the new Operating system.</div>
<div><strong>Before you install Windows Technical Preview</strong> </div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the methods below and check if it works</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>Once you install the Operating system try installing AHCI drivers from Intel and update the latest BIOS and chipset drivers from the manufacturer's website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. <br />
Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Upgrade to the latest Build 9879 On Windows 10 Technical preview which has major bug fixes.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the Wiki article by Andre Da Costa on <strong>How to: 10 Tips before installing the latest Windows 10 build</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_tp-windows_install/how-to-10-tips-before-installing-the-latest/4fbec413-fed4-4a18-b1de-399a2d1e2a3a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_tp-windows_install/how-to-10-tips-before-installing-the-latest/4fbec413-fed4-4a18-b1de-399a2d1e2a3a</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disable your Antivirus utility before attempting the upgrade.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>If you are running a third party Antivirus utility, uninstall it. Because Windows 10 is still in development, this can have adverse effects on the success of the installation. If you are using the built in Antivirus utility, Windows Defender, go
 to the settings of the program and disable it. Please remember to re-enable Windows Defender after installation is complete.
<br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>ISO files of the November Update (build 9879) are now available for download.</div>
<div><strong>Download Windows Technical Preview November Update </strong><br />

<p>Hope this helps. If the issue persists please provide required information and we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Show more than one category color when sorting by category</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some users that are using Outlook i the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several (7-10)&nbsp;users opening the same Exchange mailbox as default.</li><li>All mails are sorted by category</li><li>An e-mail often has more than one category (for example "Claims" + "The name of&nbsp;the user&nbsp;responsible for this claim")</li><li>When a user is done with a mail it is put into an appropriate subfolder.</li></ul>
<p>That way&nbsp;we can easily see how many unfinished claims we have going and we can also see how many other unfinished&nbsp;mails (with other categories) a&nbsp;user has directly in the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But we have run into a Little annoyance. When the mails are sorted by category it seems we cannot see several category colors in the mail list view. If we open the mail we can see all the different category colors assigned to this mail.&nbsp; It is also worth
 a note that if we change the sorting to be by date for example. Then several category colors are shown in the mail list view (like we want).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems to only be an issue in the mail list view when sorting by category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with some bright ideas / help for this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Dan Nielsen</p>

<h2>            Content types not working with documents that have document protection turned on</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up templates for project pages. In these project pages we have document libraries that have content types. I have set up plenty with no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving forward however, we will have to have the documents with document protection turned on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up one of these documents as a content type but when I try to create a new document I get two error messages. The first reads:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sorry, Word Online can't open this document for editing because it has document protection enabled for one or more sections. To edit this document, please open it in Microsoft Word." With the options to "Edit in Word" or "Open in Reading View".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select "Edit in Word" the next &nbsp;error message is "We're sorry, we can't open Document because we found a problem with its contents."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document opens just fine otherwise in SharePoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tameka,</p>
<p>

<p>I recently purchased Microsoft Wireless Mouse 4000 for my Laptop DELL Latitude E6410. The laptop came with the default pointing device config application. I do not have Microsoft Intellipoint software. I have Win7 64 bit.</p>
<p>Here are the problems with the scroll wheel that I noticed when I bought Microsoft Wirelss Mouse 4000</p>
<p>o) The scroll wheel does not scroll through the combobox items when the combo is NOT dropped down but has the input focus.</p>
<p>e.g. Control Panel -&gt; Mouse -&gt; Pointers -&gt; "Schemes" combobox.</p>
<p>o) The scroll wheel does not scroll the ribbon of MS Office 2007.</p>
<p>o) In Word 2007 the Ctrl+Scroll wheel does not zoom in out</p>
<p>o) The scroll wheel does not scroll the XML Notepad 2007</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>This solution is not mine - it was there on internet already.</p>
<p>It worked for me.</p>
<p>I am posting this with additional steps for 'how to get there'</p>
<p>Go to Mouse Properties -&gt; Hardware tab</p>
<p>Select the problematic mouse from the list "HID-compliant mouse"</p>
<p>Click "Properties"</p>
<p>Go to Details tab</p>
<p>Select the "Device Instance Path" from the combobox.</p>
<p>A value will be displayed e.g.: <strong><em>HID\VID_045E&amp;PID_0745&amp;MI_01&amp;COL01\8&amp;5538EC&amp;0&amp;0000</em></strong></p>
<p>Note this value.</p>
<p>Open registry editor and navigate to:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\<strong><em>HID\VID_045E&amp;PID_0745&amp;MI_01&amp;Col01\8&amp;5538ec&amp;0&amp;0000</em></strong>\Device Parameters</p>
<p>The "Device Instance Path" is the path of the reg key that corresponds to this instance of the mouse.</p>
<p>In the Device Parameters, add the following DWORD (32 bit) reg keys</p>
<p>HScrollHighResolutionDisable = 1</p>
<p>VScrollHighResolutionDisable = 1</p>
<p>Delta = 120 (decimal)</p>
<p>Remove the transreceiver and put it back (this kind of re-initializes the driver). You can choose to restart the PC, too - whatever.</p>
<p>This should work.</p>
<p>Initially I had not put the "Delta" key. But because of that it was scrolling as if I pressed the "Home" and "End" keys i.e. either all the way down or all the way up. After putting the "Delta" key, it worked.</p>

<p>Hi Tylerdaniels,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would advise you to use <a href="http://www.comms.ovi.com/m/p/ovi/suite/English" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite</a> to retrieve the text messages. You'll need to connect your phone to Nokia Suite and import the text messages by following the instructions on
<a href="http://support.ovi.com/osc/en_GB/service/ovi_on_your_computer/howto/support-suite-manage-your-text-messages.dita#articlesupport-suite-manage-your-text-messages-export-and-import-messages.dita" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>To follow what <font color="#ff9900"><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/473180A9-937C-412E-A3E3-8A1027FA6A6D"><font color="#ff9900">Puigchild</font></a></strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;has suggested, it will be difficult for you
 to connect the phone to PC in the PC Suite mode in absence of the display visibility, unless you have set the default connection in this mode. What you may try is as soon as you connect the phone to PC thru' USB press the centre of the Navigation key (..as
 if you are selecting something in the Menu). Ususlly the PC Suite mode option is highlighted when the phone is connected and hence even if you can't see anything in display the phone should get connected. If this doesn't work disconnect and reconnect the phone
 and this time press the Down navigation key once and then press the Centre..You may repeat this with Twice down and Trice down as most probbly there are 4 ptions available for connection mode..and atleast ONE will get thru' the correct one ...</p>
<p>Hope you are successfull connecting the phone and retriving the important data...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a precaution in future, always set the default connection mode to PC Suite so that in such evantuality,the phone can be connected to PC without problem..&nbsp;</p>

<div>Yes, it is called an academic license. See: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/education/license/howtobuy/eligible.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac not saving contacts</h2>
                    I have Outlook 2016 for Mac running on OS X El Capitan. When I 'save' a contact card direct from a received email address,it is not showing in the address book. What gives?

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way you understand is correct: double click the sender's email address&gt; select contact card&gt; save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b24f736d-3100-4135-a6c8-712083213309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b24f736d-3100-4135-a6c8-712083213309" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you mean you don't have this icon? Can you see it and save contact before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Outlook client latest version has been released and I have tested the function runs well there, I suggest that you update your Outlook client to the latest version 15.33(170409) to see if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Vanessa</p>

<p>Sincerely, I can do much more than this. I put my usb drive with win 10 in the pc in 5 minutes after the error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, when I put the usb flash drive into pc, it shows like this :&nbsp;</p>

 when I enter F1 , it doesn’t change a thing, it comes back to the same page. When I press F8 the windos is refreshing ( like 0.1s black screen ) . F9 , it shows me like Automatic Repair, loading, then again back at this menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what can I do ?</p>

                    <p>Original Title: people and contacts</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently been browsing through my delete items folder and noticed that there was a name of a contact i ad deleted a while ago,in a red title. this had not been there before as i always thoroughly empty the deleted files folder so i don't know how
 it spontaneously ended up there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i then went on to click on the file and it said i cannot open it unless i restore it to its original location. what does this mean? once i opened the file,it had no text to display. why was it there if the contact had been deleted all the way back in november
 2015. also,when i delete contacts from my people folder,i never see them appear in the deleted contacts folder along with other files such as emails etc? will this contact be notified of my deleting him even tho i only have an contact number and no email address
 for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i permanently delete a contact and what does purge contact mean? does outlook automatically send emails in my contact list to join me on skype? i don't want this to happen</p>

<h2>            I accidently registered Office 2013 with the wrong microsoft account.  Is there someway to get this fixed&#63;</h2>
                    I had to create Microsoft accounts for all of our employees upgrading to Office Home and Business 2013. &nbsp;When we activated a few of the licenses, they got registered under the wrong email address due to some cached log ins in chrome. &nbsp;I had contacted support,
 but they said it couldn't be done due to the MSA being email validated. &nbsp;Well of course they have been I had to when I created them. &nbsp;The support tech could not understand why this was such an issue, but i suspect the strong language barrier had something
 to do with it. &nbsp; Now I have one account with 3 Office licenses attached and two office licenses attached to the wrong emails. &nbsp;This wouldn't be that big of a deal with 2010 and before, but with the added integration with skydrive and the office apps online
 this greatly reduces the functionality of the product. &nbsp;Two of the licenses were upgrades from 2010, the updated software has not been installed yet. &nbsp;The other that is registered in the wrong name is only installed on one machine and the end user is logged
 into his skydrive and everything is working well, except for the fact that if he ever needed to use the online apps he would not have access under his username.
<div><br />

<div>Any help is most appreciated! &nbsp;This is very frustrating. &nbsp;It doesn't seem like this should be that difficult.</div>

<h2>            MS Outlook 15.35 Mac&#58; Open next message after delete</h2>
                    <p>I have a Mac running 10.12.5 (Sierra) and Outlook 15.35 for the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While viewing a message in full screen mode, I would like to be able to delete that message and have the next message pop up in it's place. On a PC, this is easily solved using: File / Options / "After moving or deleting..."&nbsp; On the Mac, no such option exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched this forum and looked through all 240 Outlook plug-ins in the Office Store, but no luck.&nbsp; Any brilliant ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for your quick reply Barry!&nbsp; It's not a huge deal as the workaround is to simply:</p>
<p>1. Press CMD + DELETE {to delete the current message and close the window}</p>
<p>2. Press ENTER {To open the next message in a new window}</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was thinking about a single hotkey workaround. I wrote some applescript in Automater, and I was planning to assign it to a hotkey. Here's what I wrote. It ain't working (in or out of Outlook) but this is probably the wrong forum to get the fix!</p>
<p>
</p><p>on run {input, parameters}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;tell application "System Events"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;keystroke (delete using(command down))<br />

    <title>Finally successful 1520 to Windows 10 Moblie &#40;How to don&#39;t try - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artboy714  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finally successful 1520 to Windows 10 Moblie &#40;How to don&#39;t try at home&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I want to give some feedback here, share my experience and ask for a solution to the issue of having significant difficulty with the 1520 to get into the rings and also from reset to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working with my 1520 (as a hobby) for about 3 years.&nbsp; I have and have had other Windows phones but this one is my favorite one because I can see it easily without my glasses on which is helpful to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I started down the road from 8.1 on this device in February or maybe January.&nbsp; I first went for the preview ring.&nbsp; I had significant issues getting it to go into the preview ring but once there ran flawlessly (mostly) for about 3 months.&nbsp; Then in May
 I bumped it up to the slow ring.&nbsp; Again, significant issues during the update process.&nbsp; It actually took the better part of two weekends to go back down to 8.1 and then get it up to 10 again.&nbsp; I tried all sorts of things to get it to go and developed a drinking
 game where I get a shot every time the phone reboots.&nbsp; It didn't work, but I felt better.&nbsp; I got it running.&nbsp; Then I had a problem with Bluetooth functions (not the phone's fault I learned) in July and I decided to go back down to 8.1 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In mid July I decided to give the retail version a try since it was showing "ready" on the upgrade advisor.&nbsp; However, I&nbsp;experienced many frustrating hours of bootlooping and a few bricks thrown in for good measure.&nbsp; I honestly thought I was defeated until
 today.&nbsp; I have read many pages of people asking for help and the "answered" posts leaving the "asker" with very little to go on and people chiming in on the answered question asking for help to deaf ears.&nbsp; If the phone throws an error code at me, it goes nowhere
 and offers no pointers.&nbsp; FYI - for the retail upgrade the phone could easily say "I'm hot and tired" instead of 0x80070002...not helpful.&nbsp; The first hit Cortana will pull on it is a Vista or XP error.&nbsp; The regular joe will open that page, think he's reading
 a tax form and fall asleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here is how I did it.&nbsp; I spent 3 hours last night doing the same old grind.&nbsp; Rename, reset, plug in, update, wait, dump the bloatware, download, watch gears.&nbsp; I wasn't getting anywhere as usual.&nbsp; However, I became concerned with another computer overheating
 recently because of a broken processor cooler giving kernel-power errors and such and the temp of the 1520 during these trials has been concerning.&nbsp; I walked away from the phone for a while to watch something on TV and came back to it.&nbsp; I had left it shut
 down but still ready to start up the process again once I turned it on and this time it seemed to move further along in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I thought, this is a backup&nbsp;dev phone, I'm going to get a little funky with it.&nbsp; I got home from work today, ran through the usual series of events to get ready for the download, brought out a&nbsp;bucket of ice, a can of canned air and a fan.&nbsp; I have pictures.&nbsp;
 I can report that providing additional air conditioning to the phone brought my first success after weeks of effort.&nbsp; I was able to keep the phone around room temp by keeping the phone cold.&nbsp; I was concerned that the upgrade took about 25 minutes.&nbsp; It normally
 takes about that long and the phone is very hot, but there were periods where the gears were turning and it looked like it was going to lock up again and reboot, but it did not.&nbsp; I kept the over the bucket of ice, with the fan on it and if I felt it was going
 to get too hot I used the air and shook the can to chill it and then set it down by the phone because it was freezing. Done! Finally. "It was worth the wait."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this shouldn't be that hard.&nbsp; It shouldn't take weeks to MacGyver a solution.&nbsp; Granted, MS is breathing life into a phone I have had for 3 years, but certainly there is a way to give the phone a&nbsp;"breather" during the upgrade/update process so that it
 doesn't overheat so bad.&nbsp; And, I believe that there should be a way to set up recovery so that I don't have to flash back to 8.1 only to go through this process again.&nbsp; Next time I'll try the freezer!&nbsp; I also believe that there needs to be a better way to
 run error codes through edge so that I'm getting better info without digging so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, I know that&nbsp;nobody will back this method up, that many people are going to read this and electrocute themselves with the phone in the fridge, but can you guys please figure out a way to cool this thing down during this process&nbsp;without me having
 to Mr. Wizard the thing?&nbsp; There are plenty of other people stuck in bootloops during this process to read about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a great phone.&nbsp; Don't dump this down to a discussion.&nbsp; I know you will, but somebody pass this along and fix it.&nbsp; I've run this phone in 10 twice and it was running great.&nbsp; Upgrading sucks and we'll have to do it again someday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I made the mistake of recommending a 1520 to a friend of mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, for the past two months, seemingly every single time there's a major Windows 10 update, he has to bring his phone to me because it got ridiculously hot during install and got stuck in&nbsp;a boot loop and frowny-faced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time, I have had to run Device Recovery to put it back to 8 (losing all his files of course, which thankfully he hasn't been too bitter about), then upgrade it to 10 while propping it up in front of a little desk fan to keep it cool long enough to
 finish the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm actually doing it right now. Again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, it looks like you also discovered this same lovely little feature of the 1520.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two other friends with 1520s. Heaven help me if they decide to upgrade.</p>

<p>What you don't realize is that a scan that's been paused is basically useless, since this doesn't allow the antimalware application to perform the entire scan within a single session, which Is required in order to insure context for any active malware that
 might be present as it can change states during the pause.&nbsp; My first discussion of this occurred with the developer of a 3rd-party security application several years ago, when he explained this same issue to several of his customers asking the same basic question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact you've just indicated that you understand the custom scan is present, which though it has the same basic problems as the full scan, can be used to appropriately work around this problem by simply selecting smaller chunks to scan which can be completed
 within the time available.&nbsp; It may take some experimentation to find the most effective groupings of files, but typically once you do these remain fairly consistent over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most basic confusion that consumers have with scanning for malware though is that there's anything especially useful about a full scan, since in fact these are far more error prone and less targeted than the quick scan, which is specifically designed
 to target the files, registry and other items&nbsp;where existing malware are known to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lead developers of Windows Defender, Microsoft Security Essentials and the Microsoft antimalware engines upon which these are based had told me personally&nbsp;that a full scan was only considered useful when either malware had already been detected or was
 suspected.&nbsp; This is because the quick scan would already have found anything actively operating, so all the full scan actually does is find&nbsp;possible&nbsp;inactive leftovers such as installers or 'droppers', which may have been left behind either during initial
 installation or after the malware had been operating for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this all means is that a full scan is often rife with false positive detections, which though they may be the remnants of actual malware, are often incapable of re-infecting since they contain items like scripts or compressed packages that can only
 be activated during a session of web browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chance that a full scan might discover a malware&nbsp;executable that was missed&nbsp;during download due to no definition having been available is very small and would be detected by Defender's real-time protection when the file is&nbsp;next encountered.&nbsp; In fact,
 Windows 10 Defender real-time&nbsp;automatically scans all files not recently scanned as you browse into a new folder with Windows Explorer or any other file manager, so it should typically find any malware before you'd even have a chance to attempt to execute
 the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason many consumer PC users don't understand why manual scanning isn't really needed at all anymore is that they aren't aware of how the improvements in Windows itself have gained from the corresponding improvements in the processors and additional
 memory required.&nbsp; For example, Windows 8/10 both&nbsp;require processors with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/paenxsse2-support-requirement-guide-for-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PAE/NX/SSE2 support</a>&nbsp;since along with other built-in Windows security features like DEP and ASLR, Defender is one of the applications that uses the SSE2 instruction set to improve performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unlike in the past when the PC user often needed to either manually scan recently downloaded files before opening or perform other relatively obsessive compulsive activities in order to remain protected, the modern security applications typically do all
 of this in the background.&nbsp; That wasn't always true as recently as Windows 7, since both the processing power of the systems as well as the sophistication of the security applications themselves were far less capable, though over time even some of these have
 added many of the improvements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the technology has advanced so far and fast that even most relatively knowledgeable PC users aren't aware how any of this works.&nbsp; I'm only aware because I was a Microsoft MVP during the years that Windows Live OneCare and the later MSE
 and Defender products were being created and so had direct access to the lead developers and others responsible for these, as well as read every Microsoft&nbsp;article about them available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even do full scans anymore unless I've been purposefully browsing the web in a dangerous manner and so wish to confirm that nothing got past the more advanced security settings I use along&nbsp;with Defender.&nbsp; Back in the early days of antivirus I religiously
 manually&nbsp;scanned almost daily, but now allow the automatic quick scan to&nbsp;take care of that along with the real-time components that do the real job continuously.</p>

</p><p><em>In previous Windows 10 feature update rollouts, the update installation was automatically initiated on a device once our data gave us confidence that device would have a great update experience.&nbsp;
<strong>Beginning with the Windows 10 May 2019 Update</strong>, users will be more in control of initiating the feature OS update.&nbsp; We will provide notification that an update is available and recommended based on our data, but it will be largely up to the
 user to initiate when the update occurs.&nbsp; When Windows 10 devices are at, or will soon reach, end of service, Windows update will continue to automatically initiate a feature update; keeping machines supported and receiving monthly updates is critical to device
 security and ecosystem health.&nbsp; We are adding new features that will empower users with control and transparency around when updates are installed. In fact, all customers will now have the ability to explicitly choose if they want to update their device when
 they “check for updates” or to pause updates for up to 35 days. </em></p>

<p>I think this is the new process to get the May update as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Windows 10 May 2019 Update rollout approach</strong></em></p>
<p><br />
<em>The May 2019 Update will start to be available next week in Release Preview. We will rollout the production-quality Release Preview in phases for early adopters through the Windows Insider Program. Users already taking part in the Release Preview will receive
 monthly updates via normal channels.</em><br />
<em><strong>In late May, we will begin availability for those users on a currently supported version of Windows 10 who seek to update via “Download and install now” (limited to devices with no known compatibility issues).</strong> We will also begin the phased
 rollout using our ML model to intelligently target those devices running Windows 10, version 1803 or prior versions that our data and feedback predict will have the best update experience. We will proactively monitor all available feedback and update experience
<em>Our commercial customers can begin their targeted deployments in late May, which will mark the beginning of the 18-month servicing period for Windows 10, version 1903 in the Semi-Annual Channel. We recommend IT administrators start validating the apps,
 devices and infrastructure used by their organizations at that time to ensure that they work well with this release before broadly deploying. The May 2019 Update will be available in late May through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Windows Update for
 Business, the Volume Licensing Service Center for phased deployment using System Center Configuration Manager or other systems management software.</em></p>

</p><p>IMO and based on Don's post, seems like this CU also prepares 17763 for the May update.</p>
<p>Maybe they're thinking on those who haven't installed 1809 yet.</p>

<p>That's how I am understanding this. With all the diagnostics and reports of installing 1903 MS has been quite busy. Down to only my main on 17763 and with 2 CU's this week already, they are ensuring everyone has a good experience with the upgrade with phased
 rollouts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping to see 19H2 coming down the line shortly. Let our adventures continue. Have a great weekend all.</p>

<p>Well spotted CK thank you. Updated my wife's laptop to 17763.475</p>
<p>All we need to do now is wait for late May and hope that no insurmountable problems rear their ugly heads in the Release Preview updates.</p>
