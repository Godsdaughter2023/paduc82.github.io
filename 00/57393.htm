<h2>            Atheros Windows 7 Update Error code 800f020b</h2>
                    I was advised to go to MS site to check for this error code and got nothing on this error code. it just sent me on a wild goose chase. Getting tired of MS doing this when are they going to just send you to the site to fix the problems like Apple does.
 MS likes to put out new OS with out correcting the old ones. I never get any Solutions for my Errors also. this is another issue. And it is set to Automatic. I have asked them many times and got no replies. I refuse to upgrade to Windows 8. &nbsp;I do not have
 any problems on several computers I own that have Windows XP on it. &nbsp;I think I will take this computer and reformat it to XP. I have all the software and all the drivers. I did Beta testing for MS but got tired of talking to techs that would not listen to
 me when I found a problem. I corrected the problem on my computers and did not submit the errors to them seeing they would not talk to me in a timely manor. I can also be contacted at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***

<h2>            Microsoft USB Audio &#47; mic driver has been bad for to long</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft USB audio for microphone does not have a boost option, and the mic volume is to low, it has been an issue for years and nothing is getting done about it. It worked with windows 7 but no longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a USB audio device that is using its own drivers ( not microsoft ) all is ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My particular issue is when using windows mixed reality and the built in audio jack on my headset, when I switch to headset audio I can not boost the mic. If I use my regular headset and not USB all is fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is the right place to post to reach microsoft, but after all these years it really is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What exactly is the issue?&nbsp; Primarily, I don't know what it is.&nbsp; I have no knowledge of allowing this program access to my computer.&nbsp; I DO NOT LIKE IT WHEN UNKNOWN PROGRAMS INSTALL THEMSELVES ON MY COMPUTER.&nbsp; The provided link does not work.&nbsp; All efforts
 to find any information on the internet about Footprint 4.8/FPMCP yields no results.&nbsp; Additionally it prevented me from accessing a web page.&nbsp; I am afraid it may be some kind of malware.&nbsp; I found one complaint about this program (or whatever it is) online&nbsp;that
 said it was a transparent proxy server which works as spyware.</p>
<p>I cannot find any files on my computer related to Footprint 4.8 and suspect it is hidden. It does not show up in an AVG virus scan or a Malwarebytes scan.&nbsp; I want to know what this is and be able to get it off my computer.&nbsp; I am running IE9 and have all
 updates current.</p>

            <p>The only answer you may deduce.&nbsp; If you search for some old documentation on version 2 you will find reference to Footprint Managed Cache Protocol.&nbsp; It appears to be something in widespread use behind the scenes at all ISPs.&nbsp; If you use DomainTools (r) to
 do the my-ip information gathering, you might note that all your communication may be passed by your ISP through it and that it is hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objective back in history was so that (for example) ten people making a request for the same information from the same local server (ISP) would only pull the full file from the source once and the rest would use the managed cache.&nbsp; Lots of information age
 and latency technical evaluations goes into how often to 'freshen' the cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly after the date of the 2.0 documentation, there are some copyrights battle notes and all the information disappeared from the internet.&nbsp; Almost like it was being intentionally filtered out by the cache, itself????&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use DomainTools and your Traceroute function, you can confirm it is still in full operation.&nbsp; Just good luck getiting detailed information.&nbsp; Heck, it may now have been taken over by Big Brother (ala George Orwells 1984).</p>

            I came here with the same question as you, so I am not an expert, but from what I've seen elsewhere, we are basically out of luck. &nbsp;The video card manufacturer stopped supporting that video card. &nbsp;End of Licence agreement or something..... &nbsp;Also, these
 are built into the main board, so you can't swap it out for something else. &nbsp;Guess I will continue on with Windows 7. &nbsp;

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>When I was forced to sign up to a Microsoft account, my Skype name has been changed to that account. So now I seem to have two Skype names. How do I switch back to my old one?</p>
<p>And how do I get actual customer service?? Seemingly we only get offered this 'community' support site.</p>

<p>Hi Catherine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still sign-in to Skype using your Skype Name, the one you previously had and it will direct you to your account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have forgotten your Skype Name, please follow the steps below for help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to our <a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Problems signing in</span></a><strong>
</strong>page.</li><li>Enter your email address and select&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
</li><li>We'll show you all the Skype accounts associated with that email address.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid confusion, I strongly suggest for you to combine your Skype account that is being signed in using a Skype Name and your Microsoft email address. Please refer to this link for more information:

<p>
</p><p>One 'fix' found here on the Forums involves renaming some 'Folders' (CatRoot2 and SoftwareDistribution)&nbsp; I believe.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present, these folders won't allow me to 'rename them,' I get an error that they are 'in use' by another program/process......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried doing this both from within Windows Explorer and within an Administrative Command Window.......&nbsp; same result......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts appreciated........</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried doing this right after doing a 'cold restart' as well as after running various other tools such as DISM and sfc /scannow......</p>

<p>You'll&nbsp;be better off&nbsp;discussing the line&nbsp;causing the error with TenForums as they might have seen previous reports of the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have looked through that section of the batch file and I cannot see anything that would give rise to an error except unexpected folder permissions on the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution or C:\Windows\system32\Catroot2 folders.&nbsp; Which of these was giving
 rise to the error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only error I have seen in running the batch file is with restarting the DcomLaunch service at the end.&nbsp; I have never investigated this because there are so many interactions between services that I would not be surprised to find that restarting one of
 the other services had had the side-effect of restarting DcomLaunch beforehand&nbsp;[which would generate the error message I see].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Windows update run correctly since using the batch file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, when I first looked into problems with Windows updates I found umpteen suggestions of resetting routines that were allegedly better than using the built-in Windows update troubleshooter.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of them were ridiculous, some looked alright on first sight but did not run correctly.&nbsp;
</li><li>I eventually settled on the <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Reset-Windows-Update-Agent-d824badc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet tool</a> &amp; the TenForums tool.&nbsp; </li><li>I rapidly started to prefer the TenForums one because it only deals with resetting Windows update [it is based on an extract of those parts of the TechNet tool].&nbsp; The TechNet tool acts as a front end for several other repair procedures as well.</li></ul>

</p><p>Some process appears to have latched onto these two subdirectories; and won't let them go so the sub-directories can be renamed.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got an option set to send any errors to Microsoft; so hopefully something will eventually shake out with this Creature Feature Update to Build 1702....</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this particular machine, I have learned that 'patience is a virtue' when dealing with Microsoft Updates........&nbsp; But Build 1702 Creature Feature Update is testing this patience......</p>

<p>It makes me wonder if you'd be better off running a Repair install [aka In-Place upgrade], a thorough repair procedure using an installation USB/DVD as its source of good system files copies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know what I'm talking about?&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>To run a Repair install procedure make an installation disk [USB/DVD] using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>A <em>Repair install</em> is also called an <em>In-Place upgrade</em> because it can be used as a repair procedure or as a method of updating your computer to the latest version [which is what will be downloaded using the Media creation tool].</li><li>You can use the procedure** in <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>Disconnect any unnecessary hardware, such as external drives, before running the Repair install.</li><li>I always disconnect from the internet before starting it.</li><li>The procedure asks if you want it to check for further updates while it's running.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>I always say <em>No</em> because I always disconnect from the internet beforehand but I have seen other users say that&nbsp;letting it check for updates&nbsp;does not cause any problems.&nbsp; I just like to keep repair procedures as straightforward as possible.</li><li>In your case, I think it would be important to reject letting it update during the procedure because you want to get it done without worrying about your current problem interfering with it.</li></ul>
</li><li>Repair installs just overwrite Windows files.</li><li>Your own files should not be affected.</li><li>Your installed applications should not be affected.</li><li>Your user accounts should not be affected</li><li>I always do a full backup of my own files &amp; make a system image before running a Repair install but I have never actually had it fail on me or cause any collateral damage.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>** It is a very simple procedure - </em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Start your computer normally [do not boot from the installation USB].</em></li><li><em>Connect the installation USB.</em></li><li><em>Open File explorer and browse to the installation USB.</em></li><li><em>Run its setup.exe file then just respond to its prompts [there are some at the start &amp; some at the end].</em></li><li><em>Run Windows update afterwards.</em></li></ul>

                    When I join a Skype for Business call my mic drops to 40. I have it set on Windows so that no external programs can change it but it still does. I will set my mic to 100, join a Skype call and watch it go down to 40.

<h2>            &#40;Windows 10&#41; USB device not recognized loop ... yet the only devices plugged into USB ports are keyboard and mouse ... and both are working fine</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 installed on a desktop computer.&nbsp; Everything has been working fine for years.&nbsp; But for the last several days my computer has incessantly been looping the "USB device not recognized" error, making the (now annoying) sound effects every couple
 of seconds.&nbsp; The only USB devices that are connected to the computer are they keyboard and mouse, and both are working fine.&nbsp; No other USB devices were trying to be plugged in when this error started happening.&nbsp; While troubleshooting the issue, when I plug
 in other USB devices (like external hard drives) they work fine as well.&nbsp; It seems that everything is working fine, but the error keeps making noise and popping up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched this forum as well as Google to find out how to resolve this issue to no avail.&nbsp; There are many websites that describe four different things to be done, or even six different things to do.&nbsp; I have done them all, to no avail.&nbsp; What could it
 be?&nbsp; How can I resolve this issue and regain my sanity while trying to use my computer with sound?</p>

            Hi Brian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> Recent Windows Updates are causing device problems in Windows 10, including USB flash and external drives.  You should be able to access and back up your files on another PC.  Then here are some things to try:
<br />
<br />You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Everything has been running fine, until i returned from holiday with a message saying the C:drive was running with very little free space. (like 20mb) I have totalled up all the files in the C:drive and they come to 21GB so there should be 19Gb free... what
 is using this up? I have had to repartition an extra 5GB on to the C Drive to give enough space to runn defrags and Disk cleans and now this space is rapidly disappearing.</p>
<p>I did the obvious... defrag, Disk Clean up and nothing seemed to change. I run the diskcheck and no errors were found. After trying the Disk Clean up a few more times on the same day the C:Drive showed free speace of 12GB! excellent!&nbsp; However with a matter
 of hours this sapce had disappeared again!</p>
<p>Mcafee shows up no virus's and spyware terminator and malwarebytes has found no spyware...</p>
After reading up on things on the internet I looked into the back up and restore files expecting these to be taking up alot of space but the restore file function is turned off! i had not done this. And in the System Restore there are multiple C:Drive entries
 one with Operating system written after and the other 2 say (missing)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a problem with sectors of my hard disk, and why has the disk check not picked it up or is there something i can do to recover the missing space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me!</p>

<p><span><span>Change the size of virtual memory</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><br />
1. Open System by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking System.
<br />
2. In the left pane, click Advanced system settings.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3. On the Advanced tab, under Performance, click Settings.<br />
4. Click the Advanced tab, and then, under Virtual memory, click Change.<br />
5. Clear the Automatically manage paging file size for all drives check box.<br />
6. Under Drive [Volume Label], click the drive that contains the paging file you want to change.<br />
7. Click Custom size, type a new size in megabytes in the Initial size (MB) or Maximum size (MB) box, click Set, and then click OK.</p>
<p><br />
Increases in size usually don't require a restart, but if you decrease the size, you'll need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. We recommend that you don't disable or delete the paging file.</p>

<h2>            Why has this QUICK ACCESS icon suddenly shown up on my Desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I can't even trash it into the Recycle Bin since it must be programmed not to let that happen. I must have changed some Setting somewhere recently that made it appear. I do remember a few days ago clicking something somewhere to make that QUICK ACCESS thing
 disappear from my File Explorer since I never use QUICK ACCESS and it just seemed like it was cluttering up File Explorer which I do use quite often. So, what's the fix?</p>

            Hi Ruthle55, that definitely sounds like a Video device driver issue . . .
<br />
<br />Let us see if you can get into Safe Mode and resolve this!
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running
<br />
<br />
<br />If you can get into your PC in Safe mode or normal mode, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Do the following at the sign in screen.
<br />
<br />Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />If you are able to boot successfully to the desktop....
<br />
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, the version of Windows 10 installed, might be the problem.
<br />
<br />In that case, I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Online Connection</h2>
                    I'm having an issue where i keep getting kicked out of For Honor mid game or even before the game starts saying to check my internet. Weird because i never have issues with my internet and usually average 40 up and 30 down, with anywhere from 13-60 latency.
 It's an issue that has been arising since i believe Monday when i was forced to reset my Xbox to factory settings because it wouldn't get past the the green Xbox One loading screen and that was the suggestion to fix it. It worked but ever since i've been having
 random lag spikes and anywhere from 1-96% packet loss. Which is weird because as i stated before i never have internet problems. At first i thought maybe it was just For Honor having server issues, wasn't seeing anything about that, and then it started happening
 on games like Overwatch and Star Wars Battlefront 2, with noticeble lag in each and also being kicked out mid game. So i did some research and apparently third party headsets can cause interference if there is no strai

<h2>            Missing External Boot Options from BIOS.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of restoring an old computer to factory condition to preserve, however it appears that any attempt to boot it externally has failed. I'm trying to reinstall the old Windows XP Operating System onto it with an external optical
 drive, as it's internal one is in need of replacing. </p>
<p>However both in the boot menu and the boot device priority menu within it's BIOS, there is no option to boot from the external optical drive. I have used that drive before to boot up another computer and it worked fine.
</p>
<p>To make sure that it is a problem with external USB devices, I attemped to test whether a USB drive with Ubuntu preloaded (without actually installing it) would be displayed or could boot from it, however I had no luck and the USB drive didn't even show
 up on the boot menu or the BIOS boot device priority menu. I tested the USB ports from within it's current OS and they all work fine. As It's current OS is Windows XP SP3, and I only have a disk with XP SP1 it will not re-install from within Windows.
</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, </p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>James. </p>

            The motherboard might be to old to have feature to boot from external CD drive. You might have to replace the internal CD driver.<br />

<p>Hi TomJeson64, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response, I just realised that I forgot to mention in the original post that, in the past it was able to boot via USB drives and other external optical drives. Thanks for your suggestion to replace the internal optical drive, I am on the
 lookout for one, hopefully though there is a way to get it to recognise USB devices as Boot devices again though.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>James. </p>

<h2>            Lifetime support of windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I upgraded to windows 10,&nbsp;however, as weird as it is, I decided to go back to windows 8.</p>
<p>There is a ton of reasons why I decided to do that, but the main one is that windows 10 wasn't compatible with my sound device (and I've got a huge studio that runs off of it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is&nbsp;since windows 10 was free and all, will the lifetime support for windows 8.1 be dropped early on?&nbsp; or&nbsp;will it still exist as long as the support for windows 7?</p>

</p><p>Its up to MS of course, but I doubt that will change. However, they may choose to "encourage" people to update to W10 by removing more facilities from W8.1 as they did with the 'Metro' Skype app for one example.</p>

<h3> car1749  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center does not detect the extender for my xbox 360, but the conditions do not fit the solutions in the FAQ.</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>The PC and Xbox are both connected via ethernet cable to the same router. </li><li>The XBox and XBox 360 are both showing as active network objects in the Network tool on the PC.
</li><li>The XBox network test for connections to both XBox Live and the PC say that the connection is good.
</li><li>The Extender can be installed/uninstalled from the network tool on the PC without issue.
</li><li>Windows Media Center, regardless, will not recognize the installed extender or install it when uninstalled from network
</li><li>These factors disallow the use of Windows Media Center from the XBox360. </li><li>Also I have added windows media center extenders to my list of approved objects on windows firewall.
</li></ul>
I solved this, but not entirely sure how/why it worked this time over the last time I tried the same.&nbsp; Shortly after posting this I manually installed the extender using the network tool on windows.&nbsp; Then I told the XBox to connect to Windows Media Center.&nbsp;
 While the XBox attempted to connect, I went into settings&gt;extender, brought up the extender icon, then attempted to configure from there.&nbsp; Before I did this I attempted to configure the extender from a few other parts, like tasks&gt;extender and settings&gt;extender
 but not on the specific extender.&nbsp; So if anyone else has a similar issue, install it manually, then configure it rather than trying to have WMC install it.

            <div>Most firewalls are automatically configured through the Extender setup procedure. If you believe that a firewall is blocking your Extender,
 it is the majority probable a less general firewall. to resolve firewalls are installed on your PC you have to go to Action Center through pressing the Start key , pressing Control Panel, as well as after that, in System and Security, you have to press Review
 your PC's position. You have to press on Security to expand the Security sector. In Network firewall, you will observe which firewall or firewalls are at present installed on your PC.</div>

            I was forced to stop using AVG, as I just could not figure out what the problem was. &nbsp;I'm somewhat computer literate, and have never had a problem where I just throw my arms up. &nbsp;AVG for some unknown reason was partially blocking the XBOX360 so I stopped
 using it.
