            Hi Mark
<div><br />
<div>Finally after a long day of struggling I decided to&nbsp;re install&nbsp;Windows 8. Found the source of the problem. Windows 8 didn't&nbsp;recognize my drivers for the PPPoE dashboard that was provided by my ISP. Re-installed the drivers for the PPPPoE connection and
 everything is now working 100%.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can FINALLY use the metro UI.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you though for your time and effort to try and help me out.</div>
<div>Enjoy Win8.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Finally, success!!</p>
<p>Not sure if this is relevant in your case Rohan, but I found where someone changed their internet connection type from NDIS to RAS, so I tried that and it worked. All Metro apps now work and the "offline" icon in the top rhs of the screen is gone!! I found
 that&nbsp;it's a quick and easy thing to change.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<h2>            My usb ports aren&#39;t working</h2>
                    My USB ports worked fine. I had my mouse plugged into the port on the right side of the computer but it suddenly stopped working. Now only one of my three ports work, and one of the ports that don't work has never been used. Nothing happened to the laptop
 at all, no damage. Please help.

<p>HI&nbsp;<span>Jordy Laforge,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry you're having issues with both of your consoles. The likelihood of both of these just having a hardware failure at the same time (without a crazy power surge). would be really rare. Do other things work on same outlet as the Xbox One? If the
 Xbox One is plugged into a power strip, go ahead and plug it directly into the wall. If that doesn't work, I would then suggest trying to power it in another location in your home to see if it does or does not work.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Media Streaming option only available by Search, not in control panel</h2>
                    <p>Why is it that in order to find the Media Streaming options I have to do a specific search in the windows search for "media" in order to get to the correct window with the options. The address it gives in the address bar after doing the search doesn't exist
 if I try to access it through the Control Panel. Notice in the screenshots the address in the window that was accessed through the windows search bar isn't available in the window that was navigated to using Control Panel. If I try to access the Media Streaming
 options via the Control Panel there is no link, button, or other clickable area called "Media Streaming Options".&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Pros, cons of using 3rd party firewalls vs WIndows firewall&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pros, cons of using 3rd party firewalls vs WIndows firewall&#63;</h2>
                    At the suggestion of PA Bear, I am opening this thread to get an education on firewalls.<br />
<br />
I have a Dell Latitude D600 with XP Pro SP3. I was using ZoneAlarms free firewall. Apparently, though, ZA conflicted with my NetGear USB WiFi adapter and kicked me off the network after about an hour (at one place, it totally crashed the machine to a blue screen).
 At PA Bear's suggestion, I unloaded ZA and enabled the Windows firewall - no more conflicts!<br />
<br />
But I do miss a couple of other functions I had with ZA: -- visual indication on the task bar of traffic flow -- permit/deny internet access to specific programs -- completely locking out all internet activity<br />
<br />
So is there a decent firewall program that provides good firewall protection AND these extra goodies WITHOUT conflicts?<br />
<br />
Or: <br />
<br />
Why should I stick with Windows firewall and not look elsewhere for additional functionality?<br />
<br />

<blockquote>Hi, Joel. Thanks for the response. <br />
<br />
I liked the alerts becasue there seemed to be a lot of stuff happening in the background that I never knew about. I appreciated being able to see what was happening and kill it. "what do you mean every time I open a file you want to connect to the internet???"<br />
<br />
The other part is that I use my laptop more in environments where I don't have an internet connection than I do at the coffee shops where I WiFi. I didn't want the constant slow-down of who-knows-what-and-how-many programs making repeated calls for a connection.<br />
<br />
Router?? All I do is turn on my computer and plug in my USB adapter and connect. (There's a guy at Starbucks almost every day who pulls out three laptops and a buncha other stuff - it's his corner office!) I don't know what I'd do with a router - it's just
 me and my laptop and Starbucks (or wherever). <br />

Hi Ed:</p>
<p>If you use your laptop frequently on public networks then a third party firewall is perhaps a good option. I did not detect that from your original post. You should look at the link below for a list of popular options. Comodo, however, would be my choice
 if I were to use one.</p>

            I also am having problems installing the H&amp;R Block 2009 with the same error.&nbsp; The federal program was downloaded from Amazon.com using their software and game downloader.&nbsp; Thinking that might be a problem, I uninstalled the amazon software downloader but
 that didn't help.&nbsp; I do not have trouble installing anything else, just the H&amp;R Block state software.&nbsp; My registry matches exactly with what it is supposed to be, so I don't think that is the problem.&nbsp; Sure would like some help.&nbsp; My OS is Vista.

            Hello <br />
<br />
If you are having problems installing H&amp;R Block software, be sure you have paused or disabled your antivirus before installing.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you turn off the Antivirus and see if you can now install the H&amp;R Software.<br />
You might also try to see if you can install in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Start the program in safe mode</span></p>
<p><span>1. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when
 you see the boot menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2. When the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, select Safe Mode, and then press Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Log onto Windows by using the Administrator account or any user account with the Administrator privilege.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: In Safe Mode, your system display and Desktop will look and perform differently than in Normal Mode. This is only temporary. To return the system back to Normal Mode, we
 can simply restart the computer.</span></p>
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Win 10 Mail will send but won&#39;t receive</h2>
                    <p>Has Microsoft fixed their Mail App yet in Win 10?&nbsp; Since downloading Win 10, I have been unable to set up any POP accounts in the Mail App.&nbsp; It seems to be able to send an email, though it doesn't show up in the Sent&nbsp;file.&nbsp; I am unable to receive any emails
 to either of my two accounts.&nbsp; The Yahoo account seems to default to an IMAP account, and doesn't provide an option to select a POP account or&nbsp;set the port numbers.&nbsp; After I deleted both my email accounts, I am still left with one entry in my Account view.&nbsp;
 It says System Error, Can't Get Mail.&nbsp; I am unable to delete this notification. I am running the latest update for Win 10 Pro, IOS X El Capitan 1511 Build 10586.29.</p>
<p>I have been able, fortunately,&nbsp;to set up my email accounts in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>How can Microsoft spend years developing the so-called BEST OS ever, and the most basic of computer apps -- the Email Program -- doesn't work???&nbsp; And there seems to be a reluctance to fix the problem!!!&nbsp; There are thousands of threads on the Internet forums
 alluding to problems with the Win 10Mail App. How can a large corporation in today's competitive&nbsp;business world ignore customer feedback?&nbsp; To me, it is just unconscionable!</p>

<p>I have two email accounts set up in Win 10 Mail.&nbsp;They are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Incoming Mail Server</p>
<p>winmo.imap.mail.yahoo.com:993:1</p>

<p>winmo.smtp.mail.yahoo.com:465:1</p>
<p>Outgoing (SMTP) Mail Server</p>
<p>smtphm.sympatico.ca:25:1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Sympatico account is set up as a POP&nbsp;type as it is essential that the emails remain on my computers and ipads to be accessed at any time, even when internet access is not available. An IMAP account is useless
 to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to set up a Yahoo mail account, Win 10 Mail defaults to the above IMAP settings.&nbsp; There is no way to choose a POP protocol, and the port numbers are wrong.&nbsp; The Yahoo settings won't change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have notification in the Win 10 Mail account screen that there is a "System Error" with account "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, Cannot get mail".&nbsp; I am unable to delete this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server ports for both accounts should be 995 and 587 respectively.</p>

</p><p>I have gone into WebMail on IE and tried sending mail from each account to each account.&nbsp; I received the test emails in Window Live Mail running in Win 10, as well as receiving them on my iPad. They even showed up in the Sent file.&nbsp; So the email accounts
 are set up properly as POP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to sync the accounts in Win 10 Mail resulted in Not Synced Yet with the scrolling dots continuing and hanging forever. It now appears that I can't Send or Receive mail now in Win 10 Mail -- as reported by many customers in various Internet forums
 on Win 10 Mail problems.</p>

    <title>Receiving error message&#58; 1439 and iTunes iPod restore not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Receiving error message&#58; 1439  and iTunes iPod restore not working on Windows 8.1.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: iTunes iPod restore not working on Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Since I upgraded to Windows 8.1, I reinstalled iTunes, which works fine, but when I plugged in my iPod, it said it was corrupted and needed restoring. When I tried to restore it, the error message 1439 came up, then windows told me I needed to format the
 removable hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried the apple support guide and the tips in the forums, and nothing on there seems to work. They want over £100 to send it in for repair, so I'm trying to see if there is anything else I could do to help before I give in.</p>

    <title>Is Windows 10 causing early HD failures - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is Windows 10 causing early HD failures</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new HP Pavilion 15 inch notebook and within 6 months the hard drive had completely failed. Wouldn't even boot into OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that in my 20 plus years of using PC's and at least 10 of those using notebooks. I never had any HD failures, even after years of using a notebook. But I have had two fail since using Windows 10, one after upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Win 10 and second
 less then six months on a new notebook installed with Win 10. To me, this gives pause to consider that maybe Windows 10 is shortening drive life for some reason? I looked into some valid stats on hard drive failure rates and none seem to indicate that hard
 drives in general are getting worse in failure rates even with capacity increases and speed. I run typical 5400 rpm drives with around 1000 or less GB capacities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I would start a discussion on this topics to see if anyone else could chime in on their experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you read thru the MS forums there is little, if any indication that W10 is a possible cause of HDD failure (I am not defending W10, by the way.) There are some posts claiming that their HDD,s appear to be running more frequently and causing overheating,
 none of those indicated that their HHD, eventually died due to this!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a website called Backblaze, that do regular tests on HDD, (refer link below), they have quite a lot of info on HDD failures, but not whether it is due OS,s or what the actual causes were!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-reliability-q3-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-reliability-q3-2015/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A website search for HDD failures due to W10, does not support any evidence of HDD failure due to OS,s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can think that an OS may cause a HDD failure, is if there was a setting, which would cause the HDD failure by thrashing (constant use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you have any indication that the HDD,s were being over-extended, before they died?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was active working, I found that virtually all HDD,s I replaced was because of mechanical failure of some part of the HDD, (I will admit that was several years ago and HDD&nbsp; technology &amp; reliability are much better now.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you check the PC manufacturer warranty, as to what terms if any, covers HDD failure?</p>

            Yes, I checked out BackBlaze and their stats indicated that the drive that failed in my HP was actually pretty low in failure rates. I've seen a few forums addressing failures and some do question the big Win 10 updates as possibly finishing off a weak
 or defective drive. Anyway, HP replaced mine with a HGST 7200 RPM vs the old WD 5400 so at least its a better drive. Could be just a fluke but certainly I think Win 10 is a very busy OS for the storage drive from my observations.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I bought a new msi laptop around a month ago. From the very first day it used to hang. I thought I'd give it time after the updates were installed but there seems to be no change. It still hangs very randomly, sometimes when i am watching a Youtube video
 and sometimes when I am playing a game. It goes totally unresponsive and requires a hard reboot. I searched the internet and found people with similar issues but found no appropriate solution. Can anyone kindly help?</p>

            <p>Hi Suarez,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to display driver incompatibility with Windows 10. Let's try the following steps and check the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place the computer in clean boot state to avoid any third party software conflict</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Update the display driver in Device Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click <strong>Device Manager</strong></p>
<p>b. Expand <strong>Display adapters </strong></p>
<p>c. Right click the Wi-Fi adapter and click <strong>Update driver software</strong></p>
<p>d. Click <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest display&nbsp;adapter for the same computer model as you have and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Since I've been used to dealing with overheating, a wild guess could be this. I'd say you could try to monitor system temperatures in order to rule out CPU throttling. I personally use CPUID HW Monitor* which will tell you a lot of potentially useful (or
 just interesting) info. Under idle load, I'd say a big gaming laptop should definitely not get over 60 degrees. I speculate at around 90 degrees throttling would take place. Another even wilder guess is just to check the power options, as power saver or balanced
 are usually a terrible choice when it really matters.</p>
<p>Still just wild guesses. But to be honest the info you provide of your hardware and OS&nbsp;are as vague as it could be, thus limiting how many wild guesses can be made. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

</p><p>If you successfully close your Skype account, it will be permanently deleted on our system after 60 days. Within the 60 days period, you can still&nbsp;revoke the request to your account being marked for closure by signing in. In the event that the 60 days have&nbsp;already
 passed, you will no longer be able to get back on your account as the system closed your account permanently. Let me know if you still have questions.

<h2>            Why has Google Chrome appeared inside windows 10 after latest update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've just updated windows to the latest (hopefully stable) version and for some reason Chrome has been installed even though I
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">didn't</span></em> give permission for this
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nor</span></em> did I want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my questions....</p>

</p><p>Why is it there? How the heck do I get rid of it? There's NO uninstall option... it doesn't appear in Programs and Features......</p>
<p>

<h2>            Typo Error On Website</h2>
                    <p>So I was checking out the EOS date on the Windows site and I came across this page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/endofsupport.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the heading "Potential risks of staying with Windows XP" there is a pretty funny typo.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Running Windows XP SP3 in your environment after April 8, 2104 may expose you to potential risks...."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone see the issue.&nbsp; Unless MS intend to support XP for the next 90 years, I suggest a change.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you say “system goes offline”, do you mean to say that the Internet stops working?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which browser are you using on the computer to connect to the Internet?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you make any recent changes to the computer?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a wired or wireless connection?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;First I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode with networking and check if the same issue occurs,
 here is the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Also try updating the latest drivers for your network adapter and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you don’t find the drivers in Windows updates, then try going to manufacturer’s website download the latest
 drivers and install. Check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also check the advanced power management on the network adapter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Though usually only done on laptops, the power management may be set to allow the<strong>computer</strong>
 to turn off the Ethernet port to conserve energy.<br />
<br />
Open Device Manager, go into the properties of the network adapter. &nbsp;Check in the Power Management tab for "Allow the<strong>computer</strong> to turn off this device to save power"</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 not recognizing audio devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adalvs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not recognizing audio devices</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded an update and after the update&nbsp;windows 10 stopped recognizing that it has audio playback devices installed. I've checked on the&nbsp;drivers and they are all&nbsp;working. I tried updating them, and they were up to date. I also&nbsp;disabled then
 enabled them and&nbsp;restarted my&nbsp;laptop but that did not help either. I also cannot use headphones either, since the computer&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;recognizing earbuds as an audio playback device either. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all the drivers are there and working just fine, windows just is not recognizing that there are sound drivers. I also cannot configure windows to use the sound drivers it has installed since it will not let me and the configure button is grayed out.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4eda7352-5b56-4049-a1a1-c9a8d2986d35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4eda7352-5b56-4049-a1a1-c9a8d2986d35" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>edit: I guess after updating my Intel High Definition audio under other devices became incompatible and I now have to find an update for that since windows could not find one automatically.

            Windows troubleshooter cannot fix this problem, so I went to the device manager and Intel HD Audio device is listed under other. When I look at properties, no drivers are installed, so I tried to update drivers but none can be found? Any advice?

            <p>If the Device Manager is showing Intel Display Audio, that is not the one you want.&nbsp; I don't remember seeing a normal Intel Audio since many of them are Realtek or perhaps others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the top of the Device Manager window and do a search for devices.&nbsp; If that doesn't show something, reboot the system and give it time to find its own drivers.&nbsp; Once you find out what audio device you have you could then look for drivers or get them
 from your OEM.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but a search for devices did not find any audio devices. I had already tried rebooting so I started manually searching through program files(x86) and found a Harmon audio file with driver folder. However, when I tried to install driver file it seemed
 to be empty. I ended up going to OEM and asking for help, they pointed me to the correct drivers and problem solved. All of this started after a Windows 10 update, only the second one.&nbsp;I would like to state my displeasure with Windows 10 and its automatic
 updates, no prompt before download which ties up my satellite modem rendering my laptop almost unusable until Windows is satisfied. It feels like I am being held hostage by Microsoft, I can't even use my computer until they are done with it. When Windows did
 its first update it did a restart which locked up and sent me into a crash on reboot, not very impressive. I have been a Microsoft customer since Windows 98 but I truly believe this will regrettably be my last Microsoft product purchase.

            <p>Hey guys I ended up fixing the problem that I had on my own time before I got any response. In hopes that this will help other people here is what I did.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is Lenovo brand and therefore the drivers probably did not update themselves when I installed the Windows update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to Lenovo's website</p>
<p>found where the drivers were on there, the driver I wanted to update here was a sound driver so I looked for those and downloaded the most recent version of it that was available, along with a couple other drivers Lenovo said needed updating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if your computer brand is Dell, HP, Samsung, or whatever you can maybe try visiting the company's website and see if they have a solution for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also Windows Troubleshooter did not help find anything. It just claimed all my drivers were up to date, which they weren't it seems.

</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry to know that&nbsp;you are facing the issues&nbsp;in connecting&nbsp;TV with the laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the below methods and check if&nbsp;it&nbsp;helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> I suggest you to follow below steps to connect your computer to your TV:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>1. Turn off your computer and position it within easy reach of your TV. Disconnect the monitor, but leave the mouse and keyboard connected.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Connect the appropriate video cable from your computer's output to your TV.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Turn on your TV and set it to the input that matches the output on your computer. You might need to refer to the user's guide included with your TV for instructions on how to do this.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Turn on your computer. </span>
<span>You should see Windows displayed on your TV. If the screen looks stretched, or part of the screen seems cut off, you probably need to adjust the screen resolution in Windows. For more information,</span></p>

<h2>            Ms paint issue that I was curious about.</h2>
                    <p>I was working with a scanned picture in paint. I had wanted to outline and color it . Saved a separate copy of the image and when I came back to it, the solid red lines that were used to outline the picture were all different shades of red and pixelated.
 The fill bucket tool would&nbsp; only fill one pixel at a time. I tried to look up the issue online but nothing came close.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the place to ask but I just wanted to see if any one else had this happen.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi ResortRags
<br />a clean install is better than the factory defaults - no manufacture tweaks or  bloatware, just windows and the apps you choose to install.
<br />
<br />Because you have previously had windows 10 installed and activated on that device, you can reinstall windows 10 anytime you wish. 
<br />
<br />to get the best install, with fewest issues, use the media creation tool to create bootable media and clean install windows 10. 
<br />
<br />make sure to get windows 10 edition (home pro etc) that you had before
<br />
<br />during install, skip the pages that ask for a key, it will activate automatically when you go online. 
<br />
<br />Greg Carmack's article can help in guiding you through a clean install

<p>Factory reset is actually a procedure developed by the computer manufacturer, so detailed instructions are on the manufacturer's website. Just be sure that you're following the procedures for your model of computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advantages of a factory reset are: 1) it's over quickly; 2) it was designed for your computer, so you know it's going to work; and 3) you'll get all the programs and drivers that were installed at the factory. In addition, you won't have any worries
 about activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer will be&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> as it was when it left the factory, which is not the case when you reset the computer according to Microsoft's procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All will be well <em>provided</em> that no one has monkeyed with the manufacturer's recovery partition.</p>

<p><br />
Further to Mike Hall's reply: A backup to an internal disk is almost useless. It is unlikely that you can recover your lost pictures but you can build on this bad experience by buying a USB hard disk and using it as your medium for the regular backups.<br />
