    <title>Xbox live chat suspension - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox live chat suspension</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently receiced a 14 day communication ban today because someone messaged me after I killed him on Call Of Duty Black Ops 4 with an abusive message. I replied with laughing faces and he kept on with the abuse. I then called him a
<strong>[Mod removed profanity] </strong>and continued with the laughing faces and then received a suspension. After appealing it, I was told my suspension will be upheld even though he messaged me first and said alot worse than the word that I used. All the
 agent did was tell me how what I said was so bad and explained it would be upheld but when I asked why the other guy hasnt received any suspension, the xbox representative failed to answer that part of my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone explain to me why the other guy hasnt received any form of punishment after messaging me completely randomly and giving me abuse for doing what the game was made for and why ive received a suspsension and he has not. As this is not fair
 what so ever and completely goes against anything that microsoft claim to promote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you report the other player? The enforcement team relies on other members to submit reports when another player breaks the Code of Conduct. Whoever "starts" it does not matter. Since you broke the terms and were reported, you received the suspension.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend just reporting the other player if this happens again, instead of trying to retaliate with your own messages.</p>

            As long as you reported the other person, the enforcement team will investigate them as well and take the appropriate action. There is no way for you to know for sure whether they have received some type of enforcement action or not. Even if they haven't
 received anything yet, it doesn't meant they won't.&nbsp;

<p>Yes i did report the other player and he was still messaging me hours later. So i know he hasnt had anything against him. I wasnt referring to who started it but i find it disgusting how microsoft can punish people for replying back to someone who is sending
 disgusting messages out of the blue to another player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They dont take anything into consideration at all, they can clearly see the whole chat and exactly how it went but still chose to suspend me because i told him to stop being a
<span><strong>[Mod Removed – Profanity]</strong></span>. thats hardly offensive at all in comparison to what he said to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft need to nip these people in the bud because i can guarentee that im not the only person hes messaged because theyre better than him &amp; he will continue to be allowed to antagonise people with no sanction. Microsoft seriously need to sort it out.</p>

You're not accepting it by blocking it. You're not saying nothing by reporting it. Microsoft will deal with them.

<p>Re Q307545 - How to recover from a corrupted Registry that prevents Windows XP from starting.</p>
<p>When I got to Action 9., it didn't show any previously dated Restore{D*********)\RP1\Snapshots, only showed the one with today's date, so was unable to complete procedure. Hence laptop still boots to Desktop but no icons, or Start Menu accessible - just
 hangs.&nbsp;(Have tried CTRL-ALT-DEL and waited and waited, over 15 minutes, but no go. I can boot it in "Safe Mode", but that doesn't help much.&nbsp; Any suggestions PLEASE !!!</p>

<p>Which of the KB307545 article symptoms do/did you have?<br />
<br />
If you do not have the listed symptoms, what symptoms do you have (or are you just practicing).</p>
<p>What problem were you having that you think KB307545 would be able to resolve?</p>
<p>Prior to trying to implement KB307545, did your system recently have a power interruption, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown (including the power button and plug pulling)?</p>
<p>Were you trying to resolve some problem before beginning this KB307545 implementation or did it just start happening out of the blue?</p>
<p>If your system boots in Normal Mode to the point where you see your background wallpaper image and have no Start button or taskbar, it sounds like you have some other problem that does not necessitate the use of KB307545, but we don't know any history that
 got you here.</p>
<p>If you only have an RP1 folder, as far as XP is concerned, that constitutes all your available Restore Points.</p>
<p>Have you ever in recent memory when the system was running normally, turned off and on System Restore thinking that would solve some problem?</p>
<p>Have you ever used any kind of disk cleanup program (some of them will remove all but the current restore point).</p>
<p>If your system boots in Safe Mode, are you able to boot in Safe Mode with Networking and get on the Internet?</p>
<p>Do you have your desktop icons and Start menu when you boot into Safe Mode?</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>What is your XP version and Service Pack?</p>
<p>What is your system make and model?</p>
<p>Are you booting on a genuine bootable XP installation CD or some System Recovery type CD that came with your system (how are you getting into the XP Recovery Console?&nbsp; If you are able to boot into the XP Recovery Console, that is a good thing.</p>
<p>From the Recovery Console are you able to successfully run chkdsk /r?</p>

<p>If you can successfully boot to Safe Mode then your problem is most likely due to a program that loads after the bare minimum Windows components loads. Boot to Safe Mode and try following the suggestions in the article:</p>
<p>"How to troubleshoot configuration errors by using the System Configuration utility in Windows XP"<br />
&nbsp; &lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310560/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310560/en-us</a> &gt;</p>

<p>Start by disabling all startup items.&nbsp; If that works, then enable startup items until you find the one that is giving you problems.&nbsp; If it doesn't work, then start disabling services.&nbsp; Once you find the program that is giving you the problems, you can probably
 uninstall it and re-install it.</p>

<p>Well, somehow I suspected there was a power interruption in the picture. &nbsp;There usually is when this message is reported.</p>
<p>Frequently the power interruption corrupts the file system a bit and chkdsk /r from the Recovery Console will usually fix it right up and there is no need to use KB307545. &nbsp;Even trying to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;KB307545 with a corrupted file system after a power interruption
 is usually very frustrating until the real problem is fixed.</p>
<p>This knowledge comes from having actually recreated the situation many times by plug pulling, battery pulling, etc., and then actually figuring out what the problem is and fixing it (not by just trying things). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, KB307545 is the first thing that come up in a Google search for the error message and it is a fine article that works if registry really is corrupt. &nbsp;Usually, the advice is to "try" KB307545. &nbsp;Recreate the problem a few times and you will see that
 KB307545 is probably not needed. &nbsp;Trying and fixing are not the same things.</p>
<p>I looked at Nitro PDF and don't see the disk cleanup option but I did not install it. &nbsp;There was a version of ZoneAlarm recently that would leave your system with only the last Restore Point, hence my query.</p>
<p>From the Recovery Console you should run chkdsk /r repeatedly until it runs clean, then start trying to fix things if there is still a problem. &nbsp;SInce you have already tried KB307545 to a point, your current situation may require some further analysis -
 you may need to put back your original 5 registry files... &nbsp;who knows at this point how things are.</p>
<p>Keep your fingers crossed!</p>

<p>Hi Jose,</p>
<p>I just read your answer and I'm in shock because I am in the same situation.</p>
<p>Because a&nbsp;power interruption&nbsp;I couldn't start back my computer. When I turned ON I just had black screen and a message that windows cannot start,... file missing,... System something. I wrote it down, and look for it on the internet, the article Q307545
 came out.&nbsp; Honestly it was the best solution and I trusted being from Microsoft...&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>Of course I didn't pay attention of this &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "WARNING: Do not use this procedure if your computer has an OEM installed. The system hive on OEM installations create passwords and user account that did not exist previously...."</p>
<p>And as they said, now I can not access the registry to finish the process.&nbsp; I logged back on a new Administrator user (new as they said) and with no access at anything. When I try to execute any program, or even open the properties of the desktop to change
 the screen, I receved the same message: Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the apporpiate permission to access the item.</p>
<p>What can i do???? Please help!!!!!!!!<br />
I have a second computer so I can get instructions from one to work on the other. My biggest biggest concern is not loosing my information (pictures, documents, e-mails, work, etc...)</p>
<p>I have doubts and do not want to do anything else bad, Should I re-start windows?&nbsp; Is there a way to restore the computer to a previous point (I have the date when the success happened).<br />
<br />
Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
:(</p>

<p>I don't have much experience to give you any silver bullet advice.&nbsp; If I see an OEM system with some goofy problem, I will just reformat it and reinstall XP from scratch anyway. &nbsp;Then, I know how it is set up.</p>
<p>As far as recent&nbsp;memory&nbsp;serves, the ...config\system... missing or corrupt kinds of problems that occur after a power failure I have never used KB307545 to fix one.&nbsp; The chkdsk /r works so far for me every time (and that is a lot of times). &nbsp;The&nbsp;KB is great
 advice if your&nbsp;registry&nbsp;really does get messed up somehow, but so often people have problems because nobody tells them to run the chkdsk /r first. &nbsp;Sometimes, you have to recreate the problem to learn how to fix it.</p>
<p>If you did not format you HDD, you personal files are still there, so maybe somebody else will have a good answer on how to get your regular XP going.&nbsp; The best I could do is come up with ideas but would not be able to test them.</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;followed&nbsp;KB307545, I see you make a folder called tmp and copy your original 5 registry files there for safekeeping. &nbsp;If that part worked and you have run the chkdsk /r to be sure your file system is intact after the power glitch, it would seem you
 could just put the 5 files from the tmp folder back into the system32\config folder since there was probably nothing wrong with them in the first place. &nbsp;I don't know if that will work or not though.</p>
<p>Before you do all that, you might want to think about how you are going to salvage your personal data and then when you are sure you have all your good stuff saved off someplace else, see if you can get your afflicted system running again. &nbsp;Plan for the
 worst, hope for the best! &nbsp;You should think about what you are you are going to do if you have to reinstall your XP from scratch - how can you save your stuff first.</p>
<p>You can boot on some other kind of CD and still access all your files (you will have to find them).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hiren's boot CD is easy to make, has a Windows Explorer kind of interface that you will recognize and you can copy your stuff off to another HDD, burn a CD, copy to a flash drive, etc. &nbsp;I am not sure what will happen with your current setup though and
 these&nbsp;permissions&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>You can do all your 5 registry file copying from Hiren's too. &nbsp;It works just like the Windows Explorer - copy/paste, etc. &nbsp;I think you will like it much better than Recovery Console for what you need to do.</p>
<p>Make yourself a Hiren's BootCD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.net/</a><br />
<br />
On the left, click Download, scroll down to the bottom, choose the latest version<br />
<br />
The download link is a little hard to see.&nbsp; It is at the bottom of the page above the drop down list for older versions and looks like this (click this part to download the ZIP file:<br />
<br />
<strong>Direct HTTP Mirror</strong> + Torrent + Torrent Magnet<br />
<br />
Click the "<strong>Direct HTTP Mirror</strong>" link to start the download and save the ZIP file to your desktop of someplace you can remember. &nbsp;The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to
 extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You&nbsp;have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it.&nbsp; The BurnToCD.cmd will use the extracted BurnCDCC.exe file to burn the .ISO file to a blank CD using your existing CD burner.&nbsp; You can also use your own CD burning software
 as long as your software is capable of creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file.&nbsp; Most modern CD burning programs can create bootable CDs from an .ISO image.&nbsp; Creating a bootable CD from an ISO image is not the same as just burning the file to a CD.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp; These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is&nbsp;being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Using the Mini XP, you can access the Internet, maneuver around your system, search for files, copy files, replace files, run various scans for malicious software, edit text files (like the c:\boot.ini) etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are dozens of free and useful tools included in the CD that can be used to repair your system or copy your important personal files to another device (like a USB device or external drive).</p>
<p>Hopefully you will come back later with some good news or see what other ideas come up from other folks.</p>

<p>Kamaci,</p>
<p>Just to add a bit to Jose's information with specifics regarding KB307545...&nbsp; Windows keeps regular system backups as part of the System Restore process which includes recent backups of your registry.&nbsp; If your registry gets corrupted, the goal is to replace
 the corrupted registry with a&nbsp; backup stored in the "System Volume Information" folder.&nbsp; Since your computer can't boot, they set up a four-part process to get you going again.</p>
<p>Part 1 Replaces your registry with a very old/basic -- but accessible --&nbsp; registry so that you can boot to a primitive state.<br />
Part 2 The backup folder is "super hidden" and protected, so this step accesses the recent backup and copies it to a temp folder<br />
Part 3 Since you can't replace a registry in use, you boot to Restore Console and replace registry from Part 2<br />
Part 4 Reboots and does a complete System Restore to make sure everything matches.</p>
<p>Part 1 is very susceptible to problems because you may have upgraded several services packs and IE versions since the registry repair files were created and it may not match your system -- plus the OEM warning.&nbsp; This is most likely where Kamaci had the problem.&nbsp;
 The workaround is rather simple. You need to boot your system from a Recovery-style CD.&nbsp; Everyone has their favorite.&nbsp; Jose prefers "HirensBootCD" (I've never tried that one).&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend to prefer free Live Linux CDs such as
<a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Knoppix</a> or<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ubuntu</a> mainly because it is easy to build and Linux does not have any issues accessing files in the "super hidden" System Volume
 Information folder.&nbsp; If you use the Ubuntu disk, recognize that it is an install disk, so be sure you use the "Try me" option and do not do an install.&nbsp; To make the CD, you basically download a .iso file and use the procedure described by Jose to burn it to
 a CD then you boot your system with it.</p>
<p>Once you have booted from the above CD, then you can pick up KB307545 at Part 2, Step 6 -- using regular GUI methods of copying/pasting the files specified in the KB article instead of doing it from a command prompt.&nbsp; Both Part 2 and Part 3 can be done without
 rebooting using the Linux or Recovery CD.&nbsp; After which you must reboot (fingers crossed) and do a regular System Restore as per Part 4.</p>
<p>If everything else fails, the Linux [or Recovery] CD should allow you to plug in a USB drive into your computer and back up any of your critical data before taking the big step of reinstalling Windows.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>EA has announced that former Arsenal and England striker Alan Smith will take over commentary duties in FIFA 12.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/viewer.php?mode=article&amp;id=258715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.medialib.computerandvideogames.com%2fscreens%2fscreenshot_258715_thumb_wide300.jpg" /></a> Smith replaces the disgraced Andy
 Gray, who was caught in something of a sexism scandal earlier this year whilst employed at Sky Sports.</p>
<p>Smith - who all-too-often played second fiddle to Gary Lineker in the England team (not that we're bitter) - joins FIFA' long-time word garbler Martin Tyler in the digital commentary box.
<br />
<br />
The game's second punditry team will be made up of Clive Tyldesley and outside broadcast truck specialist Andy Townsend.<br />
<br />
"Alan will bring a fresh, new perspective and insight to FIFA 12, working alongside the trusted and well-known voice of Martin Tyler," said David Rutter, Senior Producer of FIFA 12. "As one of the top-tier broadcasters in the UK, he brings enormous knowledge
 and expert analysis to the game so that we can deliver the most authentic FIFA experience this year."<br />
<br />
"The natural chemistry that Martin and I have developed working live matches for TV has transferred very well to the virtual broadcast booth," said Smith.
<br />
<br />
"I'm really looking forward to FIFA fans hearing our work this fall as we bring all the match day emotion and excitement to this year's game."</p>

 then the best commentary is always through your headset over LIVE</p>

    <title>Limit &#34;Default Beep&#34; Error Sound when using Windows Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gfinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Limit &#34;Default Beep&#34; Error Sound when using Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I've been "upgraded" to a Windows 10 machine at work and am trying to get everything configured and copied over on the new machine (they really need to add more options for configuring window and taskbar colors, it looks horrid!) and have noticed a strange
 discrepancy in the way the error sounds are handled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Windows 7 machine &nbsp;if I'm in a Windows Explorer window and type a key to jump to a subfolder but there is no folder starting with that letter it will make an error noise, the one assigned to "Default Beep". However if I keep typing it doesn't make
 any more noise even though it's still not finding something to jump to. The noise won't play again unless I wait a second or so without typing, or go to some other window and come back. As long as I keep typing on the keyboard in the same Windows Explorer
 window and each keypress is within that ~1 second timeframe&nbsp;from the previous keypress it will keep on not making any noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Windows 10 machine however in the&nbsp;same situation it&nbsp;makes another beep for every key I press. If I keep pressing keys it keeps making noise, the faster I press the faster the noises happen, up until the point where the beeps starting overwriting each
 other. This is very annoying.&nbsp;One beep lets me know I've made a mistake, I don't need to be assaulted by multiple beeps before my fingers catch up to my brain and stop typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to change the Default Beep sound (and have already changed it from the default Default Beep on the Windows 10 machine) and I know I could turn it off entirely if I wanted, but _one_ beep as a warning is useful. A friend who's also on a Windows
 7 machine reports that when they do the same thing they get multiple beeps, like my Windows 10 machine, so it doesn't seem to be a change in the OS. There must be some configuration option that got changed on my Windows 7 machine, whether by me or the IT department
 I have no idea at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I limit the error noise so that it will beep once and then not again until a sufficient time has passed since the last error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And trying to search the internet for solutions&nbsp;using things like&nbsp;"Windows error beeps" results in&nbsp;questions from a lot of people who either don't know how to change or disable the sound, or people who are getting error beeps and&nbsp;can't figure out why, neither
 of which is my situation.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that the feature you are seeking for in Windows 10 is not available. As the new Windows has been significantly changed as compared to the older&nbsp;OS. However as a workaround you can either turn off the sound notification or choose one
 that is more apt for you, which you have mentioned you do not required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having stated&nbsp;so, I suggest that you post your suggestions and concerns about the&nbsp;same in our Feedback app as this will let our developers know about your scenario and they will work towards it in the upcoming builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Guru&nbsp;Kiran</p>
<p />

    <title>Clean reinstall Windows 7 64 bit with OEM disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trswanson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clean reinstall Windows 7 64 bit with OEM disc</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do a clean reinstall of Windows 7 64 bit on my machine. I have the OEM disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started when I went out of town for a few days, and shut my machine down. When I came back, I turned it on, the boot went thru the post procedure, but hung up starting windows. I eventually punched it out, and when I started it up again, I got
 the notice that windows failed to start correctly (no kidding). It went thru the automatic repair, and finally got running again. However, most MS products don't work properly. My Office programs no longer show&nbsp; installed, Silverlight doesn't work, etc. IE
 only flashes, and won't run, Firefox doesn't' work right. Only Chrome operates properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway. I have backed up my files, and tried to do a clean reinstall, set up the BIOS to run off of the CD, and tried to boot up. It still boots off the HD. Am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO. Checkdisk and malware programs show no problems, but many of the Windows security updates fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

<h3> starrider888  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pause Win 10 camera app &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way to pause&nbsp;recording a video with the windows 10 camera app so that when I continue recording, it is one file instead of having to stop recording which produces a separate file? Also is there a way to zoom while recording OR taking a still
 photo ?

<p>
</p><p>What happens when you pause the video? Is it getting saved as a new file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to tap on pause while taking a video and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest you to refer to the Microsoft help article and check if it helps.</p>

            There IS NO PAUSE BUTTON . If there is, it is hidden. I tried the pause button on the keyboard. It did nothing. The help&nbsp; article has NO info on this.

            Thank you for the reply. I have added the ManyCam (manycam.com) free camera app which has a multitude of features and even includes zoom. They have a paid version also with more features, of course.

<li>Please confirm: the difference between the two meeting hosting functions of E3. &nbsp; Is it correct that one method enables up to 250 people to participate in a bi-directional meeting while the other is a uni-directional broadcast to up to 10,000 people?<br />
</li><li>In each function how do attendees connect via voice?

<p>Hi Ken , </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting . </p>
<p>The Office 365 for Business E3 is used widely for enterprises . It has lots of features .
</p>
<p>And the answer to your question is : </p>
<p>1 . Yes . You can have meetings with 250 attendees and broadcast to up to 10,000 people online . You can attend in a browser on nearly any device .
</p>
<p>2 . You can use Skype for Business desktop client or mobile application to connect a meeting via an invitation email or calendar events .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides , you can use dial-in number in Skype for Business to join the meeting . When you purchase a Office 365 subscription , dial-in numbers are assigned to you automatically . These numbers are only available to your organization . It depends on
 your area . You can check it by negative to Skype for Business admin center -&gt; Audio conferencing -&gt; Microsoft bridge .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards , </p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I guess I still need to learn more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...I currently have an O365 Business Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added the "Audio Conferencing" to my subscription and assigned the given phone number to my O365 account</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping that was all I needed to do dial into to host a meeting but clearly there is more to this than I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please direct me to the best MS source to answer the question "How do I actually use the audio conference phone number?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ken , </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder whether you want to manage the dial-in numbers . If you just want to use it for calls and meetings , when you create a Skype for Business meeting or call , the dial-in number will be displayed in the invitation email . You don’t need to change it
 . And the attendees can join the call via the invitation emails . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need to manage the dial-in numbers for your organization , you can refer to this link for more help (the PSTN in the link is the same with dial-in number):

            The backup wizard only comes in xp professional and xp media center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have either of those and if so did you have the Wizard before but not now?&nbsp; Have you used it before successfully and it has since disappeared?<br />
<br />
If you had it before then you are having the same problem I am.&nbsp; See my 2/13 post "Backup Wizard won't popup/display".<br />
There are some suggestions here under "How do I enable Backup Wizard" :&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/expertzone/newsgroups/reader.mspx?dg=microsoft.public.windows.mediacenter&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
<br />
But none of the suggestions have helped me so far.

    <title>Cannot identify root cause of connectivity issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mobispoke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot identify root cause of connectivity issues</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded four computers (desktop, 2 laptops, 1 tablet) to Windows 10. The newest of the laptops, a Lenovo E531 Thinkpad, has had various issues. I had done DISM and SFC commands and it wouldn't correct system files. I thought it was possible that
 the hard drive was corrupt and went ahead and got a new SDD&nbsp;and reinstalled Windows from a USB thumb drive using the Version 1511, 10586.0 build from online, then upgraded to the latest build at the time. The system files were once again corrupt and I found
 a helpful thread apount OpenCL.cll issues.&nbsp;It took some effort, but I was able to finally fix the file using DISM and an .iso file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought for sure all my problems would be over. But no. Sometimes from initial launch, and other times within 5 minutes of browsing the internet, any web page that is more than basic text and links begins to freeze up. Edge is worse, but happens in IE
 too. I have noticed that Cortana would fail to properly launch when try to give voice commands. Also, notifications freeze and can't be closed without going back to the home page. speedtest.comcast.net won't even load without saying the website fail and asking
 for me to recover the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only consistent error in event viewer was an error related to Cortana. I thought perhaps that was one manifestation of the errors so I tried different conditions: wired Ethernet connection, WiFi, different network etc. Problem persists. I finally turned
 off Cortana to revert to the simple search menu. It seems like things have improved but still not consistent as they are on the other PCs. I have reset winsock&nbsp; many many times. That doesn't seem to do anything than just a regular reset of the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated all the drivers to the latest versions. Firmware is also flashed to the latest version.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The problems surfaces in MS Edge, and Internet Explorer. It also seems to freeze the notifications, such that they appear on the screen but won't close and will not show an "x" in the upper right with which to close. Also, Cortana will fail to load speech
 recognition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Symantec Norton Security suite. I have uninstalled and tried to load with Defender. The problem persisted. I also ran the network troubleshooter and no problems were identified by the troubleshooter. netsh winsock reset solves the problem but only
 for a few minutes until it relapses. While Cortana is often listed as having an error, sometimes it's Skype or Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that one of the common warnings in Event ID is no. 8021. It references my desktop computer which is not set up as a server but I do share files between the two. Any correlation?</p>

            I turned off Firewall while connected in Private Network and no resolution to connectivity issue. I can submit this text online, but I cannot successfully load pages and programs that rely on secondary sources (so it seems). Again, notifications, Cortana
 and more complex web pages seem to freeze/break with this problem

<p>
</p><p>Doesn't necessarily sound like a Networking problem.&nbsp; Have you tried using msconfig to try to identify a possible cause?&nbsp;&nbsp;For some performance problems what I do is try lowering the priority of a suspect task or raising the priority of one which seems to
 be thrashing (e.g. using Task Manager).&nbsp; Also try getting some clues from Resource Monitor, especially if you still think Networking is the main issue.</p>

            <p>I haven't reproduced the issue this week. Perhaps because of the Build update to 10586.71? Cortana still has issues with accepted spoken commands, but that is secondary to the issue that now is apparently resolved. Thanks for the suggestions!</p>

 user account.Actually,surfing the web,etc,should be ran in a "Standard" user mode,for security reasons.....

    <title>Cannot open temp file Access Denied - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuart anderson grant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open temp file Access Denied</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 64 bit. In the last few weeks I have had problems opening some files downloaded from the internet. These are standard files from well-known reputable sources. The latest is Firefox setup 28.0.exe . (I thought my browser Chrome might
 be causing the trouble)</p>
<p>Others are fdminst.exe, Virtualbox-43.4-91207win.exe and Avast-browser-cleanup.exe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I click and get the usual message Run or Save. I click Run and get the error message ""Cannot open File C:\stuart\appdata\local\temp\filename .tmp". Sometimes the message has The name 7Zip as the title. I never use 7Zip and don't have it installed. The error
 messages vary slightly - even for two attempts at the same file! But are always about the same sometimes with Access Denied.</p>
<p>There are no other users.</p>
<p>Have I got a virus? I use AVG and also periodically Malwarebytes Anti-Malware but they have found nothing.</p>
<p>Finally I have downloaded some other files and have opened them with no difficultyy.</p>
<p>Can anyone help ?</p>

            <p>Being that the usual "temp" directory is different for each user, a possible work-around would be for you to create another user on your computer that has Administrator privilege.&nbsp; Then logoff your normal user account and log into your computer as this new
 user and try to do some of your installs while logged in as the new administrator user.&nbsp; This *should* use a brand-new clean "temp" directory to do the installation.&nbsp; Hopefully this will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else:&nbsp; On my computer, there is a "C:\Windows\Temp" directory.&nbsp; It is possible that this is the directory that it is trying to use instead of the usual user-profile temp directory.&nbsp; If you have this folder, you might want to right-click on it -&gt;
 Properties -&gt; Security (tab) and verify that "Administrators" have full access to this directory.</p>

</p><p>I am sorry to hear that, if I may ask. Are we talking about one Skype contact or multiple Skype contacts? If we are talking about one single contact, it can be possible that the one you are calling might be using multiple devices that has Skype on it. What
 we can recommend is to logout from other device and leave just only one online. After that, please try to initiate a test call.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t enable Bass Management etc. in the Audio Enhancement</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I really hope someone can help me out here.<br />
<br />
I have for a couple of days now tried to configure my Razer Tiamat 7.1 headset with my Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Audio PCI Express sound card and it's causing me a lot of trouble.<br />
<br />
I have configured everything accordingly to support the 7.1 feature but I am still missing my Sub in 7.1 mode.<br />
After trying several different solutions from other forums I've concluded i need to enable Flex Bass or the like.<br />
But to access this function I have to go to the audio enhancement tab which for some reason is locked for me.<br />
(See link)<br />
https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1026FF7D37CCB133!8733&amp;authkey=!AHe-QfoLMgpoXbY&amp;v=3&amp;ithint=photo%2cpng<br />
Seems as the check box that's usually there, is gone.<br />
How can I access this enhancement tab?<br />
<br />
Best regards</p>
<p>Patrick</p>

<h2>            Event id error code 8003.Unable to connect to internet.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Event id error code 8003.... windows vista.</p>
<p>I have a wireless router set up in my house. for my home computer. my sister came up with her laptop and got on my wireless internet. didnt have a problem before when she came up and connected to my network. now my computer saya it is connected to the network
 and the internet but the internet does not load. the event code says that my sisters laptop states that it is the master browser, i dont know what that is, i searched some fixes for it and upped the security from WEP to WAP2.&nbsp; even if i put in my routers ip
 address on&nbsp; internet explorer or google chrome it wont open it. but i can open it on my sisters laptop. I have verizon dsl, and the router is a westell 327w.&nbsp; i am getting very frustrated, especially because my sister went back home and left me her laptop
 until i can get my network,/computer fixed.</p>
<p>any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; also my computer says my memory is at 60% of the 2gb that it has. had a bad virus on it a couple months ago and had to erase the hard drive and start new..</p>

<p><span>Hi Mr. Dom,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A master browser is responsible for maintaining the Browser-list by adding and removing computers for a single subnet.</span></p>
<p><span>First check if the issue persists in the safe mode with networking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Steps to boot to Safe mode with networking</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Restart your computer if it is powered on.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tap the&nbsp;<strong>F8 key</strong> after your computer initially powers on.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once you see the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> menu you can stop tapping.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Use the&nbsp;<strong>up/down</strong> arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> and press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You should see drivers loading, and then&nbsp;<strong>Please wait.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You should then be at the Welcome Screen.</span></p>
<p><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer to get back to the normal mode</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know about the results in the safe mode with networking.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then try the below steps to disable computer browser service.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Look
 at the&nbsp; <strong>System Event log</strong> on your server and look for the error<strong>8003</strong>. Within that log, identify the “<strong>computer</strong>” that is announcing itself as a master browser.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 on to the computer identified in <strong>step 1</strong>, then open Services Administration panel by entering&nbsp;<strong>services.msc</strong>in the search box on the start menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you have&nbsp; <strong>Services</strong> open, look for an entry called “<strong>Computer Browser</strong>”. If that service is “<strong>started</strong>, you have found your culprit. If not, you may have to try the registry fix listed in step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double
 click on the “<strong>Computer Browser</strong>” service to edit it&nbsp;<strong>Stop</strong> the service and then change the type to<strong>Disabled</strong>” (from either&nbsp;<strong>Manual</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Automatic</strong>). Click<strong>OK</strong> to apply
 your changes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>That
 should have resolved the issue. You should check your main servers event logs periodically to be sure that the error does not show up. If the error continues to appear read step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 the following registry value on the computer: "<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Browser\Parameters\IsDomainMaster</strong>". Ensure that it is set to false. You probably have to reboot the machine to make the change take place.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Important This section</strong>, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However,
 serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more
 information about how to back up and restore the registry refer the below link.&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Back up the registry&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry</a><br />

<p><span>Hi Mr. Dom,&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you tried the steps mentioned about the “Computer browser”?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not tried the step mentioned in the previous post about the “computer browser” and the registry fix, try the steps and let us know the
 result</span></p>
<p><span>If you still face issues I would suggest that you disable the security software installed on the computer or try the clean boot procedure.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Important:</strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should
 not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled,
 your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press&nbsp;<strong>ENTER</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click&nbsp;
<strong>Continue</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the&nbsp;<strong>General</strong> tab, click the
<strong>Normal Startup</strong> option, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

<h2>            Installed TP-Link Archer T6E Wi-Fi adapter in my desktop. I lost the &#34;On-Off&#34; Wi-Fi switch of the setting page on Desktop.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: wi-fi "On-Off" switch disappeared</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed a TP-Link Archer T6E&nbsp;Wi-Fi adapter in my desktop. Everything worked as it should, no issue even if it was&nbsp;a Vista sp2 compatible driver detected by Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually I create a desktop Icon of the adapter&nbsp;giving me the opportunity to disconnect from my home&nbsp;network and or internet. When we dclk on that icon, we see the Wi-Fi setting page with the switch to&nbsp;turn it Off . If we close that page and again dclk on
 the icon the Wi-Fi setting page appears and we can turn the network ON. It is a classic feature available since Win XP. I have proceeded&nbsp; the same way on a recent Win 10 Home laptop without any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on my desktop PC, it did not work as usually. By doing this I lost the "On-Off" Wi-Fi switch of the setting page. The adapter works normally permitting&nbsp;to link my pc on the network. I tried&nbsp;all suggested ways published in many forums to solve that issue
 without success. There is, in&nbsp;the register, something that may create that problem but what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody there who got the same results and found a solution?</p>
<p>

    <title>Backup and recovery space management problem, with system image - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Backup and recovery space management problem, with system image</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Hi again, I was trying to do a system image restore with an image I created on a back
 up EX-HD a while back, the problem is it doesn't have enough space to create a new system image which I'm fine with but does have enough to save a backup of my data files on the drive I'm trying to do a recovery for. When I tried to restore it with the last
 system image I created a while ago, it told me the last data backup I've done was a while back and if I'd like to do a backup now, when I clicked yes it said I didn't have enough space for a system image. Seeing as how I only wanted to backup data files and
 not create a new system image I closed the window.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">I then decided to do a data backup from the backup and recovery panel with the backup now
 option assuming it was only going to backup the data files. After which about half a day of the recovery running, I checked the status and it is creating a NEW system image.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">My question is if I end the backup now in the middle of the creation of the new system
 image (since it would be a pointless system image since it's the system I'm trying to revert from) will it retain my older system image, or am I screwed and it has already deleted my older system image and I may as well let it finish creating this new one?</span>
