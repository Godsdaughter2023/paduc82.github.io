            I am confused! I subscribed to MSN about 15 years ago when I used dial up for internet access. I have broad band now but still use my MSN email (now upgraded to outlook). Also recently upgraded to IE 9 without any problem. I seached my year old computer&nbsp;and
 don't have MSN&nbsp;explorer (or MSN.exe). What will happen to my account when the new changes MS has announced for July-Sep 2013 take place?

            <p>I appreciate the rapid response and reassurance, but, even tho I'm tech savvy challenged,&nbsp;I am curious about several points: I checked some MSN websites and founds I apparently have MSN explorer v 10.2 installed on my computer even tho I can find no evidence
 of this;&nbsp;why does&nbsp;this upcoming update of MSN explorer email not affect my outlook email account (are they separate?)</p>

<br />
An email address is an email address. If you have your Outlook account configured to use your MSN account email then it's the same.<br />
<br />
What is this change you speak off. Do you have a URL describing it?<br />
<br />
All I know is everything is being or has been migrated to outlook.com...if you use the web to read your emails. I don't now if the POP settings will change. I doubt they will. They will just redirect.<br />
I use Gmail but do have a Hotmail, which is now outlook.com, email but I rarely use the Hotmail one so not an expert on what MS is doing.<br />

<p>If I'm not affected (since I don't use MSN explorer) why did I get this notice. There must be a lot of other individuals in the same boat.</p>

<p>Efectivamente, la entrada externa de micrófono del mando de Xbox360 posee un conector Jack de 2,5mm, que por lo general, debería soportar una conversión a Jack de tres y medio... Al fin y al cabo, el mando no se entera de lo que le estás conectando.</p>

<h2>            Playing Xbox 360 Through Xbox One Lag Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I been playing my 360 through my One for a while now and it works really but they are a couple of games that have lag issues that (if anyone has even tried playing a game console through a dvd recorder before will know what I am talking about) makes gameplay
 kind of difficult. I was wondering if anyone out there knew of a way fix this little issue such as splitting the connects or something like that?</p>

<p>Simple, you should not play anything that is time sensitive thru a pass-thru, the signal encoding and processing is going to introduce lag that you can't get around. &nbsp;It works fine for tv etc... but interactive things are going to be screwed.</p>
<p>The Xbox one is adding all of its interface etc... to the 360 signal, that takes time, and if that time is too much it makes the 360 unplayable. put the 360 on its own hdmi port and play on.</p>

            <p>well basically, you have a point, however its not xbox who decides if the game will stay or close, its really the developer that handles that. so the best is to address the developers.</p>

            Unless the two laptops are exactly the same spec, from exactly the same manufacturer, the batteries are in exactly the same condition and they conduct there time synchronisation via the internet at exactly the same time............. &nbsp;It's all primarily
 down to the computer components and the BIOS Clock, which isn't anything to do with Windows.

            <p>Hi Major Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use Safely remove hardware notification to&nbsp;unplug an USB drive on the computer.
</p>
<p>To safely remove a certain device, click the <strong>Safely Remove Hardware</strong> icon
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f29b00a99-7710-4268-9d2c-ca2781304967_46.jpg" />&nbsp;<font>in the notification area on the right side of the taskbar</font>,
 and then, in the list of devices, click the device that you want to remove. Windows will display a notification telling you it's safe to remove the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further reference, you can refer to the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/safely-remove-devices-from-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/safely-remove-devices-from-your-computer</a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This information also applies for Windows 8.1.</p>

            Hi, thanks for the rapid reply; unfortunately, your information doesn't work on my windows 8.1, sure wish it did.&nbsp; That advice did work great on my Windows 7 which is what the link you mentioned referred to.&nbsp; I have gone to some other help places with
 several asking essentially my same question, but the answers are really just discussion of how confusing the situation is as we can not find an icon to use. I need to hasty say that at one point, I thought I accidentally did see and&nbsp; use something&nbsp; in Windows
 8.1 but I sure can't find it again.&nbsp; So, in summary,Windows 8.1is what I have now with Microsoft office 2013 home and business and with a new HP printer and 5S IPhone&nbsp; many more challenges have&nbsp;shown their&nbsp;&nbsp;ugly so &nbsp;that I will post questions individually
 later.&nbsp;My equipment was all&nbsp; getting old and unreliable so I had a chance to upgrade during Black Thursday and Friday so jumped in realizing the for sure learning curve. &nbsp;Thank

            <p>Hi, thanks for the comeback; I am lost, please remember that I have only had less than a week experience with Windows 8.1 and don't yet understand a lot of basic terms, etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried several times to follow the instructions but no results for me.&nbsp; The last post states that the first one started from DT.&nbsp; I went there&nbsp; and go the same results for me&nbsp; and that is as follows:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With&nbsp;the cursor in the lower right corner, if I am lucky, up comes a ribbon with white icons (mostly it takes several attempts and some times I have the cursor up the right side.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clicking around, I finally get the white icons to turn to various colors;
 they are:&nbsp; Setting; Netgear34 (my router); speaker; 95; NOTIFICATIONS; Power; Keyboard.&nbsp; Clicking on NOTIFICATIONS as that word is mentioned&nbsp; in the first reply and right clicking the following options&nbsp;appear: hide 8 hrs, hide 3 hrs, and hide 1 hrs---I have
 no idea where&nbsp; what this is for.&nbsp; At no&nbsp; point have I seen an Icon pertaining to safely removing a thumb drive&nbsp; or anything else as I did with Windows 7.&nbsp; What in the world am I missing here?&nbsp; Thanks for your interest and please stay with me on this issue.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want the icon to appear permanently on display then click on the up arrow in the notification area and then, when the list of icons appears, click the Customize option. A list of all of the icons will now appear. Locate the safely remove hardware
 icon and click on the arrow in the dialogue box to the right of this option. From the drop down list select 'show icon and notification' and then press the OK button.</p>
<p>The safely remove hardware icon will now permanently be displayed in the notification area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you may try this:</p>
<div>Go to Start screen&nbsp;-&gt;write "run"-&gt;click on the "run" icon apear on top of the window -&gt;copy-paste this line:
<span><strong>rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL hotplug.dll</strong> -&gt; press
<strong>OK</strong> -&gt; a "<strong>safely remove hardware</strong>" window apears with the list of devices-&gt; mark the usb device you want the remove icon to apear when connected -&gt; click
<strong>'Properties'</strong> -&gt;</span></div>
<div>in <strong>'General' </strong>Tab choose <strong>'change settings'</strong> -&gt; choose "<strong>policies'</strong> tab - &gt; change the setting from
<strong>'quick</strong>...' to <strong>'better</strong>...' -&gt; press <strong>'OK'</strong> -&gt;</div>

            <p>Hi, thanks, I am in a rush trying to get ahead of a big storm on a trip to Columbia for my 3 months checkup but have taken the time to try your last post and no luck yet but did make some progress In my understanding of windows 8 and maybe 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do want a permanent icon for safe removal of some devices such thumbdrives.&nbsp; I again tried the notifications charm ( think that is the right name) I get when I go to settings on the right side as ex;plained&nbsp; in my post above and all I get is a window that
 has the 3 options of&nbsp;6, 3, and one hour hide---noting I can do within that white area (window---charm---whatever with my cursor changes anything; that is why I wonder if you are referring to Windows 7 or 8 and I&nbsp;have windows&nbsp;8.1 that I am trying to learn;&nbsp;
 Anyway, I then tried your second suggestion and&nbsp;I appreciate any thing I can try.&nbsp; At first, I was stumped as I did not see any place to type in 'run.'&nbsp; on DT but then I clicked on the down&nbsp;arrow and up jumped a couple dozen apps; I found 'run' and clicked
 on it and a white window came up and at the top it states 'Safely remove thrumbdrive' but&nbsp;below the line with the big blank window, I can find&nbsp;no way to enter anything and 'Properties and the other command, I forget' are&nbsp;both grayed out---there is no way I
 can get any action with my cursor.&nbsp; So, here I am, probably on the wrong page as they say but still want&nbsp;your help and I want to learn.&nbsp; I will be back Saturday and&nbsp;do get emails on my cell phone---while I can't try anything away from my DT, I can read an
 study anything you might feel disposed to write.&nbsp; Thanks so much and Semper Fi Ben&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this issue specific to a particular device? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps that you are following up until now is using the Charms bar setting to remove the external device using Safely remove hardware. Try doing it from the desktop screen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connect the external device such as an USB device and follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>If you are on the Start screen, Press <strong>Windows+D</strong> buttom. You would reach desktop screen. Then, click on small arrow symbol pointing towards the top at the bottom right corner on the screen on the taskbar wherein you would find other options
 such as Volume, network icon, Language and Date and time. After you click on the Arrow, you would find the the list of devices that are connected. Select the device and then safely remove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know about the results. </p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for all of your information.&nbsp; As I have posted several times elsewhere, I have upgraded computer, have windows 8.1 installed, office home and business 2013, new keyboard and mouse, new all in one printer,&nbsp;and several of my previous problems have
 gone away or &nbsp;solved by help from this great site and from others.&nbsp; Yet, new equipment poses new problems as it has since changing from Windows 95 through the stages.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As far as this problem of safely removing devices,&nbsp;I still have it, or at least part of the time:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On a daily basis, I do not have a green arrow in the notification area.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is here that I need to make a comment.&nbsp; Being new to 8.1, when help mentioned 'notification area' I immediately thought of 'notification' as it appears when you open the charm area;
 it was only after I review an old Dummies manual, did I remember that the right side of the task bar has been referred to as the 'notification area' and this duplication has caused me a lot of confusion.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But, with that said, I have seen a green arrow in the right side of the task bar a few times but it disappears; when I did click on it, it only referred me to a thumb drive I&nbsp; had in a USB port and did not mention my IPhone 5s which I also had plugged in
 and wanted to disengage.&nbsp; On another occasion, I had a Nook plugged into a USB port and when I was ready to disengage, there was a notice on the Nook itself that it&nbsp; was safe to do so,&nbsp; but no arrow in the notification area of the right side of task bar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With that said, relatives trying to help me&nbsp; understand, have said that the green arrow only appears when something is plugged in to a USB port and that it is not a constant thing that gives options when clicked on; further that when my IPhone is not&nbsp; syncing,
 it is safe to remove it.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, as you can see, I am totally confused.&nbsp; I intend to post a new question indicating the equipment that I now have.&nbsp; So, thanks so much for all your help.&nbsp; Semper Fi Ben</p>

            <p>Hi, sorry for the delay in getting back but I'll use holidays and such as my excuse.&nbsp; At different times, I have tried all of the suggestions in this post for which I thank all of you; however, I can't seem to follow some of them.&nbsp; I am learning this new
 system but slowly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First question today is, where on the 'start' screen is there a place&nbsp; to type in 'run' or anything for that matter?&nbsp; I have a number of tiles but I find none as suggested.&nbsp; I do get to 'run' by going to the charm 'search' and type 'run' in.&nbsp; I pasted as
 suggested an got the 'safely remove hardware' window/properties/general/policies and changed setting to better then OK.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is my situation as I know it.&nbsp; When I insert a thumb&nbsp; drive, a small icon of it and a green check mark appears in the right side of the task bar; If I click on it, I get the opportunity to learn if it is ok to remove the thumb drive.&nbsp; HOWEVER, when
 I remove the thumb drive, the icon and green check mark disappear and never have I seen a menu there to select what devices you want to include.&nbsp; Further, when I insert a line from my IPhone 5s, nothing ever appears.&nbsp; I have noticed that when I plug in my
 wife's new nook to charge, the nook itself will have a message that it is safe&nbsp; to remove it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some&nbsp; have suggested that in the case of the IPhone, it data is being transferred, an icon with the green check mark will appear for me&nbsp; to follow; but, if there&nbsp; is no icon and green check mark on the task bar, no data is being transferred thus it is safe&nbsp;
 to remove.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would appreciate any comments; I can certainly get a long with this situation if I can't get a permanent icon and listing of the devices I use.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As to my question regarding not finding run in the 'start' windows, is it possible that the references cite 32 bite and I have 64.&nbsp; Most of the problems I&nbsp; have&nbsp; had trying to follow the suggestions is due to my inexperience and lack of knowledge of 8.1
 but I am making progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks and Semper Fi Ben</p>

    <title>Cannot access System Reserved Partition to resize it to help resolve - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot access System Reserved Partition to resize it to help resolve Update Error 0x800F0922 for WIndows 8.1 Update KB2919355</h2>
                    <p>I still have the same error 0x800F0922 while trying to install 9355 Update and tried MiniTool Partition Wizard and can create Unallocated space next to the System Reserved Partition but&nbsp;when I try to use the wizard to extend&nbsp;or&nbsp;resize the System Reserved
 Partiton all of the tools are grayed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a link/suggestion on how to access the System Reserved Partition so I can extend it ? I see other posts have the same issue but have not seen a way to access the partition or Minitool functions.&nbsp; Do I need to apply the changes to C drive
 first&nbsp;to&nbsp;create the unallocated space and then retry the Wizard tools? </p>
<p>I currently have 128mb in SR Partition and&nbsp;there is no free space&nbsp;so I am looking to increase it to approx. 1GB to allow room for the update to work. see screen shot.</p>
<p>System has&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit with a clean installation - this was not an upgrade. &nbsp;I do not have a VPN program so extending the partition looks like the only possible fix but the tools in MiniTool are not accessible like C drive?? see below</p>
<p>I posted another question awhile ago and tried all of the suggestions so I am down to this last potential&nbsp;fix which hopefully works if I can get access to the partition/tools.
</p>
<p>Also tried the suggestion to rename the Distribution folder and that did not work.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf8ad6d1-f674-49f1-b081-91df86673c0a" height="382" width="567" /></p>

<p>Tools accessible when creating unallocated space. </p>
<p>I am just a regular computer user and do not have the skills to repair Windows or reformat my entire system and do not want to lose the current set up so any&nbsp;help on this is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Think you're making it too big ..&nbsp; keep it Less than 500mb.&nbsp; So 499mb or less is typical.</p>
<p>1.4gb partition needs 1gb minimum free space for shadow copy, if I remember correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than 500mb partitions only need 50mb free space for shadow copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think you would need to press the apply button on top before you can proceed doing things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you make the unallocated space then you can expand into it</p>

            <p>Mike P -I tried the suggestion in the link which is similar to other solutions but after getting thru the process and&nbsp;installing 9355 again&nbsp;it stopped as always during restart&nbsp;and got the same error 0x800F0922 . It seems&nbsp;this problem&nbsp;has to do with&nbsp;my System
 Resreved Parttion but when I asked the computer manufacture&nbsp;that set up my system&nbsp;they said you cannot extend that hidden partition.<strong> I have read hundreds of posts saying people have access and have&nbsp;resized / extended this partition.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I did make the Unallocated space and retried MiniTool both with the&nbsp;WIndows&nbsp;program and their Bootable CD they offer which I used to boot directly into the CD&nbsp;program&nbsp;which should have kept Windows closed and the partition available &nbsp;- nothing works to unlock
 the System Reserved Partition.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a way to get access to the hidden System Reserved Partition that I can only see with MiniTool?

            <p>The Mini Partition tool has a problem with the MSR (128 GB) partition.&nbsp; One option is to delete the partition, extend or resize the other partitions and leave 128 GB of unallocated space in the same relative position as it is now.&nbsp; Then you can use Diskpart
 to recreate the partition in that 128 GB of unallocated space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you recreate the partition, make sure the 128 GB is the only unallocated space on the drive.&nbsp; Windows will run without the MSR partition, so you can wait until you boot back into Windows to recreate it or boot to recovery media which has a Command Prompt
 Window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand, my response is for your question about resizing a partition.&nbsp; I have not gotten into the 9355 situation but I was not aware there were any such problems related to updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Diskpart, you would select the correct disk and then use the command below to recreate the MSR partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>create par msr</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not have to be formatted, just created.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I should have included&nbsp;some system information -&nbsp;Windows 8.1 64x Pro [clean install] on a SSD set up from factory&nbsp;as GPT / UEFI&nbsp; partitions/bios - this is new factory&nbsp;set&nbsp;up&nbsp;back in January and I have not made any changes to the system other than to update
 drivers and Windows Auto Updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> new information I just recently read that&nbsp;in a clean install
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">of</span>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 8.1 if set up as&nbsp;a GPT/UEFI system then Windows automatically&nbsp;creates the SR Partition @ 128mb with no drive letter =&nbsp;instead of the 350mb needed for the

 Its only thru&nbsp;Auto Update to get this latest file for unknown reasons?&nbsp; Tried MS Support and they only wanted me to pay up front for support and offered zero solutions, for their problems with their 8.1 OS. and the&nbsp;9355 update.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Is there a way in WIndows to add a&nbsp;drive letter to the GPT System Reserved Partition
</span>?&nbsp;which I believe will allow MiniTool to then&nbsp;access&nbsp;that portion of my drive to resize it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in a post that you can create&nbsp;unallocated space [did this]&nbsp;between the C drive and SRP&gt;&nbsp; then copy the SRP/and files&nbsp;to the unallocated space @ 350mb or more&nbsp;&gt; then delete the old SRV&gt;&nbsp;then&nbsp;Windows will use the new location the files have been relocated
 to&nbsp;?&nbsp; would this work and what do you do with the unallocated space that would be between the EFI and SRP.&nbsp;&nbsp;Already created unallocated space next to SRP&nbsp;but cannot do anything with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saltgrass - thanks for your recommendation which&nbsp;is similar to above - but I am not sure how to use DISKPART to create the GPT partition and move the files which are apparently critical for booting. &nbsp;I have limited computer knowledge but any&nbsp;solutions are&nbsp;appreciated.</p>

            I am having a similar issue. I installed Windows 8.1 64bit pro on SSD then accepted the free Windows 10 pro update.&nbsp; Everything seemed fine for a while, then when I booted up months later, the computer updates failed. Cannot update Windows 10 or Security&nbsp;
 files because Windows cannot update the system reserved partition. II have tried the windows update troubleshooter with no avail. Error code 0xc1900200&nbsp; have tried several Partition Software tools and none of them allow resizing the SRP.&nbsp; &nbsp;Are there any reasonable
 solutions out there?&nbsp;

<h2>            Cannot activate Windows 8&#47;8.1 after using PC Refresh &#40;Error Code 0xC004C003&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I bought a HP Envy notebook a few months back, which came with Windows 8. I soon upgraded it&nbsp;to Windows 8.1, but started experiencing some stability issues over the last couple of weeks. Last night I used the in-built PC Refresh option in Settings, which
 reset it back to Windows 8. When I logged in, it said that Windows was no longer activated (error code 0xC004C003 - The activation server determined that the specified product key has been blocked). Thinking it was because I was now running Windows 8 again,
 I redownloaded the Windows 8.1, but I'm still getting the activation error. I can't afford for this PC to become unactivated and locked out.. how can I get the activation server to recognise that I do in fact have a legitimate key?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have also contacted HP and are waiting on them to get back to me. They want to send me some recovery media, but&nbsp;they want to send it via courier and as I work on the road, there's nowhere for me to receive it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Shehaal,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might see this error if you're using an invalid product key. You'll need to buy a new product key, or if you bought a PC with Windows preinstalled, contact the PC
 manufacturer for the original key.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you recently used Add features to Windows 8 to get an edition of Windows with more features, you might see this error if you immediately updated to Windows 8.1 in
 the Windows Store. To fix this problem, you'll need to contact a <b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Customer Support representative</a></b>.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My system came with Windows 8 preinstalled by HP, and I haven't used the Add features option. The product key has worked fine up until I used the "Refresh your PC" option under Settings. How can it be invalidated by using functionality built into Windows?
 It's not like I've completely uninstalled and reinstalled Windows, or tried to use it across multiple computers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>MS phone support advised the key is tied to the BIOS.. there apparently isn't any number as such, it's encoded in the hardware so it doesn't seem possible for HP to just give me the key as there's nothing to give.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had already read both of those links before posting. I'm more than happy to activate Windows--but you and/or HP need to
<em>let</em> me do it. In saying that, I don't think it's fair that I be placed in a position where I need to fork out $250 for a new license just because the system Microsoft has designed is not fool proof. The Refresh your PC functionality is clearly broken
 if it causes an installation to become invalidated upon first use, when the entire idea of it is to simply clear out the rubbish and problems on a hard drive without doing the traditional format/reinstall of days gone by. Such a practice is double-dipping
 for my money&nbsp;if I've ever seen it. There should be a clear warning to state that using it is probably going to cause activation issues if using an OEM license.</p>

            &nbsp;I have been a huge Microsoft customer since way back - I got into computers before there were PC's. &nbsp;I &nbsp;now have Windows 8.1 which is one of the biggest, time consuming and costly mistakes I have ever made. &nbsp;I lost 40 (+/-) programs, some of which cannot
 be restored, others will cost quite a bit of money. &nbsp;My family uses both PC's and Apple products - and I think I am going to consider Apple in the future. I sorely miss Windows 7 - which I can't get back except at an expense from Microsoft, and will still
 be without the programs I used almost daily. &nbsp;Some of the programs that were built in and free under Windows 7 are gone in Windows 8.1, and cost to be added! The service from Microsoft (India?) is full of support but I can only understand a few words, lots
 of repeating. wasted time, and with their help I have again lost even more programs. I think someone should work up &nbsp;a class action suit against Microsoft for this wonderful Windows 8.1.

            I agree.&nbsp; Microsoft says it can't help, HP says reset to factory, but with the media you still have the same problem.&nbsp; This is so disrespectful to customers,&nbsp; They need a better solution.&nbsp; I would like to be compensated for work time lost due to this foolishness.

            <p>The exact same thing happened to me. My product key is blocked. I tried to contact Microsoft they told me to contact the manufacturer. I contacted HP and now they are asking me to pay 100 dollars for the service.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what to do. I paid to have this laptop with Windows 8, and now that I need it they blocked it and I can no longer use my laptop. How is that fair ?&nbsp;</p>

            I have had exactly the same problem as Shehaal.&nbsp; Started having problems with HP envy when I bought a new subscription to Office 365.&nbsp; Download wouldn't work properly and eventually&nbsp;I decided to do a system refresh.&nbsp; Office 365 downloaded fine but my windows
 8 will now not activate.&nbsp; I am just out of guarantee period for my laptop and HP want money for recovery disks, or I can by a new Windows licence - this is so unfair when I have a genuine OEM windows key that just doesn't work.

            <p>I am encountering the same situation as well. &nbsp;Purchased an ASUS laptop a while back. &nbsp;Pre-installed with Windows 8. &nbsp;Later updated to 8.1. &nbsp;The hard drive began experiencing issues, was just outside warranty, so ASUS would not replace the drive. &nbsp;Not a
 problem, purchases a new drive, went to re-install windows with a fresh buil. &nbsp;I asked ASUS for a Windows reinstall/recovery ISO, they do not provide those. &nbsp;Not by mail, not by download. &nbsp;I have to mail in my laptop to them, they keep it for several weeks,
 they mail it back, I foot the bill. &nbsp;Ridiculous. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Windows 8 license key which I purchased and own as part of buying this computer. &nbsp;So I tried to download the Windows 8 installer from MS, but they would not accept my license key. &nbsp;I was able to download and install 8.1, but I am unable to activate
 it because the key is an 8.0 license key. &nbsp;I spent several hours on MS support and at the end of the day, they basically said "you have to get an ISO from the manufacturer." &nbsp;And ASUS says "we don't give out ISOs." &nbsp;So I am out an OS, because of a technicality,
 because there is no earthly technology reason this cannot be activated, it's all simply licensing semantics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 20 years of experience managing a large IT department. &nbsp;I have spent innumerable hours doing my level best to ensure our many MS products are properly licensed. &nbsp;I've enrolled our company for Office365, through which we funnel thousands of dollars
 per month to MS. &nbsp;I know this is all not relevant, but it is all to say I do take licensing very seriously, and I do stay on top of it. &nbsp;But this licensing policy/system for Windows 8 is absurd. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a license key for windows 8. &nbsp;I own a license key for Windows 8. &nbsp;I have Windows 8 installed on the same device on which it was originally licensed. &nbsp;And yet, I am unable to use that license key to activate a copy of windows on the very same
 machine. &nbsp;Yes, ASUS is annoying as well, but at the end of the day, I am trying to activate MS software, not ASUS software. &nbsp;There should be, at the very least, a way to just call in and activate it over the phone after doing a fresh install, just like there
 was a way to do that with Windows 7 and previous versions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is these type of "improvements" to the Windows operating system which make Ubuntu an increasingly attractive option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incredibly frustrated, would love to hear back from an MS rep as to how this represents an improvement in my Windows experience. &nbsp;</p>

            It is only 40$ to have them send you a USB recovery, which reinstalls all. Go To HP support &amp; hit Buy a product and then tell them serial number and you can buy a USB or Disk. PatG

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When do you get this error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are zdcn50.dll error message. These errors are generally going to be caused by if the file being unreadable or corrupted - preventing your computer from correctly reading the information &amp; settings it contains inside. This
 will not only prevent your PC from reading the actual file, but also prevent your computer from being able to process the files it requires to run the programs / settings that your system will be needing to run.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ZDCN50.dll error may be caused by the following situations:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>ZDCN50.dll file may be mistakenly deleted by someone, computer antivirus or system cleaning tools.</li><li>ZDCN50.dll file is corrupted or damaged by virus infections.</li><li>Some applications were installed or uninstalled improperly.</li><li>The configuration entries of ZDCN50.dll file is still active in the system registry.</li><li>There may be something wrong with your computer hardware.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>As you are getting .dll file corruption. So, there might be a chance that there is some system file corruption. T<span><span>ry to
</span><span>check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong><span>System File Checker (SFC)</span></strong> tool.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

<h2>            HP Laserjet 1320N will no longer add to my computers.</h2>
                    I have a HP Laserjet 1320n that will not connect with my computer using the add pinter.&nbsp; It appears that the printer sees the netwwork as the the light at the cable connection on the printer lights up. I have tried 2 different computers and 2 different
 1320n printers. Also have another 1320n at a different location and different network with the same problem. They had worked fine up until I removed them about a week ago to work on them, now they won't install.&nbsp; I have windows 10 and they worked fine up til
 now. Wondering if there was a window update causing the problem.

            <p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>You may try resetting the sidebar to default settings and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;By resetting to the default settings, you’ll have to add your gadgets back to the sidebar.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First make sure that the sidebar process is completely closed.</p>
<p>Go to Task Manager to make sure that there are no sidebar.exe processes running. If there are, just right-click and use End Process on each of them.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open up a windows explorer window and then paste the following into the location bar: %localappdata%\microsoft\Windows Sidebar</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will open up the Sidebar gadgets folder.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rename Settings.ini file. This file contains your current sidebar configuration.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click start and open windows sidebar, you’ll notice that a new Settings.ini is created in the above mentioned folder immediately.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows side bar now should work with minimum gadgets.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may add the gadgets manually and check if it is working.</p>
<p>Refer to the link “Windows Sidebar and gadgets”</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Desktop-gadgets-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Desktop-gadgets-overview</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to create a new user account and check whether the issue persists. Follow the steps mentioned in the article given below to create a new user account.</p>
<p><strong>Create a user account</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>Start-&gt;Run&gt;Type in "regedit"-&gt;OK-&gt; Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -&gt; Software -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; Currentversion -&gt; Internet Settings -&gt; Zones -&gt; if there is a weird thing that looks like an l, delete that folder and restart your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>See if any of these method helps or not.</p>

    <title>Unable to install Microsoft Mobile Mouse 3000 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install Microsoft Mobile Mouse 3000</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new "Microsoft Mobile Mouse 3000" and went to install &amp; use it 2 days ago, without success. My OS is Vista. I have read and acted upon an extensive amount of troubleshooting advice on various microsoft and windows websites and have spent several
 hours taking the recommended actions.&nbsp;<strong><em> I am now seeking a solution to this. I suspect&nbsp;that missing software/drivers may be the cause.</em></strong> I am detailing ALL the actions I have taken so I don't simply get advised to do what has already
 been done in an attempt to correct this problem.&nbsp; If you look at my point 4 of "steps taken" down further, you can see where software appropriate for Vista is apparently missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web addresses I have consulted:</p>

<p><strong>Actions taken and results</strong></p>
<font>
<p>Initial Steps taken to install Microsoft Mobile Mouse 3000</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Plugged in mouse usb stick - Press appropriate buttons on usb stick then mouse - lights flash (assorted red &amp; green) for about a minute or so. Wait for flashing to stop.</p>
<p>First time - nothing, 2nd time installs as generic software - dialog box "Found New Hardware - Windows needs to install device driver for your Unknown Device". Follow through the dialog boxes - message shown is "Device driver successfully installed". No
 cursor movement, no response at all from mouse.</p>
<p>NOTE: I'm using this on the same surface as every other mouse I've used for the last 2 1/2 years, including another microsoft wireless mouse - the MS Wireless Optical Mouse 2000 which worked perfectly &amp; installed seamlessly on the same computer.</p>
<p><strong>Proceed to Microsoft website for troubleshooting information: </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>All 3 usb ports have had this currently useless piece of garbage plugged in &amp; above steps followed - same result which is NOTHING</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Ran Fix-It from this link - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices Clicked on "apply this fix". Message displayed - "there is no driver software installed for Unknown device.... blah,
 blah" Problem reperts &amp; solutions dialog box opened - followed all prompts - message is "no new solutions found". Further message displayed was "install a driver for this device The driver for Unknown device is not installed. Install the lastest driver for
 the device". I followed up on each &amp; every suggestion in each and every dialog box that appeared.</p>
<p>No Solution</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Following suggestions online - running windows update to possible update driver</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Followed next lot of instructions: </p>
</font>
<p><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398 The Microsoft wireless keyboard or mouse does not respond as expected or responds intermittently.<br />
Followed everything here except trying on another computer - because there isn't one to try.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I resynced, tried other ports, fresh batteries, no interference, and this (incredibly frustrating) instruction on this&nbsp;webpage&nbsp;:</p>
</font><font><font><em>Method 5: Install the latest software </em></font></font>
<p><font>Download and install the latest Microsoft IntelliPoint and/or IntelliType software. For more information, visit the following Microsoft Web site: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx?category=MK Guess what??!!!?!?!?!. There is NO
 option give for a driver or the software for Vista. It's there for Win 7 &amp; 8, and for 64 bit versions of XP, even for Win 2000 and for Mac.........BUT NOT FOR VISTA!!</font></p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/wireless-mobile-mouse-3000 - here is another link for the software &amp; again lacking the option for Vista</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Directed to video for how to sync - video not there; searched using variety of terms - not found</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>Remove all other mouse software - Control Panel &gt; Mouse - PS/2 mouse. After restart, driver info is still present but Uninstall &amp; Disable options are greyed out (USB mouse is not connected)- .</p>
<p>Vewed all installed programs - Microsoft Intellimouse is not present</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly - followed instructions to manually update driver via Control Panel. Continued with these instructions "</p>
<p><font>clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.‌In Device Manager, locate the device you want to update, and then double-click the device name. Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions."</font></p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>I did this twice. First result was "Windows was unable to install your Unknown Device....could not find driver software for your device".</p>
<font>2nd time returned a different result "Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device. windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it.....The driver installation file
 for this device is missing a necessary entry. This may be because the INF was written for Windows 95 or later. Contact your hardware vendor" That's Microsoft, isn't it? It also suggested visiting manufacturer's website -&nbsp;Microsoft again - for the software.
 As you can see above, there was no option for Vista in the software for this mouse.</font>

            <p>Finally found a solution (basically a work-around)&nbsp;from Microsoft Hardware support&nbsp;by using the software for a different mouse: the Wireless Mobile Mouse 3000 with Nano. I don't know exactly what the Nano means in this context, but at least&nbsp;I now have a
 functioning mouse.</p>

<h2>            Getting banned for calling a kid names for Team killing on Ranked in Rainbow Six Siege&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So today I was playing rainbow six siege and went into ranked minding my business until some kid and his friend&nbsp;decide&nbsp;to team kill thus putting me and the bottom of the leaderboard with no kills and all deaths. Then he sends me a message saying worst teammate ever which I would definitely respond and talk back and then after a while I call him a fag which was a mistake in my part but after I had said that a minute later he says “Have fun with your communication ban after saying that derogatory homophobic&nbsp;term” then putting a smiley face which for any kid would tick them off even more. I’m very suprised on how&nbsp;quick you could&nbsp;get banned and how someone kid would know about it before it even happened</p>

            <p>Hi, note that the Xbox Enforcement Team deals with all matters regarding suspensions, and they don't actively use or monitor these forums.&nbsp; My guess is that your suspension was due to the use of a word which violates the Xbox Live Code of Conduct, and the Enforcement Team is known to act very quickly on many commonly-used derogatory words when they are reported.&nbsp; For more information on the Xbox Live Code of Conduct:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/legal/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.xbox.com/legal/codeofconduct</a></p>
<p><br /></p><p>In the future, I would advise against using language that violates the Code of Conduct, and block/mute players rather than responding to them with foul language- instructions to do so can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic2-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic2-1</a></p><p><br /></p><p>If you feel the player should be reported to the Xbox Enforcement Team, instructions to do so can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic2-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic2-0</a></p>

            <p>Thank you for the information but I am very upset for how long the suspension lasts (14 days) and I know I have had suspensions isn’t he past but it seems kind of long for a one time thing</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Suspension length varies depending on severity of the issue as well as previous enforcement actions. They get longer with each suspension which is why it's now at 14 days.&nbsp;</p>

            I had this happen to me tonight. I was playing with 2 friends and we&nbsp;had 2 random players on our team lets call them Player 1 &amp; Player 2. In a certain Round Player 1 teamkills friend 1, I avenged my friend and killed player 1, player 2 then teamkills myself.
 I sent a message to player 2 asking what their problem was and said a certain curse word starting with f*** and I receive an instant suspension from my message as player 2 reported my message and I report both players for unsporting behavior which I believe
 Microsoft Legitimately don't care/investigate. So I'm punished from talking with my friends for 3 Days now in messages &amp; parties thanks to team-killers because I sent a curse word to them after they team killed us. I contact support to find out I have to wait
 24 hours until I can lodge a Case Review explaining my side. I feel this is very pathetic and unbelievable on Microsoft's behalf, this makes me not want to continue playing on Xbox if Microsoft doesn't punish the real s

<p>you admit to using profanity, that breaks the code of conduct and as you were reported results in Enforcement action. You have reported the other players which is the correct thing to do, your mistake was sending the message. In future report, mute and block
 and don't respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a lot of useful information at&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com</a> on how to deal with issues of bad behavior from other gamers. Also the code of conduct is there and worth refreshing
 yourself on.</p>

<p>What's the point in reporting for unsporting behavior if nothing happens to them? Do players get investigated and banned/suspensions for receiving reports of team killing under unsporting behavior? Seems like The priorities aren't straight.</p>

            it goes against their reputation. as stated if you come across players acting like this mute and block them, that way in future you will be unlikely to get them in a team/multiplayer match. The priorities are correct, you unfortunately found out the hard
 way, that using profanity, if reported will get you a suspension. Xbox Live is rated at E for everyone, we all agreed to the code of conduct when we created our accounts and in doing so agreed that if we violated the code of conduct, we accept the punishment
 for doing so.

            So really what you are saying is that thise that cause the unnessecary rage and frustration do NOT get a ban or suspension but you say one bad word out of frustration, instant 3 day coms ban while the instigators have a bad rep which isnt something that
 can be checked quickly before starting a game and you say the priorities are right? Why do people pay money to use the service which is of little to no help on stopping a problem before it starts? I suppose its easier to impliment an algarithim that flicks
 all the other complaints out and just focuses on swearing. Not overly happy to have just had the live renewed for you lot to do a whole lot of nothing in prevention.
