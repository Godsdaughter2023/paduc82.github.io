<h2>            Asha 302 Message key on phone will not work</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I was wondering if someone could help. Bought the Asha 302 to day and the message key on the front will not work. As soon as I press it it says to choose a shortcut to personalise this key. When I try to go into settings,then my shortcuts and then message
 key it does absolutely nothing!! It won't let me assign the key and dosen't list any options as it actually should, so basically the message key on the front does absolutely nothing.....any ideas??</p>

<p>Hi Violentbeauty,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia discussions board!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you first press on the enveloppe button on your Asha 302, it will indeed ask you to choose a shortcut. To select a shortcut, press OK then select the shortcut wanted: for example "new message" or "conversations". When you press on the same button again
 it should open the location you had selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is any issue, and it does not open the location selected, I advise you to perform a soft reset: type *#7780# on the keypad, original lock code is 12345.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then press on the enveloppe button again and repeat the steps above. This button should now allow you to access your messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on and feel free to post any other questions you may have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have followed the above advice and the keys are still not working, then you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care point for them to take a look at.</p>

<h2>            Outlook icons &#40;shortcuts or files&#41; - including outlook.exe in Program Files will not work - can only open with run outlook &#47;recycle</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>&nbsp;XP Professional SP3.&nbsp; Outlook 2007 (though the problem started with 2003 and upgrading didn't resolve it).</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>When I click on Outlook shortcuts or even the Outlook executable in Program Files or on desktop or anywhere, nothing happens.&nbsp; The ONLY way to open Outlook is to go to run and type outlook /recycle and enter and then it opens and functions normally.&nbsp; Typing
 outlook or outlook.exe alone without the switch does nothing.&nbsp; I don't remember how I discovered the switch when it first occurred (well over a year ago - maybe two) but I'm tired of having to open Outlook this way.&nbsp; I've used this same Office Enterprise 2007
 disk on several different machines running XP and Vista both (using the proper product keys from the other packages but keeping those disks unused in case I ever need to replace this one - so it isn't anything on the disk itself) and it works fine on those
 other computers.&nbsp; The fact that it started in 2003 before even upgrading support this as well.&nbsp; In fact, both 2003 and 2007 versions worked fine on those other computers but not this one - so it isn't the version or the disks or even the OS version.&nbsp; I tried
 to fix it when it first started in Outlook 2003 but had same results (just didn't ask for help then - should have done System Restore but wasn't as knowledgeable about computers at the time).</p>
<p>Adding /recycle to the target in the shortcut results in an error message "unrecognized switch" - even though it works in run.&nbsp; This is also true with Quick start icon which simply gives error (since it seems to automatically add the switch when placed there).</p>
<p>Repair makes no difference.</p>
<p>Uninstalling and re-installing Outlook (even the entire Office Suite (Enterprise)) makes no difference.&nbsp; I've even done it using Revo and that didn't make any difference either.</p>
<p>Creating new shortcurts (directly or from the program file)&nbsp;makes no difference.&nbsp; Putting shortcuts in Quick Start makes no difference.</p>
<p>Scanned with Malwarebytes, Microsoft Malicious Software Tool, Pandasoft, MSE, OneCare, Avast and HijackMe - nothing significant (a few tracking cookies) detected.&nbsp; I'm thinking of trying Combofix but I really don't know how to read that output very well
 and know it's a bit dangerous if not used properly.&nbsp; MSE is normal software with Malwarebytes run about monthly or so.&nbsp; All other software removed properly after testing with removal tools where applicable - never had more than one installed at the same time
 (except Malwarebytes which I never removed once installed but have set to scan only on command).</p>
<p>SFC /scannow comes up no integrity violations found.&nbsp; Chkdsk /f /r comes up clean.&nbsp; Problem occurs in Safe Mode and in Clean Mode.&nbsp; Problem occurs whether or not security software (see above) is activated or deactivated.&nbsp; Startup repair detects no problems.&nbsp;
 Event viewer shows no errors - clicking the icons simply doesn't work (no error messages, no event recorded, nothing).</p>
<p>What is /recycle and why does that work in run but&nbsp;not in a shortcut (I mean, I know technically what it is from looking it up, but WHY is it the only way to get Outlook to open and why does it only work from the run command and not when inserted into a
 shortcut)?&nbsp; Why is it necessary at all (it isn't on any of my other computers)?&nbsp; How do i get shortcuts to work (or even the program executable file itself - with or without the switch)?&nbsp; Is there some entry in the registry causing this (I'm a systems engineer
 and comfortable with the registry but can find nothing to change to resolve the problem)?</p>
<p>All other programs (including all other Office programs) work fine and all other shortcuts work fine.&nbsp; Ran LNK and EXE association fixes - no change.</p>
<p>Have not tried system repair/upgrade on XP - seems a bit too radical (not willing to try and be forced to uninstall installed SPs and re-install hundreds of updates and the SPs unless someone can provide documentation of this problem being caused by XP and
 that this will solve it) and anyway can't see how XP could be the cause as it works fine on other XP computers.&nbsp; And if XP, why only Outlook and no other programs?&nbsp; It doesn't make sense.&nbsp; I know it sounds like malware but I have checked as noted above and
 found nothing (and have never had to remove any trojans or any major infections from the system since first purchased).</p>
<p>I'm open to suggestions.&nbsp; I'd really like to know what /recycle does and why that makes it work (and is the only thing that makes it work).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance.&nbsp; If I can provide any additional information, just ask.</p>
<p>I first posted in Installation Forum, but they said they didn't know answer (after some very unlikely and totally worthless suggestions) and specifically sent me here - providing the link and everything.&nbsp; I know this really isn't the right place and that
 was, but I could really use some help so I very much appreciate anything you have to suggest.</p>

            The /recycle command switch says to reuse the existing Outlook window instead of trying to start a new process.&nbsp; The symptoms you describe indicate that Outlook is already running when you try to open it again.&nbsp; You can verify this by examining the Processes
 tab of Task Manager (press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to start it).&nbsp; An OUTLOOK.EXE process already running indicaztes that Outlook had trouble closing the last time it ran.&nbsp; Here are some troubleshooting procedures:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/outlookdoesntclose.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>Thanks for the most insightful reply I've received thus far from the more than dozen forums in which I've posted this question - in fact, for the only reply that was even potentially useful (though I tried all suggestions even those that were obviously absurd
 just in case I was losing my mind and missing something obvious).&nbsp; Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be the case.&nbsp; I checked both Task Manager and Process Explorer (every entry) for outlook.exe or<strong>anything</strong> from the Outlook folder (intending
 to delete that too just in case) and there was nothing there.&nbsp; I did this right after startup and after confirming, the icons still wouldn't work.&nbsp; It was still an excellent suggestion well worth the time and effort as I had run Autoruns to verify it wasn't
 starting but never actually checked.&nbsp; I also opened Outlook, ran it for a few hours, closed it and checked again.&nbsp; Nothing showed up so it appears to be closing properly.&nbsp; I then disabled all add-ons (there weren't many) and tried it all again and the problem
 persisted. I read the article you provided and to my knowledge there are no programs tied to Outlook that might be keeping it open (or that by being open themselves may be causing the problem).&nbsp; I use MSE which doesn't do that sort of thing.&nbsp; I have no gadgets
 tied to Outlook.&nbsp; I do not sync it with any other program or device.&nbsp; Plus since Task Manager and Process Explorer both show it is closing properly, I don't see how that could be the problem.&nbsp; More confusing still, the icons don't work when /recycle is added
 to the target - they say unrecognized switch (even in Quick Launch where it is supposed to be and is automatically included) - and if Outlook being already open is the problem, that should work just as well as using the run command, but for some reason the
 shortcuts won't accept the switch (or rather, generate that error when used with the switch).</p>
<p>Can it possibly be "started" with some other program that isn't in any Office Folder and doesn't mention any office application in it (like some obscure System32 dll or something?&nbsp; Is it possible that there's a registry setting saying it is started even
 when it isn't causing this and, if so, how do I find it and modify and/or delete it?&nbsp; This seems very unlikely as I've uninstalled Office a number of times using Revo in Advanced Mode and then re-installed but the problem persists.&nbsp; I've tried just about every
 malware detection/removal tool available (except Combofix) and found nothing but some insignificant tracking cookies.&nbsp; As it happens only with the Outlook icons (shortcut and program files), I can't see how it can be a Vista issue (especially given the number
 of re-installations) though I have run the standard tests (SFC and others) and come up clean.</p>
<p>If you have any other suggestions, I'd love to hear and try them as this one seemed at first to be so promising.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your assistance and I hope you (or maybe some other MVP or Engineer you know and can bring in to assist) can help me resolve this most aggravating problem.</p>

<p>Does this issue also occur when you create a new user account on your machine and try to launch Outlook when logged on as this user?</p>
<p>Could it be that you have a scheduled task configured that runs Outlook at startup? The task will then fail since it has to be configured to run at logon if you want it to start automatically (or place a link to it in the Startup Start Menu folder).</p>
<p>If you try another switch, like for instance /safe, do you still get the "unrecognized switch" error?</p>

    <title>Disable Right Click into Access Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzannen_ct  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Right Click into Access  Options</h2>
                    <p>In Access (2007 or 2010) Options, Current database -&gt; you have the choice to not allow full menu.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;My quesiton is how do I disable the right click on the ribbon (or other places you can go into options) -&gt; so that they cannot reset this back to full ribbon. (My users now know they can go into this - and they just unset it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if it has to be by code that would be ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Well first, if you have users that try to get around your&nbsp;restrictions&nbsp;you have a bigger problem. I've talked about this before. Users need to understand that these apps are company data. That not following the uses of the apps is a serious issue.
<div><br />
<div>But one choice is to distribute the apps as a ACCDE with only your own ribbons.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Scott is absolutely right. I never distribute ACCDB files. And I disable the default shortcut menus as well as the full menus. The code I use to set the database properties to limit what the users can do is as follows:</p>
<p><br />
Private Sub ChangeProperty(db As Database, strPropertyName As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varPropertyType As Variant, varPropertyValue As Variant)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo err_PROC</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; db.Properties(strPropertyName) = varPropertyValue</p>
<p>exit_PROC:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub</p>
<p>err_PROC:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If property not found, create it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Err = 3270 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim prpNew As DAO.Property<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set prpNew = db.CreateProperty(strPropertyName, varPropertyType, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varPropertyValue, True)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; db.Properties.Append prpNew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set prpNew = Nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description, vbCritical<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This calls the routine on my startup form's Load event&nbsp;to set each property:</p>
Dim 
db As
DAO.Database
Dim 
wks As
DAO.Workspace
Dim 
strFormName As String
Const 
conObjStateClosed = 0
'Workspace must be made by Admins to change Database properties.
Set 
wks = DBEngine.CreateWorkspace("", "Admin", "")
Set 
db = wks.OpenDatabase(CurrentDb.Name)
<p>　</p>
'Set executable properties.
If 
Right(db.Name, 4) = ".mde" Or
Right(db.Name, 6) = ".accde" Then
<p>ChangeProperty db, "AllowBreakIntoCode", dbBoolean, </p>False
<p>ChangeProperty db, "AllowBuiltinToolbars", dbBoolean, </p>False
'Special case for 2007 &amp; 2010 Files.Count
If 
Right(db.Name, 6) = ".accde" Then

<h3> nuahaun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint 2016 - How to repeat an outline slide throughout a presentation, with formatting changes each time&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to have an outline slide with text bullet points that is repeated 5-6 times in my presentation. Each time I want to highlight a different point by greying out the rest. Is there an easy method to repeat a slide with text, while making small
 formatting changes each time? I can make a master slide, but the only two options seem to be non-editable text, or placeholder text that vanishes. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

<p>There's little reason to use multiple slides for what I understand your purpose to be - and there are a few reasons to avoid doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What will accomplish the purpose with only a single slide is to apply any of the various
<em><strong>Emphasis</strong></em> <strong>Animation Effects</strong> to that slide. Use the settings for the effect to determine how the focus changes for each point. See the Mac PPt 2016 Help article:</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, Bob. I should have specified that the outline slides are not sequential; there are other (content) slides between them. The point of repeating the outline slide (with different points highlighted) is to re-establish with the audience
 where in the talk I am, and where I'm going. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I've found so far for this setup is to copy/paste the original slide, and change them all when a change is needed.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
here it states that your phone is capable of FOTA, however those links have been known to be incorrect. i am not sure when the firmware update came out for your phone, but sometimes it may take even few months to reach all regions and be available for all product
 codes.

<p>Hello, sorry if this has been discussed before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to send a 240 MB video to a friend who uses a 6120c, but his internal memory is too small, but his memory card has a lot of free space. Problem is he can't find the settings to set received Bluetooth files to be saved on his memory card, and every
 time we try to transfer the file he gets and error stating there's insufficient memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a 700 MB movie and I used SmartMovie Converter to bring it down to 240 MB.</p>
<p>Thanks.:smileywink:</p>

<br />
In Symbian/S60 based phones, you can change the "Memory in use" setting in the Messaging app settings, under "Other" to point to the memory card.<br />
<br />
After that, files sent over Bluetooth (like all other messages, default to the memory card and not phone memory.<br />
<br />
And if you install Nokia PC Suite, you can over Bluetooth also copy the files directly to the file system without having to go through messaging at all.

            Not using Datasheet View.&nbsp; You can use a Subform and set it up to look like Datasheet View and then leave off the Labels.&nbsp; Doing it this way also gives you more control over the Form.

            <p>1. Again... no, I do not need to test because it is either Shortcut Menu = Yes then Sort/Filter will show; Shortcut Menu = No then it won't show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. That many fields suggest your database is not properly normalized.&nbsp; Putting that aside my answer still stands, can't have one without the other.&nbsp; You can use Labels and write code to do the sorting and filtering.</p>

            Hi<br />
1-So I understand from you that&nbsp; I can't have my special right click and omit the sort and filter on Title menu on Datasheet view in the same time ( together ), yes?<br />
2-assume I have one table (Table1) with 2 field (a , b ) and I build a textbox (TXT1) and a button (Name: buton1)
<br />
please give me a code that when user click a field on datasheet and go to TXT1 and type anything in the TXT1 and press the buton , it filter it that only is that field , no other field<br />
3-when it is'nt normalize , what problem will it make&nbsp; ?<br />

            Hi dear 
Gina Whipp <br />
thanks for your corporation <br />
I told you test but you don't try it but it's possible and I find it<br />
for omit the sort and filter menu on Title menu on Datasheet view where you keep the special your shortcut menu on the form on the datasheet view , you can use of below setting and code :<br />
<br />
1-<span style="font-weight: bold">on the design view set No for shortcut menu on th tab "Other"</span> , this will omit the sort and filter menu on Title menu<br />
<br />
2- <span style="font-weight: bold">on the design view set&nbsp; shortcut menu</span> bar&nbsp; to the name a macro that make your special shortcut menu that you build it
<br />
3-on current VBA code write these codes :<br />
Me.ShortcutMenu = True<br />
<br />
now you have short cut menu on main form but you don't have the sort and filter menu on Title menu on Datasheet view on the form<br />
<br />

I can use it for a form and I can use of it for a subform but when I create a button on the form and I switch between the form view and datasheet view for subform , it active the sort and filter menu on the title menu on datasheet view<br />
<br />

    <title>Can I program the E90 &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I program the E90 &#63;</h2>
                    I am an ex-Psion user (my 3c, 5 and 5mx still work!!), therefore I used OPL (a lot) to write handy programs (engineering calcs, back-of-pocket algorithms, etc.). On my Imate (PocketPC) and Treo (PalmOS) I installed Basic interpreter and C compiler to help
 me continue programming.<br />
<br />
Are there similar programming software for the E90 ?.<br />
<br />
Although I hear Nokia OS is based on Symbian, no chance it will have OPL on it, right? I noticed that the size of the E90 display seems as large as that of the Psion 5mx, which makes it eye-friendly for writing/editing/debugging (at least for simple programs).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any feedback !!

            You can write Symbian C++ apps, Java (J2ME, Java 2 Micro Edition) apps, Python apps or Flash Lite apps for the E90, at least.<br />
<br />
The developer tools, etc., you will find on <a href="http://forum.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forum.nokia.com</a><br />
<br />
The E90 is based on "S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1", so look for tools for that S60 version.

I have 1000+ contacts synchronised from Good Enterprise application, Facebook, Linkedin, Hotmail and Gmail.<br />
<br />
2. After installing outlook.com app:<br />
<br />
All my contacts from device gone. Contacts app shows 0 contacts. I looked into outlook.com app contacts on my laptop but they were not showing up in contacts.<br />
<br />
3. Steps I have taken after this:<br />
<br />
a. Uninstalled outlook.com and reinstalled. Nothing changed. meaning device contacts app shows 0 contacts<br />
b. Called up my company service deck, they have me uninstall and reinstall good enterprise app. and I was able to synch the partial list of contacts whatever existing in "good app contacts"<br />
c. Removed outlook.com app<br />
d. I am still missing a number of contacts which I have added to my device which were not synchronized with "good app"<br />
<br />

<h2>            My old laptop died, can I transfer my Office 2010 license to my new computer</h2>
                    Hey so my old laptop came preinstalled (with license) with Office 2010, it died about a year ago and just got my new one. &nbsp;This one came preinstalled with Office 2010 as well, only this time sans license. &nbsp;People have told me that since I have an active
 license for Office 2010 it should be possible to use my old license from my dead computer to activate Microsoft Office on my new one? &nbsp;Is this accurate if so, how do I go about doing it?

            Look on your invoice it should identify what type of product they sold you.&nbsp; You can also compare the price you paid to the MS retail prices:<br />
<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/buy/office-2010-pricing-information-HA101810737.aspx<br />
<br />
If you have a retail license you need the 25 character Product Key and the installation file. Just run the installation file and enter the product key when prompted.

<h2>            BBC iPlayer on E6</h2>
                    
<p>Oh, no, not again....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there really no way of getting even BBC UK radio via the iPlayer on an E6? I actually don't care if the screen is broad and shallow, because all I want to do is listen to Radio 4 _and_ be able to take notes and/or browse relevant sites at the same time.
 The BBC only has WorldService radio on Nokia Internet Radio, and while YourMuze.fm is good quality and stability-wise, it takes over the phone, i.e. goes off line if you browse away or open another app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many other great apps have solved the E6 640x480 screen res. problem, so why can't the Beeb?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not a programmer, so fixing certificates and other legit sculduggery is way beyond me...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Good radio makes me) Smile Away!!!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you describe what the problem is specifically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BBC iPlayer works very well on my E6 via a wifi connection for both television and radio. I have Radio 4 on right now to test it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iPlayer does not support streaming though a 3G connection though, not for Symbian, iPhone or Android.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this direct link from the Radio 4 webpage. I can listen to the live broadcast over both wifi and 3G on my E6.</p>

<p>Hi twozero3! Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clicked on your link in the E6's native browser and it said "Loading". I tried switching from 3G to WiFi but that made no difference. Then I entered the URL instead of clicking on your link...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It switched to the Nokia player and said "Loading" for a few minutes, but then reverted to the News site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it's more likely my non-residence in UK than anything truly technical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not being a licance payer, I don't expect to get TV, but R4 is available worldwide on the net.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the Beeb is catering for iPhone users but a) I don't want an iPhone and b) I don't want the BBC's offerings designed for ex-pats because they think we're all flippin' millionaires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to listen to BBC Radio 4 and still be able to take notes and browse while listening without other interruptions to what is on LIVE in the UK now.</p>

<p>That was the bad news. The good news is that going straight to bbc.co.uk/iplayer takes you there in the Nokia browser.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to get a VPN solution of some kind. Going to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/</a> on my W7 PC gives me live Radio 4 on a slimmed down, radio-only iPlayer, so perhaps I should modify my
 Bob Dylan-style mouth organ holder and lug my Dell laptop around like an oversized bib with a 4G LTE fast broadband connection just to spite the Beeb!!</p>

<p>Hi DJ Jimnix,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply. I will help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur due to several reasons, let us start with restarting the computer in Windows clean boot following the steps from the link below to check if the issue occurs:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></span></a></p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not help, then ensure PowerPoint 2010 is not running in compatibility mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Navigate to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office 14.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Right click on </span><span style="font-weight: bold">PowerPoint.exe
</span><span>and go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Properties.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Now go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Compatibility</span><span> tab and
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">uncheck</span><span> all the options that are checked.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul>

            This is a known bug with their 'Amber' and Black' firmware release. There is absolutely no updates whatsoever, from the support team on any known fix. However, they have given a workaround in the Win8.1 release(developer version) by introducing the'soft'
 volume control for ringer s well as media.<br />
But it is indeed pathetic to see that they haven't solved the firmware bug

<p>Especially as in most cases it turns out to be a hardware issue with the button itself.</p>

<p>Is one year that I have put up with my Lumia720 and all the trouble it has given me.. (there are many who don't stay in a relationship so long these days of they have problems!!!!)<br />
Initially it used to hang several times a day... It reduced with Amber upgrade. But the volume - function ceased to function correctly but would work for sometime after a reboot. Then came the Black upgrade which successfully made the volume bug permanent!!!!
 Now when the phone hangs(yes! It still does when it cannot handle multitasking) I can't even restart with the combination of power and volume- buttons.<br />
I resorted to Win8.1 developer version hoping that the issue would be resolved but in vain.<br />
Are Nokia folks so much insensitive or ignorant about customers problems???</p>

well, you basically posted about this twice. Once a year ago and today. In the meantime, what have you don to contact Nokia and have this looked at and/or repaired. Obviously if there is a problem with your phone (as it certainly is not a structural issue with
 the 720) you should have it looked after and not just wait for updates to maybe fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on where you are located your warranty may by now be about to expire so I'd have this looked after by a certified repair partner. You are now posting to a user to user forum so there's not much anyone here could do to help you. Start
<a href="http://nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a> and find your available options to have this checked.</p>

            Paul/Mobile Guru, I have been a loyal customer/fan of Nokia since the year 2000. I have owned handsets right from the 3310 to 720 Lumia. So before voicing my frustration here on the discussion forum, I have done quite some research and put enough efforts
 on the same. You may want to give a keyword search on 'Lumia/volume control' and you will see the results. The volume minus button stopped working only after the Amber upgrade and we had to rssort to that upgrade because of the nightmarish hanging issues with
 the phone!. We were then forced to go for the Black update hoping that the volume minus button issue would get resolved. ...but in vain...Now with the last resort option, Windows 8.1 was loaded, you may notice that they have changed the combination of keys
 for even taking screen shots. Its lock button + volume plus and not lock button + volume minus like before!. They have even given a 'soft' option of varying the volume levels of media and ringer on Win 8.1. I am convinced that these are enough evidences of
 workaroundsgiven for the known bug!<br />
Btw, I dint expect this forum to solve my problem. I only want to make other frustrated users to feel that they are not alone. ..<br />
Anyways, after nearly 14 years of being closely associated with the company's products, I have happily moved to Apple...

            Hi Enzo,<br />
<br />
I just tested this Using the Omnia II from Verizon.<br />
<br />
There are actually two calendars User Interfaces(UI) on the device. One is the Samsung UI and secondly the standard Windows Mobile 6.5 UI. Press start and you will see two different icons for this<br />
<br />
1: My Calendar (samsung UI)<br />
2: Calendar (Windows Mobile UI)<br />
<br />
In both instances (creating the appointment on the device)it worked giving me the correct date. Make sure the date is correct in setting up the appointment. ( I'm using Exchange 2007 with 2010 desktop client)

    <title>transfer office professional plus 2016 to new laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimbenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            transfer office professional plus 2016 to new laptop</h2>
                    I purchased office professional plus 2016 2 years ago from a deal offered at my work as a teaher. I have the disc but not the product code. I downloaded it to my laptop in December 2015 but the laptop has broken, screen went black and geek squad said it
 basically fried everything on it. I read that I could transfer the office but had to remove it from the old device first, which is impossible since it will not even turn on. Is there a way for me to be able to use the disc I currently have, to download office
 to my new laptop? thanks

            Hi Kimbenson,
<br />
<br />Did you associate that Office with your Office Account, if so you can de-activate the old installation . .. 
<br />
<br />If Office is linked to your Account:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />Select Install
<br />
<br />Under Install information, locate the computer where you want to deactivate 
<br />
<br />Then click Install

<p>is rejoin the Insider program.</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>Asus sent me this new PC without an OS on it.</p>
<p>So I downloaded the Windows 10 tool to create a bootable Win 10 USB.</p>
<p>I installed it like that.</p>

<p>Asus sent me this new PC without an OS on it.</p>
<p>So I downloaded the Windows 10 tool to create a bootable Win 10 USB.</p>

<p>I have two questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Did your old computer have Windows 10 on it and did it have OEM license or did it have a retail License? If it had a retail license then MIcrosoft should be able to transfer it to your new computer as long as it has the same version of Windows 10 (Home
 or Professional). If it is transferrable once Microsoft transfers the license then you could rejoin the Insider Program on your new computer. If the old computer had an OEM license then you cannot transfer it. If it is OEM then the short answer the free license
 is over. The free license period for Insiders ended on July 15 2015 if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If your new computer has an OEM Windows license you can just rejoin the Insider program with the same version of you have on the new computer. If the new computer did not come with an OEM license then you would to pay for a new license. Once that is done
 you can rejoin the insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is how you answer the first question. Also make certain your new computer is activated before you try to rejoin the Insider program.</p>

<p>From either an elevated command prompt or run from</p>
<p>windows powershell (admin) You will see if you right click your start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then type: slmgr /xpr</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will tell you if your computer is permanently activated. If says permanently activated you don't have to worry about the free license. As I said early then you can rejoin the insider program if you want. Since you said in an earlier post you got the new
 computer from Asus. You might want to check with them for a&nbsp; legal copy of Windows if it is not a legal copy of windows.</p>

<p>You sort of beat around the bush here.&nbsp; So you are using KMS for activation.&nbsp; That is no secret since you state that.&nbsp; Not really the site to be talking about KMS activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Insiders will run on any PC that has activation.&nbsp; Let's not quibble over how it is activated.&nbsp; Insiders will not provide or alter any degree of activation.&nbsp; Since you are already "activated",&nbsp; what are you really expecting?&nbsp; Your PC will continue
 as it is now but will be running Insiders but will still not be "real".&nbsp; Nothing lost and nothing gained, other than Insiders.</p>

    <title>Objects disappearing from PPT during slide presentations - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Objects disappearing from PPT during slide presentations</h2>
                    <p>Just over the last 2-3 weeks (after installing Powerpoint updates), I've started having trouble presenting my slides. When I do, objects often fail to appear in the slideshow or the screen will unexpectedly show all black for a slide. The problem goes away
 and the slides display fine if I step back a slide and then forward again, though this makes the presentation quite disruptive and challenging. The problem is highly sporadic: the same slide will present with problems one day, but not the next. Almost every
 presentation has 5-15 slides with issues, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Powerpoint version 16.19 (181109) on a Macbook Pro 2017 with macOS Sierra 10.12.6. I present in Presenter mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Mailmerge in Word 2016 not working</h2>
                    <p>Tried to do mail merge today for envelopes with word 2016, used 2016 excel csv file for data source.&nbsp;&nbsp;Working fine before updating to 2016 office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get to insert address&nbsp;block and nothing shows up in the right hand field for preview even after matching fields. When I exit that and in address block on envelope, only First name is showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can insert merge fields individually ,as a work around, not using address block, so I know it's picking up the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if anybody has a solution to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>How to move services to work account, close personal account under - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luis alonso ramos  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to move services to work account, close personal account under same email address</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two email addresses, both with Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>On *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I have OneDrive and my personal Skype (skypename "mypersonalskype").</p>
<p>
</p><p>On *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I have both a personal and a work account. The personal account has an Azure subscription, and maybe a Microsoft Partner account (I don't know about this). Also it has a Skype account (with skypename "mycompany"). This was the main
 account for the Skype Manager, but I made my personal email an admin before removing this account from my company's Skype Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the work account, I was added to another Azure directory (so I can see that subscription, but not the ones I own).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tried to create an Office 365 subscription for my company, and when I tried to create my account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** it says that I cannot use "mycompany" there because it has already been taken (I would think it is the skypename for the
 personal side of my work email -- I tried changing it but I think I can't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to fix all this mess. Ideally I'd like to have everything business-related on the work side of my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account. But for that I would need to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Move the Azure subscription to the work side of the same account</p>
<p>b) Move the Partner account to the work side of the same account. Would this include MSDN?</p>
<p>c) Delete the personal account on the company email</p>
<p>d) Create the mycompany account on Office 365</p>
<p>
</p><p>How should I tackle this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luis</p>

</p><p>Hi Luis,</p>

</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>a) Move the Azure subscription to the work side of the same account</p>
<p>As it is related to Azure subscription and this category focus on Office 365, we suggest gathering the information and posting a new thread in&nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowsazuredevelopment%2cwindowsazuremanagement%2cwindowsazureaditpro&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=Move+the+Azure+subscription+to+the+work+side+of+the+same+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Azure
 TechNet forum</a>&nbsp;for dedicated support.</p>
<p>b) Move the Partner account to the work side of the same account. Would this include MSDN?</p>
<p>As it is related to partner account (already signed up with the personal account side of the same account, we suggest posting a new thread in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoftpartnercommunity.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=Move+the+Partner+account+to+the+work+side+of+the+same+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Partner Community</a>&nbsp;for dedicated support.</p>
<p>c) Delete the personal account on the company email</p>
<p>We would like to suggest renaming your personal account by following the steps in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/11545/microsoft-account-rename-your-personal-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this
 article</a>. If you have further queries, we suggest posting&nbsp; a new thread in the category Outlook.com &gt; My Account and information &gt; Other.</p>
<p>d) Create the mycompany account on Office 365</p>
<p>After investigating from our side, the same name you prefer&nbsp; (***.onmicrosoft.com) has already been taken, it is not feasible to set up a new one with the same name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your understanding is highly appreciated,</p>
<p>Tina​</p>
