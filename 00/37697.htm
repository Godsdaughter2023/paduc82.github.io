<h2>            Live Mail - attachments blocked by anti-virus&#63;</h2>

 thinking... trying to win the console race? Im a hardcore xbox fan love my online but seriously after this call of duty screw up with the licensing of the dlc by xbox im not to sure anymore .... i think xbox should remember who it is that needs who more simple
 business ethics boys get it sorted and give those who have already purchased 360 dlc onslaught pack the download code to get it on xbox 1 for free &nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. NOTHING I bought on my xbox 360 (maps, camos people, ect) transferred when I recently switched to the xbox one about a week ago. Which is really making me angry because the Maverick quickly became my favorite gun in the game.
 I have a couple emails into support but have not heard anything. I also tweeted the devs of COD: Ghosts and haven't heard anything either. I'll update if I find anything useful in my searches for answers.

            <p>Hi,<br />

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually included<br />
with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
<span>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;hope that I'll be able to find an answer here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to have issues with my Windows Firewall and Remote Access Connection Manager (this one is very important as without this service I can't use VPN). Sometimes one of these services, sometimes both of them don't start with Windows and can't started
 later. Error is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Windows could not start the &lt;service&gt; on Local Computer. For more information, review the System Event Log. If this is a non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to service-specific error code 1825.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p>
</p><p>Two entries at the same time in the Windows Event Log&nbsp;are then created:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The Remote Access Connection Manager service terminated with the following service-specific error:
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">A security package specific error occurred.</p>

            <p>I think I have finally managed to fix this issue. I checked many places and tried many approaches but finally I did the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open regedit</p>
<p>2) Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</p>
<p>3) Backup this registry hive</p>
<p>4) Check AppInit_DLLs key - if it's not empty then this may be a problem.&nbsp;Mine was "C:\\Windows\\system32\\nvinitx.dll,C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\nvinitx.dll,C:\\PROGRA~1\\COMMON~1\\avest\\AVESTC~1\\AvSSPc.dll"</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;One of dlls from this key is path to NVidia driver and second is 3rd party cryptography provider. The following steps both fixed my issue:</p>
<p>6.1) Remove redundant path from list</p>
<p>6.2) Move 3rd party crypt dll to another location (I just renamed original folder and renamed installation location of crypto provider so that it can't accessible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went with 6.1 and for now (1 day long) I have no more issue with Windows Firewall and RACM.</p>
<p>6.2 is quite dangerous - in my case I wouldn't be able to use software that is depend on this crypto provider. An option is to&nbsp;move everything back to original location when you need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this will help someone as I spent 4 days in frustration diving into this issue.</p>

<h2>            Have new laptop &#40;Acer&#41; and microsoft games such as solitare will not load from start menu&#47;games  Using Windows 7 home premium.</h2>
                    The microsoft&nbsp;games have never loaded from games folder (acer games provided do open from this folder) since loading Windows.&nbsp; The games folder shows all the installed games (icons and&nbsp;details)&nbsp;&nbsp;but fails to launch the microsoft games either by&nbsp; trying
 double clicking on them or by right click and "play".<br />
No changes have been made to the system since loading Windows.&nbsp; No new programs installed.<br />
Games can be opened via C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games if i right click on the .exe file and choose "open as administrator",&nbsp; it then warns me that the games are from an unknown source and" do I wish to open it."<br />
I can enable the games to open through the start menu/games folder if i switch the "User account control settings " to "never notify me".&nbsp; Would this not reduce my computers security?<br />
I have run cmd and scannow, no errors have been shown.<br />
I have tried to remove and reinstall the games through "turn windows features on and off"<br />

            Hi<strong> ferriarione</strong> ,<br />
<br />
<strong>Thanks for posting on&nbsp; Microsoft Answers!</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Run a Virus Scan</strong> <br />
I suspect a virus activity. Follow the links below to remove the Viruses and Malware.<br />
I would recommend you to run online Virus Scan to remove any infections, if present.<br />
<br />
Follow the link below to run the free online scan:<br />
http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm<br />
<br />
The following thread discusses about removing viruses and malware online:<br />
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistasecurity/thread/ba80504b-61f1-4d71-960f-b561798b7b42<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2 : You can also try creating and another user profile and verify if you get the same message.</strong>
<br />
<br />
To create a new profile, you must first create a new user account. When the account is created, a profile will also be created.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety (or clicking User Accounts, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking User Accounts.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Manage another account.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Create a new account.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.
<br />
<br />
If it works fine, please revert back for further assistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 ....... What a joke&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After downloading the eagerly awaited&nbsp;Windows 8.1 update my computer has run into problems, nothing serious, more minor irritations.&nbsp;Basically when I boot my machine up to the metro home screen, none of the tiles update straight away.&nbsp;When I click on the
 store it tells me im not connected to the&nbsp;internet. It takes at least 2-3 minutes after logging on before I&nbsp;am able to access the&nbsp;tiles with them fully up-to-date. Is this a serious problem or&nbsp;something that just comes with the Windows 8.1 update?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I should have know better to update from 8 to 8.1... all my video games look like I'm watching a 3D movie with out the glasses. Java is freaking out saying the right version is installed while IE is freaking out saying the version in incompatible. I go to
 Nvidia's website to use the auto detect and it needs Java.&nbsp; I already hate Java and its ASK toolbar and search it always want me to install. If I do the manual video driver install, it says I have the right&nbsp;driver, yet my games still wont work, and the Java
 Icon just popped up&nbsp;again as I'm typing this wanting me to update Java again...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I should have read the 8.1 info more clearly before doing it... I figured it was like a service pack for the new generation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now I have to back up all my files and re-install 8 from scratch along with all my settings if I want to play my games or get IE and Java to play nice again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also it wants me to redo my Microsoft live account and back up account information or phone numbers which is already overkill for my home gaming PC.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Other than that the download and update worked... my system restarted, I'm using it now but all I can do is use Office or surf the web that doesn't need Java...
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Horrible Update... DO NOT waste your time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

 awesome. </p>

            <p>I think the real issue is the very poor operating system and the fact that Microsoft are not listening to the hundreds of people that think Windows 8 is a joke and windows 8.1 (only released because Windows 8 is a joke and Microsoft knows it), is no better!
 These forums offer Microsoft business intelligence for free and yet they fail to make use of it&nbsp;to keep ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion Microsoft's unique selling point is that everyone knows their operating system; so why make an operating system that know one knows how to use and eliminate their key USP, or arguably their only USP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have continued to have problems with windows 8, it took me 3 days to upload to windows 8.1. The operating system is designed for mobile phones and not laptops, it is not intuitive in the slightest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot understand why technology has to degenerate all the time when it worked ok to start with. In order for technology to advance the designers of the technology need to listen to their market and understand what they want first I.e. easier, faster&nbsp;and
 cheaper technology!</p>

<p>I think that the warnings appears because it is a unknown publisher, <br />
when a system (e.g. windows and the UAC technology) does not find <br />
a digital-signature which can help to determine the "publisher" - then <br />
they prompt a message with "unknown publisher"-text added also with <br />
different colors to tell you that this can be a security risk. <br />
<br />
But, if you know the publisher then go ahead with no problem and continue.<br />
<br />

please feel free to contact me and let me know.<br />

            <p>​Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!
</span><br />
As I understand you receive error code “0xc000007b” when you try to boot into the laptop.
<span>I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps to check if it helps.</span><br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. When exactly do you receive the error code?<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Store&#58; After recent update, app force closes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> watcherseye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Store&#58; After recent update, app force closes</h2>
                    <p>Apparently a new update to the store went out and now when I click on any app to try to install, it just closes the store.&nbsp; I can navigate the store fine (between apps, games, music, etc) but if I click on ANYTHING, it closes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run all the usual "fixes" found in the numerous store problem threads here&nbsp;and none have worked yet.&nbsp; Anyway to revert the version back?

<p>I think your right, You only have 30 Days before your locked in, DO IT. I was looking forward to Windows 10, but it has been nothing but a Headache for me, and have only rolled a couple machines. Microsoft is ONE more screw-up from me rolling every one of
 those machines back to either Win 7 or Win 8.1. All the customers that I have not rolled over to Win 10 WILL STAY at Win 7 or Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your an enterprise user there is "some" support and guidance from Microsoft. If you are a Tech supporting Home and SMB Users, Microsoft has more less just shafted you. Microsoft says they want feedback, well here it is, and I get the feeling they don't
 give a ****. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your listing Microsoft, Quit getting rid of every tool there ever was to make administration of Home Windows Computers even manageable, or do I need do buy a volume enterprise license for my IT Business and use those volume licenses for each of my home
 users and small businesses with two or three PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems the better long term strategy is simply convert clients to using Linux Desktops, with their old copy of Pre-Windows 10 running in a Virtual Machine, if not just using WINE and being done with Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the vent, but Microsoft If your Listening and ACTUALLY CARE....THEN FIX THIS STUFF!</p>

            <p>Same problem here: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgraded a few days ago - and everything was flawless. <br />
<br />
But yesterday - noticed the Windows Store app won't open anymore. It looks "greyed out" in the start menu - and in the all apps area - shows a bar that won't move that appears like it was supposed to upgrade or something.
<br />
<br />
Tried a few things saw suggested - like removing the cache folder in the user app data folder and also the powershell command. Looks like the system didn't take a Restore Point.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Tried all the suggestions&nbsp;here. Nothing work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Anyone fix it. Anyone have other&nbsp;suggestions? <br />
<br />
Thanks! </p>

<h2>            Problem with recent update causing problem with other software writing files</h2>
                    For about the last week or so I have been getting messages about defender blocking files that are being written to a folder. This has become more than frustrating. For example: I play Elite Dangerous. I use a widget called ED Market Connector(EDMC). It
 writes a text file to my document folder. I just checked the security setting on the document folder and it says full control, with read and write access.&nbsp;

<h2>            My laptop cant access the internet.</h2>
                    
<div>Hello,<br />
<br />
I hope someone here can help me. I've tried everything I can. <br />
<br />
Here is the situation. My connection was fine when suddenly my comp shut off (this has happened before). When I turned it back on I had no connection. I ran network diagnostics and tried every suggested repair. Then I called&nbsp;At&amp;t tech support and we checked
 everything he could think of. The last thing&nbsp;we did was an "ipconfig" and&nbsp;found my ip address was starting with 169. which he thought meant my network adapter was bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also after running network diagnostics It says "There might be a problem with 1 or more
 network adapters on this computer. <br />
<br />
I've done all the obvious.&nbsp; I ran the ethernet cable direct to the lap top.&nbsp; Ive taken my laptop to the library that has free internet.&nbsp; It is definately a problem within the laptop, not the router or the cable, or the internet service.&nbsp; I tried a system restore-
 but it said no changes were made, I downloaded and reinstalled the driver,I checked&nbsp;the IP settings were set to&nbsp;auto and that&nbsp;DHCP is enabled, and I've disabled the firewall. I went to the store and got a wireless usb adapter - no difference.<br />
<br />
Someone on another site recomended I try this: I did an ipconfig&nbsp; release &amp; renew, I also did winsock.<br />
<br />
I havent downloaded the service pack 1, but I had auto updates set up the entire time Ive had the computer.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Any insight on this matter would be&nbsp;VERY helpful and appreciated. I look forward to your response. Thank you.</div>

            <p><span>Hi John,<br />
</span><span><br />
From reading the entire thread, it sounds to me you have a bad NIC.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The 127.0.0.1 address is the test loop back address that exists on every computer.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<br />
</span></span><span><br />
If you are having problems with your network, PING 127.0.0.1 is the first thing you do to&nbsp;prove the Network Card
</span><span>and the TCP/IP software is working correctly. You will get a response from 127.0.0.1 even of the computer is not connected to anything.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Since you are receiving a General failure from this test, I </span><span><span>does look like you have a bad NIC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you’ve tried to re-install the drivers, tried pinging the loopback address (127.0.0.1) with no luck and re-installed NIC drivers and Winsock with no success, I would recommend getting a new NIC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you want to try a few more things, you can <span>&nbsp;</span>try the following if you have not done so already</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click on Start button.</span></span><span><br />
<span>2. Type Cmd in the Start Search text box.</span><br />
<span>3. Press Ctrl-Shift-Enter keyboard shortcut to run Command Prompt as Administrator. Allow elevation request.</span><br />
<span>4. Type netsh int ip reset in the Command Prompt shell, and then press the Enter key.</span><br />
<span>5. Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<span><span>You can also try to u</span></span><span>ninstall IPv6 Using the Network Connections Folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I personally don’t think there is a conflict between IPv4 and IPv6 but if you want to try this as well, you can.</span>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click Start.</span>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Either click <strong>Control Panel</strong> and then double-click
<strong>Network Connections</strong>, or point to <strong>Settings</strong>, click
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then double-click <strong>Network Connections</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click any local area connection, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>Microsoft TCP/IP version 6</strong> in the list of installed components, and then click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also, have you tried to reboot your computer in Safe Mode with networking and see if your NIC works in this mode? To do this:</span></span></p>
<p>
<table>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p><span>1.</span></p>

<p><span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.

<p><span>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button , click the arrow next to the <strong>

</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><span>2. </span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>Do one of the following: </span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>•</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows
 logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>•</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>3. </span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>On the <strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode with networking option, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/f9c50a72-04ec-4088-9fd4-a4f979eef5a71033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>Log on to your computer with a <span>user account</span> that has administrator rights.</span></p>

</tbody>

</tbody>

</p><p>
</p><p><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words <strong>Safe Mode
</strong>in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.&nbsp; In safe mode, try seeing if your NIC is working.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you’ve tried the above steps and still no luck, I would recommend you buy a plug-in NIC and see if this new NIC works on your pc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it does, then you know you have a bad NIC and not a configuration problem on your computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Is your computer under warranty?<span>&nbsp; </span>Perhaps the manufacturer of your laptop can run some extensive diagnostics that will check your NIC to see if it is a problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Some manufacturers can provide a boot up cd that can be run which <span>&nbsp;</span>test your NIC and other components of your laptop to find the problem,</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck and let us know if we can provide any more help.</span></p>

<p>Hi Jkeisling,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your responses,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 127.0.0.1 is showing a request timeout then the problem is with the Network Card itself.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are a few steps that I want to confirm, however, because I want to make sure that everything in this information points to that issue also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>To answer your question from the previous post, you have a NIC for the WIRELESS CONNECTION and a SEPARATE NIC for the WIRED CONNECTION.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Let's work on the Wireless 1st.</span> </li><li><span>With no cables connecting the WIRED CONNECTION to the router from an elevated command prompt type PING 127.0.0.1 and verify if you get the request time out again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Let us know if you do get a different response.</span> </li><li><span>Click the Start ORB / Select NETWORK / NETWORK and SHARING CENTER / Manage Network Connections /<span>&nbsp;
</span>- you should see two network connections listed - one is the Wired Network Card and the Other is for the Wireless Network Connection
</span></li><li><span>Double Click first on the Wired Card Connection - Under the General Tab there is an option for Details</span>
</li><li><span>What we need you to put in this information is </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Description</span><span> - which should be the card manufacturer<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">DHCP Enabled - </span><span>Yes/No - What address is shown beside
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">IPV4 IP ADDRESS:<span>&nbsp; </span>something similar to 192.168.1.7
</span><span>also we need the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">IPV4 DEFAULT GATEWAY</span><span> address ; and the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">IPV4 SUBNET MASK </span><span>address</span>
</li><li><span>After that information is obtained, please then CLICK on the WIRELESS ADAPTOR and obtain the same information as was needed on the WIRED ADAPTOR.</span>
</li><li><span>After you have that information, please place into the forum what TYPE of ROUTER you are using on your network so we can also look into whether it allows the reset of the DHCPFLAG as was indicated in earlier steps-----</span>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928233</span></a>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Please post all the information requested into the forum.</span> </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>From what's been done, I'm not ready to totally give up and say it is hardware related, because, sometimes I've seen a 127.0.0.1 ping return be request timeout, especially, since not determining whether we had the wireless connection correct or the wired
 correct earlier.<span>&nbsp; </span>We just want to make sure.<span>&nbsp; </span>At this point, I'm leaning more towards if the Router allows DHCP flag requests or if it disables it.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I have an app originaly created for window XP, seems to run ok in windows 10 except for the configuration menu.</p>
<p>The configuration meny is a .cpl file or control panel file and has no compatiability settings like an executable .exe does.</p>
<p>Is there any way to change the compatability on a cpl file so it will work with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File name is i2050Config.cpl and is located in the windows system32 directory.</p>

            If the .cpl file is in the System32 folder and doesn't result in a corresponding item in Control Panel, there's nothing you can do.&nbsp; There might be an executable in the program folder that's supposed to be invoked by clicking on the item in Control Panel,
 and you might be able to open it directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're fortunate that the program works at all in Windows 10.

Vista64 Home Premium.&nbsp; My error code is 1719 not 1720 but it says the same thing. Error 1719. The Windows Installer Service could not be accessed.&nbsp; This can occur if the Windows Installer is not correctly installed.&nbsp; Contact your "support personnel for assistance."
 I am my own support, unfortunately.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have unregistered and re-registered the file.&nbsp; There are instructions on how to fix this unless you are a vista user and no instructions on how to fix this error related to Vista or Vista64.<br />
<br />
The steps here suggesting I download the installer does not work either.&nbsp; In fact when I select my version of Vista and download the file and try to run it a popup tells me its not the appropriate version for my version of Windows Vista.&nbsp; It is!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Step 1.&nbsp; AFter finding and downloading&nbsp;and running the appropriate installer download, a popup tell me its the wrong version.&nbsp; It wasnt.
<br />
Step 2.&nbsp; I stopped the service, then restarted: no help.&nbsp; Set it to Manual and Automatic; no help.<br />
Step 3.&nbsp; Cannot help until possibly AFTER I get the installer working.<br />
<br />
I cannot find help for this error.&nbsp; Apparently the Installer 4.5 is PART of Vista and replacing the file is not an option.&nbsp; I have had this problem for quite awhile.&nbsp; Have been searching for a solution off and on and have not solved it yet.
<br />
<br />
Please help if you can.&nbsp; COMPUTER RUNS VISTA64 HOME PREMIUM. THANKS<br />

<p>
</p><p>I had a bootable backup on a larger hard drive that I replaced my C drive with. &nbsp;It would not boot properly but the machine will still boot after I choose Windows 7 option from a black and white screen titled "Windows Boot Manager". &nbsp;It gives two options,
 Windows setup and Windows 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine works fine I simply have to tend it until it has booted. &nbsp;I have tried using System Options Recovery with no success to repair this. &nbsp;Is there a way to repair this?<br />

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When you install a second operating system on your computer, Windows displays the Boot Manager screen on startup to allow you to boot from the second partition. We can configure Windows so that it skips the Boot Manager screen entirely

</p><p><span>To make your Windows start directly without prompting for Boot screen, follow the below steps:</span></p>

    <title>nslookup works but nothing else has DNS on standalone Win7 PC. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> technicalbloke.com  say:</h3>
<h2>            nslookup works but nothing else has DNS on standalone Win7 PC.</h2>
                    I can connect to wired and wireless networks, the machine gets an IP and gateway and DNS from DHCP server just fine and I can connect to things via ip but nothing can resolve DNS except nslookup which seems to work perfectly. Network and sharing center
 shows both as "connected" and "no internet access". I have tried a lot of things and now I'm stumped. The problems began when a router failed recently, several other connected machines came back online when the faulty router was replaced but this one never
 did.<br />
<br />
Some of the things I tried...<br />
<br />
uninstalled everything that might conceivably mess with networking: McAfee, Hamachi, Bonjour etc<br />
ran the McAfee removal tool<br />
booted into safe mode<br />
tried several different profiles<br />
disabled the windows firewall<br />
unticked <br />
set DNS to 8.8.8.8 manually for each adapter<br />
set an IP for google.com manually in the hosts file: ping still wont resolve it<br />
disabled the dnscache service : made no difference so re-enabled it<br />
netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt : has no effect and resetlog.txt is never created<br />
netsh winsock reset<br />
sfc /scannow : no corruption found<br />
unticked ipv6 for all network adapters in the system<br />
rebooted, like, a million times<br />
<br />
RPC, DHCP, DNS Client all seem to be running.<br />
<br />
Hardware tests fine, no DNS problems with either interface when running from a linux boot disk so it's got to be software.<br />
<br />
There is nothing in the logs that hasn't already been a problem for several months or isn't directly attributable to the lack of connectivity, this network problem is new as of 3 or 4 days ago. The only significant error entries are, annoyingly, for System
 Restore and VSS meaning the system hasn't been making restore points for several months and, even more annoyingly, fails to restore ones it already has with a "catastrophic error 0x8000ffff". Annoying though this is, it had clearly been a problem for months
 without affecting the networking. <br />
<br />
Interestingly under "Access Type:" in Network and Sharing center I get&nbsp; "No Internet access" but when I open a browser and access google via an ip address (173.194.37.136) this quickly changes to "Internet" although I still can't ping google.<br />
<br />
Other than that the only thing I've found that doesn't look right is that ipconfig /registerdns brings up the error: "Registration of DNS failed: The RPC server is unavailable" which seems strange as RPC says its running in services.msc and everything else
 seems to be OK. There are a few pages on the web that mention this error but they all seem to apply to servers and this is a vanilla dell laptop running Win7HP64.<br />
<br />
Things I haven't tried...<br />
<br />
reinstalling hardware drivers: I figure if it affects Realtek LAN AND Intel WiFi it can't be the drivers for those<br />
<br />
I'm out of ideas now.<br />
<br />
Help please!<br />
<br />
