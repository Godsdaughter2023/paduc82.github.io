<h2>            List wokflow not creating task</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a task list approval workflow which is attached with a document library, a day ago it was working fine, now it has stopped creating tasks and doesn't send emails for task creation, it shows as "In Progress" state and keeps showing this only and no
 tasks are created. It's a Sharepoint 2010 workflow which I created in Sharepoint Designer 2013. Please help me asap.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anupam&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi anupam,</p>
<p>to clarify the scenario and find the root cause, could you help confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. about ”i have a task list approval workflow which is attached with a document library”,&nbsp;may i know&nbsp;you create an approval workflow for a library and have a task list with this workflow? if not, can you share with us more details or a screenshot about
 the workflow in sharepoint designer 2013? <br />
2. can you share with us a screenshot about the workflow status? please click “<strong>in progress</strong>” you mentioned to see if the workflow is started.
<br />

3. which start options of the workflow do you set up, automatically or manually? can you click
<strong>library &gt; workflow &gt; workflow settings &gt;</strong> click the workflow <strong>
&gt; start options</strong>?<br />

<p>hi shirley,</p>
<p>thanks for looking into it.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6411e671-e949-416f-9765-b5f7be3e72c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6411e671-e949-416f-9765-b5f7be3e72c4" /></a></p>
<p>here is some useful information.</p>
<p>1. yes, i created an approval workflow for a library and have a task list with this workflow, two days before it was working fine, but suddenly it stopped creating tasks.</p>
<p>2. screenshot shared.</p>
<p>3. the workflow starts on addition of a new/change item., but after it's version 2 has been created, we have used condition for that in workflow.</p>
<p>4. we created subsites based on a template, and all the subsites created with that template are affected.</p>
<p>please let me know if you need further details. two days before, it was working absolutely fine and suddenly it has stopped creating tasks.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>anupam</p>

<p>Hi Anupam,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue for further troubleshooting, please confirm the following.<br />
1. The workflow you created is a customized workflow in SharePoint Designer 2013 or a build-in workflow in SharePoint Online? Could you show me some screenshots about my confirmation?<br />
2. If the workflow is a customized workflow, from #3 you mentioned above, I’d like to know how you design the workflow. For clarifying the workflow, could you upload the detailed steps and screenshots about how you create it to the workspace we have created
 for you? I have sent you a private message for how to enter the workspace. You can review the private message via
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations.<br />
3. Have you tried creating a new site collection without the template and apply the same workflow to a new library in the new site collection to check the outcome?<br />
4. Has the Workflow feature been deactivated by the site administrator? Can you make sure it?<br />
5. If you create the workflow in SharePoint Designer 2013, check the task list and capture a screenshot of the task list page via Workflows&gt;List Workflows&gt;Open task list&gt;Click Web Address&gt;Capture a screenshot in SharePoint Designer.</p>
<p>Please let me know your updates at your convenience.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>

<p>I need to edit the NK2 file (remove some old email addresses from the autocomplete list) and have found what "looks" like a good software tool for this purpose - NK2Edit v1.05 / Copyright (c) 2010 Nir Sofer at http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/outlook_nk2_edit.html</p>
<p>Does anyone have any experience with this particular software and recommend it or any other suggestions?</p>

            You can remove entries from the NK2 list by simply selecting them with the up or down arrow key and then pressing Delete.&nbsp; I've never used the Nirsoft tool, but I know others have and have seen few complaints about it.

<h2>            How to get Rich Text in mail body when using Mailitem to send email from MS Access</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>after the debacle with sendobject I decided to use mailitem as a means of sending emails from MSA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is almost working OK.</p>
<p>here is a portion of my code</p>
<p>
</p><p>HBODY = Me.CUR_MESSAGE&nbsp; &nbsp;. . . ( a form field with text format set to RICH . . has bold and coloured text etc)</p>
<p>Dim oOUTLOOK As Outlook.Application<br />
Dim oEMAILITEM As MailItem<br />
If oOUTLOOK Is Nothing Then Set oOUTLOOK = New Outlook.Application<br />
Set oEMAILITEM = oOUTLOOK.CreateItem(olMailItem)<br />
With oEMAILITEM<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .To = HSENDTO<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .BodyFormat = olFormatRichText<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Subject = HSUBJECT<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> .Body = HBODY</strong><br />
End With<br />
If Not IsNull(HBCC) Then oEMAILITEM.BCC = HBCC<br />
If Not IsNull(HATTACHMENT1) Then oEMAILITEM.Attachments.Add HATTACHMENT1<br />
<br />
oEMAILITEM.Display </p>
<p>
</p><p>the variable <strong>HBODY</strong> is defined as a variant ( was string - experimenting for a fix)</p>
<p>when displayed on the form - formatting looks OK</p>
<p>when the email is displayed in "outlook" it shows all the formatting strings - not the resulting text.</p>
<p>eg</p>

    <title>Cannot unlink Office 365 account and Outlook.com e-mail account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot unlink Office 365 account and Outlook.com e-mail account</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>While I was studying at a university, I linked the e-mail address my school gave me to my personal e-mail address. This was back in 2009 before the outlook.com changes. I would have the e-mails forwarded from my school's account to my personal account.
 Now I have finished I don't to keep getting those e-mails from my school. However, when I signed into the new office 365 web app to delete my personal e-mail address from my account, there is no option for me to remove it! I even tried going to my personal
 account to remove it. But the settings have no record or indication that I previously linked these accounts. I am still receiving e-mails into my personal account from my school via my school's e-mail account and this is very annoying. Can anyone help me of
 have experienced such an issue? How do I resolve this?</div>
                </div>

<div>On the office 365 client the school uses I checked the account options by going to Options -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Connected Accounts and there is nothing there. There is also nothing below where it says "forward my email to"</div>

            <p>I'm also having this issue. Were you able to solve it? The funny thing is that I never manually linked my Outlook account with my university account. It start to appear that way. I tried the same steps that you have tried and there was no success. I also
 find it unusual that when I go to my university account I can see my personal account emails, but when I go to my personal account I cannot see my university emails.</p>

            I never got it resolved. Actually I am just ignoring the emails since no one doesn't seem to have an answer. But I am having the exact same issues you have.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; What is the affected email address?&nbsp; </p>
<p>*&nbsp; What is the university email address that has been linked to Outlook.com? </p>
<p>*&nbsp; How was the link made in the first place?&nbsp; Which interface was used to link the 2 email addresses?&nbsp; Was it on Office 365?&nbsp; On Outlook.com?&nbsp; Or on the university domain?&nbsp;

            A colleague advised I may have misread your post. I thought I read it was msrt.exe (Malicious Software Removal Tool) that your were referring to, not msert.exe (Microsoft Safety Scanner). As such I just wanted to get back and clarify why I answered the
 way I did. <br />
<br />
With that said, the instructions are the same to access either the msrt.log or msert.log.<br />

<h2>            How to set up a dual boot for the Insider Program without a new license for Windows</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 supports multibooting on the same license. &nbsp;This is a change from previous versions of Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Procedure</strong>: &nbsp;After you select the volume you are going to use for a reinstallation of Windows 10 start a clean install using media. &nbsp;Make sure you are using the Fall Update (build 10586) as this is harder to do with the July 29 release (build
 10240).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Setup reaches the Product Key page click the link at the bottom center of the page indicating this is a reinstallation (you are not using a product key). &nbsp;On the next page choose the same edition for which your computer is already registered as a Windows
 10 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Proceed with the installation normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will result in an activated (by digital entitlement) copy of Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Discussion</strong>" &nbsp;Objections to "violating the license" as a result of wording in the license for some reason are reasonable but don't seem to apply. &nbsp;(I am fully conversant with Microsft EULAs.) &nbsp;This procedure would have violated the EULA of
 any previous version, but does not appear to in Windows 10, the present wording notwithstanding. &nbsp;Whether this is by Microsoft tolerance or simply a need to update the EULA, I don't know. &nbsp;Perhaps it is because a second installation is described as a reinstallation,
 as becomes clear on the product key page when you select the link at the bottom middle of the page to continue without a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this procedure with Build 10240 a couple of months ago when the Product Key page would not advance without a product key (clean installs) and supplied the dummy key just to get Setup to continue. &nbsp;I contacted Support for activation help and was up
 front that I was trying to dual boot on one license. &nbsp;A second level Answer tech remoted into my computer and, using a retail key, activated Windows for me. &nbsp;This is also consistent with a tweet from Gabe Aul (last summer) responding to a user asking about
 dual booting this way. &nbsp;Aul commented that dual booting on the same license was possible but virtual machines each required their own licenses. &nbsp;I have tried to recover the quote from the net but apparently that string is now archived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has changed is that the first installation of Windows 10 registers the <em>
computer </em>as a Windows 10 device. &nbsp;The focus of anti-piracy measures has changed from the software to the hardware. &nbsp;Your motherboard's serial number is now accessible in your MSA account at
<em>account.microsoft.com</em> by clicking to the right of the device icon. The motherboard serial number is the basis for the device's registration as a Windows 10 device. &nbsp;The device list shows those devices you have associated with your MSA. &nbsp;The link you
 click on the product key page for subsequent installations defines what you are doing as a
<em>reinstallation</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Functionally, it just works and does not require any "workarounds" or "tricks." &nbsp;In cooperation with fellow insider John AC Nolan we have verified this using the Fall Update. &nbsp;This provides a way for someone wanting to be an insider but not having a spare
 license for Windows 7 or 8 to participate without succumbing to the temptation to use their primary copy of Windows.</p>

<p>We've observed that either a total wipe and reload, a dual boot cloning of the original W10 drive, or second installation from scratch of W10&nbsp;for bios&nbsp;dual boot on the same machine works, simply and easily.&nbsp; This is a&nbsp;tremendous bonus for W10 users.&nbsp; We
 all have the ability to simply install the OS on a second attached drive for dual boot reliability&nbsp;or to pull and keep handy for quick and easy crash or infection recovery&nbsp;without the need for cloning software.&nbsp; You can also&nbsp;have one drive to boot to&nbsp;for work
 and the other to boot to for experimental use, say&nbsp;if you're coding or creating Apps. This a&nbsp;HUGE benefit of the new licensing scheme.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can say too, that my device used for the Insider&nbsp;program&nbsp;is an older ACPI compliant, non-UEFI,&nbsp;non-secure boot bios motherboard from ECS (HP), and the digital tattoo&nbsp;is in place and working fine.&nbsp; I was dual boot with W7.&nbsp; Now I triple boot with (2) W10
 drives, both reporting activated,&nbsp;and (1) W7 drive activated the old way. &nbsp;I'm seeing all kinds of possibilities here.&nbsp; I'm going to&nbsp;guess that it&nbsp;doesn't matter about&nbsp;which hard&nbsp;drive is attached to your computer&nbsp;with W10 on it, as long as it's yours and
 has seen that motherboard and bios at first installation.&nbsp; My first DVD via ISO installation is on a WDC Black 1TB.&nbsp; I did my second install a day ago&nbsp;the same way (with crossed fingers) on a Seagate Constellation 2TB.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; No issues.&nbsp; MAYBE it doesn't
 matter about&nbsp;the video card, network card, etc. anymore&nbsp;either within reason.&nbsp; I think as long as the system motherboard registration is intact in bios, you&nbsp;MIGHT be&nbsp;good to go a reasonable distance in swapping components and memory&nbsp;for repairs or upgrade.&nbsp;
 Can you take a W10 drive created on one computer and attach it to another&nbsp;that also has&nbsp;the digital tattoo identifying it as a W10 device also&nbsp;and have it work?&nbsp; I do NOT know.&nbsp; I don't have a second W10 box yet to try it on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know in the past in order to keep a machine current it was pretty easy to make a few hardware changes and find yourself on the phone with Windows Activation.&nbsp; It happened to me three times in the last year, twice with Vista and once with Windows 7.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kudos to Colin for all the work done rooting out licensing detail!&nbsp; Anybody else that wants to explore and stretch the envelope jump right in!</p>

<p>Most welcome Colin.&nbsp; :&gt;)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, an interesting side note.&nbsp; I addition to the recorded digital entitlement on my MS profile and tattooed on the motherboard&nbsp;bios, I&nbsp;ALSO have a product key reported by Belarc Advisor, and it's an MS issued, legitimate, and&nbsp;familiar one.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp;
 I wonder at the impact this might have on activations?&nbsp; The fact that I have one would indicate to me there is a reason for it and a probable use, but for what?&nbsp; I did not upgrade from W7 or 8 or 8.1.&nbsp; I got my digital entitlement along the road in the Insider
 Program at RTM I believe.&nbsp; That much I know.&nbsp; It never occurred to me to look for a Key.&nbsp; I just picked it up on the Belarc analysis I ran, and it's recorded in two places for both the OS and IE11.&nbsp; Hmmmmmm.</p>

            <p>Thank you for this information, this could come in very handy as my 10586 installation won't boot any more since the cumulative update that came in on November 20. I am facing the prospect of a reinstall but was hesitating because I wasn't sure if I'd have
 to enter a product key -- my installation came "free" by virtue of enrolling in the Insiders program back in 2014 and I set it up on its own partition alongside (not on top of) a Windows 7 installation.<br />
</p>
<p>Just one question about the reinstallation process: I have the newly issued 10586 setup disk, downloaded this week. If I reboot with this disk and run through the Win10 reinstallation procedure, will it ask me, at some point, to specify exactly which partition
 I want to install Win10 on? I don't want to run the risk of obliterating my good Windows 7 installation thanks to excessive automation, so if I don't get the chance to tell it precisely where to reinstall Win10 I'd rather do without it.</p>

            <p>Yes. &nbsp;It is a normal clean install and works like previous versions of Windows in that regard. &nbsp;If your Windows 10 that messed up was digitally entitled then you can do what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get to the product key page just remember to click the link that says "I don't have a product key" and on the next page click the same edition choice you have been using.</p>

            <p>I think I've just realized why some people without a valid upgrade are able to keep activation from the Insider Preview on reinstallation and others, like me, lose it. &nbsp;I wonder how many systems report a default motherboard serial number to Windows and prevent
 digital entitlement from working correctly. &nbsp;I've considered that the digital entitlement was tied to the reported motherboard serial number, but when I realized my system BIOS was reporting a false number, I assumed Microsoft had to be using other methods
 for system identification as wll, but I think I may have given Microsoft too much credit. &nbsp;Then again... I could be wrong again. &nbsp;lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry... Wasn't trying to hijack the thread. &nbsp;Please continue with the normally scheduled programming. &nbsp;Have a good one!</p>

            <p>Digital entitlement did not begin until mid-July when we were all told that we had to be sure to re-install using 10240 if we had started the insider program from an activated copy of Win 7 or 8. &nbsp;That was to trigger digital entitlement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those who had clean-installed their first preveiw build had to continue accepting preview builds or re-install a copy of Win 7 or 8 and then upgrade to 10240 if they digital entitlement, although those terms were in common use for a few weeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who didn't do this and had clean-installed a preview build could maintain activation only by continuing to upgrade to each preview build as it released but stopping receipt of preview builds meant deactivation by mid-August.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was because because up until mid-July the preview builds were activated by product keys special to each build and all of these were timebombed. &nbsp;Those product key were disabled in July to prevent new installations of the pre-10240 builds. &nbsp;So it was
 stay on the program or revert and upgrade to the official release to get digital entitlement, or buy Windows.</p>

</p><blockquote>Have you tried booting from the installation disk and selecting the repair tools in the lower left on the screen that says Install Now?
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the idea. I booted from the installation disk and clicked on "Repair this PC" as you suggested, but at that point it's not entirely clear which option to select for my purposes: there's "Reset this PC" or if you choose Advanced Options there are
 several other options, such as "System Image Recovery" or "Go back to the previous build." I'm not confident that any of these latter ones will work since I've been trying them for a week without success; not sure if having the installation DVD in place will
 make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the time being, I selected "Reset this PC" but got a message saying that, "The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again." Huh??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trouble is that even if I figure out what the heck it means by a drive being "locked," I'm not sure
<strong>which</strong> drive it's referring to. I sure wish it would simply list the various partitions on the HDD and then let me pick which one to install or repair.</p>

<h2>            URGENT HELP NEEDED- MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4. - Microsoft word does not open</h2>
                    <p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have Microsoft office 365. Yesterday, I was writing on the word document and suddenly it stopped working (could not write or click anything within the document) and I had to force quit.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After I force quitting, the Microsoft Excel, paint, outlook, etc were opening but word did not open. The icon kept popping/jumping and the program never opened.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I deleted all the programs (word, excel, power point, etc) and reinstall at least 5 times. it only worked for one time and then stopped work.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I checked online and tried to clear cache, but nothing happened.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I located a file named "normal.dotm", which I guess is a startup file. If I delete this file than&nbsp;the word opens for one time after that it doesn't&nbsp;as it makes another&nbsp;"normal.dotm".</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Online someone said to change its name to "oldnormal.dotm". I did that, and again it opened for just one time.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, Its very frustrating especially when you passed your&nbsp;submission deadline because of this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>It could be that some files or programs on your device have damaged some components in Windows while the update to the build is processing. May we know if the computer is connected within a domain network? Since RPC or Remote Procedure Call is a mechanism
 that allows communications between a client and a server across a domain network.</p>
<p>

<p>Just curious why you are doing all those steps. I know you are experienced and probably already have an ISO for 17035 why not just start there, or with 17025.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I do clean install I do offline first. Gets me user folder of what I want named (matches user account name) no password and on my test machines it bypasses any login screen. I rename computer name, shut off uac then restart computer. I go online,
 usually sign in with Feedback to MS account and let it sign me in to all apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great thing about starting with Insider ISO is you are now setup as insider due to signing in to Hub earlier so only thing left is to verify account and set it back to Fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for going on so long, frustration of not being able to install 17035 on test laptop due to AMD issue. Not from ISO image or even clean install. It would just hang on 1st boot with the MS icon and circle spinning. Not sure if you were wondering this
 in another post. 17035 running good in vm.</p>

<h2>            Removing clutter from the Assignments page in Teams for Education</h2>
                    As I add more assignments to a class, is there any way to remove or hide the older ones?&nbsp; I'm new to Teams for Education, but have run into similar issues in Moodle &amp; Edmodo:&nbsp; the feed gets cluttered.

<p>
</p><p>This is happening to me all the time too now and it is driving me to utter distraction.&nbsp; No other user at all has access to my files only me and no-one is making any changes whatsoever to the file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I am trying to do is save them locally on my laptop in my OneDrive files and hoped to have them saved periodically to the Cloud's OneDrive.&nbsp; I never edit them on the Cloud - it is for safekeeping and backup purposes only.&nbsp; And yet time and time again
 I get this message forcing me to save my local drive version with a new name just to ensure that my changes aren't lost.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too also do not have autosave on (and I HATE that Microsoft assume that we want it on for ALL documents saved to OneDrive - as if we are fools and can't save ourselves - there is no workaround for this that I have found and it also drives me mad.&nbsp; I need
 to be able to prove that document X was last modified at Y date even though I may want to view it.&nbsp; In the past this was fine - open it then close and say no to 'save changes' when closing down.&nbsp; Now, if I open it without thinking, it has automatically saved
 with today's date as autosave now switches on automatically on ALL Excel files saves in OneDrive despite me not having been asked if I wanted that.&nbsp; My only workaround to view a file and not have it change on me is to save a copy that I can open and not mind
 if it get's changed.&nbsp; Nightmare!).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway - I am not sure if my turning off autosave in the documents I am working on is part of the issue.&nbsp; But time and time and time again I get this error message and it is driving me nuts.&nbsp; Makes me want to get rid of 365 altogether and move back to Office
 2007 which worked so much better than this nonsense (never mind much quicker too).</p>

<p>Hi linz_h,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your case, we suggest you follow the steps below to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>1. Right click OneDrive icon in the taskbar, click Settings.</p>
<p>2. Choose the Office tab, just like the picture below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cef4080-239e-41be-8d91-fb1a12bc575b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cef4080-239e-41be-8d91-fb1a12bc575b?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>3. Untick the option of “Use Office 2016 to sync Office files that I open”, then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About AutoSave, you can refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-autosave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Ronnie, I understand the developers' desire to have patches and updates quickly executed on users 'computers. It makes sense, but can be quite counterproductive.&nbsp; More than once, in Build 9879, I've had Windows Updates try to foist Nvidia video card drivers
 on my system, drivers that were IDENTICAL to the Nvidia drivers already installed and working perfectly on the system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I learned the registry edit to block automatic updating, the forced, redundant drivers installation wreaked havoc on the system, as I was in the middle of changing settings, multitasking, and installing applications (real applications, not the cellphone
 ditties).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would encourage the software engineers to at least allow the user to select the option for Windows Updates to notify of available software, but not to force. I probably would have quit the 10TP preview by now if I hadn't been able to select the redundant
 drivers and have Windows Update make them not visible.</p>

<p>I have had my Lumia 521 for a couple years and now the battery drained to 0%, but when i plugged it in it did not begin charging/turn on, nor did the low battery symbol show up. Also, the part of the usb plugged into the phone began to heat up. Is there
 any solution to this or is the battery just shot?</p>

<p>Outlook can't send and receive email this morning. Can't update folder. no error message, it just stuck. Displays "Trying to connect..." at the bottom. I tried to repair the account, it stuck for a long time trying to reach the mail server and nothing happen.
 However, on Chrome and IE, I have no problem using the web based email page. Then on my phone, no new mail and can't send mail. New mails stuck in the outbox and keep giving me failed send notice. It can't be my ISP because I am using different networks. So
 anyone know how to make it work again? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Outlook downloaded lots of old duplicate emails but no new emails since I exported a pst file</h2>
                    <p>I have several Gmail addresses, which I download to Outlook. Two days ago I exported my Outlook folders from my old computer to a pst file, which I then tried to import into my new computer, without much success as some of the content was corrupted (or so
 the message said). However, I experienced other problems on my new computer, running Outlook 365, as Outlook then started downloading thousands of emails from the Gmail server into my account. I went into my Gmail accounts online and deleted all emails there,
 but many of them reappeared after deletion, and continued to download to Outlook 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After two days I have now gone back to using my old computer, as there are problems with my new one (and I have to send it back), but Outlook 2010 no longer downloads new emails from my Gmail account, even though I have not changed any settings. I leave
 a copy of messages on the server. I can send emails to myself, which arrive on the Gmail server but do not download to Outlook. The latest emails downloaded two days ago, when I first disconnected my old computer. When I test the Outlook account settings,
 they work fine.</p>

 downloaded to Outlook 2010, whereas the same emails would have been new to the new computer), but no new emails since two days ago.</p>

 they show up on Gmail online. Could my Outlook be corrupted? When I was trying to export a pst file in changing computers, it kept crashing, probably because I have thousands of emails. And the pst file was corrupt in the end (I couldn't download to the new
 computer from it).&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Harsha</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been trying to export my Outlook emails as a .pst file from the old computer (current), and to import it into the new computer (which I'm now not using any more). The import failed part of the way through because the file, apparently, was corrupted.
 That doesn't matter, as I've gone back to my old computer. But my original Outlook account on the old computer (which I'm now using) does not download emails any more. It's configured to IMAP for the accounts. The Gmail settings (online) are for both IMAP
 and POP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook seems to be downloading files to one account - I get quick glimpses of them, but then they're aren't in the folders when I check them. And the occasional very old file is also downloading, including stuff from my drafts folder.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks again, Harsha. I've found out the root of my Outlook problem, or at least one of the problems. I have deleted and added the same email address more than once, thinking to sort out any corruption in the configuration of the accounts, and each time
 I've done so it's created a new folder, so that I now have two or three .pst folders/files for each email address. How can I merge the ones for the same address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also need to archive older emails. I have many subfolders under the main folder 'Outlook', into which I sort out both incoming and outgoing mail. I need to archive older emails within each of these folders. Is this possible, or is it not a good idea in
 that the folders will still be very large, albeit with an archive subfolder?</p>

    <title>Stripped Down Version of Office 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charmoffensive  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stripped Down Version of Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>This product is missing numerous features of Office 2013 across the board - Outlook, Word etc. &nbsp;The list is endless. In Outlook, you can't insert table in a message. You can only copy it over from Word and then you can't edit it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;You can't customize the ribbon. The text in messages you are composing is tiny in Outlook. No favorite folders in Outlook etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2016 for the Mac is an attempt by MS to throw Apple users a few more bones. &nbsp;Personally, since the MacBook Pro Retina 13.3" is the best Windows laptop ever made (yes I meant what I said), I will simply run Office 2013 for Windows in a virtual machine
 on my Mac and stay far and clear from this stripped down version MS Office is offering to 2nd class citizens of the Office World.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Office2016 Is a Public Beta. That means many features either haven't been written yet, or is in the testing stages and, the reason for such a Public Display of FeedBack (Smiley face on The Ribbon) is they&nbsp;<strong>want Customer Participation in Bug reporting
 a request for features.&nbsp;</strong>They even have a place where you give your email address and&nbsp; a Checkbox whether you want to send. With the "Slight possibility they may write you for followup. (However don't your breath waiting.). Doing this this way is un
 precedented in the 40-50 year old history of Microsoft. Usually MS tells you what they are going to do and have in past resented customer attempts at help. Either with Bug reports RFE's (request for enhancements).<br />
</p>
<p>Will all the features in Office 2013 make it in 2016 for Mac. No, Way, Jose!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some features tied to Active-X that will never get in. As to where Windows Form controls for VBA and Macros like is in PC that don't use Active-X will they make it in this time? I hope so. but am not betting the Bank on such.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly there are some features like Publisher that many MVP hope never see the light of day in Mac. Many consider Publisher a Gimmick. If you need a Layout program then use one such as InDesign Quark Express and others. All the Publisher feature does is,
 make the document unduly complex and makes prone to Corrupting and Crashing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I'd really love to see come to Mac, and&nbsp;work exactly like it does on PC is Perhaps Access.</p>

            That may be true for you, but if you don't use Visio and rely solely on Office, that argument does not hold up. The typical user is probably more like me. Using Visio or Publisher alongside office is an outlier.

<p>If you want the Zune HD 16GB you're looking at only 179.00 - Where as the competition sells their 8GB version for 229.00 -</p>
<p>Seems to me that the Zune Devices are very competitively priced!!! -&nbsp;&nbsp;:-) Besides that, the competition can't even come close to the Zune Marketplace -&nbsp;</p>

                    My daughter bought the Zune about 5 years ago but she never used it. I decide to try it. It works fine when plugged in to the comp. or wall socket. The battery looks like it is charging because it does turn green. When I unplug it, I cannot turn it on
 or even reboot it. Then when it is plugged back in the battery icon is red and starts to charge again. Is there anything that can be done? Thank you for any help you can give.

            If it's been sitting for 5 years the battery is likely dead.&nbsp; They aren't intended for total inactivity for extended periods.&nbsp; The repair center for Zunes was shut down after they stopped making them 2 years ago.&nbsp; You can look into 3rd party repair places
 to see if any of them still service it, but that's pretty much your only option.
