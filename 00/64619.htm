<h2>            Windows 7 Search only find files that I already opened</h2>
                    <p>I have Indexing Options setup to index an entire folder. But when I search it doesn't find anything even that it says: Indexing complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I manually find the file using Windows Explorer, the file immediately is there on the fast search. I guess that is not the way its suppose to work, since the search is pretty useless like that. Is this a known issue? Is there any fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: If that is any help, the folder have subfolders and all files are PDF. I'm not trying to search things inside the PDF only PDF filename.</p>

<p>Hi Douglas, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering that you've set up the search to look for an entire folder and it is not working properly, we suggest running the troubleshooter for Windows Search.

</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the answer. But the troubleshoot did not find any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any KB that would solve this? Or a fix it? Because I did all windows updates but not the ones that fix problems. I mean, all security and mandatory updates. Maybe some tool can identify the recommended updates related to search and install only
 them.</p>

<h2>            My DVD RW Drive &#40;D&#58;&#41; Icon Disappears</h2>
                    Hello Dear Microsoft Support Community
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am having a problem with my DVD RW Drive where it keeps disappearing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Last week I had a fault and had to bring this laptop to have it's OS re-installed. It was an XP but has been wonderfully restored to a Windows 7 and it now runs like a train, but very on time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I noticed yesterday that the icon had disappeared when I went to re-install my printer&nbsp;and noticed the icon missing.</div>
<div>I then thought of Microsoft MrFixIt which worked a treat and my printer is now running as smooth as it did before but much better.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have just gone back today to do a disk clean of files I no-longer need and saw that my DVD Icon has gone again, I tried the MrFixIt that I used yesterday but it never worked so I downloaded it again and it's back, and I have since gone to my Toshiba's
 website and installed any patches I can for it, though am still dubious that it might not stay and go for a wonder again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could someone enlighten me as how I would stop this from disappearing in the near and far future, PLEASE.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>JTV</div>
                </div>

            Hi<br />
Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
Method 1:<br />
Go to start-&gt;right click Computer-&gt;click Manage. Click Yes if UAC pops-up. On the left pane of Computer Management, navigate to \Storage\Disk Management, by expanding it. When you click Disk Management, you should see list of storage drives (optical drives
 as well). If listed, right click and click add drive letters. Select the drive letter you want and click Ok-&gt;Ok. Now you should see the drive in Computer. If the drive is not listed, try the next methods.<br />
<br />
Method 2:<br />
Check the connectivity/power cables of the optical drive for any connectivity problems. Connectivity problems raise a loose contact issue which works sometimes and fails sometimes. Replace the cable(s) if found defective.<br />
<br />
Method 3:<br />
If the above two methods fails, try resetting the BIOS. [Refer you PC documentation for resetting the BIOS].<br />
<br />
Method 4:<br />
If all of the above method fails, replace the optical drive.<br />
        </p>

            Dear Balaji M Kundalam
<div><br />
<div>Am so sorry I have taken so long to reply to you concerning this subject, at the time I had some greater problems and since had this laptop upgraded from XP to Win7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That problem still exists&nbsp;and I had to bring this PC back twice to get solved, or so I thought till today I noticed my CD/DVD icon had gone missing again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Around the time when it was happening I used Microsoft MrFixIt which does find it and replaced it in place.</div>
<div>Today I used MrFixIt again, I looked into the manage section before and after and found that the CD/DVD info is only held at the bottom part of Computer Management Window.</div>
<div>Should this not be placed in the upper part of the window too, if so am I given the directions to do so,
<span>in</span> hope that it will fix this problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The thing is, I know the CD/DVD is working once the connection is stable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please could you direct me again in this matter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yours sincerely</div>
<div>JT Valerie</div>

<div>It's not necessary that it must be in the upper part. If you can see the device in Computer Management, it means that the device is detected and works fine. But if you can't see it in Computer, try method 1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the drive is not detected in Computer Management, try method 2 or ultimately, method 4.</div>

            <p>Dear Dear Balaji M Kundalam </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope you are still with us and MS Windows, or someone can continue to help with this subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still getting this problem and the MS MrFixIt has almost come to the end of it's days to help and fit it, which I have now found it leaves this subject partially fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same laptop with a new Hardrive.</p>
<p>I am planning to add more RAM&nbsp;memory from 2 to 4GB and due to the coming upgrade of Win10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will renew any cords that are possibly causing this problem, but I want to send to you these pictures, if they will help in me making any sense of what I may need to do further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the drives seem not to sit together in the graph and I was hoping if possible to find if this can be changed, to stabilize my running laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope these will help you guide me</p>
<p>

            <div>
<p>My DVD+RW, has been giving me problems finding the icon in the My Computer XP/Computer Win7/ This PC Win10 folder.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Over the years I have asked the Microsoft Answers Community to help<br />
In that time I was directed to use an application called: MicrosoftFixIt.dvd.FISC.1361408439102856.1.1.Run and another application of more or less the same credentials. This application was created about the time of the OS Win7 to fix problems via a online
 service from Microsoft.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks ago, Microsoft Tech Support got my "DVD RW Icon" back to <br />
where it should be.<br />
The only problem is that we did not test to see it working it's functions.<br />
After my MSTS finished chatting, I tried a DVD, but it did not play and<br />
when I tried to eject it. The DVD RW draw, would not open.<br />
I had to emergency shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>On the 14/02/2016, I tried to find the item and somehow, after<br />
a "folder reset", I attained the item.<br />
Then I tried to play a DVD, but this error came up instead.<br />
"Playback Error, Catastrophic failure, 0x8000ffff"</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Can no one tell me what could be wrong, is it possibly the optical wire, but<br />
I don't think this could be the problem, as am sure it would not<br />
work at all, but it could be!</p>
<p>Or someone please put me out of my misery and tell me to "give up trying", please.</p>

            <p>Dear Alexei S</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not remember marking your reply as the answer and this is quite surprising answer, as I do not recall any Win7 hiding their DVD (RW) icon as the default going through several in my time.</p>
<p>If this is so, then that default continued with Win8 and 8.1, where I do recall that the "My Computer/Computer/This PC was not displayed on the desktop and was difficult to move/send/create shortcut for those items and therefore arriving at the DVD (RW)
 would take a different path.</p>

</p>
<p>Saying can't sent 8 message&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that you tried to send a message that couldn't be sent, probably the photo email. This meant it got stuck in the outbox and created a logjam, so no later messages could be sent either. To clear the logjam, then,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click once on the <em>Working online</em> status message to change it to <em>
Working Offline:</em><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb8683e8-9a85-4b50-ba0d-e8961a99d394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb8683e8-9a85-4b50-ba0d-e8961a99d394" /></a><br />
If you don't see the status message, enable <em>Status bar </em>on the <em>View</em> tab.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Disconnect from the Internet, e.g. by disabling Wi-Fi or unplugging the Ethernet cable.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Remove all the messages from the outbox, below the account folders in the folder pane:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efee7585-5aed-4c1a-903e-ce875eeea7bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efee7585-5aed-4c1a-903e-ce875eeea7bf" /></a><br />
If you want to try resending them (but not the photo email), drag them to a <em>Drafts</em> folder. Otherwise, just delete them.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>When the outbox is empty, compose a new test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself (eg from the emailsvr.com account to the same account). Post&nbsp;any new error message in your reply.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8CCC0003</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The photo email feature depends on your being signed in in Windows Live Mail with a Microsoft Account. This is because the feature uploads the pictures to OneDrive and only includes small thumbnails in the actual mail message together with a link to the
 online pictures. This makes it much easier to share pictures without clogging up mailboxes with large messages. You have to be signed in for the program to know which OneDrive account to upload the pictures to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error often arises if you use the <em>Send to&nbsp;&gt; Mail recipient </em>or similar function to start a new message with a picture while you're not signed in.

<p>You can create a text file with all the entries as follows:</p>
<p>1) Click on Start and type CMD in search bar</p>
<p>2) Right click on the cmd.exe entry in the "Programs (1)" list and select "Run as administrator"</p>
<p>3) At the command prompt which will be: C:\Windows\system32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enter the commands listed below.<br />
3a) C:\Windows\system32&gt; CD C:\users&nbsp;&nbsp; and press the enter key<br />
3b) Next enter:&nbsp; dir&nbsp;&nbsp; and press enter<br />
one of the entries in the list will be your account name, example: My Name<br />
3c) now enter: CD "My name"&nbsp;&nbsp; and press enter</p>
<p>4) The command line prompt should now be:&nbsp; C:\Users\My Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; where 'My Name' represents your account name.<br />
5) Now enter the following at the prompt:&nbsp; dir&nbsp; /al&nbsp; /s&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; C:\Results.txt</p>
<p>6) Open Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you should see the "Results.txt" file you just created.</p>
<p>7) use the content of this file to review all the junction points. None of which should point to files located on the backup drive. Note: Trying to backup files on the USB drive to the USB drive can cause the error 0x81000037.</p>

<h2>            The Compatibility Pack fiasco</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, dont know how it happened or why but the Skarlet that everyone is playing with is the same Skarlet that people would see on-line had they not bought Skarlet and just had the compatibility pack. This is basically the Skarlet that hackers would use if
 they hacked the Compatibility Pack to get Skarlet for free it is like a failsafe almost and does not give alt or the stats in the Nekropolis,etc. Someone at NRS really screwed up and now I just wonder what impact this will have on all future DLC characters.</p>

<p>So, you're saying that people playing Skarlet...are playing Skarlet. I don't understand. There's no difference between buying her and having the compatibility pack other than the coding for it. It works like that for other games as well. It won't have any
 impact on future DLC other than them knowing the hiccups along the way.</p>

<p>What I am saying is that the reason that she doesnt have a alt or stats in the Nekropolis is that the Skarlet we are playing is the same one OTHERS on-line would see if they are fighting Skarlet and havent purchased her. Can the people that only have the
 compatibility pack be able to view her alt in the Nekropolis or even view her stats in the Nekropolis? No. BUT if they hack the compatibility pack they get Skarlet but still dont get access to her alt or her stats. Sound familiar? The Compatibility Pack got
 glitched somehow and the files is reading as if hackers had hacked the compatibility pack and basically get Skarlet like she would be played in a demo.</p>

<p>First of all, nothing is hacked. Secondly, we don't know for sure if she should be viewable in the Nekropolis yet or not. From the current issues, I wouldn't set anything in stone just yet. I've seen her alternate outfit as well, but it may just be inaccessible
 due to the current problems. I haven't seen any photos or videos of her statue in the Nekropolis at all, have you? If so, please show it.</p>

<p>Well, whatever the case and if it turns out that the DLC doesnt have alts or Mastery stats or a way to see their arcade ending without keep having to play arcade over and over again than $5 is a bit expensive for one character to not have an alt or a place
 in the Nekropolis like everyone else. People cant say that there isnt room in the Nekropolis because NRS should have planned it for the DLC also when they were making the core game, we know they were planning DLC from the beginning with the inclusion of DLC
 skins in the game already. I just wish someone from NRS would confirm if the DLC has alts or not.</p>

<p>They'll probably work on the Nekropolis issue after they fix the issues online more. I rather then focus on online more than stat tracking for one character, to be honest. I know we've seen Skarlet's alternate in screen shots, but they may have decided against
 it before release. I won't lie, I doubt they did and they'll fix it soon. As for $5 being too expensive, perhaps. It's more than I would expect to pay for a character, but with what's given, I think it's fairly decent. She has her own moves, combos, animations,
 and fatalities. She's also new to the MK series, as opposed to her first 'appearance' through an error within the earlier games. We'll know soon enough what's going on when the online issue is dealt with more.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 slim non si accende - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giob it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 slim non si accende</h2>
                    
<p>Da ieri la 360 slim presa ad aprile non si accende,i tasti suonano ma il lettore non si apre e la console non si accende</p>
<p>Oggi ho fatto la richiesta di assistenza,ma ho notato che vogliono che spedisco la console senza niente,ma se il problema è nell'alimentatore?la console arriva in assistenza,vedono che funziona e per esclusione di altri fattori mi mettono un altro alimentatore
 o me la rispediscono senza?</p>
<p>Non sarebbe possibile mandarmi direttamente l'alimentatore?Avevo trovato una pagina nell'assistenza dove c'era il link,ma quel link non è più valido</p>
<p>L'ho presa in un gamestop,c'è la possibilità che se gliela porto me la fanno provare con un altro alimentatore in modo da capire se è la console ad avere problemi o l'alimentatore?</p>
<p>Il led dell'alimentatore è giallo quando è collegato alla rete elettrica indipendentemente se la console è collegata o meno,quando provo ad accenderla diventa verde per un istante e poi torna giallo,è guasto?</p>

<p>@ GioB IT: hai una valida ragione per credere che sia l'alimentatore il tuo problema? A questo proposito ti lascio un link così fai tutte le verifiche del caso:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/it-IT/xbox-360/flashing-lights/three-flashinglights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../three-flashinglights</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Per la tua ultima domanda: no, non ti mandano l'alimentatore insieme alla console riparata.
</p>
<p>Probabilmente Net Master si sará confuso con un'altra console o ricorda male.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In ogni caso fidati dell'assistenza, se ti hann detto di inviargli la console é solo quello il tuo problema.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Facci sapere come risolvi, grazie.</p>

<p>In realtá non ti hanno inviato l'alimentatore, ( la prima console Microsoft l'aveva interno), bensí il cavo di alimentazione. Te lo dico con assoluta certezza perché ancora oggi mio figlio la usa.</p>

<p>Se è l'alimentatore dubito fortissimamente che te ne inviino un altro senza avere la prova che il vecchio sia guasto.</p>
<p>Quando ricevono la console valutano quali guasti abbia, se non ci sono la console non subisce la riparazioni di nessun tipo. Però se hai compilato il modulo e alla fine ti consiglia di spedirla qualcosa con la console c'è che non va.</p>
<p>Anche a me capitò di avere un problema con la console è la prima cosa che pensai e diedi la colpa, di così tanta frustrazione, fu l'alimentatore. Chiamai l'assistenza e mi dissero di spedirgliela senza HDD ne alimentatore. L'alimentatore sono 7 anni che
 c'è l'ho e funziona benissimo, consuma come una Ferrari, ma va beh..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Se vuoi toglierti ogni dubbio, chiama l'assistenza e vedi se ti chiedono di inviargli anche l'alimentatore o
<em>solo</em> l'alimentatore.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)"><strong>UPS</strong></span></p>
<p>Come ben saprai la spedizione è a carico della Microsoft, ma tu puoi chiamare UPS e contattarli per gli orari o un diverso indirizzo di consegna. Non penso ci sia possibilità di lasciarla in una mailboxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I looked in C:\Users\Anton&nbsp; and saw all of my documents and everything. I looked in the other folder and it was as if it were a new profile.&nbsp; How can I make my computer load C:\Users\Anton instead of C:\Users\Anton.Anton-PC ? Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Original Title - Apps stop working</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Windows 8 went down with a 0xc0000012a error or something nothing works. Ok Internet Explorer 10 works as I can type these messages but Mail says that it cannot access the server (it doesn't say wich of the 8) also the Store App cann't find the store
 and a number of other unrelated apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did the app.diag magic dance but that didn't help. Should I live with a system that just goes haywire? And don't get me that restore refresh refurbish&nbsp;or &nbsp;re-whatever sh*t.

    <title>Amazon Prime Instant Video audio issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bathosphyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Amazon Prime Instant Video audio issue</h2>
                    Watching Amazon Prime Instant Video is working great, but the audio occasionally makes a single stutter.&nbsp; Like a quick 1/4 second stutter every 5 or 10 minutes.&nbsp; Nothing major, but annoying.<br />
<br />
I read on The Verge ( http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/9/3622306/surface-touch-cover-audio-issues ) about some audio problems.&nbsp; I was going to just hope a future update made for smoother audio, but if it's hardware-related I'd like to get it fixed.<br />
<br />
Does anybody else have this problem?<br />

Generally speaking we need more than one DMP file to spot trends and confirm diagnosis.<br />
<br />
This one crash was related to 2 things.<br />
<br />
1-<span><em>wsnf</em>.<em>sys</em>. Driver Description: Network Filter Service (associated with Quick Heal Antivirus/Internet Security<br />

<br />
No way to tell which killed which, with one DMP.<br />
<br />
I would remove Quick heal completely and use the built in defender in its place.<br />

I suspect you have a USB wifi (or ethernet) connection and quick heal is killing the USBCCGP,sys.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to driver related issues. I suggest you to try installing the PCI and Graphics card drivers in compatibility mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Windows 8.1 article to install the drivers compatibility mode. The steps for Windows 8/8.1 applies to Windows 10 as well.</p>

<p><span>The latest 8.42.0.60 Skype for Desktop version does exit when using Quit from the system tray, but this may take longer time, up to 2 minutes. See this similar case:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/skype-842/fb637c6f-2148-4521-a169-8bc5e60eacb1#LastReply">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/skype-842/fb637c6f-2148-4521-a169-8bc5e60eacb1#LastReply</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It appears, that Skype is now creating some log files on exit, and on my computer (Windows 7) it takes about 2 minutes with 25% CPU load. Within this time, you should see 2 Skype.exe processes still running in Task manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you enable the Command Line option in Task Manager, you will see that the Skype.exe process still running after Quit is using "--reporter-url=
<a href="https://rink.hockeyapp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://rink.hockeyapp.net</span></a> ..." switch. This is probably the URL where Skype now reports it's performance data.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To avoid this delay in exit, you can quit Skype from the menubar. Press Alt, select File -&gt; Quit, or just use Ctrl + Q keyboard shortcut.</span></p>

<p>You don't see the evidence&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't get it do you</p>
<p>They review the network data and the video and audio of what happens on xbox live</p>
<p>Network data is propiatary data</p>
<p>If he's been banned so many times he obviously knows why he got banned</p>
<p>It not once or twice it would be.multiple unless it was severe violation</p>
<p>about the 3months gold you gotta contact support</p>
<p>That's a billing &nbsp;issue</p>
<p>If it was communications ban then he can add gold all he wants.</p>
<p>You do realize that first post I know of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was a troll</p>
<p>Never listen to them not everything on the net is true you can however get the REAL FACTs from official sources like enforcement.xbox.com</p>
<p>You will get farther in llife</p>

</p>
<p>You didn't notice when he was getting longer suspensions that he was on a bad streak really?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They don't issue multiple week suspensions for nothing that would be more serious or egregious ones</p>
<p>It will get approved as long as you didn't ask before if you did that's spaming</p>
<p>They will tell you the reason</p>
<p>They don't have to show you what your son did especially if it is eregious</p>
<p>That should be a private conversation with your son</p>
<p>FYI if it's cursing they are bound by the rules too</p>

<h2>            Witcher 2 Achievements not unlocking </h2>
                    
<p>Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem. When playing the Witcher 2 on my xbox one via backwards compatibility and I get an achievement, in game the notification pops up in the style of xbox 360 saying I have unlocked the achievement but when
 I checked my achievements both online and on my xbox one nothing shows up. Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem or if you guys are aware of it and are working on a fix? Will I need to re-do the achievements that have triggered in game but not
 showing up on my profile? Thanks</p>

<p>Hello DonMatteo13,</p>
<p>I am unsure as to your question. Your original post states that you received the achievement notifications while playing The Witcher 2. Are you asking if they should show up like Xbox One achievements? If that is what you are asking, then no. They will not
 show up in your activity feed. While playing Xbox 360 Backwards Compatible titles, you will receive achievements just like on the Xbox 360 console. To view your achievement guide on the 360 emulator, just hit the View and Menu buttons at the same time, and
 scroll over to achievements. &nbsp;You will not be able to view Xbox 360 achievements from your Xbox One's achievement hub.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>~Blitz</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! Make sure the 360 Guide says that you are signed in when you launch the game. If achievements are showing up as "offline", then this means that your profile hasn't properly downloaded to the Xbox One.</p>
<p>If you hit the Menu and View buttons on your controller to bring up the Guide for the 360 emulator and it says "Connect to Live", do that. Your achievements should properly pop after that.</p>
<p>One thing we've noticed here is if you have two-step verification on, your 360 emulator will not sign in properly. Please remove two-step verification from your account on our <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com</a> page and it should sign you in without issue the next time you try to connect in the emulator.</p>
<p>Let us know if that helps you out! :)</p>

<h2>            Windows XP not starting, System restore ineffective, safe mode w&#47; networking is operational.</h2>
                    Greetings,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Windows XP Home SP3 will not start up, the situation is as follows...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Turn on PC</div>
<div>- PC goes through the regular start up screens all of which appear to be afflicted by random annotations, commas, full stops etc.</div>
<div>- The RAM count appears to take place but displays as gibberish.</div>
<div>- Start up sequence gets as far as the 'Windows XP' screen and then restarts, this cycle perpetuates unless I turn the PC off or push a button.</div>
<div>- I can get to the safe mode start-up options screen.</div>
<div>- Starting Windows 'normally' results in the same problem as above.</div>
<div>- Starting Windows in the 'last known configuration that worked' results in the same problem as above.</div>
<div>- Starting in Safe Mode/Safe Mode with Networking works and I can access the net in both mine and the admin accounts.</div>
<div>- Using System Restore to go back to an earlier system point does not make any difference to the above scenarios. Have tried 3 recent system restore points.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have added no new programs or hardware, I can only think that the problem may have been caused by not properly removing an external usb hard drive, (if anything).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice please ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks,</div>
<div>Sal.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Safe Mode is Windows starting up with a bare minimal of startup programs and many programs and processes that are started with a Normal startup simply aren't running.&nbsp; Since you can start in Safe Mode, the implication is that one of the programs that normally
 starts but doesn't start in Safe Mode is causing your problems.&nbsp; One way you find out which program this is is to use Microsoft's Configuration Editor (msconfig) to turn off startup programs until you find the one(s) that are causing your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Begin by starting in Safe Mode, then bring up the configuration editor:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "msconfig"</p>
<p>When it starts, begin by disabling all "Startup" items, then reboot your computer and see if you still have the problem.&nbsp; If you don't, then go back to configuration editor and turn some of them back on again, reboot, and continue the process until you narrow
 down on the problem.&nbsp; It's a long, iterative process...&nbsp; (If "Startup Items" doesn't fix it, next&nbsp;try "Services").</p>

            It is too bad that the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know next to nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please answer the following questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If you can get to the Advanced Startup Options menu and choose 'Safe Mode' (even though it still might not boot) do you see an option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
When you choose that, if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the <b>Disable automatic restart on system failure</b> option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

            Thank you for both replies.
<div><br />
<div>JW - This procedure did not make a difference to the situation, but thank you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>ElderL - My system is a MESH Computers PC which originally came with Windows XP Media Centre 2005 but following major problems my Windows software has since been re-installed using a Fujitsu Siemens XP Home 2005 OEM disc and upgraded to SP3.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It has a SATA hard drive, Avast free antivirus. Preceding the problem I seem to recall the system freezing, nothing worked only holding down the power button 'til it turns off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have an internal DVD writer which reads CD/DVD but no longer writes DVDs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The 2 windows XP discs that I have to hand are as follows;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Fujitsu Siemens OEM disc Windows XP 2002 with drivers and utilities.</div>
<div>Fujitsu Siemens OEM disc Windows XP Media Centre 2005 with update roll up 2</div>
<div><br />
<div>Neither disc came with my current PC and neither disc matches my current system update which is Windows XP Home SP3. These discs both came with old PCs, neither of which I have any more. My current PC did come with an OEM recovery disc which I no longer
 have. Up until now windows was running fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only hardware I have bought recently that might have an effect was a wi-fi blu-ray player with smart tv which connects to my wireless broadband hub, my PC is also connected to this hub.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Disable automatic restart on system failure.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried pressing F8 and got to a very basic looking boot menu screen which gives me 3 options to boot from either a removable floppy disk, hard disk or CD ROM, it does not look like the advanced menu you mentioned.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is no option to 'disable automatic restart on system failure' that I have seen. Could it be under 'del' or 'F2'?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Something else I have noticed is the BSOD flashes up for less than half a second immediately after the Windows XP loading screen. Too fast to catch on a photo but I was able to catch it on video on my camera phone. The bits you need to know are as follows;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><i><b>A problem has been detected....</b></i></div>
<div><i><b><br />
</b></i></div>
<div><i><b>PAGE_FAULT_IN NON_PAGED_AREA.</b></i></div>
<div><i><b><br />
</b></i></div>
<div><i><b>Follow these steps...</b></i></div>
<div><i><b><br />
</b></i></div>
<div><i><b>Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed.</b></i></div>
<div><i><b>If the problem continues disable or remove any newly installed hardware/software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing..</b></i></div>
<div><i><b><br />
</b></i></div>
<div><i><b>If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart, press F8 to select advanced set-up.</b></i></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>As I have mentioned pressing F8 does not get me to the advanced options, also I have not installed any new software of hardware.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this is not too exhaustive and look forward to hearing from you.</div>
<div>Many thanks,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sal. &nbsp;</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You can see if unplugging any new stuff from the system will allow you to boot normally - as a process of elimination...&nbsp; Just unplug anything new like the '<i>...wi-fi blu-ray player with smart tv which connects to my wireless broadband hub, my PC is
 also connected to this hub...</i>'<br />
<br />
Of course if you unplug your system from your hub and stuff, you may not be able to get on the Internet again but you just want to see if with all things unplugged from your system, will the system boot normally?&nbsp; Then as you plug things back in one at a time
 and reboot after each things is added back, what is the one thing you have plugged in that suddenly makes it not boot normally?<br />
<br />
When you choose Safe Mode, lots of things are not going to load that would load in a normal boot,<br />
so it sounds like when you installed the new stuff it added some startup items/drivers that are not being loaded in the minimal boot Safe Mode configuration so you don't see the problem there.<br />
<br />
You may want to hop out to the manufacturers WWW site for those new things and see if there are any driver updates for your new plater and smart TV items.<br />
<br />
The 3 options you see when pressing F8 don't sound like they are coming from XP - they sound like they are coming from your MESH motherboard startup routine so you might need to let the process get past that part and THEN start tapping F8 again so the XP startup
 will see it (just as the screen goes black).<br />
<br />
Since you can boot in Safe Mode, go ahead and configure your system to create a crash dump file so that the next time XP crashes (if it gets far enough along) there will be a crash dump file with some clues.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
XP is set up to automatically reboot on some system failures, so you need to disable that feature so the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) information will stay on the screen for you to see it.&nbsp; You should also configure XP to create a small memory dump file for
 each BSOD so you will have a crash dump file to look at later if more debugging is needed.<br />
<br />
If your system crashes later, the information you need will still be on the screen and then you can use the information in the memory dump files to figure out what the problem is and fix it.<br />
<br />
Disable Automatic restart on system error<br />
<br />
XP automatically restarts on a system failure, so configure your system so it doesn't do that, then you can see the error message.<br />
<br />
Configure your system to not automatically restart on system failure and to create a crash dump file when it does crash.<br />
<br />
Right click My Computer, Properties, Advanced, Startup and Recovery Settings.<br />
<br />
In the System failure section:<br />
<br />
Put a check mark in the "Write an event to the system log" box<br />
Put a check mark in the "Send an administrative alert" box<br />
Uncheck the "Automatically restart" box<br />
<br />
In the Write debugging information section, choose:<br />
<br />
Small memory dump (64 KB)<br />
<br />
Set the Small dump directory to:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\Minidump&nbsp; (if there is no Minidump folder, it will be created when needed)<br />
<br />
Click OK, OK to save the settings.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and then wait for the next restart/crash.<br />
<br />
After the next BSOD, boot back into Sfae Mode and look here for a crash dump file with the current date/time and ends in .dmp:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\minidump<br />
<br />
When you get a crash dump file (or files), you can upload the most recent ones to your SkyDrive and somebody can take a look at it.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is easiest to just upload the memory dump files from your most recent crashes to your SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then somebody that already has the Windows debugging tools can take a closer look at things and figure
 out what is going on.<br />
<br />
The memory dump files from the recent crashes and BSODs are usually in this folder:<br />
<br />
<br />
The files will be named something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to upload the most recent ones...&nbsp; maybe 5-10 of the most recent crash dump files ought to be enough if you have that many.&nbsp; If you do not have that many, send what you do have.<br />
<br />
Getting started with SkyDrive:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started</a><br />
<br />
After you get your files uploaded and are looking at them on your SkyDrive, you need to "share" your folders/files so others can see them.<br />
<br />
Here is a link that tells you how to do that:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq</a><br />
<br />
Then choose the "Get a link" button.&nbsp; When you click that, a window will open that contains the link to your SkyDrive files.<br />
<br />
Copy the contents of the box "Copy this link to share:" by selecting the link contents (it will all become highlighted), press Ctrl-C (copy) and then come back to the forum and in your next message press Ctrl-V to paste the contents of the link back here.<br />
<br />
What you paste back will look something like this link to my SkyDrive:<br />

<h2>            Installing New Fonts - Control Panel No Install Font Option</h2>
                    I am trying to install fonts used on my 32 bit XP machine onto my 64 bit new Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; People keep referring to opening Fonts in Control Panel and hitting File where an Install Font item is supposed to appear, but no such thing appears in mine.<br />
How do I install these?<br />
I tried opening a new folder for the fonts in windows but it would not let me do that either.
