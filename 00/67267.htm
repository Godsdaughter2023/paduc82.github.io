<h2>            Problem when installing windows 10 version 1809</h2>
                    updates always repeat the installation preparation, is this because when downloading updates with an unstable connection or something else that causes this problem?

            Hi Andre.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it wont' find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Terrible lag despite a good connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Terrible lag despite a good connection</h2>
                    
<p>Hopefully someone can explain this for me, &nbsp;for about the last month and a half anything I do on xbox live game wise has been very laggy. &nbsp;I have done multiple things (power cycle, DMZ my xbox, replaced my modem, etc) but everything still lags terribly.
 &nbsp;The odd part is that I maintain at least 60mb/s down and 8mb/s up with no packet loss and about 130 ping which from Ontario to Seattle, WA is kind of expected. &nbsp;Every game I play that has connection monitors all come up green yet I still rubber band into
 walls and behind objects that I was not intending to get behind. &nbsp;Hopefully someone can enlighten me on what I can possibly do to fix this. &nbsp;Very frustrating!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>If you are talking about the slim, then no. You cannot use the external hard drive from the old xbox. This is because the harddrives from the newer versions (slims) are actually smaller and somewhat implanted inside the machine rather than being on the outside
 like the older ones were. </p>

<p>Yes, but it is not reccomended. Eachgame.hk, sells the casing for the Xbox 360 slim drive.</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 hard drive is a standard laptop 2.5 inch sata drive.</p>
<p>You would need to remove the hard drive from the original xbox styled casing. (which does require alot of effort. because one wrong move and the drive can be cracked from too much pressure on the lid.)</p>
<p>But if you wish to use your old drive. go that way. </p>
<p>KEEP IN MIND-</p>
<p>The Case, IS not an original Microsoft part. </p>
<p>So any Attempt to do so, Will Void any warranty regarding your hard drive if it fails.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Hi Kenny...</p>
<p>I don't know for certain I'll be able to help with your problem because I'm not familiar with 'Vista' and you probably have a different version of WMP too, but I may be able to point you in the right general direction. I need a bit more info about your tape
 converter first...you say the music files have been saved on your pc as wav. files - normally these should burn to CD without a problem. Can you explain briefly how the converter uploaded the files to your pc, how they are titled and the number and&nbsp;length
 of the files you wish to burn to disc? - Thanks, Ric.</p>

            <p>I have a ION converter.It is&nbsp;AUDACITY Software.It is suppose to upload to ITUNES then I have to download from ITUNES to my windows media player.Now I can't seem to even get the song files&nbsp;to load into ITUNES.It tells me does noy support those files.So,then
 I use AUDACITY to convert what I have converted from cassette music to WAV files,I can play them on the windows media player,but can't burn to CD.Tho I did get two songs to burn.Then I couldn,t get it to burn anymore songs.Music length is not an issue,I just
 title the songs asto what there titles.&nbsp;Maybe time for a new computer system.It's 10 years old.&nbsp;Got me baffled.</p>
<p>I 'll keep trying different things,maybe I'll get the results&nbsp;I am looking for.</p>
<p>Thanks K.T.</p>

            <p>Thanks for updating...I use 'Audacity' but rather than using any conversion tools - my music system is set up to record directly to Audacity on the pc whether from vinyl or cassette etc.&nbsp;I then have to re-edit the wav. files and then (if needed) create an
 mp3 version (and I use iTunes for Windows to create the mp3).</p>
<p>So in theory everything you want to do should be possible - as you say it may just be that there are bits of older software involved here that aren't talking to each other in the desired way! I went from XP to W7 (fortunately by the sound of things!) completely
 missing 'Vista' so that's one element I cannot shed any light on.</p>
<p>I'll be glad to try and help you with the other aspects if you do get stuck...Cheers, R.</p>

    <title>Lenovo Explorer not detected by Windows Mixed Reality App at Set Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrissykes1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Explorer not detected by Windows Mixed Reality App at Set Up</h2>
                    <p>My brand new Lenovo Explorer Headset is not detected by the WMR app at set up, despite it being plugged in correctly, my desktop PC meeting all the hardware requirements and everything being updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have returned one headset already assuming it was a fault with the hardware, but I am experiencing exactly the same issues with the replacement that Lenovo have sent me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary I have tried / can see the follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* The headset is detected in Device Manager in Windows under&nbsp; Mixed Reality devices - "Lenovo Explorer."&nbsp; - Monitors - "Mixed Reality Headset" and also under "Universal Serial Buses Devices" - HoloLens Sensor. All of these say "The Device is working properly".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Windows 10 is fully up to date&nbsp;</p>
<p>* My GPU Drivers (Nvida Geforce 1080) is fully up to date&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The Headset is plugged into the motherboard directly, via a USB 3.0 port. I have tried all 4 of the USB 3.0 ports on the motherboard with the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The Headset is plugged directly into the GPU via HDMI. Monitor is connected via Display Port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I am not using any form of extender or port adaptor for the HDMI or USB connections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers for the headset and restarted the PC on several occasions&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I have reset the Windows Mixed Reality App</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help anyone can give me to resolve this will be gratefully received.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi ChrisSykes1 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your Lenovo issues.
<br />
<br />My immediate response is that something has happened with the drivers. My experience with troubleshooting Lenovo system has been very good using their update utility. 
<br />
<br />Try downloading the utility from the following link and see if this resolves your issues. 
<br />

<br />
<br />You mention having checked all the updates and hardware.  Try using their utilty and see what it finds.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />

<p>Hello Fernando,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is not a Lenovo system/pc, so I believe the download that you suggest will not help resolve the issue I am having with the Lenovo Explorer Mixed Reality on my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarity my PC is a self built system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other suggestions, that would be great&nbsp;</p>

            If all other USB devices are working on our computer then you might be looking at some hardware incompatibility.  If you have another computer available to try your headset, I would suggest trying to see if it works.

<h2>            Games For Windows Live Problem - GTA Key Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>

<p>I've posted this topic in this forum and I'm unable to find it so Ile try here.</p>

<p>I've got an issue with my GTA IV PC Game I've exceeded the use of my Key when I sign into to GWFL Service, to cut a long story short I had this problem before and GFWL provided me with a new Access Key to enable me to play the game properly.</p>

<p>Now a few months ago this same problem happend again ( I have a case reference number but not going to post it) things went back and forth a solution was to contact the game publisher (RockStar) This I did who said the issue was with GFWL and not them so
 I went back to GFWL who got this case going.&nbsp; And I submited all the information that they needed i.e Game Manual, Disk, Box, CD, And Keys.</p>
<p>And they prommised me they will get his sorted to get me a replacement Key, they kept updating me no news at present, so a few weeks went buy and I had a phone call of a woman (This was yesterday) to say they couldn't provide me with a key for what reason
 I don't know, I stood my ground but I think there was a language barrier problem and I hung up in disgust.</p>
<p>Is anyone here a representative here that can help me get my Key so I can play this game again I haven't played this for months?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Rob</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just bought a new Surface Pro 4 and did an update for the device. However, there is a persistent Thin white line that is always appear at 1/3 position from the bottom of the screen in landscape mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a hardware defect or is this a driver issue?</p>
<p>

<p>To determine with a high degree of assurance if this problem is a hardware issue perform a 2 button reset on your sp4 to enter the UEFI (bios) screen.&nbsp; Since the UEFI screen runs independent of the Windows OS if you observe the line there then the problem
 is most likely hardware and you should return your sp4 for a full refund or go to a Microsoft Retail store and have them give you a new sp4.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Warning!!! If you work thru the Microsoft online or phone helpdesk and they offer you an exchange you will end up with a refurbished unit not a new sp4.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform a 2 button reset shut down your sp4 and then press and hold the volume up and power button at the same time (about 15 seconds) until the Surface UEFI screen appears.&nbsp; If you see the line assume it's a hardware problem.</p>

    <title>Registry Cleanup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evenicoulddoit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Registry Cleanup</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I initially posted a question into the Windows Update forum, but delving a little deeper it became apparent that my problem was caused by a registry corruption and my question was left unanswered.<br />
<br />
A while back in attempting to check and correct my registry of any problems I downloaded a program, RegSeeker (from Softpedia), which edited permissions and has caused great problems since. (The program has been verified as non-malicious, but clearly it doesn't
 do it's job)<br />
<br />
The problems started with my inability to update Skype, then Windows Updates, and now Silverlight. I need a tool that'll help resolve these permission issues / corrupt keys.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0a162694-4d9d-4676-8283-1ba674374d71&amp;displaylang=en#filelist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Patch Registration Cleanup</a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0a162694-4d9d-4676-8283-1ba674374d71&amp;displaylang=en#filelist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Tool</a> simply shows "a productcode must be specified" and exits.<br />
The <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Reseter</a> is most likely insufficient for my problem, and either way doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Is there something that can genuinely help me? The issue is not one particular key but a range of them - even taking individual keys I am unable to use RegEdit to fix the problems. What can I do? Is a clean install really the only thing that'll fix this?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />
Ian<br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />

If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

            Check under the installed updates tab, it might already be installed for you and didn't crash your system. I started with a fresh install of Windows 7 pro 64bit on a VM and after doing all the updates including&nbsp;KB3177467 today it didn't crash for me this
 time. Could be related to additional software that was installed before so I'm going to dig through the system logs and see if there is anything there that would give me more info on what could have caused the crash in the first place. If I find anything useful
 I'll post it here.

            Thank you so much. This article saved my bacon. Had a laptop get this patch from our 3rd party patch management tool. On reboot it came up to a black screen with a white underscore cursor. Couldn't do anything with it. No F8 menu even. Booted up from a
 Win7 install USB drive, went into the Repair Windows section and picked up your instructions from step 6. Everything went smooth from there. I was so pleased when Windows boot normally. Microsoft really blew it with this patch.

<p>Necro'ing the thread. <br />
<strong>If Windows/Microsoft Update works okay without this patch, </strong><strong>STAY AWAY FROM IT.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On a Lenovo T420i, it seems like it's the culprit for sporadic network disconnections on GPU activity. It only happened when online video (Netflix, small video ads, etc) is present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went through installing Windows fresh, then installing JUST this patch, then network drivers, then firing up a browser instance (you name it, tried with all), go to Netflix... Boom. It happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a cmd window aside, with 'ping -t 8.8.8.8', while videos show up, the network disconnects briefly (wired/wifi), ping reports a 'General failure' 3 times, then it comes back online. This reset frequency ranges about 30~90 seconds per occurrence, killing
 SSH connections and any no-resume-capable downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next thing to try is ditching it into hidden, since it looks like it's the only available patch in a WU cycle (some design behavior they say), and carry on with the rest of the updates. I'll see how it goes, and report back.</p>

                    Why can't I edit my files&nbsp; on a RW-CD after I burn it onto my CD-RW?&nbsp; (that I copied from my microsoft word&nbsp;program) I made&nbsp;sure I'm putting it onto a RW-CD and not a&nbsp;"R" CD&nbsp;or a DVD, so I know that's not the problem.&nbsp; Do I need to take it out of my CD
 burner drive and put it on to my regular drive to make the changes?&nbsp; Or.... should'nt I be able to still make any changes after it's done burning and I hit finish?&nbsp;Even after I&nbsp;put it back in the CD burner drive it won't let me edit anything?

<p>It depends what recoding format has been used, by default writing to cd creates a read only media. You would need to use 'Packet writing'</p>
<p>Though IMO I would be wary of editing data recorded to CD. Better to copy data to your PC, make sure read only attribute for the copied file is turned off, then edit the file with eg Word&nbsp;</p>

<h3> bobwoolf, aka the olde greywoolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            ATT Cable box Cisco MN IPN4320 won&#39;t work with WMC &#38; MCE Kit - WMC IR sensor will not recognize&#47;&#34;learn&#34; ATT Remot codes.</h2>
                    <p>I just had to move and consequently had to change my ISP and cable TV provide, and reconfigure my system to match.&nbsp; I can't get it to work.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I am using my laptop to view and record TV.&nbsp; Don't have a real TV.&nbsp; I get the TV signal into my computer by the use of a USB TV tuner stick by Hauppauge, MN HVR950Q.&nbsp; I normally (with Comcast's equipment) use a MCE kit (IR sensor, IR blaster and Remote)
 with Windows Media Center to control the required TV cable provider's Set top box.&nbsp; That has always worked well in the past.&nbsp; Not this time!</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>To do the set up, I have to have the IR codes for the cable box's remote.&nbsp; Normally, I either select the make/model of my cable box from the list, OR manually set the codes by using the cable box's remote to SET/TEACH/LEARN the codes into the WMC/MCE Kit
 memory.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>This involves the&nbsp; WMC setup wizard asking you to press certain buttons (0,1,2 3, etc.) while hold the box remote up to the IR sensor so it can read them.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>In this case, my cable box manker is not listed (Cisco MN IPN4320) and the IR sensor, for reasons I can't fathom, will NOT recognize or "learn" the codes from the Cisco/ATT remote<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><strong>Anyone else have this issue?&nbsp; Anyone have a solution?&nbsp; Please share!</strong></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I can still watch TV using the WinTV7 app that came with the tuner stick (tuner is set to cable channel 3 and can't change)&nbsp;with the&nbsp;WMC in unprogrammed mode, but I can't control the cable box from the compouter which means I can't do scheduled TV recording
 which is my greatest need.&nbsp; I can only control the box manually with ATT remote and only do real time manual recordings.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>If you can help on this one, let me know.&nbsp; Logically the program SHOULD have no reaso to NOT be able to "learn" or "read" the ATT/Cisco remote, but there it is.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I am using my HP Envy17 3D laptop and the Hauppauge HVR950Q hybird TV tuner running under Windows 7 HP X64 with the ATT/Uverse TV cable service and internet ISP and their cable box, made by Cisco, MN IPN4320.</p>

            <p>Hi BobWoolf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you receive your TV signal through a set-top box and Media Center can't change channels, or it changes channels incorrectly, check the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The IR blaster is connected to your remote control receiver. If the IR blaster is not connected, Media Center can't send a signal to the set-top box to change a channel.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The IR blaster is positioned correctly on the front of the set-top box. If you're having trouble placing the IR blaster on the set-top box correctly, try using a flashlight to locate the signal receiver on
 the set-top box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The IR control codes are configured correctly. If channels consistently change incorrectly, the IR control codes might not have been configured correctly during TV signal setup. To reconfigure your TV signal,
 on the Windows Media Center start screen, scroll to Tasks, click Settings, click TV, and then click Set Up TV Signal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Center cannot send a signal to the set-top box to change a channel.</p>

            <b>Sorry, but I think you mis-read my post. &nbsp;NONE of that helps or applies to this issue.</b>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>I know how to set up WMC and how to use the MCE kit, sensor and blaster both. &nbsp;I have used the MCE kit and WMC together before for Comcast and their cable box without any problem.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>The issue here is the setting up of the WMC TV signal.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>The set top cable box that comes with the ATT/Uverse service is unlike any I have seen before and of a unusual maker that I am&nbsp;unfamiliar&nbsp;with (with respect to cable boxed only!) and, apparently, neither is WMC or Microsoft.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>When I try to set up the TV signal, that maker is NOT on the list of set top box makers in WMC set up list. &nbsp;Nor does WMC automatically detect it. &nbsp;Using manual set up also fails. &nbsp;In order to manually set up the WMC you have to hold the Uverse remote
 up to the sensor and push specific buttons (i.e. OK, 1, 2 ,3, 4, etc.) as directed for the WMC/sensor to "learn" the Uverse remote codes.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>This is where the FAIL happens! &nbsp;The WMC will respond to the buttons, but it will NOT learn or accept the Uverse codes. &nbsp;It senses that a button is being pressed, but it will never (so far) actually accept/learn that code and move on to the next button;
 &nbsp;I never get past pushing button"1"!! &nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>WMC says press button "1", I do. &nbsp;WNC says hold, and I do. &nbsp;WMC says release, and I do. &nbsp;WMC cycles b ack to button "1" and never accepts that c ode. &nbsp;I never get past "1"! &nbsp;See my problem?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>The Uverse cable box is made, apparently, by Cisco and the model number is IPN4320. &nbsp;Cisco is NOT on the WMC's list of box makers.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>BTW, the box is also a DVR and also connects to the modem-router wirelessly. &nbsp;Mine is hard wired, but the Cisco box is quite a bit more than just a cable channel switcher. &nbsp;If you have Uverse from ATT you know what I mean.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Thanks for the good try! &nbsp;All of that was good info, but I'm afraid my issue comes from another direction.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Please keep trying!</b></div>

            I switched to EPB, they have a cable set top box made by Cisco and I have exactly the same issue.&nbsp; Exactly as you describe I get the same responses from WMC and teh same issue with the learn function.&nbsp; It does not have Cisco listed and the learn function
 does not work with it's remote.&nbsp; Just like you I had no problem with Comcast set top boxes with the IR Sensor and remote.&nbsp; It is just the Cisco that appears to be either incompatible or Microsoft has not added for some reason.
<br />
<br />
Has anyone found a solution so we can use WMC IR to change channels on the Cisco set top Boxes?<br />

    <title>Vista won&#39;t boot&#59; safe mode hangs at crcdisk.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kwithers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista won&#39;t boot&#59; safe mode hangs at crcdisk.sys</h2>
                    
<p>I'm running Vista Home Premium on an HP Pavilion Slimline s3220n computer I've had for a little over a year and a half now.&nbsp; The other morning I sat down in front of my PC and saw a window asking if I wanted to restore the system.&nbsp; Since my computer had
 been operating just fine the night before, I closed the window.&nbsp; Now I can't get Windows to boot up at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried booting to C:, booting to an HP recovery disk that I created on my daughter's HP, booting to the HP System Recovery Disc that HP sent me, and booting to a Vista Recovery Disc that I downloaded from the Internet - nothing works.&nbsp; All I get are
 the moving green bars followed by a black screen.&nbsp; When I use F8 to bring up the Advanced Boot Options screen, neither Repair Your Computer nor Last Known Good Configuration work.&nbsp; The safe modes load a bunch of drivers and then stop at crcdisk.sys.</p>
<p>The few times I've been able to get a command prompt, the C: drive is shown as X:, and not all the files and folders are shown.&nbsp; I have been able to go in and rename some drivers, based on advice given on some other forums, but it hasn't helped.</p>
<p>On another forum, one person solved this problem by installing a new hard drive, loading Vista on it, and then accessing his files on the old hard drive through a USB connection, which requires a special adapter.&nbsp; I opened the case to my Pavilion Slimline
 and found the hard disk to be wedged under the DVD drive, with both drives being virtually impossible to remove because of the tight spaces and what looks to be a series of inaccessable interlocking brackets.</p>
<p>As I see it, I'm left with two options.&nbsp; Either I take my PC to a repair shop and have someone who knows what he's doing put in a new hard drive, and then access my files through a USB port, or buy a full installation of Vista and try to reinstall Vista
 over the version of Vista that's on there now.&nbsp; The only problem with the second option, other than the fact that I'm paying $170 for a Vista license that I already have, is that I'm afraid I may get the same results - moving green bars followed by a black
 screen.&nbsp; Or, it may boot up but fail to recognize the C: drive.&nbsp; Or, it may install but wipe out the data I have on the C: drive, which is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
I've not added any new hardware or software that could have caused this problem.</p>
<p>By what I've seen on other forums, others have had this problem with Vista running on Dells, Acers, Sonys, Toshibas, and HPs.&nbsp; I'm at the end of my wits on this - I've been struggling with it for over a week now.&nbsp; Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            You don't want to try and install Vista on a damaged hard drive where you want to retrieve data! Boot with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the hard drive mftr.'s website (or use
<a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/downloads/seatools/seatooldreg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Seagate's SeaTools For DOS</a> ) and test the drive thoroughly. If the test won't run or the test shows the drive failed any physical tests, your drive needs to be replaced. It is unlikely that you or a local tech can get data back from a hard drive that isn't
 physically viable using software methods. Attempting to do so will greatly increase the risk of irretrievably damaging the data. In the case or a physically damaged hard drive, you would need to send the drive to a professional data recovery company like
<a href="http://www.drivesavers.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Drive Savers</a> . This will run from $500-$3500.<br />
<br />
Others have had this problem (as you stated) because hard drives are mechanical devices and mechanical devices fail. This has nothing to do with Vista.<br />

<h2>            MS Surface Book - Surface Dock - Monitor Compatibility</h2>
                    <p>I bought the Surface Dock when the MS salesperson said it worked with 'most' monitors.&nbsp; What I've learned since is that the Surface Dock is actually incompatible with quite a lot of monitor models; only quite expensive monitors seem to be compatible ($400
 or &gt;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for alternate ways to achieve dual monitor display.&nbsp; Any ideas? Or is the Surface Dock the only way to achieve this?</p>

            It actually will work with most monitors. As an example, I have a Dell S2415H which is incompatible with the dock. However, if you use an active display port to HDMI cable, the screen works just fine. The speaker on the monitor do not work though. So you
 have to either listen thru the surface book speakers or get a pair of external speakers, which is what I have.

<p>I'm having the same issue.&nbsp; Surface Book 2 (the big one, i7, 16GB, 256, Performance Base), and just picked up a new Dock.&nbsp; I can't get my HP 27es monitors to work with the Dock, SB2 screen flickers and the system seems to be taxed, I can't do anything (inc
 pulling up Task Manager), the HP monitors flick on then say HDMI is inactive and turn off, then back on and off, etc etc etc.</p>
<p>When I connect the monitor directly to the SB2 via USB-C it works just fine.&nbsp; I've tried the MS Mini-DP to HDMI adaptor and a high quality HDMI, also tried a direct Mini-DP to HDMI, neither works. any thoughts??</p>

    <title>Desktop Restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghlnknjc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop Restart</h2>
                    <p>I have a Acer Aspire M3450-UR30P and I am running Windows 10 1703 with every cumulative update and every other update applied. My system runs great with one exception. I can restart from windows and it has no problems restarting and booting up to my windows.
 I can shut down and turn my computer back on and it boots up to windows without any problem. It offers me Windows 10 1709 all the time unless I block it and it updates everything great and reboots from windows update just fine and applies all updates (except
 1709 which I have blocked for the 14 time) and boots up to my normal windows 1703. When I unblock 1709 and let it download and install and the computer boots up only 1 time&nbsp; fine then the next time it tries to boot up my HD goes to sleep but everything is
 running. I was told that my power supply was bad so I put in a new and larger power supply and the computer acts exactly the same way. I was told that it was my HD so I changed that also and it acts exactly the same way. I have checked my ram (12GB) and I
 only have 90GB used out of a 500GB HD so I have plenty of space open. I have Malwarebytes Pro and Driver Support installed and everything else is Microsoft. My Acer Aspire E1-571-6680 notebook has exactly the same thing installed and I have 1709 blocked on
 it as well because 1709 downloads and installs and goes through the install process just fine but freezes my computer up after I click on one&nbsp; item and then just stops responding and I have to do a hard shut down and start up and it continues doing the same
 thing so I have to&nbsp; reinstall Windows from a backup to 1703. Both computers have and are set up with UEFI. Why does my desktop put my HD to sleep and my notebook stop responding after this crazy 1709 update. I have too many apps to do another install from
 scratch and install them and register them. What is wrong? I am 75 years old and on social security and don't have the extra money to buy two new computers. Thanks for all that can help. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, but every time there is a cumulative update I have to use it again but it works. I've had it on my computer for quite awhile. That isn't my problem it's 1709.&nbsp;</p>

 Microsoft tech support told me that my bios is too old. How did you get yours to upgrade to ver 1703?
</blockquote>
<p>The only way that it can be done is installing a new HDD set to GPT then downloading to a usb stick using the media creation tool and then doing a complete new install of the creators update 1703 or 1709. Like in my case for 1703 I had to start all over
 again configuring my computer from scratch and that includes reinstalling all of your programs, configuring windows like you had it before, and getting rid of all the Microsoft junk. After doing this with 1703 which took me about three weeks before I got everything
 done. Don't let Microsoft tell you there is something wrong with your bios because without changing anything on the computer except doing a new install (my computer came with windows 7) everyone of my programs work and everything on the computer works even
 with the windows 7 drivers that came with it. It was no problem upgrading to the first two versions of windows 10 when it was offered to me. Now every time they offer me 1709 through windows update my computer HDD goes to sleep on the third reboot and I have
 to hard reset it then it reverts back to the previous windows (1703 in my case). It messes up my computer so bad that I have to restore my windows from a backup. This has happened 17 times on my desktop and 5 times on my notebook.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Still Installing Hidden Updates.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do computer repair and have a customer that is having an issue with a Windows 10 update. &nbsp;The PC itself is a desktop that is a home built. &nbsp;I believe it was upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;The problem update is the Feature update to Windows 10,
 Version 1703. &nbsp;It had failed a time or two before I started working on it. &nbsp;The first thing I did was run system file checker and everything checked out fine. &nbsp;Then I ran the Windows Update troubleshooting tool and it repaired an item or two. &nbsp;I have also
 checked the computer out for adware and viruses. &nbsp;It is clean in that regard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We ran Windows update again so that this problem update would start to download and install. &nbsp;At that point I left the customer's house and let the install go through the process. &nbsp;They called me back and said that the updated failed. &nbsp;At this point I came
 to the conclusion that the update would not install on that machine. &nbsp;I went back over and used the show/hide tool to hide the update. &nbsp;A few days later the update showed up and tried to reinstall. &nbsp;It failed again. &nbsp;I went back over and hid the update again
 and a few days later it showed up and failed again. &nbsp;I have verified in the show/hide tool that this update is in fact hidden both times it came back and tried to reinstall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone out there know why the update keeps coming back even after I hid it? &nbsp;What can I do to stop this update from coming back? &nbsp;A Microsoft customer's computer cannot just sit there over and over and keep trying to reinstall an update that should
 be hidden. &nbsp;They do reach a point of frustration after a while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Could be an issue with the software distribution folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try the following to see if it fixes the problem then try using the hide update tool again.</p>

<p>** This is the one where you have to kill all four zombie types in one Dead Eye meter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having quite a time with this one. I have heard two good areas are El Presidio and then Jorge's Gap where there are dozens walking around.<br />
<br />
I never see a bolter in El Presidio and never see a Retcher in Jorge's Gap.<br />
<br />
I was thinking one strategy might be to go to Jorge's Gap, go into Dead Eye and use the Explosibe Rifle over and over until you got the right combination of kills -- but I am just not seeing any of those green Retchers.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>Use a weapon with as many shots as possible (mauser has 15 shots), and start dead eye with a full meter. &nbsp;I would recommend doing it during one of the "town under attack" scenarios or during a graveyard cleansing as those very regularly spawn a full variety.
 &nbsp;If you can run around without shooting for a bit you can get a nice little zombie parade going. Rather than trying to pick out one of each type in deadeye, I just drilled as many as I could in the head with one clip until I got it. &nbsp; Like a lot of my RDR
 achievements, I set up a save point before starting so I could re-load and try again right away if I didn't get it. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<p>Yep.&nbsp; I used the bait Landon Rickkets showed to kill them, then the 4 types spawn real good for shooting.</p>

<p>I earned my achievement in El Presidio with the evens rifle. &nbsp;I used deadeye on more than four targets. Plus the cannon is a great way to get deadeye back up if you do not get it right.</p>

<p>North Gate El Presido, climb the hill to the right, throw down bait let them all huddle round, fire up the dead eye and blaze &nbsp;away. Try to get as many hits as possible on as many Zombies as possible so then nothing is left to chance. Also to make doubly
 sure put Phospherous coating on your bullet So if you miss the instant kill head shot they still die.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 blank start menu display bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pstechfrench  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 blank start menu display bug</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a never ending issue with windows 10 - even after a complete format reinstall (so advising this will not help).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu and window preview (context menu on right clicking a task icon) is diplaying some visual bug where nothing is shown except icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this issue repetively and ignored it as the only remedy i found is a restart. But alas, this is only a temporary fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is running the latest DirectX and Nvidia driver / software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can help me, that would be most appreciated. I've looked and cannot find any solutions rather than a complete re-install which I have eliminated.</p>
<p>
