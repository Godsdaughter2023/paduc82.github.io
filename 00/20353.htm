<br />
There is no need to have two cells.&nbsp; If you reference Range("C2") in VBA, you can use it either as a number or as a date.<br />
<br />
First, it is unclear what the format of C2 is.&nbsp; By default, =DATEVALUE(B2) is formatted as General if the cell was originally General.&nbsp; And in that case, C2 would display "just the number result" (39330) already.<br />
<br />
In that case, Range("C2").Value is type Double.&nbsp; If you want to use it as type Date, you can use CDate(Range("C2")).<br />
<br />
However, from the context of your question, it appears that you might set the format of C2 to Date.<br />
<br />
In that case, Range("C2").Value is type Date, and Range("C2").Value2 is type Double.<br />
<br />
But you can always use CDbl(Range("C2")) [or Range("C2").Value2] and CDate(Range("C2")) to ensure that Range("C2") is used as the intended type regardless of the Excel cell type.<br />
<br />
 &amp; "" [2 double quotes, indicating the null string].<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; It is also unclear why you are using =DATEVALUE(B2) in the first place.&nbsp; There are circumstances where it might be useful; for example, if column B contains a mix of text and numeric types.&nbsp; But in that case, you might consider using the Text To Column
 feature to convert everything to numeric dates, if that is reasonable to do.&nbsp; (Sometimes it is not; for example, when column B is imported from an outside source, and you do not want the extra manual step.)<br />

            <p>Thank you both!&nbsp; I actually had been trying that, but the date format persisted.&nbsp; This spreadsheet came from outside our firm.</p>
<p>If &nbsp;I just type in a date, then reformat as a number, the contents do show the serial number.&nbsp; But the dates of the other cells will not change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also have tried copying the spreadsheet, then pasting into a brand new spreadsheet, but still the problem persists.</p>
<p>Perhaps I need to save the workbook out as an XML, then bring back in?&nbsp; I don't know the way around this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or maybe I will turn it into a PDF, then OCR the PDF back as an Excel document.</p>
<p>Thank you again for responding.</p>

<br />
If that "imported" date is in B2, does the formula =ISTEXT(B2) return TRUE?<br />
<br />
I presume it does.&nbsp; But in that case, your formula =DATEVALUE(B2) in C2 should be sufficient to convert the "text date" to a numeric date.&nbsp; And the formula in D2 should be unnecessary.<br />
<br />
And again, in that case, you could use the Text To Column feature to correct column B, and dispense with the formulas in columns C and D.<br />
<br />
If none of that works, I suspect that the "dates" in column contain extraneous characters, notably non-breaking spaces (HTML &amp;nbsp).&nbsp; In that case, the following should work in column C:<br />
<br />
=DATEVALUE(TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(B2,CHAR(160),"")))<br />
<br />
formatted as Date, General or Number as you wish.<br />
<br />
And you might want to copy column C and paste-special-value into column B, then delete column C.<br />
<br />
In either case, the VBA work-arounds that I suggested should obviate the need for column D.<br />
<br />

<br />
That will simply replicate whatever problem you might have with the contents of column B.<br />
<br />

<br />
That would correct the problem in column B, if my speculation is correct.&nbsp; But that seems extreme.<br />
<br />
If you are unable to resolve the problem based on suggestions here, it would be ideal if you can upload an example Excel file (devoid of any private data) that demonstrates the problem to a file-sharing website and post the "shared", "public" or "view-only"
 link (aka URL; http://...) in a response here.&nbsp; The following is a list of some free file-sharing websites; or use your own.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that the reason for this is incopatible date formats.&nbsp; Looks like your Windows OS has dd/mm/yyyy as its default format and the file you got is in mm/dd/yyyy or vice versa.&nbsp; To quickly cross check whether my assumption is right or not, try to change
 some dates (which are not converting to numbers) to dates where dd and mm are flipped.&nbsp; So if in the file which you received, the date is 6/15/2012, retype to 15/6/2012.&nbsp; Now see if the number format show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be best if you can share the file.</p>

<h2>            Still having a problem with Exchange Server</h2>
                    I have updated to 2.2009.51-1.002. I can access my exchange server over a web browser, so data connection is working, and I have the right details. I do get a message about invalid certificates on Firefox. On the N900 I get the message "either exchange
 requires secure connection or account is disabled".&nbsp;

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have the same problem. Could it be so that IT has desabled the usage of the Exchange server for&nbsp;phones other than S60... or something like that? Maybe this Linux causes problems?</p>
<p>I use several Nokia phones (S60) and I only have this problem with n900. I have allready installed the latest firmware. I also&nbsp;installed the certificate... but nothing.&nbsp;Same message&nbsp;that you've got.</p>
<p>Hope to&nbsp;see some really good&nbsp;replies ;o)&nbsp;</p>

            I had it in my computer (got it from other phone)&nbsp;and I sent it to the phone via bluetooth. N900 asked to save it and I used the default location. Only thing I had to choose was&nbsp;the usege of the certficate (for email).

<p>With the phone n PCSuite mode, I've tried the cert in N900\Documents and N900\Data with no success. Though the default location for certificates is some other location on the phone; Settings/Connectivity/Cerftificate manager lists a series of certs, though
 not my MfE one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just thinking, if I browsed to my MfE would any certificate, or exception, be available for the MfE app?</p>

<p>Made some progress here;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I exported a cert using IE8; browse to outlook/web access in IE, click and take the option to view cert, then export to a .p7b format.</p>
<p>(I got the method from&nbsp;<a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=35136&amp;page=27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=35136&amp;page=27</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I copied the cert using PCSuite (storage or email would probably work also)&nbsp;</p>
<p>- In file manager I clicked on the cert and confirmed that I wanted to install it.</p>
<p>- that got me through to the Account setup: First synchronisation step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My N900 began the first synch and then produced an "Error in communication with Exchange server" message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would this be something to do with the "non-provisionable" issue?&nbsp;."&gt;http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?p=431938&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Hi again!</p>
<p>I noticed other Topic: <span>[adding a certificate to my N900] and followed the instructions with installing the certificate. Last time when prompted the question about the usage I chose only email. Now I chose server also.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally it works... first synchronisation and all.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope you get yours to work also. It's always that little thing that you can't identify on your own.</span></p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Mac Does Not Complete Excel File Sync</h2>
                    <p>I do not know if this is an Excel problem or a OneDrive problem but lately (the past 30 days) the OneDrive app for Mac has problems syncing Excel files. After saving an Excel file, the OneDrive app does not finish syncing. It says "Processing changes..."
 but never completes it. The only way to complete the sync is to quit Excel. At that point OneDrive completes the sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens with Excel. Other Office apps sync fine as does all other non-Office apps. So I'm thinking this is an issue between Excel and OneDrive only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this issue on both my iMac (macOS 10.13.3) and MacBook (currently macOS 10.13.4 b1).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Shing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that we also experience this behavior. To let the related team know regarding this, we suggest using the
<strong>Report a problem</strong> button on the OneDrive app, as well as through our
<a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive?category_id=86086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive UserVoice</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, we suggest when saving to the OneDrive sync folder, you first close Excel to make sure it is syncing to the cloud. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<h2>            Hacked by Scam Alarm in Edge - syskey activated - now what&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>hacked and need to know what to do. syskey seems to be set.</p>
<p>bought new dell computer and then upgraded it from windows 7 to 10</p>
<p>did not install any antivirus on it at this time.</p>
<p>then somehow on the edge browser they had a screen come up with the computer making some sounds (annoying) and it said they had a virus and a number to call.</p>
<p>wife called the number and was on the phone for a long time but she said she did not do anything to the computer. they kept saying they could fix it but was not saying how much, but kept stalling her to give an answer. &nbsp;eventually was being told all kinds
 of costs to fix it so hung up.</p>
<p>installed norton antivirus.</p>
<p>after a week, ran with malwarebytes anti-malware and it found nothing.&nbsp; then i went to setting and turned off remote access.&nbsp; then i had the network connection stop (they are on at&amp;t service), so i then rebooted.</p>
<p>now is where i got a startup password but they said they never saw that, so it seems a hacker has used the syskey.</p>
<p>what should i do. i am in north suburbs of chicago and no one can remote in to fix it, as i cannot get past syskey. &nbsp;there is two restore points, but the first worked but still had syskey password screen. &nbsp;failed going to the oldest one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>if i reinstall windows 7 will i keep all data files but eliminate need to know syskey password. &nbsp;</p>

                    Hi there
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I received an email form a friend that required my password to open (it looked exactly like the Hotmail/outlook log in page- but wasn't), foolishly I opened it. My account was then blocked for a week at my request. I have changed my password but my email
 keeps sending out emails to all my contacts. It deleted most of my contacts but this hasn't helped. The mails it sends and self deletes are all different, weight loss, dating and evens poetry.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have reported this to Microsoft. I don't have a PC and usually use an ipad and iPhone-all suggestions on what to do would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Jayme,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote automatically saves your notes while you work, but its recommended to always back up your notebooks, just like the rest of your computer’s files and data. To isolate your concern In OneNote 2016, we'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you signed in to your Microsoft account when using OneNote 2016?</li><li>Have you checked OneDrive for the missing files?</li></ul>

</p><p><span><span>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</span></span></p>

            Hi Joan,<br />
<br />
Thank you for getting back to me!<br />
<br />
To answer your questions:<br />
<br />
1. I am not sure if I was logged into Microsoft.&nbsp; I always worked in<br />
OneNote off of the link from my start menu.&nbsp; I believe I was connected<br />
because I used it regularly and it always saved all information without<br />
difficulty.<br />
<br />
2. I did check OneDrive and, unfortunately, I still cannot find the missing<br />
sections and pages.<br />
<br />
Does OneNote automatically sync with OneDrive when the computer is<br />
connected to the internet?&nbsp; I am wondering if I needed to sync after each<br />
time I used OneNote?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!

<p>There are two different versions of OneNote. The free version of OneNote that comes with Windows 10 automatically creates new notebooks in your OneDrive account, and automatically syncs existing notebooks with your OneDrive account by default. With the desktop
 version of OneNote 2016 that comes with Office 365, you need to sync OneNote 2016. To further isolate your concern, we'd like to ask you the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you checked <strong><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive online</a></strong> if the files are in there?</li><li>Were you able to sign in <strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote online</a></strong> to check your files?</li></ul>
<p>We also suggest that you open the OneNote 2016 desktop version and look if you can restore your notes from a backup. To do this, click
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Info </strong>&gt; <strong>Open Backups</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38ec79f2-93d0-4ae5-8bb8-3ebd237f27d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38ec79f2-93d0-4ae5-8bb8-3ebd237f27d0" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me!&nbsp; I tried your suggestions and I am still unable to recover my missing sections and pages.&nbsp; I believe I was using OneNote 2016 and, per your message, I needed to sync that version; which I did not do recently.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Carolyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As John mentioned, if you want to use the Insert Icons feature mentioned in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/insert-icons-in-microsoft-office-e2459f17-3996-4795-996e-b9a13486fa79?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>, you should be Office 365 subscriber and use the 16.14 version of Office for Mac. The version number 16.14 is insider fast version of Office 2016 for Mac. If you want to update to this version, open
<strong>PowerPoint</strong>&gt;click <strong>Help</strong> on the top bar&gt;<strong>Check for updates</strong>&gt;tick the check box of
<strong>Join the Office Insider program to get early access to new releases</strong>&gt;click
<strong>Accept</strong> for the pop-up&gt;select <strong>Office Insider Fast</strong>&gt;click<strong> Check for Updates</strong>.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ea9f4f3-4bcd-4d6e-8886-214a39345ca5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ea9f4f3-4bcd-4d6e-8886-214a39345ca5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Normally, we suggest users to use the production version of Office for Mac (currently it's 16.12 for Office 365 or retail). It's more stable than inside version. You could wait for the Insert Icons feature be released to production
 version. If you really want to test this feature now, you may choose to update to the insider fast version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>@John, thanks for your useful sharing. We appreciate your effort in our forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint &#40;Office 365&#41; unable to save file after storing on OneDrive, Box, or Dropbox</h2>
                    <p>I am running Office 365 on Win7Pro. Consistently when you go to save a file, you get an error that PPT was unable to save the file. Here are various scenarios that I have played with and am getting continual errors.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create new PPT file. Save to either OneDrive, Box, or DropBox.
<ol>
<li>Open later, go to save again. Error pops up that it cant be saved.</li><li>So I then save locally to desktop.</li><li>When opening the file see attachment, get an error where all images in the file are missing:
<ol>
<li>"The image part with relationship ID rId2 was not found in the file."</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li><li>I have then copied the file as a "new file" and just put it on the desktop. Open it, go to save it. Still told I am unable to save.</li><li>I have created a new PPT file saved in compatibility mode 97-2003.
<ol>
<li>It sometimes works, but have still seen it break. Even when saving locally and avoiding cloud backup.</li><li>This has been my best solution as a work around where it breaks the least, although its still not very good solution.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>These are pretty serious issues with PPT. I am sure others are experiencing this. Any thoughts on a fix?</p>

            Outlook should be able to import the file (File - Open &amp; Export - Import/Export - Import from another program or file - Outlook Data FIle (-pst).
<br />
<br />I also like an external tool called Mailstore Home (<a href="https://www.mailstore.com/en/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mailstore.com/en/products/</a>) which lets you inspect the PST file first and export selected messages or complete folders to Outlook.

            If he was using a POP account, there would have been no need to archive his data; you could have just copied his original PST. IN fact, archive is not a good tool if you want to save the contents of one Outlook instance to use in another. For IMAP or Exchange, I would have suggested opening a new data file, then simply copying the folders to that data file, then closing Outlook and copying that data file to the new Outlook instance.
<br />
<br />In Outlook, click File&gt;Open &amp; Export&gt;Open Outlook Data File. Browse to the PST, select it, and click OK. A new set of folders will be added to the Navigation Pane that are the contents of the data file you transferred.

<h2>            In Outlook, Is there a way to change the sorting default order for newly created Personal Folders without manually changing each one&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Outlook 2007 on my laptop which is running Windows 7 Home Edition.&nbsp; Whenever I create a new subfolder within&nbsp;my Personal Folder, it automatically defaults the sorting order for the emails to be stored there by size.&nbsp; I'm not sure why people
 would want to store by size, I don't.&nbsp; I want to store the emails by date.&nbsp; In order to&nbsp;make the change I have to go into each new folder and change it.&nbsp; There should be a way to tell Outlook that I want all new folders that I create to store by date.&nbsp; If
 there is a way, I can't find it by searching help or the Internet.&nbsp; Is there a way and if so, how can I do it?&nbsp; Thanks.

</p><p>Outlook is showing the time of emails I receive in GMT, but BST isn't given as an option in the account settings dropdown after I've selected my location as England - it simply lists London GMT. My computer is correctly displaying the time in BST. Any ideas
 on how I can change it because it's annoying not being able to see the correct time that emails have been received in my inbox.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

<p>sometimes this happens with me also I live in Panchkula and maps and local websites give me location of city 300kms away this happens because my WI FI location is of that city but when I connect with mobile network it gives me exact location but I can understand
 why bing is opening UK based websites you may have last opened a UK based site</p>

<h3> panic-button  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Outlook 2016 Drafts folder is now syncing.</h2>
                    <p>I’m running Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus (Office 2016?) that I get through the school district I work for.&nbsp; I have it loaded on several computers and haven’t had any real issues with it.&nbsp; As of today, it’s full updated and the version of Outlook is displayed
 as v16.0.6741.2071.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since I’ve installed it, the Drafts folder in Outlook has always displayed This Computer Only next to it.&nbsp; It would never sync with my online Outlook.com account (Hotmail) and everything I read was the Drafts folder did not sync.&nbsp; I did a quick search
 for a work around, but never did find one, so I just forgot about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day two of my computers would not open Outlook, it would just crash when started, Outlook crashing, not the computer, which is Windows 7 Pro x64.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I moved the data file and got Outlook to open by creating a new profile.&nbsp; For reasons I can’t really explain here, I had a difficult time creating it the way I wanted, so it took me several attempts to get back the way I had it before the crashing
 issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I finally got all the old profile deleted and re-created a new profile, I noticed the Drafts folder did not display the This Computer Only next to it.&nbsp; I started a new message, saved it, it ended up in the Drafts folder and it also ended up in the Drafts
 folder at Outlook.com online, never did that before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did the same process on the other computer and once the old profile was fully deleted and I re-created a new profile, that Drafts folder was syncing too.&nbsp; I have one more computer at work to do, so I’m hoping it will do the same as the two at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea why it took deleting the profile and re-creating it to make this happen?&nbsp; I’m not finding any information about this online, so I thought I would post what happen to me in case others are interested in trying this to see what happens.
 &nbsp;It's my understanding the Drafts folder doesn't sync and it never did for me and I haven't read anything that says that it's doing this now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RG</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you are having concern syncing Draft folder on your Outlook email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are possible reason why draft folder is not syncing on your previous email profile. It is either your old user profile account is corrupted or the server settings on it is not syncing properly. And by recreating a new profile fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint - Lock master slides so none can be pasted in</h2>
                    <p>I have a questions about master slides in Powerpoint 2013.<br />
I have updated a powerpoint with an array of master slides and want to send these to a number of people to use.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, I know that they have previous versions of these templates and through past experience found that when they copy a slide over from a separate presentation to my new one, it will also bring the master slide with it and add it to my array of master slides.
 How do I stop this from happening?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of locking the master slides?</p>

<h2>            &#33; NEW CHARGER&#39;S NOT USER&#47;ENVIROMENT FRIENDLY &#33;</h2>
                    I find it disgusting after being a Nokia devotee for 6 years now that they have updated their chargers by one mm(!!!!) to increase profiteering and help further damage the environment by making old chargers obsolete.<br />
<br />
What is most disturbing about this is that decreasing the pin size has no practicality what so ever, it doesn't make it charge any faster and doesn't make it's rear end look any nicer. It's just another example of how corporations only pretend to care about
 the environment (like Nokia signing up with WWF) and it's customers, when it only really cares about one thing: increasing its profits.<br />
<br />
I'm disgusted, aren't you? I recommend a Nokia boycott.<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
<br />
XnokiaUser.

            The chargers were changed to 2mm in 2004!<br />
<br />
Adaptors were given out with the first 2mm charger phones (N70 if I remember rightly)and are still available on the nokia web site...

If Noki really cares, they should make this the standard charger that comes right out of the box.

            The pin size was also reduced to be able to make the phones smaller. my 5310 would not be able to use the larger one without it being thicker.<br />
<br />
You can always buy an adapter...<br />
<br />
on the environment... what is your point? since I and my wife have been using Nokias for the past 8 years they have changed charger size once. what is so unfriendly about that specially if people change phones at a 2 year rate? (at least in GER)<br />

Thank you for posting here.<br />
<br />
I understand that you are not able to receive your email messages. <br />
<br />
It is possible that this is an account settings issue. Please refer <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/cannot-receive-emails/912d9db5-ec4a-431e-90ff-34622544cdca?tab=AllReplies">
here</a> on how to check your settings so you can get your important email messages.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, try to send a test email to the affected email account and let us know if you will be able to receive it.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

            No! It is not my settings. Nothing changed except now I can not receive email. I can send only. On Aug 3rd, Web Outlook did receive email but this was only 1 time. Since that one time, they have again stopped. I am quite knowledgeable about all aspects
 of computers and I have tried everything an advanced user such as myself could try.<b> I feel it is some sort of server issue that is yet undiscovered.</b> My sister, on a completely different account at a different location is also having the same issue and
 therefor I know it has nothing to do with any setting on our end. I have had to resort to going into my att.net account to get my email and she is going to her yahoo.com email to get hers. We both have sent test email from Web Outlook and we do not receive
 them in Web Outlook. We do however receive the test email from Web Outlook in our respective att and yahoo email account. &nbsp;Our incoming settings are exactly as what att and yahoo states they should be. Since we
<b>both </b>stopped receiving email on July 28th and then received some on Aug 3rd we have 2 confirmations that it is not anything to do with any settings we have any control over. Can someone please escalate this to a more technical area for assistance? Thank
 you...

            I am having the same issue with my att.net emails that were working fine until a few days ago. &nbsp;My settings in outlook.com did not change and I have checked them multiple times.
<div><br />
<div>I tried setting up a gmail account, using the same settings, and was able to download the emails from att.net, so I really think there is a server issue between outlook.com and att/yahoo.</div>

            Yes, I'm beginning to wonder if ATT made some change? Even though my sister has her Yahoo account set up, it is still via ATT Uverse as our internet provider. Do you have Uverse? Strangely enough, even thought I use ATT.net as my fallback email, it is
 still Yahoo powered so I'm not sure if the problem is persisting with ATT or Yahoo?

            I have an att.net that I kept as an email only when ATT changed to Uverse and dropped Colorado from their service area. &nbsp;I do pay for what would technically be a dial-up, and started accessing from windows live after ATT dropped the ability to link accounts
 into their webmail when yahoo took it over.
<div><br />
<div>All of my att.net email accounts are blocked from outlook.com receiving the emails. &nbsp;They worked for a while as att/yahoo/outlook webmail, but about the time outlook.com changed the policy to let me link multiple live.com IDs, the email problems started.
 &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think someone at yahoo or Microsoft has changed a server setting to block Microsoft from receiving the att.net emails from yahoo.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I understand you are unable to receive emails from ATT/Yahoo on Outlook.com.&nbsp; Let me assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine the main cause of your issue, please reply with the answers to the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Is&nbsp;the&nbsp;ATT Yahoo account&nbsp;registered in Microsoft as&nbsp;EASI (Email as Sign In) account because you mentioned that this issue started after discontinuing the linked account feature?&nbsp; The Inbox for EASI accounts have limited receiving capability.&nbsp; You&nbsp;would
 have to sign in on the third party email account to receive all&nbsp;emails.&nbsp; As a workaround, you would need to set up&nbsp;the ATT Yahoo account as send and receive by following the instructions on the link below:

Set up your Gmail, Yahoo! Plus, or Microsoft email accounts in Outlook.com</a></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Is the Yahoo account previously linked in your Microsoft account or did you&nbsp;set up the Yahoo account&nbsp;to send and receive&nbsp;in Microsoft account?&nbsp; Try to remove and re-add the send and receive account and check if this will resolve the issue.&nbsp; Please check
 the article above for instructions. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;If your ATT Yahoo account is already a send and receive account, have you been getting a bounce error message?&nbsp; Please reply with the bounce error message on the Private Message area so we can investigate.

            Leah V. I don't have much of an idea as to what you are talking about. It has worked well for well over a year, but since July 28th it does not. It worked briefly, 2-times on August 3 and has again stopped working. I can not be any more clear than that.
 As stated, there were no setting changes made to the email which would have stopped it from working, it just has. I may try your suggestions later today.

<div>As Cat Guy and I have been telling you, we didn't change anything, and we had working outlook up until last week. &nbsp;Something has happened at the server level that has caused outlook.com servers to not talk to the ATT.net server, and you may need to escalate
 this to someone that can look into the bowels of the service.</div>

<div>I've had my ATT.net email service since 1997 when it started as worldnet, and have kept it over the years. &nbsp;I do have a paid account. &nbsp;Originally, ATT had a webmail client that worked very much like the MS Livemail where you could set up the account to
 monitor and view multiple email addresses from a single web page. &nbsp;When Yahoo took over the att email service they disabled the ability of their webmail to show multiple accounts, and went with a sign-in to see a single account, and you could only look at
 one email address at a time. &nbsp;When that happened, I set up my livemail account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've been using the livemail.com account and service since 2010, and had other accounts set up and working at the time of the q.com nightmare. &nbsp;I originally had 2 identities linked together in Windows Live so I could switch between them as well as having
 multiple email addresses pulling into my primary Live folders. &nbsp;Everything was working well until Live changed to outlook.com and the changes were made to disable linking multiple live accounts. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have not tried deleting the links for the 2 ATT accounts because I don't want to risk losing all of the mail that has been sorted into subfolders for each account. &nbsp;I will go back and answer the more sensitive account information in the private email
 area. &nbsp;I have successfully sent emails from the outlook account to the ATT email accounts as well as a yahoo free account, and all were received by the ISP's, but the 2 ATT accounts did not receive them on outlook.com.<br />

            As I understand it is billed monthly on the day you sign up for it and you are paying for it in advance (MS can't lose).&nbsp;&nbsp; ie if you cancel, your service will end on the next billing date.<br />

<h2>            Creating Applications To Windows Mobile Phones Using String Values</h2>
                    I Was Wondering If Microsoft Or Another Company Has Created Windows Mobile Phone Applications Using 32 or 64 Bit String Values And Encrypting The Application. Also, If Anyone Has The Link For A Phone Number Or Chat Link To Microsoft Developers I Would
 Gladly Apreciate That. ThankYou.{&lt;&gt;}

            Hello. You may have to do some troubleshooting to find out if it is a hardware or software&nbsp;problem. You say that you "can't turn my WIFI on". Does that mean when you activate the WIFI radio on the device, it does not stay on? Or are you saying that no
 available WIFI networks exist to connect to? I would go to a local hotspot and see if it will detect that WIFI network. If it works with the hotspot and not others, i would delete off the connection and remake it. If it doesn't work anywhere, it most likely
 is a hardware problem or you might try a hard reset to bring it back to factory conditions if it is software problem. Oh, and if you have access to the router (e.g. a home network), you could try a power cycle and reset it.
