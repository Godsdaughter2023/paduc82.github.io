<h2>            After running Disc cleanup on Widows Vista, it says that I have 33.1 G. B. temporary files. Is it possible it can be that large&#63; Is it safe to remove all that material&#63;</h2>
                    Is this possible to have such a huge load of temporary files?

            Perfectly possible, may depend on various settings, eg Internet Options, your IE temp files settings.<br />
Remove them - under safely remove that is<br />

<h2>            New lap-top, Windows 10, cannot receive any call &#40;only notification&#41;</h2>
                    Just bought a fresh new lap-top with Windows 10. Skype for Windows 10 was already installed and I re-installed it because I cannot receive a call from, for example, a mobile phone (by the way, call
<em>from</em> Skype to a mobile phone is possible). Still the same problem after re-installation; if I call my Skype number with another phone, there is no incoming call on my lap-top. I only get a message that I missed a call. Also switched off VPN, still
 the same problem. What can I do?

<p>I read something somewhere that showed examples of how to use the desktop.ini file to also set the font size and color under the icons, as well as the icon size, and the background image to be displayed as a wallpaper in the explorer window within that particular
 folder. Again I'm also under the impression this is obsolute now in Windows Vista and 7 with the development of BAGS, which automatically senses content type and adjusts the desktop.ini file on it's own. There needs to be a more standardized way to turn this
 off too,&nbsp; as those of us that don't use can find it very obtrusive. I only know of a few ways right now that are complicated and involved several registry modifications, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Well that's just ridiculous.&nbsp; I seriously doubt it could do anything like crippling the system.&nbsp; The files are ONLY used by Explorer, and ONLY when they are local.&nbsp; Nothing with that level of limitation could cripple the system, and if that were the case, MS
 would heavily document it to make sure that people DIDN'T cripple their system.<br />
<br />
I think the real reason is that in the Immersive Shell, they're not used.&nbsp; Microsoft has been deprecating more and more information relating to the Desktop in favour of the restrictive Immersive Shell.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Immersive Shell truncates both text
 and icon size, with no way of ever viewing the full text of a long filename, making it worse than DOS.&nbsp; BTW, the Immersive Skydrive app in Windows 8.1 is called "FileManager.exe".&nbsp; So...<br />
<br />
Trial and error will tell you what you need to know about desktop.ini.&nbsp; Just look at all the different versions squirted out indiscriminately across the filesystem and glean the info from them.&nbsp; I edit mine all the time for folders that are MY "system" folders.<br />

                    I just decided to wipe my laptop because it was filled up with too many unwanted programs. I used a Windows 7 Home Premium 64x install disc, and now i can't connect to the internet. It says that there are no Network Adapter Drivers detected. I've searched
 for hours and i can't find anything that helps which doesn't need an internet connection. Really frustrating, any ideas?<br />

            Hi Robert , this is a known bug in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            This is one of the known issues with the update as Recovery partition should be hidden and is accidentally assigned a drive letter. 
<br />Right-click Start&gt;Command Prompt(admin) 
<br />Type in the following: 
<br />diskpart 
<br />list volume 
<br />select volume 3 
<br />Replace 3 with the number of the volume which is assigned a drive letter. (In hundreds of MBs) 
<br />remove letter="G" 
<br />Replace G with the Recovery drive letter. 
<br />
<br />Don't worry, removing a drive letter would not cause any harm to your device.

<p>Not clear from this whether just removing seeing disk e or actually solving the problem of it being nearly full.&nbsp; Message coming up every few minutes. Do I need to do anything about it.&nbsp; If I do and the instructions above are telling me what to do, I don';t
 understand the reference to volume</p>
<p>Could deleting early restore points help although not sure whether I have them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have uninstalled some programs that I know about but for 85% of them I have no idea what they are for.. various microsoft ones that come with the system or its updates.</p>

            OK, so now we learn that this is Office Outlook?   What exactly are you trying to Send if not an email?  Folders?  Please clarify.  
<br />
<br />Try repairing Outlook at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Modify &gt; Repair.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Brandon from NZ here,</p>
<p>ive had a pro 4 since launch and was wanted to get a Bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboard connected to the surface at the same time. is it possible ?
<br />
I was thinking the Microsoft comfort BT mouse,<br />
and maybe a 3rd party BT gaming Keyboard ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or will only one work at a time ?</p>
<p>(I really don't want to loose an usb port)</p>

</p><p>That's a good question.&nbsp; I'm not aware of anyone&nbsp;reporting limits of Bluetooth devices&nbsp;while using their Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; I know that mouse and keyboard combinations as well as&nbsp;other devices&nbsp;have worked with no problem.&nbsp; I'm sure it would depend on the type

    <title>Not sure what to do and scared to death&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melodyspencer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not sure what to do and scared to death&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Excuse my lack of OS knowledge, but I am just a 62 year old newbie who decided to start her own at home business designing digital art for a future website of my own. Didn't realize what I was&nbsp;getting into as I had to start learning more about hardware/software/photoshop/Wacom
 all around the same time. I think my head is going to explode, but now even more so since I upgraded(?) to Windows 10 from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is like several others I've read on this site.....File Access Denied &amp; Administrator Permission needed.....</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong> On my windows 7, I had only one user &amp; one administrator....me.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; When I upgraded to Win 10, I was asked if I wanted to have a Microsoft Account that would (I guess)&nbsp;group things together &amp; allow&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;easier access&nbsp;in my Microsoft world.</p>
<p>I went for it, and <strong>it</strong> placed everything under my Hotmail account &amp; password.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;Later I went into one of <strong>my text folders to retype a document
</strong>and upon hitting save&nbsp;got the message:&nbsp; "You don't have permission to save in this location....contact the administrator for permission." It also asked if I would like to save it in Documents. So thought I give that a try, but soon found that no matter
 where I tried to save it, it was denied. So needless to say,<strong> I could not complete my work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp; In my Picture folders and files, <strong>I can </strong>open a image that was taken with my digital camera, &amp; in the details panel, I can add data such as tag, title and so on and save it with no sassy message coming back at me.&nbsp;
<strong>But</strong> when I open a design I created<strong> in Photoshop</strong>, &amp; make changes &amp; then
<strong>hit save, I get the message </strong>"You don't have permission to save in this location (or any location I've tried) contact admin. for permission."<strong> And so I could not save my design.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now this part is probably of no importance, but again, I'm not proficient enough with&nbsp;computers/software to know if its of importance, but when I&nbsp;go to save&nbsp;something, there is the file name &amp; save as boxes; if I hit the down arrow next to my files name
 it shows the c <strong>drive/users/and the name I used&nbsp;when using windows 7</strong> &amp; before switching to a Microsoft account&nbsp;for windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last several days I've searched everywhere for help. Went on the Microsoft chat line, and after waiting 15 min., was disconnected after asking the person my question. I then requested a return call,&nbsp; and they did call me in about 30 min. I was told
 that my problem sounded like it was a Photoshop problem and I needed to call them. I explained I also had this problem with my text files (those written in Word Pad), which I use in Windows &amp; not PS, but he wouldn't listen. I just gave up. I did come across
 an article that showed how to take control of your own files &amp; folders, but at the end of the article it stated one should be&nbsp;experienced at this....enough to scare me off from trying. I found this site, but the majority of it is over my head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone give me some advice as to what I should do next? Could the problem have started when I switched to a Microsoft account instead of using my original one in Windows 7? I'm getting worried because I can't work on my designs for a business that I
 would like to start up in September. I also had to just buy an upgraded monitor and printer for this business, but now I'm worried about hooking them up, until this other mess is corrected.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of<strong> uninstalling my Windows 10 </strong>(well not me, but somebody) &amp; reinstalling my windows 7 even though there are several new features I like on the newer version.
</p>
<p>One last dumb question...Is there more than one place to check in my system as to who and how many is dubbed the administrator assistant for Windows 10? I keep wondering where my Windows 7 administrator data went to.....just floating out there somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely would appreciate any advice &amp;/or suggestions anyone can offer. My sanity is slowly slipping away.</p>

</p><p>Hi Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to answer &amp; give me some&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Before I try to take ownership of folder/files, should I check the&nbsp;2 of the&nbsp;issues that you gave concerning what could be causing the problem...Access Denied &amp; need Administrators Permission?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>1.&nbsp; File ownership has changed</strong>. Could that have happened when I went from my local Win 7 account to a Microsoft</p>

<strong>Should I do this (change accounts) before transferring ownership</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>2.&nbsp; </strong>Upon checking <strong>permission status</strong>, I'm a bit confused as it list a few things I'm not familiar with &amp; had to do some research on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            skype user name and closing accounts</h2>
                    I am confused and frustrated with lack of Skype support. Hopefully these are basic questions that someone can assist me with. 1. How do I find out what my actual skype name is? I signed up years ago but havent used until recently. Apparently there is a
 microsoft skype account but I used Skype on my iphone. Are these different accounts? Do I need 2 accounts for PC and iphone? I also see that there are 4 accounts listed for me with different names. I don't know how to delete as when I go to delete, I am advised
 not to as it impacts the microsoft account. Honestly I'd prefer not to use Skype but fellow classmates use it for course work. Thanks.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signing&nbsp;in via&nbsp;Skype name and Microsoft account (email address) are two different log ins&nbsp;of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're automatically signed in to the Skype app on your mobile phone,&nbsp;and created&nbsp;the account&nbsp;via Skype name,&nbsp;you may just tap your profile picture and from there, you'll be seeing the Skype name of the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't remember the Skype name of the account, you may reset the password of the accounts under your email address and locate the right account you used before. Here's the link for reset password:
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a>&nbsp;Enter your email address and click on Continue. You'll be seeing the Skype names under your email address. Follow the recovery process and locate the right account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For account deletion, if the Skype accounts created under Skype name is not yet merged or linked with your Microsoft account, you may change the primary email address first to a non-Microsoft email. Just log on to
<a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.skype.com</a>. Scroll down until you see
<strong>Settings and preferences</strong>,&nbsp;then, click on <strong>Edit Profile</strong>.&nbsp;Scroll down to the
<strong>Contact details section</strong> and click the <strong>Edit</strong> button on the right. Select
<strong>Set as primary email</strong> next to the address you want to set as your primary email, and click the green
<strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, on the account deletion process,&nbsp;you'll need to enter a Microsoft account to be linked to your Skype account. You may create a new Microsoft account instead. To delete a Skype account, please read and follow the instructions from our FAQ article:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I close my Skype account?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you created and used to sign in using your Microsoft account, and decided to delete the Skype account associated with it,
<span>you will also lose access to other MS products such as Office,&nbsp;OneDrive, XBOX, etc., and you can no longer sign in to your email account itself.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the information above helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any further questions or clarifications.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 home starter - Profile won&#39;t change to HOME, so I can join a Homegroup.</h2>
                    Hi, this has been driving me mad.&nbsp;
<div>I have a fairly reasonable knowledge of Networking (going back Windows 3.11), but Windows Homegroup is just frustrating.&nbsp;</div>
<div>For something that it supposed to be so basic, it is downright annoying. I have spent quite a few hours just trying to access printers/other drives, but to no avail. The current Profile is set to public, and just will not change no matter I do.&nbsp;</div>
<div>No Icon domes up for Home/Work, as per what is supposed to. When in the Homegroup Folder it says 'This computer can't connect to a homegroup. It says that my location must be set to home. When I goto Network &amp; sharing centre, it has a big red X between
 my PC &amp; the Internet Icon. It also says 'You are currently not connected to any networks'. I can access the Internet okay. I have also disabled both Windows Firewall &amp; Trend Micro Maximum Security, but I just keep running around in circles.</div>
<div>The bottom Icon for the Internet has a Yellow star on the 5 bars.</div>
<div>I have also changed the ID of the network, hoping that might go back to square one.</div>
<div>I have disabled IPv6 as per 1 suggestion today.</div>
<div>I have come across a number of people with this issue on forums etc, but have not come across any solutions.</div>
<div>It is an Asus Notebook with AR9285 Wireless Adapter.</div>
                </div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually using the methods&nbsp;<br />
below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are<br />
found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions.<br />
(The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
<strong>Repeat above for network card</strong> (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as<br />
Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 freezes Event viewer codes 41, 6008, 1002</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me start with a few things, I have already researched these codes and know that they are not giving me the answer I'm looking for to solve the mystery of my randomly freezing computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read several threads on this site as well as on bleepingcomputer (first assumption was a virus, it is not), tomshwardare (second assumpution it's my harddrives. &nbsp;I bought hardrives and bought a new Windows 7, it still freezes just as randomly as ever),
 pcworld, etc. and no one seems to have figured this out. &nbsp;Alot of threads just stop, like the person gave up and bought a new computer or something, but I am stubborn. &nbsp;I have been fighting this for almost a year now and I'm finally ready to post my own thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will probably be scattered all over the place while I'm putting this all in, I apologize in advance for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, my basic computer specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alienware Aurora (oldie I know)</p>
<p>Processor Intel Core i7 CPU &nbsp; 920@2.67 GHz 2.67GHz</p>
<p>RAM: &nbsp;9.00 GB</p>
<p>64-bit operating sytem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought and installed my new Windows 7 on March 20, it crashed half a dozen times that day, even after I reinstalled all my updates.</p>
<p>I used MalwareBytes on my old harddrives and Avast on my new ones: &nbsp;still crashes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So under this brand new computer (NVIDIA graphics card also reupdated), all I have are Avast and two online games. &nbsp;It crashes when I play, when I don't play, if I get up and walk away for 20 minutes, during the day when it's warm, during the night, when
 it's not. &nbsp;I've cleaned the fans, run diagnostics, ran microsoft fix at least 7 times (once or more per day) it finds nothing, F8 to run diagnostics, no errors, dell diagnostics, quick all the way down to complete, it says everything's great. &nbsp;I even tried
 to patch it with a fix on Microsoft that was recommended by pc world,&nbsp;Windows6.1-KB2265716-x64, it wouldn't even run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I start digging into the event finder, because every microsoft thread I read about them said to look deeper and I find this process Id under my 1101 event&nbsp;<span>Execution</span>
<span>ProcessID</span><span>="</span><strong>348",&nbsp;</strong>so I research that and I find this extremely computerific blog that says that when you see this process id</p>
<span>ProcessID</span><span>="</span><strong>348",&nbsp;</strong>so I research that and I find this extremely computerific blog that says that when you see this process id</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">That is almost certainly the cause. Apparently, the two inserting</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">processes block each other - one is waiting for the other to release a</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">lock, but the other first has to wait for a lock held by the first</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">process. SQL Server detects such deadlock situations (where both will</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">wait indefinitely), and kill one of the two processes.</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I say to myself if two processes block each other, wouldn't that cause the computer to freeze? &nbsp;So finally here I am, looking to you wonderful computer gurus to help out a computer illiterate analyst figure out what processes could possibly be crashing
 into each other to freeze up my baby. &nbsp;Otherwise I may move on to replacing my graphics card and/or motherboard to see if that stops the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what all information I can provide you to make this as smooth as possible. &nbsp;I have dump logs too if you would like them, 3 so far in a week, not sure if that's good or bad.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, thank you so much in advance for whatever help you can provide, I really appreciate it. &nbsp;ALso, I've never used OneDrive before, so if I didn't correctly share the information with you please give me a "dummies" editorial how to make sure I fix myself
 the next time.</p>

 further guidance? &nbsp;I also do not have a program on this computer to open the dump files, should I change the format under properties? &nbsp;I will do nothing until I receive further instruction from you at the risk I break something.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I updated that and a few others according to my dell service tag, also ran the fix it before updates and after updates (I also did this after initial research into error codes in my event finder, guess it didn't work then?)</p>

</p><p>First I have no idea what any of that means, but the questions you have I'll try to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this computer with the first round of Win7 on it, so early 2010? I think, I know I had to wait 4 months for a computer because it was between Vista and Win 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I replaced the hard drives on March 21, I ran all the updates from windows and dell, only one update I keep running and it says urgent.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">I
 didn't replace anything else on the computer. &nbsp;I had to comp sci friends both tell me the freezing were failing harddrives so I finally broke down and bought new ones, yet the freezing continues, I'm up to three times so far this morning. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">If
 there are other places I'm supposed to DL from I will to update this nonsense. &nbsp;I'm so far beyond my computer expertise, I just want to be able to play video games with my family without my computer freezing up all the time.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank my stars that I write everything down,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I did Rapid storage-&gt; intel chipset -&gt; silicon integrated. &nbsp;The chipset didn't show up until my second software check. &nbsp;Should I do a wipe and start from scratch? &nbsp;Again I haven't put anything on the computer yet that I can't re-download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell is showing I'm fully up-to-date, the urgent DL is gone, I'm not sure why, because it never successfully downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I didn't touch BIOS except for one thing. &nbsp;I enabled the Trubo mode in the Frequency/voltage as per an article I read in the forums that said it would stop the freezing. &nbsp;Obviously it didn't. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, during one of my many reboots this morning I hit F10 after you said the partition part. &nbsp;It said I had no partitions. &nbsp;I don't really understand how that is possible or how to fix it or if it even applies to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also pulled up system information again and now it shows changes and I don't understand what I'm seeing, could the updates have changed it?</p>

<h2>            How to remove an attachment from email.</h2>
                    <p>I receive some of my bill notifications via email (saves a few trees, so they tell me), with the actual bill as an attached xxx.pdf. I open the email, then the attachment, read it, have a minor or major heart attack, and then save the attachment as a yyy.pdf
 in&nbsp; the appropriate folder. I want to keep the "cover" email for my records, but I can't "remove" the attachment, that option is greyed out when I right-click on the attachment.</p>
<p>If anyone can advise me, it would be a big help.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                    <span>
<p><span>I just installed Windows 7 from Windows Vista on a Toshiba 64 bit laptop. My ScanSnap fi 5110 scanner does not work and, when Windows attempts to install a driver, I receive an error message
 saying that there is no driver available. However, in order to get the scanner to work with Windows Vista, I obtained a CD with a driver that works with the scanner and Windows Vista with the 64 bit computer. Is there a way to tell Windows 7 to find the driver
 that's on the computer but that it apparently does not recognize?</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>•&nbsp;Restart the tablet and check if you are able to see the apps.<br />
•&nbsp;Check in the search box whether you are able to find the app.<br />
•&nbsp;Also check in the control panel whether you are able to find the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest you ensure to login using Microsoft account&nbsp;to download this from the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would suggest you to reinstall the app from the play store and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you that Windows Update may have updated drivers available that may be relevant to your current issue. Many times, updated drivers are listed in the "Optional" section of Windows Update. Install any pending updates on the pc to check
 if that helps. <br />
<br />
Hope this information helps. Reply to the post with updated status of the issue so that we can assist you further.</p>

            <p>I think there asking about the "Apps Groups"&nbsp; "Life at a Glance" and "Play and Explore". These are areas in the start menu&nbsp;by default but if you&nbsp;"unpin" all the Apps in a "Apps Group" that Group&nbsp;goes away. If you add Apps to the start they just end up under
 the "Apps Group" that is left and that is where they stay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get back the second "Apps Group" that went away when I unpinned all the Apps in that group?</p>

<h3> busta_rhodesian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Atheros AR9285 adapter constantly turns off on ASUS N53JQ laptop.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been having a problem with my Atheros AR9285 wireless adapter for a few weeks and have tried everything save buying a new adapter. What happens is strange- I'll be connected fine wirelessly, but then after an hour or two my connection will drop and
 my wireless status indicator in the bottom of the screen will do one of two things. It will either say "no connections are available" with the red x through the bars, and I'll have to click "troubleshoot" which turns the adapter back on and I"m fine for a
 few more hours until this happens again. The second thing that happens is my connection will drop and the wireless bars will have the yellow light indicating that "connections are available". When I do this, my home wireless router is never there and I have
 to click on another router in my apartment complex so it can tell me "windows can't connect" which turns the bars to a red x again. I then run troubleshooting again and my home wireless network appears, and I can connect to it.</p>
<p>I have made it to where Windows does not conserve power on the device, tried multiple drivers, and restarted tens of times to no avail. Does anybody have any idea what to do? I've had no problems with my wireless adapter until the last few weeks- perhaps
 an update windows installed interfered with it. If I can get this fixed, it would be awesome- I really don't want to have to buy a new network adapter as taking apart this laptop is not user friendly from guides I've watched, and my warranty is already up.
 From other forums I've read, it is most likely a software issue as well. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If needed you could disable the on-board adapter and use a USB WiFi adapter.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the adapter may have a hardware problem though try updating the driver to<br />
see if that helps. Also check with ASUStek Support and ask in their forum about any known<br />
issues.<br />
<br />
Check the router maker's for update firmware as that can play a role in causing strange
<br />
connection issues.<br />

-------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Left&nbsp;Side click Manage <br />
Wireless Networks - Right Click the Networks - Remove Networks - <br />
REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect&nbsp;To - to logon on to Network.<br />

            Thanks for the extensive reply! Unfortunately, I have tried all these methods in the past and they did not work. I think I accidentally stumbled upon the answer after weeks of problems yesterday. ASUS laptops have this utility called "Wireless Console
 3" that is a UI telling you if your wifi is on or not when you turn on the Wifi switch. I uninstalled this months ago, but I read in one forum that uninstalling this sometimes confuses ASUS laptops and your adapter will shut off. I had tried re-installing
 this before and I still had the same problems. In desperation, I used ASUS's "e-driver" utility that came with the computer that I never uninstalled, and it recommended I download "Wireless Console 3". I downloaded it and now I have not had my adapter turn
 off since. Perhaps the e-driver utility had an updated version of Wireless Console 3. I am not holding my breath, though- I ordered a USB wifi adapter just in case.

            HI,<br />
<br />
Such an issue with the "Wireless Console 3" is exactly why I said to contact ASUStek Support<br />
and ask in their forums. So many makers have special considerations included in their laptop<br />
setups. <br />
<br />
Even now it would be a good idea to contact ASUStek Support and ask in their forums.<br />
<br />
Glad to have helped. And it sound like you have done some very good troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Moving everyday, going further on,

            I'm sorry to say that my computer's adapter seemed to die again....I will keep trying, but I'll probably just end up using the wifi adapter. I still believe it is some weird conflict between the driver and some Asus utility that is causing this, but I'm
 going to try the method of installing new drivers manually one at a time. I will try the ASUStek support forums with this question and get back to you!

            I have a similar asus laptop N53SV and have experienced the same problems with the wifi adapter. I purchased it around april in 2011, and I think I started experiencing the wifi problems in early 2013.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My friend also has an asus laptop N61JA which was purchased maybe 3 months earlier and has exactly the same issue. We got a wifi usb adapter to use instead, which works well but occasionally conflicts with the suddenly un-disabled internal adapter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Needless to say it is extremely annoying. Whenever the adapter stops responding, it will on average takes about an hour of restarting, disabling/enabling, and other experiments to get it back up and running again. Personally I think the device is overheating
 given that it seems to die at seemingly random times, and is likely to die again not long after applying a fix. I've taken to always shutting down the laptop instead of sleeping/hibernating, which I think just lowers the chances of it happening.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm pretty wary of my next (asus) laptop having the same problem a year or two after purchase.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote "exactly why I said to contact ASUStek Support and ask in their forums."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You actually, exactly, said "Sounds like the adapter may have a hardware problem though try updating the driver to see if that helps"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not appreciate people like you that go back to their own post and make up some statement to make it&nbsp;appear as if they were right. EVERYTHING you wrote (which was fine) never mentioned that the add-on utility "Wireless Console 3" is required for the
 wireless NIC to operate correctly. Nothing! Yet you come across like you had everything to do with the resolution and that you knew EXACTLY what was wrong. And you didn't. You failed and you were wrong. Admit it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to thank Busta_Rhodesian for the clue I needed. I removed Wireless Console 3 like a moron because I thought it sounded like some adware. Then the wireless was not working correctly, and I forgot the name of the software I removed. Thanks man,&nbsp;once
 I saw&nbsp;"Wireless Console 3" I was like Bingo. Yeah!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Rob, it's OK to be wrong and not being able to type technically.</p>
<p>Quote "So many makers have special considerations included in their laptop setups."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should be "some manufacturers&nbsp;have special drivers included in their products which are required&nbsp;for the laptop/computer to function correctly."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always will be a few steps above you, peace out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You are right that I did not mention "Wireless console 3" however perhaps you missed this in my original reply :<br />
<br />
Sounds like the adapter may have a hardware problem though try updating the driver to<br />
see if that helps<strong>. Also check with ASUStek Support and ask in their forum about any known</strong><strong> issues.</strong><br />
<br />
Check the router maker's for update firmware as that can play a role in causing strange
<br />
connection issues.<br />

<p>I had this problem with the Atheros/AR5B125 in my ASUS X555LA-HI31103J and had updated the drivers. I have configured the PC for dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu and it occurred IN BOTH OSes. The problem was reduced by configuring my WAN at home as suggested
 elsewhere to not use WPA, but, when I travel or go to coffee shops I have little control over that. I finally gave up and removed the OEM network adapter and replaced it with an "Intel Network 7260.HMWG.R Revised WiFi Wireless-AC 7260 H/T Dual Band 2x2 AC+Bluetooth
 HMC" on Amazon and have had no drops since. The card was recognized in both OSes, no additional driver setup necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a relief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say the change was harder on this PC than most, it is buried under the motherboard which required removing EVERYTHING down to the plastic shell, almost lost my nerve, but finished the job and am ever so glad I am rid of this problem.</p>

<p>You would need to try taking it back and exchanging it from where you purchased it. A few years ago you could purchase an Xbox as part of an "Entertainment for All" Plan. You'd purchase the console for $99 but you had to pay a monthly subscription as well.
 If you're getting that message it's because the previous owner stopped paying the subscription. Since they are the ones under contract, they would have to be the ones to contact support and cancel the subscription.
