<h2>            heading 5 numbering now not in sync with heading 4</h2>
                    <p>All of&nbsp; a sudden, my heading 5 numbering not in sync with heading 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: In chapter 4, heading 4 is 4.3.1.1&nbsp; where I want to insert my first heading 5.</p>
<p>But heading 5 there starts with 1.1.1.1.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried reading Ms Kelly's article, and searching the web, but I cannot make out what is wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That happened after I had to import some content without stripping the formatting from it.&nbsp; Immediately some of my styles began to malfunction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>best,</p>

            <p>"Include level number from" is only for the higher levels. "Number style for this level" gives you the number for the current level. And you won't see 1.2.3.4.5 unless you have temporarily changed the start number of
 all the levels as suggested. If you leave them all at 1, then you'll see 1.1.1.1.1.</p>
<p>But note that you should get that automatically if you select the built-in multilevel list that shows 1 Heading 1, 1.1 Heading 2, 1.1.1 Heading 3. Everything will be set up properly, with each level linked to its corresponding
 heading. You can modify the indents as desired, but you shouldn't have to modify the numbering.</p>

            You can do the Export that Harsha described as a backup. But, you don't have to. Installing 2016 should automatically pick up the setting you had in 2007, including the QAT, Quick Access Toolbar.<br />

<h2>            Circuit Switched AMR-WB Phone</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any Nokia phones that support<strong> circuit</strong> <strong>switched</strong> AMR-WB? &nbsp;I know that there are a few phones with VoIP AMR-WB capabilities. &nbsp;But I am specifically trying to find out if circuit switched AMR-WB is supported anywhere
 in the world and specifically which phone supports it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You mean a phone that uses AMR-WB as the voice codec for regular phone calls?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think more or less every single Nokia model has support for AMR-WB (since roughly 10 years or so), but I have no idea whether that's for just local audio playback (ringtones, music player, games and apps), or also as the voice codec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you need this information anyway?</p>

<p>Yeah, those phones have it as a codec for ringtones, etc. &nbsp;And some support AMR-WB for VoIP. &nbsp;But I want to specifically find a circuit switched AMR-WB capabable phone, the way AMR-NB is supported for circuit switched calls in most phones. &nbsp;<span>I do know
 that the 3GPP does specify AMR-WB circuit switched calls. &nbsp;</span>This is for research purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Nokia have a contact point for more technical questions like this?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, I've tried a few of these phones and they did not actually support AMR-WB circuit switched calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I'm having so much trouble with this is because the publicly available specifications are very vague. &nbsp;A phone might support "HD voice" but it is never specified whether it is done using VoIP or using an actual voice traffic channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried contacting support, but they were confused by my question, which is not suprising since it is not a question typical customers would ask.</p>

<p>How did you manage to find out if they supported it or not in normal calls ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Atleast in VoIP it requires that the VoIP service supports them as well as that the phone you call to supports them, then it seems to work.</p>

By hooking the phones up to an Agilent 8960 and seeing if the call goes through. &nbsp;I just don't want to have to keep buying phones until I find one that actually supports it.</p>

    <title>outlook junk filter using wildcards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerrybdot  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook junk filter using wildcards</h2>
                    While I was on hotmail, about 98% of my junk mail was sent to my junk folder.&nbsp; Now that I am on outlook, I get about 12 junks in my inbox on an average day.&nbsp; One thing I would like to do is to filter using wild cards.&nbsp; For example, everything from lisa(followed
 by other characters)@hotmail.com is junk.&nbsp; I would like to put in my filter to delete everything from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but the filter won't allow this.&nbsp; Is there another way to accomplish this.&nbsp; The chars after "lisa" and before hotmail are not always the
 same, so *** Email address is removed for privacy *** won't work either.&nbsp; Another thing that would work would being able to filter based on two criteria for a single rule.&nbsp; In the above example, it would work if I could combine "delete everything starting with "lisa" AND ending
 in hotmail.com.&nbsp; Is that do-able?<br />
<br />
Also, on hotmail I deleted anything that displayed as coming from classesUSA.&nbsp; Now that I am on outlook, classesUSA is not being filtered.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I suggest you to do is to create rules for incoming messages/emails. This function is the same with Hotmail and Outlook.
<span>Please perform steps 1-3 below for this:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Sign in to your Hotmail account with your Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click on <b>Options</b> then <b>More options </b>in the upper right corner of the page.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Under the <b>Customizing Hotmail</b> section, click on <b>Rules for sorting new messages</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: You will be given options on what to do with a sender's address, sender's name, To/cc address, subject, Message has attachment. Choose one of these.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The second dialog box needs to contain a verb (contains,contains word, does not contain, begins with, ends with).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The third box asks you to give any word that you identify in the first box so that the rule will be completed in a statement. An example of rule might be:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; senders's address contains word contact.</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>senders's address begins with contact.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After completing this, you will go to Step 2 where you wiill do action for this. Choose an action among the 7 listed such as move to inbox, move to a new folder, delete these messages&nbsp; -don't even put in my Deleted folder, add category, remove Category,
 flag, forward to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>An example would be <b>senders's address contains word contact , </b>Delete these messages—don't even put them in my Deleted folder .</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, you can have these emails form junk folder totally blocked from reaching your inbox by doing the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Go to <strong>inbox.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. Tick the box of the emails so that the senders of which will be blocked.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Go up and choose <strong>blocked from.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this resolves</span></p>

            Thanks for the reply, but I am already very familiar with blocking and filtering; however most of my new junk is from one-time addresses like
<span>infocEbQfG @ 873916gkjqgB . net.&nbsp; Other mail is from addresses like&nbsp;
</span>lisa1F29X4B12E? @ hotmail . com. &nbsp; I get a lot of lisa* @ hotmail . com junk, so if I could create a rule that deletes anything where the address starts with lisa and ends in hotmail . com, that was what I am looking for.&nbsp; I cannot use two separate rules
 to delete anything starting with lisa and another rule to delete anything from hotmail . com,&nbsp; it has to be a combined rule to filter out this kind of junk.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please be informed the the rules feature does not have the option "starts with" and "ends with". This is a useful suggestion and we'll be happy to hear more from
 you. Please post your suggestion <a href="https://feedback.live.com/?scrx=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The alternative I can give you s filter the sender's address based on 1 distinct keyword that you can see on the spammers' address. You just need to follow the
 initial steps provided by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/16e6b690-04af-4315-9dc7-e32b8b1332ec">SimonPeter_T</a>&nbsp;to access the rule
 page and then follow these:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click <b>New</b>. On Step 1, select “<b>Sender's address</b>”, “<b>contains</b>”<b>
</b>on the dropdown menu for the first and 2nd box respectively. In the third box type the common
<b>user name</b>, <b>domain name&nbsp;or keywords</b> in the sender's address.&nbsp;&nbsp;On Step 2, you can either pick
<b>Delete these messages—don't even put them in my Deleted folder</b> or <b>move it to</b> a specific folder.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Click <b>Save</b>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>How to convert HTML text to MS Word Doc&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clueless in seattle  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to convert HTML text to MS Word Doc&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Hi!<br />
<br />
I'm using an MS-DOS based text editor on an old laptop as a notepad for taking reading notes.<br />
<br />
I often need to mark the title of a book so that it can later be displayed or printed in italics from MS Word. (I still use Word 2003)<br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure out a way to use standard ASCII text characters to mark book titles.<br />
<br />
My first thought was to simply type the HTML italics markers before and after the book titles in the text file like this:
<div>
<div>Code:</div>
&lt;i&gt;Book Title&lt;/i&gt;
</div>
I assumed that there must be a simple way to then import that text into Word so that the marked text would be converted into italics.<br />
<br />
But I can't seem to find instructions for how to do that.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to mark text in a text file with ASCII characters so that Word will convert it into italics?<br />
<br />

<br />
Take a look at the AutoFormat options. Tools &gt; AutoCorrect Options &gt; AutoFormat<br />
<br />
Italic is marked by start and end _underscores_. Bold is marked by start and end *asterisks*.<br />
<br />
Select your text and use the AutoFormat command under the Format menu.<br />

    <title>Changing default fonts&#47;paragraph style in Word documents created - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cybishop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing default fonts&#47;paragraph style in Word documents created from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I know how to change the font and paragraph style. I know how to change the default font and paragraph style in the Word program itself (on the desktop). I know how to create, modify, and apply a style.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What I'm having trouble with is that I want all my new documents to default as Times New Romans, 12pt, 1.5 spacing, first line indent. I have that set up as the default on my desktop version, no problem. I have also set it as the 'normal' style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when I am in OneDrive on my browser, and I create a new Word document, it opens with Calibri 11pt with the weird spacing at the end of the paragraph and no first line indent, and that's set as the 'normal' style, as well. I can't modify
 the style within the online Word document (editing it in my browser), and while I can change the font and paragraph parameters, I can't set any of them as default. Which means that every time I make a new Word document through OneDrive (which I do regularly),
 I have to change every single thing all over again. I know that I can open it in Word (desktop) and apply normal, then close it and resume work in the browser - but why, when the desktop version is so easy to set up defaults, doesn't the browser version offer
 the same basic function?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else dealt with this? Is there some way to adjust the defaults that I've missed? Everything I can find online talks about changing defaults in the desktop version, not the browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<span>Hi CyBishop,</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Based on your description of your concern were seeing that you are pointing to the Word Online application. This platform is using
<strong>Calibri </strong><strong>11-point </strong>as default when you create a new blank document.

<p>Genevieve has answered your basic question (you can't set the document defaults in Word Online), but I would issue a caution about your changes on the desktop version. Changing the document default font (and/or the font for the Normal style) is unlikely
 to have unwanted repercussions, but changing paragraph formatting as you have done is not recommended because it affects every other document style. For example, if you create footnotes, you will find that they have 1.5 line spacing and a first-line indent.
 This may well also affect headers, footers, headings, and every other style because they are all (directly or indirectly) based on Normal. One thing many users don't realize or notice is that centered headings will never be properly centered because they're
 indented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why I recommend leaving the paragraph formatting of Normal alone and instead using the built-in Body Text style (modified to your requirements) as your basic body style. In fact, if you're going to add a first-line indent, I recommend modifying the
 line spacing of Body Text and then adding the first-line indent to Body Text First Indent, which is based on Body Text. Then when you need an unindented paragraph, you can fall back on Body Text. See

<p><br />
Thank you for the advice. I have created a new style called 'centered' for true centered (without the indent) and various other paragraph formatting that get used frequently. For anything else, I just change the settings for the applicable selection of text.
 I'm working from a specific set of guidelines for each type of text, so I have a variety of 'styles' set up according to my needs. :) Most of the alternate styles get applied when I'm doing the document's final edit in the desktop version, so I don't need
 all of the styles in the online version - but the mass bulk of the text meets the specific parameters described above, so it would be highly convenient if I could set a default instead of having to change it for every new document.&nbsp;</p>

            An alternative that may work for you is to create a new document in desktop Word and upload it (even as just a blank document) to OneDrive. It will contain the styles and formatting information that it inherited from your Normal.dotm template. In OneDrive,
 you can then copy that document to create more new documents to your specifications.

    <title>New lumina phone cannot download apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjwilcox  say:</h3>
<h2>            New lumina phone cannot download apps</h2>
                    My 17 year old son just got a Lumia640, and we are in the process of getting it set up. &nbsp;To allow him to download apps, I have added him to my family account using the same account that he has on his phone. &nbsp;I have selected no filtering and have allowed
 him to download free and paid apps from the store. &nbsp;When he attempts to download an app, in this case a free fantasy football app, it puts up a message that he must be added to a family account to do so. &nbsp;I have invested a couple of hours researching blogs,
 videos and other information, most of which seems out of date as the process seems extremely simple. &nbsp;The one thing I have never seen that is frequently mentioned is an acceptance of terms of service. &nbsp;Both my account and my son's have existed for quite a
 while and there is no tab or any other spot where you perform this function, and I assume we both did this when we set up the accounts.

<p>The account recovery process is fully automated and the only way to lift the restriction of the account is if the information you provided on the form match the information that is in the account you are trying to recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give you some tips to help you pass the verification.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Fill out the form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful. Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.
</li><li>Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally, even if there were recent changes. The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)</li><li>And also, please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The
 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.</li></ul>

<p>Please be informed that Skype does not have a Phone Support.&nbsp;I understand how upsetting it is for you to not be able to access your Skype account. Based on what you have mentioned you have done so far, you have done what is supposed to resolve the issue
 and we greatly appreciate your time and effort in doing so. But please be reminded that such form is established in the interest of data and account security. This means that the system will only grant access to the person who will be able to pass the verification
 process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, the best recourse I would strongly recommend you to do would be to revisit the answers you have provided on the form, change what you think may be inaccurate, and resubmit the form. Should that fail again, I suggest that you create a new account
 instead.</p>

<p>We understand how important this is for you. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do if you're not passing the recovery form. That is our only way of verifying the account ownership. We strongly suggest you create a new account instead.</p>

    <title>What is a Windows phone app that can add foreground light by tapping a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is a Windows phone app that can add foreground light by tapping a button&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I took a photo last weekend where the lighting in the background that my kid's faces and their clothing was too dark. Luckily, I easily stumbled upon an APP that I easily used that had a feature to add front light without ruining the lighting in the background.
 I loved it. It was so easy. I don't remember it having a slider where you could decide how much light to add but I don't know for sure. My memory is that it just had a FORE LITE button that you tapped &amp; it did it automatically. But I had Installed a few photo
 editing apps before I'd used that one &amp; liked it so much &amp; after I used it, when I went to use my camera again, some app had altered how the whole camera screen looked and worked, so I uninstalled 1 or 2 of the 3 apps that I'd Installed and I must have accidentally
 Uninstalled that one since now it isn't anywhere in my list of apps. I've tried to find it again in the store by doing the same Search that I thought that I'd done, but I can't find it. My only thought was to ask here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi MS User 372,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. According to the information you provide, you can try contact the recipients (Office 365 users) to remove IP address from a block list. And there is
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.eac.actioncenter(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reference</a> about how to remove the IP address blocked by block list from the action center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this issue persist, please ask the recipients add your IP address to the IP allow list via this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Prevent-email-from-being-marked-as-spam-in-EOP-and-Office-365-74aaade0-efc0-46ac-b949-f2d1d59256fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can send the IP address was blocked to us via <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">

<p>Unfortunately this does not appear to be an issue where specific clients' Office 365 domain are blocking the sender. All emails are being rejected
<em>regardless </em>of the recipient.&nbsp; Attempting to send an email to an Office 365 user who we've never communicated with, and who is in a completely unrelated industry, results in the same rejection message.</p>

<p>I would like to explain if Office 365 side to block your emails, we can involve the Office 365 recipient side to together check the issue. To get better understand the situation, please send us 2 NDR via private
 message. One is send emails to Office 365, and other is send email to other recipient. Thanks.</p>

</p><p>I am afraid that slicers do not work in Excel 2007. </p>
<p>It has been introduced in Excel 2010. Which means you are able to use it in the versions 2010, 2013 and 2016.</p>

    <title>missing minimize, restore and close buttons in IE 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            missing minimize, restore and close buttons in IE 10</h2>
                    <p>In win 7 when I go to my IE homepage (bing), in default view the minimize, restore and close buttons are directly above the home, favorites and tools buttons in upper right corner of screen.&nbsp; However, as of a few days ago, when I go full screen, the minimize,
 restore and close buttons disappear.&nbsp; Up until a few days ago, when I used to go full screen, those same buttons would move to and line up next to the tools icon.&nbsp; But now I have to&nbsp;go back to default view from&nbsp;full screen to get them at all.&nbsp; This is not
 an F11 issue.&nbsp; How can I get them back next to the tools button in full screen? </p>

 computers where I work that use the same system and browser and they still have the buttons in full screen lined up to the right of the tools button.&nbsp; They are very much available.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's just my computer and I don't know what happened.&nbsp; Please help.

            <p>Sorry, I got sidetracked. That said, I see the same issue as you do. Here are two screenshots from my IE11. The first is when I first use F11, and the second is from about 3 seconds after using F11. What is confusing to me is why you were able to see those
 buttons at all before. Full screen means just that.</p>

            no problem...just glad you came back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your first screen is what I was able to see all the time in full screen as long as I put my mouse up at the top since I had the whole bar on auto hide.&nbsp; And as I mentioned earlier even the computers where I work still
 have that feature because I checked today.&nbsp; I just don't know why I don't anymore.

    <title>Adding unique record identifier via query in Access - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding unique record identifier via query in Access</h2>
                    I have a table that includes student ID and language information as well as modified and created dates. The way it is set up is if the same student speaks multiple languages there will be multiple records with the same student ID. What I need to do is
 run a query that will produce a single record with all the language information. The information is being pulled from a web application and in the past included a sequence ID for each record for each language e.g. student 1234 speaks three languages therefore
 there are three records for student 1234, each with its own sequence ID i.e. 1, 2, 3. What I would do is create three select queries with criteria set for each sequence ID and then combine using a fourth query. Now the sequence ID has been removed. Is there
 a way add a similar sequence number via query?

            If each student speaks no more than two languages, then it can be done by joining an outer query which returns the MIN language to a subquery which returns the MAX language.&nbsp; The following is an example using a table from my ParentActivities demo, to which
 I referred you earlier:<br />
<br />
SELECT PA1.ParentID, MIN(ActivityID) AS Activity1, Activity2<br />
FROM ParentActivities AS PA1 LEFT JOIN<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT ParentID, MAX(ActivityID) AS Activity2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM ParentActivities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GROUP BY ParentID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;1) AS PA2<br />
ON PA1.ParentID = PA2.ParentID<br />
GROUP BY PA1.ParentID,Activity2;<br />
<br />
If a student speaks more than two languages it will return the MIN and MAX values of the set.<br />
<br />
With an ActivityCounter column, as in my ParentActivities table, it can be done in a Crosstab query to return all activities per parent (languages per student in your case) with:<br />
<br />
TRANSFORM MAX(ActivityID)<br />
SELECT ParentID<br />
FROM ParentActivities<br />
GROUP BY ParentID<br />
PIVOT "Activity" &amp; ActivityCounter;<br />
<br />
Or the first two activities only with:<br />
<br />
TRANSFORM MAX(ActivityID)<br />
SELECT ParentID<br />
FROM ParentActivities<br />
GROUP BY ParentID<br />
PIVOT "Activity" &amp; ActivityCounter IN("Activity1","Activity2");<br />

<h2>            can&#39;t delete an email in draft folder in hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;few days ago I composed an email in 'draft' mode. When I went to send it, I received the message "something went wrong and we haven't been able to send your message yet". &nbsp;I then proceeded to copy the whole message and send it again, it sent fine. Now this
 old draft won't delete in the draft folder. This is a web based outlook acct. No matter what computer I use, if will not delete. It just keeps re-appearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts please?</p>

            <p>Exactly, You know I think someone from MS is looking at this thread and are aware of the issue, but just ignoring. Yesterday, most emails in my draft folder that I actually wanted to keep there were deleted, and one email that I had been done with from long
 is still sitting there, refusing to go away still. I was quick enough to go into trash and recover the draft emails I needed, but got deleted on their own.
</p>
<p>Calling them or chatting with them is simply useless, they do basic things which we already done or transfer to another department.
</p>
<p>Annoying......and not helpful at all. </p>

<h2>            Band 2 - choose calendar for notifications</h2>
                    <p>In the documentation says that you can choose which calendar (in case you have more than one) sets the notification alerts to the&nbsp;Band 2.&nbsp; but it is not clear how or where to configure that.&nbsp; I have my calendar in my Windows Phone, + my wife's shared calendar.&nbsp;
 I just want the notifications from my calendar to have notifications (vibration) in my band.</p>
<p>Anyone can explain the exact steps on how to do in on the Phone's Notification Center?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>
</p><p>The documentation says:&nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/email-and-calendar/calendar</p>
Manage notifications for specific calendar accounts
<p>If you have several calendars or accounts on your phone, you can manage which of them delivers notifications to your Band. For example, you might want to get notifications from your personal accounts but exclude notifications from your work account.</p>
<p>You can manage calendar notifications on your phone through your <strong>phone’s Notification Center</strong>. To learn how, check the info that came with your phone or go the manufacturer’s website.</p>

    <title>Access - Disable OnClick Event for a row that has been - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mtoddmatthews  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access - Disable OnClick Event for a row that has been</h2>
                    <p>I would like to use conditional formatting to disable specific rows (rows where Item=Note in the datasheet below). The problem is that I want certain fields of the same row to have their OnClick event disabled. I thought I could just add an If item.Enabled=True
 guard in the OnClick event handler; however, the row that comes back is not that being clicked on (because it is disabled) and rather the last active row. So, I have no way to programmatically ignore the Click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excluding the fields where I don't want the click to be activated allows me to do this check. But, it makes for an ugly checkerboard (see below). Advice?</p>

            <p>Your message confuses me (e.g. Note is not in the screenshot) and I did not know you could set Enabled=False for individual rows (you should explain that in a separate post).</p>
<p>Anyway, if I wanted to suppress whatever clicking would normally do in your form, I might write in the Click event:</p>
<p>If ItsOkToRespondToClickEvent() then</p>
<p>&nbsp; 'do it</p>
<p>Else</p>
<p>&nbsp; 'ignore it</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>That function might look at Item and Note, and possibly other factors and return True or False.</p>

            <p>I think Tom missed that Note was a value in the Item field (I almost missed it too).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't use Conditional Formatting for this. All you need is the following in the On click event of the object:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Me.Item &lt;&gt; "Note" Then&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;do whatever you want to do</p>
<p>End if</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if the value for Item in that record is "Note", the code will be ignored and nothing will happen. If its not "Note" then it will run whatever code is within the If...End If.</p>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok - just realized what I need to do. Kind of stupid on my part - simply putting a different conditional format on the #Refs and Answer field to change the color to light gray along with the OnClick check as you describes gives me exactly what I want alongside
 the conditional format that disables all the other fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was attempting to disable all the fields with the conditional format which would not move the record and the OnClick would fire with the wrong record. All is well now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;Could you find any error event log when you reproduce the issue?</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Can you log in to desktop app such as Word/Excel?</p>

<p>hi johny</p>
<p>i have been working with the outlook app (android) support team to resolve an outlook issue of receiving and error message, the support contact then requested to contact here as the issue appears to be with all of my android apps.</p>
<p>as parting of that testing process we also tested it on my ipad where the outlook for ios app also returned the 'error occurred' message.</p>
<p>a couple of screens shots attached</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I would like to check if you are Office 365 administrator (manage Office 365 tenant). If not, I suggest involving the admin in this thread as I need to confirm some information requested in my first reply.</p>
<p>For example, what’s the version of ADFS server as you have this federated account? Does the issue occur to other user accounts? This will help check the actual impact. Moreover, when the issue occurs, do you have any error event log in ADFS server?</p>
<p>Also, to check if the issue is related to user’s account, you can put the impacted account to normal device (it is working for other users).</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Johnny Zhang</p>

<p>Hi Johny </p>
<p>I am not the administrator for the business, will drop the link to him today to join the conversation.</p>
<p>In terms of other users I have personally set up three others of my team on the ios and Android apps in the last month without issue which would suggest that it is linked only to my account.</p>

    <title>Unwanted borders suddenly appearing in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katy.cooper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted borders suddenly appearing in Excel</h2>
                    <p>In the last day or so, every time I enter data into a cell -- and it doesn't matter what kind of data -- a border appears. Sometimes the border is a line that stretches to the end of the workbook. Sometimes the border is a box around the new data, sometimes
 with&nbsp;the line-to-the-end, sometimes without. And sometimes, if I highlight the cell(s) with the box and click on No Border, the line appears at the bottom of the highlighted cells. The only way to get rid of all borders is to click in the box in the upper
 left corner and choose no border.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why this started, so I'm at a loss for how to fix it, but it's driving me nuts.</p>

So I am in the look out for a phone which has a decent camera,good battery life,3g and internet teathering(Bluetooth preferably over WiFi cause of battery issues)<br />
Well I think 301 might just be it<br />
The only question is does Nokia 301 support Bluetooth internet teathering<br />

<h2>            Recovering emails lost through hacking</h2>
                    My email account was hacked on 3rd October 2014. I have since followed on line help guidance to change my password and restored all settings to avoid mail being diverted to hacked account. Emails received between 2005 and 3rd October 2014 have disappeared
 from my list and are not in my delete folder. Is there any way&nbsp;at least some of them can&nbsp;be restored to my account or are they lost forever?

<p>
</p><p>The only possibility (and it is a slim one) is to use the auto recovery.&nbsp; What I suspect is the hacker turned off recover then deleted the emails to cover his/her tracks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all intents there is no back up which is why MS suggested you back up your own data in the terms of use</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>To recover your email do the following</strong><br />
<span>1. Sign in to your Outlook.com account (via a Computer/Laptop).</span><br />
<span>2. Go to your Deleted folder (found on the left pane under Folders).</span><br />
<span>3. Look for "Lost a message?", and click "recover deleted messages".</span><br />
