<h2>            Asus PCE-AC56 PCIE Wi-Fi Card not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking around for help on this but there hasn't been much in the way to fix the issue. It seems to be an issue with the Fall Creators Update. The issue is that the device cannot start:</p>
This device cannot start. (Code 10)<br />
<br />
{Operation Failed}<br />
The requested operation was unsuccessful.
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using an AMD FX-8350, 970 Pro Gaming/Aura Motherboard, 32 gigs of Corsair RAM running at 1600 MHz, Gigabyte GTX 1060, and the Asus PCE-AC56 PCIE Wi-Fi Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking into Event Viewer it states this:</p>
<p>Device PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_43B1&amp;SUBSYS_85BA1043&amp;REV_03\4&amp;e21b4e0&amp;0&amp;0050 requires further installation.</p>
<p>Then this:</p>
<p>Driver Management has concluded the process to add Service BCMWL63A for Device Instance ID PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_43B1&amp;SUBSYS_85BA1043&amp;REV_03\4&amp;E21B4E0&amp;0&amp;0050 with the following status: 0.</p>
<p>Then this:</p>

<p>Then this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling the Asus PCE-AC56 PCIE Wi-Fi Card drivers and reinstalling, updating them manually to the latest drivers (Windows Update doesn't seem to find the latest drivers), and uninstalling and letting Windows do it's thing by updating itself.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may already know, software or hardware incompatibility may cause an issue with your devices. To isolate the issue with the WIFI card driver, may we verify if you already tried reverting to its later version?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, we recommend that you refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to fix network connection issues in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have clarifications.</p>

            I have found the solution to the problem. I downloaded an earlier build of Windows 10, build 1703 and installed that one, and then the card worked fine :) So it seems that the problem is with the drivers provided by Windows in the latest Windows 10 update.

            I was able to contact Microsoft and they had to send me the older Version 1703. All the issues I was having have been resolved because of that. I also had several other issues but figured that I could solve those as they weren't bad but rolling back to
 1703 solved everything.

            I had to contact Windows support via phone to have them help me resolve this issue. They sent me an email with the Media Creation tool and one other file that I then used to reinstall the OS onto my computer. After that everything has been solved.

<h2>            Mouse stopped working - code 43</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My usb optical mouse stopped working completely yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse froze and did not move, the touchpad works fine. The mouse is not recognized as a mouse, only as a device (code 43) - I tried to update the drivers with no luck. The mouse is a "gaming" mouse with light effects (it changes color) and after the
 mouse stopped working, it still lights up when plugged, but when I scroll the wheel, the lights go crazy, they used to change very slowly but now they flicker with every touch which I find really weird - can the mouse be somehow damaged?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hopeless, because my boyfriend plugged his mouse (which is the same type as mine and was working on his computer) into my pc, and now it does not work on his pc either. He thought it could be some virus that affects every usb device that is plugged
 into the computer and "damages" it, but today I tried to plug an old usb and it works just fine - the driver installed without a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mouse is still not recognized and I don't know what to try. I am thinking of a restore point option, to see if I might have done something that affected the mouse, but I am confused as to why my bf's mouse got affected too. It's just really confusing. Please
 help - do we need to buy new mice or will the same happen to them too?</p>

            As I said, I tried my boyfriends mouse and the same thing happened - not recognized, and now his mouse is not working even on his computer after being plugged into mine. I am afraid of ruining more mice as his was fully functioning before. I also worry
 about trying my mouse on another computer, as I fear it might be a virus (I've read some forums online about a possible usb mouse virus, but am not sure if this is the case).

<p>Hey there bud!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked in to your error code, and here is a pasted page of information with regards to your error code and ones that may appear with similar issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>This article describes what to do if you get an error message when you try to do one of these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in on your console or at Xbox.com </li><li>Change the Microsoft account associated with your Xbox LIVE account </li><li>Create an Xbox LIVE account </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the error messages you might get:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The e-mail address or password you entered is not valid. Please try again." </li><li>"This profile cannot be downloaded right now. Status Code 80151103" </li><li>"This profile cannot be downloaded right now. Status Code 8015D000" </li><li>"This profile cannot be downloaded right now. Status Code 8015d02e" </li></ul>
<p>Typically, this problem occurs if you entered the wrong Microsoft account (email address or password), or if there is an issue with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If you receive an error message that is not covered by the information on this page, try searching for your error on the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/error-code-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox error code/status code search page</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If you do not yet have an Xbox LIVE account and want to set one up, go to the
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/join/free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Join Xbox LIVE page</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> “Microsoft account” is the new name for what used to be called “Windows Live ID.” It’s the email address and password you use to sign in to Microsoft services (including Xbox LIVE). Your Xbox console may still refer to your Microsoft account
 as your “Windows Live ID.” Keep in mind that these two terms mean the same thing. Your Xbox LIVE sign-in information has not changed.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Solution 1: Make sure that you are using the right Microsoft account
<div>
<p>If you have more than one Microsoft account, make sure that you use the right one — the one that was used to create your Xbox LIVE account. If you forgot, see
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manage your Microsoft account</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If the Xbox LIVE account is a child account, make sure that you enter the child's Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
Solution 2: Check your Microsoft account on Xbox.com
<div>
<p>To make sure that the Microsoft account you are using is the right one, try signing in to Xbox.com by using the same Microsoft account that you are trying to use on your console. If there’s a problem with that Microsoft account, you are prompted to correct
 it.</p>
<p>If you are signed in with an incorrect gamertag or if you are prompted to create a new Microsoft account, you are likely using the wrong Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
Solution 3: For a child’s account, use the child's Microsoft account
<div>
<p>If the Xbox LIVE account is a child's account, make sure that you enter your child's Microsoft account. You must use the Microsoft account that was used to create the account.</p>
<p>If your child's Microsoft account was automatically created as part of Family Account setup and you try to reset the password, email is sent to the Microsoft account parent account (the Xbox LIVE family primary account). Follow the instructions in that email
 to reset the child's account's password.</p>
<p>If you only want to download the account profile, use the Download Profile feature when you are signed in with the Xbox LIVE family primary account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
Solution 4: Reset your Microsoft account password
<div>
<p>If you can’t remember your Microsoft account password, try <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
resetting your password</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
Solution 5: Go to the Windows Solution Center
<div>
<p>If you can’t reset your Microsoft account password, go to the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help?SignedIn=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Solution Center</a> for help recovering your password. Xbox Support can’t reset your Microsoftaccount password for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps! Keep us posted.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 pro generic key</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to be upgrading to windows 10 pro and I am buying the license key in 3 weeks time.&nbsp; My questions is if I use this generic key VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T today, would it let me use windows fully until I get my own key in 3 weeks time?&nbsp; I had
 read that since its basically for testing purposes that it should be ok for 30 days.&nbsp; That is more than enough time for me, but I want to be sure before doing it.<br />

            To activate with the Pro Product Key, you must first go offline using Airplane Mode in the Action Center, insert the default Generic Version key to change to Pro Version.  
<br />
<br />Then go back online and insert the Pro Product Key in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key to Activate.  
<br />
<br />Again, this has been necessary since Version 1803 blocked using Pro Version keys while online if you don't already have a Pro Digital License - with many cases reported that a valid Pro Product Key will not activate until the version is changed first by going offline and inserting the Generic Pro Key.

<h2>            Do I need an OS for my computer to work&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, right now I'm building a computer. What I was wondering is, are you able to run a computer normally without an OS? If I could, would I still be able to do things such as run iTunes, play music, watch videos, play games, and so on? I'm thinking of
 installing an OS, but it does not support itunes. If I had no OS would I just not be able to do anything, or would it just be a completely plain computer with no extra gadgets?

            Hi Judy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it's a .pdf type file then sometimes it can be filled in using Adobe Reader.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise go ahead and print it out to fill it out.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            If its a PDF, see instructions how you can edit it:

<br />
<br />If its an fill in form on a website, you will have to fill it out in your browser then maybe click save at the end. 
<br />
<br />Could you give us any ideas what type of form is it or which website the form is generated from?

            Hi Petri,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting. The value of CallerAudioMicGlitchRate is defined as the average number of glitches per five minutes for the microphone capture and it is calculated and provided intermittently by the system and Skype for Business server. The actions
 for Endpoints Device and System have been updated to reflect that there might be an inter dependency between these two causes of poor audio quality in the call of Skype for Business, i.e. a misbehaving device can cause the AudioMicGlitchRate to be high or
 a misbehaving system can cause the SendListenMOS to be low. In this way, these values indirectly represent the quality of the caller in the Skype for Business call and it might be related if someone has been in muted during the meeting.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

<p>Jay,</p>
<p>Do you still expecting to see that within the same date, there could be so big differences?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few times I have asked from the users how they feel the call (with &gt;10k glitch rate)&nbsp;, and majority says: "I did not had any troubles...". Only one mentioned that her workstation behaves very badly during the call. So for me, the issue might not necessarily&nbsp;have
 nothing to do with device itself, but e.g. the load on the workstation is higher than normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually found my own account from the list as well, and I remember also that sometimes I have received the notification on the Skype client: "your device is causing poor audio quality". Could it be so, that this is linked to the Glitch Rate? So far people
 has not reported any issues with the voice, so this is a bit strange.</p>

            Hi Petri,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates. As the value of CallerAudioMicGlitchRate is calculated by its set formula and algorithm and provided by the system and server, the number will be changed differently by the data situation obtained by the system and server. In this way,
 the unstable value may be related to the use of device situation during the call or may not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Besides, for the poor audio quality caused by your device, there are different related factors. You might monitor the poor quality by refer to the value of CallerAudioMicGlitchRate, but it isn’t the main index for reflecting the problem. In this way, if you
 have any problem about poor audio quality in Skype for Business call and meeting, to help you better, it’s recommended for you to post a new thread and our relevant engineers will give your targeted help. Thanks for your time and understanding.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

<p>The reason I asked this question was the Glitch Rate itself. This is because the CQM is measuring that value and rate the environment partly based on that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And while I have investigated this, the question about "The Device cause a poor.." came up when I found my own account from the list and remember that message. As I told, I have not identified any quality issue on myself, so the message about my device was
 a bit confusing. Then I was able to reproduce the issue, one of my colleague was behind the VPN (no need to speak about VPN is not the best). And I was able to get that problem. When I tested a call to my own VPN I was not able to see any issues there. How
 other participant can affect to the Glitch Rate on my site and how my device can cause poor audio if person whom I'm calling is behind the VPN? :-o</p>
<p>
</p><p>I of course like to offer the best audio quality for my users, so I need to be aware if there are some counters which could indicate we do have troubles. To be able to do so I need to know the system enough deeply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But with this, as you said: "<em>it isn’t the main index for reflecting the problem</em>" and based on my own investigation of how randomly the Glitch Rate can be, it is very untrusted and decisions based of that should not be made.</p>

            Hi Petri,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates. As the situation of the network connections varies from person to person, with your devices’ usage and other factors, the quality of the call between you and other person might be poor. As the quality of the call varies form case to
 case, you can post a new thread as I suggested above. Besides, as it’s not such counters which could indicate you do have troubles during the call, if it’s inconvenient for you and you really want such related feature, it’s recommended to
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">submit a feedback</a> and your comments will be valuable. Your time and understanding are highly appreciated.<br />

<p>That is not required. It is enough that you confirmed me that my findings are close to truth ;) The Glitch Rate is nice counter, but it does not indicate anything about call quality. What it does seems to be not publicly available information&nbsp;:)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know nothing about that program, but you might try running or uninstalling it in "Compatibility Mode"
</p>
<p>Right click on the programs .exe (launcher) to try and run, or it's installer\setup to reinstall...</p>
<p>Select Properties... Compatibility tab... you will see a check box and a menu for previous versions of Windows..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program most likely also has a Uninstaller in it's Program Files (x86)&nbsp;folder that you can do the same thing with...&nbsp;</p>

<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>The way the Skrill payment works is that you enter your card number as you usually would for most online orders - the payment is processed through Skrill but it's basically just a card payment. 20% charge for using PayPal is a bit extreme though, especially
 as it only costs them 7%.</p>

<p>Personally I have no issues with Skrill, I deal with them through work on a daily basis and they are highly reputable.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>As a company they are fine - I've bought my last 2 subs from there with no issues at all. The Paypal charge is something that most companies absorb because the profit is in the goods, but at that price there is very little for the retailer to make. 20% takes
 the mick though so I would just use the Skrill option personally as the retailer won't even know your card number - it gets processed through Skrill but is essentially a card payment.</p>

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have updated yesterday from 8 to 8.1 and my TV tuner that was working perfectly up until then now is no longer being recognised by WMC. I have tried to re-install the drivers etc but to no avail. The device manager says the Tuner is working properly
 but still WMC won't recognise it. Anyone got any suggestions?</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the TV tuner card is not compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the Make and Model of the TV tuner card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer to the link and check if the model of the TV tuner is compatible with Windows 8.1:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/compatcenter/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/compatcenter/home</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can type the name of the card inside the search box and hit Enter. This would show you the search results according the version or model of the card and the operating system. You can click on the appropriate version and then check if it’s compatible
 with Windows 8.1. If it shows that it isn’t compatible, try changing the operating system to Windows 8 from the drop down menu and then verify if it shows compatible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the device was working previously on Windows 8, let’s try installing the driver in Windows 8 compatibility mode and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the steps to do so:</p>
<p>You can follow the steps to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys together and click on <strong>Device Manager.</strong></li><li>Locate Sound, video and game controllers and expand the driver icon. You can also check if there is an unknown device listed under “Other devices” by expanding the icon.
</li><li><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click on the TV tuner card driver and select Uninstall.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the driver.</li><li>Locate the folder that has the setup file for the latest driver for the tuner card. Right Click on the setup file and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>Go to <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and check the box which states “<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>”.</li><li>Select the <strong>Windows 8</strong> from the drop down list.</li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>. Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions to install the driver.
</li></ul>
<p>Please keep us posted. </p>

<h2>            Can I move user folder from &#40;C&#58;&#41; to &#40;D&#58;&#41; and put a shortcut in &#40;C&#58;&#41; to avoid problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I installed a new SSD in my computer and found out that C:\user is taking a lot of space. I have 1 SSD that is 250GB and 1 HDD that is 1TB. I moved location of desktop and other to my HDD. By moving, I mean that I changed the path in the location
 tab. But my User folder is still on my C:\ and is taking space. I wanted to cut C:\user out of C:\ and paste it in D:\. I've read online that this isn't a good idea and may causes issues. Well I though: can I move user to another drive but put a shortcut so
 my Pc will think it is still on C:\ but the data are actually on D:\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Question: can I move C:\user to D:\ and put a shortcut so the path will be C:\User(shortcut)\Acess Data on D:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it cause issues and how can I do it without ruining my Data ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for help and reading</p>

            You can redirect the folders to the D partition if your intention is to free up space.
<br />
<br />If the D: drive is larger than C:, I would try partitioning the drive.
<br />
<br />Here is an article how to partition a drive:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-partitions-windows-10-macos-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-partiti...</a>
<br />
<br />Name one Partition 'Files' and the other 'Apps'.
<br />
<br />Open the Files partition, create a folder and name it: WalkerFrancisco
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: %userprofile%
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Right click your Documents folder
<br />Click Properties
<br />Select the Location tab
<br />Click Move
<br />Browse to the Files partition we created earlier then select WalkerFrancisco folder.
<br />
<br />Repeat the same steps for other folders such as Pictures, Videos etc.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
<br />Under More storage settings, click 'Change where new content is saved'
<br />
<br />In New apps will save to list box, choose the 'Apps' partition we created earlier.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features
<br />Select any large app you have downloaded from the Windows Store
<br />Click Move, choose the 'Apps' partition

            Hi WizardSpace0,
<br />
<br />You will find articles on how to move the user folder to another drive - don't do it!
<br />
<br />Then next time you have a large Windows Update, your system sill become unbootable
<br />
<br />What you can safely do is move the contained Library folders (Documents, Videos, Pictures . ..  etc.) to your D Drive
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />At the top right, right click your Documents Folder and choose Properties
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, click on the Location Tab
<br />
<br />In the Location box, type D:\Documents
<br />
<br />Click Apply and OK and confirm the move
<br />
<br />Once that completes, you can continue to move the rest of your Library folders, each time specify a different folder, for example, Pictures goes to D:\Pictures and so on . . .

<p>Well my Drives are already partitioned&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On C: is my OS (Samsung SSD 860 Evo 250GB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On D: is pretty much all my Data ( 1 TB HDD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already moved Desktop, Documents, videos, etc. to my D drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that I want to have maximum space I can free on my SSD and moving C:\user is all that I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already moved around 400GB of data on my drives, but my C:\user Folder is still taking 49Go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can understand what I mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>-----------EXTRA:-------</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Originally I had only 1 TB drive with everything on it. I've bought a SSD to speed up things. (basically moving OS and Program File, etc. on it)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I used samsung migration software but the only thing is that the software only clone your partition on your new drive.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This was the main partition and was around 500Go. I couldn't migrate it to my 250GB SSD.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Finally, what I did is that I partitioned my free space on my 1TB HDD to make another partition and move every Data on it except OS. The OS partition was now small enough and I've cloned it to my SSD.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>After making sure everything was working, I formated my OS partition on my 1TB HDD and Combined this partition to my Data partition on the same disk to get all my disk space.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Now my SSD was almost full so I've transfered all data left on my Data drive (HDD) and the only thing that I want to move, if I can, is my user folder that is verry lighter than before but it still take space.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>I couldn't make a backup of all my data because the only place I could use was my 1TB Xbox One X HDD and it would have taken eternity.</em></p>

            <pre>Some of that 49 GBs is likely operating system files and accumulated logs. Some of it is not worth trying to move. Here is how you might be able to find and delete them.
Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<h2>            Windows 8 time keeps changing randomly</h2>
                    Hello everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am hoping someone can help me out with the issues I am having with my laptop. It is brand new, running Windows 8. Everything works fine except for the clock. The time keeps changing and I am unable to sync with Internet Time. Each time I try to sync
 I get the error message "The peer is unresolved."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I haven't noticed any particular pattern for the way the time keeps changing, except that if I turn it off and turn it back on hours later the time hasn't moved at all from what it was displaying when I turned it off.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have searched and tried many things, including the instructions in this post:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_store/why-windows-store-not-able-to-connect-to-proxy/8c400732-68a1-4875-906a-cae90081dc40">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_store/why-windows-store-not-able-to-connect-to-proxy/8c400732-68a1-4875-906a-cae90081dc40</a>.
 I got the same error message as that user- "no time data is available."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions? Thanks!</div>

    <title>Windows 10 for Sony Vaio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidswindells  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 for Sony Vaio</h2>
                    <p>I have reserved Windows 10 for my Sony Vaio laptop running Windows 8.1. I understand that after 29 July it will download to my machine and I will be given the option to upgrade immediately or do so at a later date.</p>
<p>I have today received a notification from Sony advising me not to upgrade to Windows 10 until the drivers are ready as below</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is offering a free upgrade* to Windows 10.</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>The offer applies for qualified Windows devices which are upgraded during the first year*.</li><li>Sony will not be providing support for all models that qualify for this upgrade.</li></ul>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get the offer details from Microsoft*.</a><br />
<br />
<p>Although Microsoft is offering the Windows 10 upgrade, it is strongly recommended that you wait to install it until the drivers &amp; installation instructions are available for your VAIO PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is do I need to cancel my reservation for Windows 10 completely. Or do I allow it to download in the background and wait until instructed to install it by Sony?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I upgraded my system from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows 10 and till today (almost 2 weeks later) I didn't found any Sony VAIO Driver compliance issue(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you upgrade your system based on my reviews, please go through the following Link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/p/os10upgrade.pl?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sony VAIO - Windows 10 Upgrade</a>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sony VAIO declared to provide Driver Update to Windows 8 and 8.1 by November 2015 and October 2015 respectively.</p>
<p>And there is no date for Windows 7 SP1. So, It becomes a "just wait and watch" kind of thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reviewed my system for any possible issues, I just found that Bluetooth Driver is not working properly...<br />
</p>
<p>Rest other things are working properly.</p>

            I did the same. Didn't want to wait for two months for Sony / Vaio to come up with updated drivers. I have the Sony Flip 15A. Upgraded to windows 10 and found two minor issues. The touch pad does not activate the action center menu when swiping from the
 right or the Task View when swiping from the left and Cortana can not hear through the built-in microphone and I have to put my headset on to talk to her! Otherwise all seems to be good.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to check SONY's support website for your model. Sony has tested most models and you can check if your model is good to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Models with hybrid grafic chips will not survive an upgrate to W10, you will according to SONY end up with a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>Sony sold the VAIO brand but agreed to maintain the special VAIO software. Apparently SONY do not think that this include updating the grafic drivers. They say they will not update the drivers.</p>
<p>Personally I wonder if it is possible to switch the hybrid to the Radeon Grafic and install a radeon driver, ANYBODY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I also get quite angry when I see this notice from Microsoft that my machine is OK for the upgrade when SONY say it is not.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I did not receive any notices from Sony regarding upgrade to Windows 10. I went ahead and performed the upgrade.</p>
<p>As Shivam reported above, I too found the Bluetooth inoperative following the upgrade. Additionally and more seriously however, I also found that the HDMI port no longer functioned.</p>
<p>When I performed the VAIO health test, the video section failed. All other tests passed.</p>
<p>A message followed the test advising me to contact Sony technical support (fee-based) in order to fix the&nbsp;video problem.</p>
<p>In all other respects, the laptop functions just fine. I have to use the VGA port in order to connect an external display now. No more HDMI, sigh.</p>

            <p>hello i have a Sony vaio model vpcf130x, when i did install windows 10 on it the first time a sound glitch happen an unstoppable making me crazy noise, i found a solution with my iPad is a laptop so had battery and unable to shut down my family wanted to
 destroy my laptop or me, found a solution i did some code in the computer it was the software that sends info to Microsoft if something goes wrong with the installation, ironically, i did this, it fixed the problem and so i used windows 10 comfortably for
 some days, until i got notice the huge need for the FN programmed keys for my vaio so it means they don't work on windows 10, that was really annoying but i endured, but i couldn't endure the exhaustion on my computer when is idle the fan sounds crazy like
 is playing a video game with high graphics, it doesn't tells you nothing is practically doing nothing, so i look for information and found out is OK is just the spying you program sending tons of info to Microsoft, and to prove it just switch your computer
 offline with the wireless switch it stops the program and the fan problems, i have nothing to hide, I'm not&nbsp; a developer, i see porn once a month, but overheating my computer like that it is really makes me angry, on all of this time i have reinstalled windows
 10&nbsp; ' 3 times removed all of the spying things but windows just puts them back on, it takes a lot of work windows ten makes it not possible to go back to windows seven an error message appeared but i found a way around proving that windows 7 was still in my
 laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>after all of this i know what to do next, i will install windows 10 again, and use it only for playing video games then switch to Ubuntu in dual boot for doing anything else, Ubuntu allows my fn keys to work, everything works fine but for video games is
 just slowly taking some terrain</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely ill be using Ubuntu on my laptop and going console life with a play-station 4 and the new cool technology play-station vr, Xbox is same thing (Microsoft ****) hopefully windows 11 saves my RTS games not good on consoles, so keep up, anti-piracy
 politics loud and often. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why this? is trump really going to be our president? is like war;&nbsp; remembering history and what this government do to enter a war; i question myself who is really in charge of the country, i believe trump it is just to be a shadow so Clinton wins the elections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Facebook everything, suddenly our world change, perhaps is understandably now terrorism and deadly weapons can be produce anywhere the other side of&nbsp; free education we are preparing for a level 1 civilization (micho haku :))</p>

<p>If you are able to use the apps and W.M.C. that does not necessarily mean that you have a strong connection, I suggest that you check your NAT type and try to change it to open if it isn't already. Open ports for your Xbox 360 and enable UPNP (Universal
 Plug n Play) . All of these instructions can be found at this link step by step and just to say this so everyone knows, this website is an unofficial Xbox Website!</p>

<p>Hi Azeworai,</p>
<p>The error code suggests a corrupted download of the updates. Can you try deleting the contents of C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download? This should be safe. And then try to download and install the updates again.</p>

            Hi, Sin6
<br />
<br />Check your Hard Disk or SSD, with "chkdsk" and you should also check the Ram Memory with "Memtest86", check these links, I hope you can solve the problem.

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran check disk on C: it scans and repairs up to 100% and just stays there, I left it for about 6 hours at 100% and gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I ran memtest86+ and found an issue, going to RMA the RAM now.</p>

            Ok, there you see that you have problems with your Ram Memory, you have to completely scan it and if you have the possibility, change it, because it has damaged sectors.

            Corsair sent me a replacement for the RAM, they only had CML32GX3M4A1600C10 in stock.<br />
I tested it when I received it and it passed memtest86+.<br />
<br />
Today I got another BSOD, the message was "IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL".<br />
This is the minidump and msinfo files:<br />
https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ap0dCeYuaCExgz4ZxFamOoRaHDJy<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.
