<h2>            My Favorates keys don&#39;t work</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 V1.0. On Windows 7, the My Favorites keys worked when I booted the computer for the programs I assigned to them with the keyboard Mouse and Keyboard Center program. When I upgraded to Windows 10, the My Favorites
 keys did not work when the computer booted. I had to open and close the Mouse and Keyboard Center program. The program still had all the My Favorites programs assigned to the keys. I have the current version of the keyboard software installed.
<br />
How do I make the keys be automatically assigned when I boot the computer?<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 Power Plan Information Isn&#39;t Available</h2>
                    I am trying to adjust what happens when I close my laptop lid. I have a Dell Inspirion. When I go into the Power Options menu to adjust this it tells me that my Power Plan Information Isn't Available. I tried running the cmd scannow fix mentioned on another
 Windows forum but it came back free of disk errors...

Hey, now that you reminded me - I did recently install AMD's 13.4 driver but had later uninstalled it due to some other issues. You said that uninstalling solved the issue but it looks like that didn't work for me. I used ATI's own utility for completely removing
 Catalyst and all drivers.&nbsp;

Using the Catalyst uninstaller provided by AMD deletes the power settings. I have yet to resolve how to restore as it doesn't let me create power plan.<br />

            Yes, AMD uninstaller tool is responsible for the loss of power settings. I'm still surfing the net to find out how to resolve this but I haven't found anything yet or the so called procedures to fix it does not work. Please let us know if you already found
 a way to resolve this. Thanks!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I just fix this issue on my laptop. I refreshed my PC without affecting files(option on windows 8). Please refer to the link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a><br />
<br />
This will remove all of the programs/apps you installed and will rollback to the same settings when you first bought your PC. Apparently this is the only solution I found. Hope this helps!<br />
<br />

            Hi Priyank
<br />
<br />That looks like a memory leak, how long was the Photos app open when you noticed it is using 4GB of RAM?
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps and locate the Photos App
<br />
<br />Select that, choose Advanced Options and click Reset
<br />
<br />Then run the Photos App for a while and check to see if it is still eating your RAM over time . . .

<h2>            GFWL - there was an error retrieving your purchase history. please sign out and try again later.</h2>
                    <p>Why has this still not been fixed? it has been more then 1 year since I and other s have NOT had access to the games that we purchased!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is ridiculous that this issue is constantly being ignored. Numerous threads in these forums about this issue have been locked for no reason what so ever. How are we suppose to get support for the issue, if the threads are constantly locked with no resolution
 to this matter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forum posts on this website - <strong>Ignored</strong> (then locked for no reason. Which gives the impression that the issue was solved - which ii has not been solved / fix)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Direct Messages via twitter to Xbox Support - <strong>Ignored</strong> since April 2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>Direct Message via twitter to MS Support - </p>
<p>
</p><p>Tweets to Phil Spencer (Head of Xbox) - <strong>Ignored</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Phone calls to Xbox Supprt - <strong>Useless </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone call to Microsoft Support - <strong>Useless</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in while a moderator will chime in with the same old "The proper teams are looking into this" only to never be heard from again, when asked for an update on a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting tips given by MS support - <strong>Useless and a waste of time as this is not an issue with our pc's it is an issue with the website that is hosting our downloadable games not allowing access. Since the website is
 not allowing access. The GFWL client can not verify our purchases, even though the GFWL client shows all of the games we purchased. Since the client can not verify our purchases we are locked out from downloading any of our games and from even seeing our CD/Licensing
 Keys for the games we purchased.</strong></p>
<p>Now our threads are constantly being locked without solutions to the issue. We were told to keep an eye on our threads for updates from support, yet moderators are constantly locking the threads so no one can reply.
 This is beyond unacceptable it is a disgrace!!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue regarding Games for Windows Live. GFWL is a service that was a predecessor for the Xbox app on PCs and has since become that of the past as we are moving forward with the Xbox app.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding the usage of games purchased under your account, you should be able to play them via the Xbox app on your Windows 10 PC by signing into the Microsoft account that you made the purchase from.
<span>Please be aware that if you have a Win10 device, you will need to use the Xbox app to sign in and play many of the games on your PC as the Games For Windows Live service is no longer available for that operating system version and has been included in
 the Xbox app.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have not updated your system'</span>s OS to windows 10, then I would recommend following the link to download the Games for Windows Live app (for Win7, 8 or 8.1) contained within the support article entitled&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/games-for-windows-live-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Games
 for Windows Live</a> if you haven't already done so. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, if you have not seen this already, I recommend trying the troubleshooting that is available from this Windows Forums thread that I found:
<span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/all/games-for-windows-live-download/c0e934be-02e7-4718-8448-da5620b0e7b7">Games For Windows Live Download
</a>, to see if it will then allow you to proceed. It seems that there are many games that have migrated over to Steam and this can help you recover them as well if needed. There is also a very helpful thread created by one of our Ambassadors that can also
 help you with this situation:&nbsp;</span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 23, 1)"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/games_windows_10/guide-games-for-windows-live-gfwl-steam-windows-10/c2a916de-ac00-485d-bc63-f77a385ef7f6">[Guide]

<p>As we've clearly communicated a number of times, this issue isn't related to one user - the GFWL marketplace service which is supposed to still be up and running to download any&nbsp;<em>previously</em> purchased content is not functioning. It has nothing to
 do with Windows 10 or the Xbox app and is supposed to remain available alongside the Xbox app for content purchased through GFWL. Can you please look into this for us?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06a29cda-f94b-46f4-8a77-82664bc9e436?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06a29cda-f94b-46f4-8a77-82664bc9e436?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Guys - In order to prove this isn't just restricted to one/a number of users it might be worth everyone posting a screenshot of this issue, so we can prove that the service is indeed down at the moment. In addition it's also preventing us from passing any
 "post release date checks" too.<br />

<p>Amber</p>
<p>Thank You for answering, Unfortunately none of the information you provided is going help. Let me try and explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This is not an issue with anyone's PC. Troubleshooting tips WILL NOT work!! This is an issue with the server on Microsoft's end that is storing the games that we paid for. This server is not allowing connections using the GFWL client / app. As you can
 see from the following image. The GFWL Client / App cannot verify my purchase history.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ad259c4-6be7-4d72-a189-80d4bb189e1d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ad259c4-6be7-4d72-a189-80d4bb189e1d?upload=true" /></a>As
 you can see the GFWL Client / App shows the games I have purchased. I should be to download these games and also be able to see the Licensing key that I purchased. As you can also see on the top of the image in RED. The GFWL client / app states "There was
 an error retrieving your purchase history. Please sign out and try again later" You can clearly see my purchase history through the client / app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result of the client / app unable to verify with the server what I have purchased. I am being prevented from downloading any of the games that I have legitimately purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been an issue for over 18 months now!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also received the same error message on numerous machines using Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you see this is not PC or Operating system specific problem. This is a problem on Microsoft's end in that the server that is suppose to allow us to download the games we purchased is refusing any and all connections in order to verify our purchased history.
 Please!! The server needs to be look at and fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just want what we paid for!</p>
<p>

                    I use Firefox as my browser, and Yahoo as my start page.&nbsp; When you initialize a search on Yahoo, you are presented with an array of search engines to choose from (Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ebay, Wikipedia, etc.).&nbsp; Website-specific searches for Wikipedia and
 Ebay work fine, but the only general search engine that works is Google.&nbsp; Additionally, If you click on one of the "Trending Now" links, which use Yahoo's engine, the connection isn't made and eventually times out.&nbsp; Obviously, Google is doing something to
 block its competitors.&nbsp; How do you tell Google to f*****ff and stop being a bully?&nbsp; I removed Google from the array, but that doesn't have any effect.

            <p>Google isn't doing anything to block or prevent other search engines from working properly.&nbsp; If other engines don't work then your Firefox search settings are not properly set or you have unwanted BHO (Browser Helper Object) or other such pests.&nbsp; I suggest
 you run an <a href="https://toolslib.net/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>AdwCleaner</strong></a> scan on your machine and see if it finds any pests.</p>

    <title>Why does Microsoft want to charge me to do another adult - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcmonroe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Microsoft want to charge me to do another adult verification&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a family account set up under xbox-live, where I have my three children each with their own sub-account (under my own adult account) with the corresponding windows-live accounts, as required by xbox-live.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This account has been open and active for just about a year. I completed the adult verification process when the accounts were set up and up until yesterday there has been no problems with their access and use of xbox-live and windows-live. Yesterday,
 when I or my children go in to access xbox-live or windows-live there is a message that says that the accounts must be verified to make sure that there is an adult that is giving them access…<span>&nbsp;
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I do not have an issue with verifying that I am an adult and that I am my children’s parent and am granting permission to access and use xbox-live and windows-live services.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, what I do object to is that part of the process states that if I do not allow windows-live (or whichever Microsoft entity it is) to charge my credit card another $0.50.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I called xbox-live support and they said that there is nothing that they can do because under the xbox-live terms of service there must be an active windows live account, so I have to comply with whatever windows live says or whatever charges windows-live
 chooses to impose to use it.<span>&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I have looked at these forums and Microsoft’s to answers and statements in reference inquiries regarding the imposition of the required charge to a credit card as part of the adult verification process.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Microsoft states in numerous locations that under COPPA it is required to charge a fee to a credit card for age verification.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I have just read the COPPA and Microsoft’s statement that it is required to charge a fee to a credit card for age verification is not exactly true.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The COPPA states that operators may institute a number of different methods for age verification.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in COPPA that "requires" Microsoft (or any operator) to place a charge on a credit card to verify adulthood.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To cite directly from the COPPA: </p>
<p><b>§ 312.5 Parental consent.</b></p>
<p>(a) <i>General requirements. </i>(1) An operator is required to obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal information from children, including consent to any material change in the collection,
 use, and/or disclosure practices to which the parent has previously consented. (2) An operator must give the parent the option to consent to the collection and use of the child’s personal information without consenting to disclosure of his or her personal
 information to third parties. </p>
<p>(b) <i>Mechanisms for verifiable parental consent. </i>(1) An operator must make reasonable efforts to obtain verifiable parental consent, taking into consideration available technology. Any method to obtain verifiable parental consent
 must be reasonably calculated, in light of available technology, to ensure that the person providing consent is the child’s parent. (2) Methods to obtain verifiable parental consent that satisfy the requirements of this paragraph include: providing a consent
 form to be signed by the parent and returned to the operator by postal mail or facsimile; requiring a parent to use a credit card in connection with a transaction; having a parent call a toll-free telephone number staffed by trained personnel; using a digital
 certificate that uses public key technology; and using e-mail accompanied by a PIN or password obtained through one of the verification methods listed in this paragraph.”</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The COPPA clearly gives Microsoft the option of doing any of the above methods.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, they appear to be choosing to only use one of them.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would not be making an issue of this if I did not already complete the age verification process for my children’s accounts (or else Microsoft has been in violation of the COPPA for almost a year now) and know that there are other
 ways that windows live can verify that I am an adult without charging my credit card.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I have gone through the age verification process previously, I have completed transactions with my credit card on my account since the time I set up my children’s accounts and maintain my adult email with a password protection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These acts have and continue to satisfy Microsoft’s duties to ensure adult verification as required by the statute and make Microsoft’s decision to force me to make an additional credit card transaction is unnecessary under the COPPA.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Microsoft’s decision to disable my children’s accounts, knowing full well that will (or would be likely to) cause my children, my wife and I great frustration and mental anguish and time, until I pay them additional, and not required, fees to use a service
 which I have paid for and am in compliance with the terms of use of, feels like (and may actually be) extortion, and is at the least a violation of their own terms of service which state that there will not be additional charges for service during the term
 of the service previously paid for, no matter how nominal that fee may be.<span>&nbsp;
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Please let me know how I can have my children's accounts made useable again without having to submit additional costs or fees.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please understand that as long as this continues it is causing my family extreme aggravation and mental anguish; but, I should not have to submit to paying additional fees when I am in compliance with the terms of use and Microsoft has no duty to require
 additional verification under the COCCA.</p>

            I find your response to be predictable, although very disappointing, as it now closes the circle of passing the buck.&nbsp; As I stated I have already spoken to several xbox live representatives and the last one made it very clear that they are either unable
 or unwilling to resolve this issue.&nbsp; She indicated that the issues was with windows live, as they (you) are the ones that do the age verification.&nbsp; This appears to be true as the verification process directs me to a windows live site not a xbox live site.&nbsp;
 She directed me to the windows live account site to submit my questions, which I did.&nbsp; The following is their responses. (italics added)<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;why must i submit to being charged when i attempt to verify my sons xboxlivefamly account. &nbsp;you have already verified that i am an adult under my account under m*****@*******.com and I have previously made purchases with my credit card on my account. &nbsp;the
 user agreement states that i must provide information such as an alternate email address or phone number for account proofs but it does not say that you have the right to charge me. &nbsp;I have already paid for the use of the xboxlivefamily account and under the
 terms of use can not be charged again until the expiration of the contacted time period. &nbsp;I feel that I am being extorted by microsoft to either pay these fees which are not in the terms of use or loose access to the services which I have already paid for.
 &nbsp;Please let me know how I can comply with your verification process without being forced to pay additional funds to use the services I have already paid for.</i><br />
<br />
As you can see I first contacted xbox live, who directed me to windows live account support who directed me to you and now you are directing me back to xbox live.&nbsp; Where does this circle end?<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who can actually answer my question or provide support?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am not having problems setting up my children's accounts, it is that Microsoft is now demanding more money for me to use the services I have already paid for claiming I need to do age verification that i have already done.&nbsp; Surely there is someone at one
 of these companies that can resolve this issue.&nbsp; Or is it that none of you are either able or willing to do so?<br />

            Yes I have seen that link. <br />
<br />
As I pointed out in my post above, the link you provided has a statement from Microsoft that:<br />
<br />
"To verify that an adult is giving a child permission to create a new <span>
Windows Live</span> account, COPPA requires that a small amount be charged to the adult's credit card. We charge 50&nbsp;cents for this verification. These charges aren't refundable."<br />
<br />
<b>MICROSOFT'S STATEMENT REGARDING COPPA IS&nbsp; UNTRUE<br />
<br />
</b>1) Under COPPA Microsoft has the option to perform an age verification in other ways which do not require the verifier to have a credit card or pay any fees.<br />
2) While COPPA does allow the use of a credit card for a valid transaction as a valid form of age verification, it does not require said transaction to be separate or independent from any other valid credit card purchase.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Therefore, because I have made the requisite credit card transaction when I first set up their accounts, not to mention multiple purchases on my account with my credit card since that time, for the purposes of COPPA, I have been age verified at least once if
 not many times.&nbsp; Thus Microsoft has no need to charge me to "age verify" my account
<u>again</u>.<br />
<br />
According to this link: <br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/liveid-signin/how-do-i-change-the-dob-for-a-child-account/9e202b21-8b9a-4ed2-92d4-2014a2dbe0ea&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Microsoft used to accept other methods of age verification.&nbsp; However when I tried to fax the requsted infromation I get a message that the number has been disconnected.&nbsp; I have not heard back regarding the postal method.<br />
<br />
I strongly object to being forced to pay for something twice.&nbsp; What makes me even more upset is when a company tries to justify their position by making false statements.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Microsoft has made it abundantly clear (by denying me the ability to use my contracted and paid for services) that they want me to give them my credit card number and pay them a fee for doing so.<br />
<br />
But, what legal right does Microsoft have to deny me the service for which I have already contract for, paid for and age verified, unless I submit to these addition fees?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The answer Microsoft gives (the link you included) is a false statement .&nbsp; They are not required to take my credit card number nor are they required to charge me to verify my age. &nbsp;

            &nbsp; You still ignore the issue. 1st COPPA does not require you charge. This is a decision that was left up to Microsoft. This means it was a Microsoft decision. Also the reason I am back here again is because after everything was already set up. I get a
 notification that I have to verify my sons account again. In other words I had to go all the way back and verify AGAIN that I was an adult. Like I would all of a sudden get younger since the last time I did this. I am not buying the new console, and I am not
 going to renew Xbox live. I am done with the willful ignorance of the company and the people who are suppose to be considered support. You answer the same question over and over with the information we have already read. You have been told that the COPPA claim
 doesn't hold water and yet your answer is not to address anything, but to put another link to the same invalid info. Sorry but I'm done with you guys, and I will not be encouraging the rest of my gaming community to support you any longer either.<br />

<p>
</p><p>If you did not see the option to cancel your subscription on your Skype page, there is a possibility that you may have signed in to a different Skype account.
<strong>You need to check if you sign in using your Skype name (username) instead of your email address</strong>. If you were auto-sign in when you access the Skype website, kindly sign it out and sign back in with your username. You should then be able to
 see your subscription that you want to cancel. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are certain concerns/issues on Skype that being routed to the appropriate support page or support team. Your concern can be found on the FAQ/help page, however, the steps on the help&nbsp;page are not the problem on why you can't cancel the subscription,
 but the details you sign in to the website. Because if you are in a different account, surely you wont see the subscription you are looking for.

    <title>Issue while upgrading hard drive from HDD to SSD on ASUS laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue while upgrading hard drive from HDD to SSD on ASUS laptop</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title:</strong> Change HDD for SDD on a pre-installed Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just bought an asus laptop with a pre-installed version of windows 8.1. I wanted to change the HDD for the SSD of my previous laptop, which had Windows 8.1 too. But when I did so, the computer was not even booting (no "Asus" screen), it was bringing
 me to the BIOS menu directly and I would not see my SSD in the boot options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this SSD had a valid Windows 8.1 on it because... it still works on my old laptop! I have tried on a desktop computer too, it booted!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a kind of protection that comes with pre-installed windows now? There must be a way to change your HDD for an SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Welcome to Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The primary difference between SSDs and HDDs is moving parts; SSDs have none. An HDD is a mechanical device with spinning platters and read/write heads moving over them, sort of like
 a record player. The heads must move over the appropriate area of the platter while they’re spinning to access data. The platters might have to spin around a few times in order for the
</span></p>
<p><span>read/write heads to access all the data.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>An SSD on the other hand is one big piece of flash i.e. solid state memory. Data access is instant no waiting for platters to spin around.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on my research I can explain that it is very important to know whether your bios support SSD.
</span><span>A Basic Input/output System (<span>BIOS</span>) is an electronic set of instructions that a Personal Computer (PC) uses to successfully start up. It is located on a chip on the motherboard
 inside of a computer and is designed to be protected from disk failure. One of the very important task of the Bios is called POST (Power-On Self-Test) this is a screen where Bios will ensure all the hardware components are functioning correctly. To answer
 your question there is no windows 8.1 security involved in this process since the computer has to pass the POST successfully and that’s when windows will start to load.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the following question.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the model of the computer?</span></li><li><span>When you plug in your HDD back are you able to boot the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to update your bios and check if you are able to change the hard drive.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: </span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, follow method 2.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the complete response!</p>
<p>1) It's an ASUS-N56JN-EB71</p>
<p>2) Yes, it worked without any issue when I plugged the HDD back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've successfully flashed the BIOS for version 203, but I am still not able to boot with the SSD. I'll write to Asus and see then... Thanks!</p>

<p>What is your PC/laptop make, model and reference number ? Then you can be shown where to download drivers for installation.</p>
<p>Is this a recent problem or long time ? If recent, have you tried a system restore to before the problem started ? What is the exact error message ?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I to am suffering from this fault. In my case File Explorer doesn't shut down the moment I open it, but it invariably after just a few file operations; moving, deleting etc., and it seems especially when copying or beginning to perform a copy procedure.
 No warnings, no error message, File Explorer is suddenly just gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed all the "Methods" described by the support Engineer; no errors were found, but the problem persists. I created a new user account, which for a few moments appeared to be more resilient, before File Explorer inevitably collapsed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this situation only for several days, approximately since the last update (Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3140741)), was installed on the 23rd March.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance gratefully received.</p>
<p>

<p>That doesn't break anything. All it does is eliminate 3rd party shell extensions. Thanks for your sarcastic response, BTW.</p>

            <p>Don't get all "holier than thou" on me Ramesh, your response was sarcastic in itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in any event following the advice you recommended DID break my computer. Refusing to boot constitutes "being broken" I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course it might be the instructions in the "Troubleshoot Windows By Performing a Clean Boot" not being clear. I suspect I may have come unstuck where it says "
#4 Disable 3rd Party Services. Click the Services tab, and uncheck all the 3rd party services listed. Important: The Services tab doesn’t list the "drivers". To disable 3rd party drivers, click the Drivers tab."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I unchecked ALL the entries in the Drivers list. I thought at the time maybe that was a step too far, but I was only obeying instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was on that reboot the machine failed to initialise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe those instructions need clarifying.</p>

            BryanCx, I write guides to help not to cause damage. On that occasion, I certainly did not mean to disable all drivers and that was probably the reason I didn't include it as Step #5 or so. But it was a vague explanation in the blog. May be I need to slow
 down for some time, and come back.

<br />
&nbsp;OS is Windows XP Home Edition Version 2002 SP3.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Windows Media player 11 won't play .AVI files. I have<br />
&nbsp;downloaded the latest codecs but I get the message:<br />

&nbsp;"Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player<br />

&nbsp;This is a file I downloaded using Vuze. It's called a<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Media player works on all youtube files.<br />

No guarantees...but it may be worth a try to install a codec pack;</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always best if you create a System Restore<br />
point before installing any software or updates.)<br />

Are you saying VLC couldn't play the .avi file?</p>
<p>Apparently the .avi file in question is corrupted.</p>

<p>I'm running XP Professional SP3 and, according to the MS WMP download center, I have all the latest codecs for WMP 11.&nbsp; Yet I have *never, ever* been able to get a .avi file to play; I always get the same error message John quoted above.&nbsp; (I had the identical
 problem with previous versions of WMP.)&nbsp; These&nbsp;.avi files have come from a variety of different sources, all of them strictly legitimate and reliable, so it also seems unlikely&nbsp;*all* of the .avi files could be corrupted.&nbsp; Considering the prevalence of this
 problem, it also seems unlikely that the cause would always be that they're using a "new" .avi variant that WMP hasn't caught up with yet.</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; I have this problem on *2 separate computers* (different models with different processors, but both are Intel), so it also seems extremely unlikely this is a problem caused by an individual computer/processor or by a corrupted download of WMP updates.</p>
<p>Judging by the WMP download center, Microsoft's official position seems to be basically that&nbsp;WMP with all relevant updates&nbsp;should play any&nbsp;(uncorrupted) .avi file.&nbsp;It's very frustrating -- indeed, it's absolutely ludicrous -- that the suggested solutions
 to this problem are to use *non-Microsoft* software!&nbsp; I'm definitely not a software or systems guy, but it's my understanding the Microsoft originated the .avi format. So doesn't it seem ironic, to say the least, that a freeware program like VLC can play a
 .avi file, why can't WMP?</p>
<p>FWIW, my Mac friends almost never have this problem -- which just reinforces their sense of superiority about Mac over Windows.</p>

VLC is a good alternative...it plays just about anything.</p>
<p>.AVI is just a wrapper...there are hundreds of types of .AVI files...</p>
<p>If you download GSpot and drag/drop the .avi file on it...you<br />
can find out which codec you need to play it.</p>

            <p>I posted my question on the Tech Net forum but they gave no more insight into this issue than you did. &nbsp;They did suggest a resolution but I want to have some basic understanding of the problem before making changes in the Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the TechNet forum said that I should ask the question here. &nbsp;I really don't understand how we are supposed to figure out where to post questions when the people running the forums don't seem to agree on the criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like as clear an answer as possible to these questions: &nbsp;My understanding from reading elsewhere talks about COM and DCOM as related to clients and servers. &nbsp; It sounds like these can be on the same computer. &nbsp;Is that correct? &nbsp;Or does their use
 require a network? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not part of a network and would like to understand if there could be something nefarious going on. &nbsp;I doubt there is but just want to make sure.</p>

            <p>I am having the same error and lack of understanding regarding registry's... I upgraded to WIN 10 and I have gotten this and numerous other errors for about 2 weeks now. None of them make any sense to me and the pc will turn off or freeze whenever it feels
 like it. Must do more research!</p>

            <p>I assume your user name is Anastasia? I have a similar error condition with this application and Cortana. In your case with the FeatureOnDemand.InsiderHub.... application. You can run dcomcnfg.exe and drill down to the Immersion Shell which is the app here
 that's mad at you. The error is telling you to right click on the immersion shell application and set the launch, permissions, and configuration to custom and make sure Anastasia is added along with the other users like the system, administrators, etc. are.
 &nbsp;Give your user Local and Remote permissions.<br />
<br />
If you can't access this in edit mode you'll probably need to use regedit to search for {316CDED5-E4AE-4B15-9113-7055D84DCC97} and add full control permissions*&nbsp;to user Anastasia so you can make changes with the dcomcnfg app. I don't think you need to change
 the permissions for the CSLID. But that may be another thing to try. <br />
<br />
This did not eliminate my 10016 Cortana/Immersion Shell errors but it did greatly reduce them. In my case the errors seem benign, just irritating to have about 400 errors per day. Now I only get about 20-40.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*This can get a little complex, to edit the permissions on the app in regedit, &nbsp;I had to take ownership from Trusted Installer. You can give it back with NT SERVICE\TRUSTEDINSTALLER.

            <p>COM and DCOM are normal&nbsp;components of any windows operating system and in most cases for most users, are never used for any computer other than the Host.&nbsp; You are correct in that many of these items can be remote launched.</p>

            Also, if my suggestion doesn't help you. There is a Windows Update Fix Tool for W10 on the network someplace.
<br />
<br />
Also it might work to turn off insider updates within Windows Update. It looks like that service is what's erring with the Immersion Shell.

<h2>            Cannot find a download site for the Microsoft ehome mcir 109 keyboard</h2>
                    Hi, I've installed XP Pro on my Acer Aspire notebook 7520G. All works fine, except the keyboard. For some reason, it uses the standard HID drivers. I've checked a friend's computer (the exact same type bought the exact same place) and the driver I'm looking
 for is the Microsoft ehome mcir 109 keyboard. The problem is that all google-results link to the microsoft download site, where I cannot find anything. I'd be really really glad if anyone could help me with getting the drivers for the Microsoft ehome mcir
 109 keyboard. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Edited addition: This is a laptop keyboard with a keypad on it. That is the reason for me troubeling so much for this driver. Half the reason for me buying this exact computer is the keypad. Help apreciated!

            The driver appears to be here:<br />
<a href="http://www.soft32.com/download_181360.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.soft32.com/download_181360.html</a><br />
<br />
Take all the usual precautions regarding up-dated anti-virus signatures, malware detectors and firewall protection before surfing and downloading. Do so at your own risk. I cannot endorse the site nor assure you it is risk free. Google or BING for 'ehome mcir
 109keyboard' without quotes to locate alternative sites.<br />

            If you check the download links, they lead you right to http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productlist.aspx?type=Keyboard<br />
I cannot find the drivers at Microsoft's, I've spent hours and hours on googling after them, all sites I find leads to that microsoft page

            <p>Creating desktop shortcuts works the same as it did in Win7.&nbsp;Open File Explorer from the desktop. Locate the .exe file&nbsp;of the program you want on the desktop. Drag and drop the file from File Explorer to&nbsp;the desktop and choose 'Create shortcuts here'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
