            Hi vasilisnikolo
<br />
<br />The functionality you describe in G Drive is also in OneDrive, is is called Files-On-Demand
<br />
<br />With that feature in OneDrive, your files are stored on the Cloud, then when you open a file, it is downloaded, you edit the document and that is then reflected in the file stored on OneDrive . . .
<br />
<br />A full explanation of Files-On-Demand and how to set that up can be found on this link . .

<h2>            Primary Alias is Wrong</h2>
                    The Primary Alias for one of my Skype accounts is wrong and I need to change it so I can access that account again. I can login to the website and have updated my e-mail addresses but the primary alias has a .com address when it should be .org so I can't
 receive the verification code.

<p>Hi Everett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be asked to verify your primary alias when you originally set your account up. You can't change your primary alias unless you can verify the primary email address set on your account.
</p>
<p>
As a suggestion, it would be best to&nbsp;get in touch with&nbsp;the Microsoft account support via this

<h2>            Unable to wake computer with key stroke or mouse</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Home Preium on a Dell Inspiron desk top.&nbsp; Over the last month or so, the computer takes an exceedingly long time to wake up -- as in 15 minutes!&nbsp; I have tried to change the power settings, and have even set the computer to never sleep.&nbsp;
 Still no change.&nbsp; I had a virus removal done on it, and there is still no change in waking the computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it is especially noticeable the first thing in the morning, after the computer not being used for a couple of hours, the problem is the same.&nbsp; The most effective way of getting the computer to wake is to shut it down completely, although this does
 not consistently solve the problem.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>
</p><p>My computer is claiming there is no wifi networks to connect to when I have been connect to the one that is in my house for awhile now obviously. All my other devices are connected fine and I have tried restarting the computer and I have also tried returning
 to the pc to the previous version simply because I had updated it this morning. Obviously nothing has worked so far and I am wondering if anyone has a solution because I haven't come across one on the internet that has worked yet.</p>

<p>Had a similar problem here, drove me crazy occasionally.&nbsp; Had an additional microsoft wifi adapter it apparently was trying to exclusively use for microsofts pay connections. &nbsp; Problem went away when I disabled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Control Panel\Network and Sharing Center\Change Adapter Settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it shows an additional wifi adapter connection, might try right clicking and disabling it.</p>

<h2>            COD &#58; Ghosts freeze &#47; lockup &#47; crash in menu</h2>
                    
<p>The game will lockup either in the menu or loading screen. If I am able to get into a multiplayer map then I am able to play just fine, I have
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NEVER</strong></span> had my machine lockup while in a match, that goes for xbox live matches, extinction, and&nbsp;private matches</p>
<p>If&nbsp;I&nbsp;group up with friends my xbox will 99% of the time lockup in the game lobby moments before the match loads. However I have had plenty of success joining their already started games and then staying in that lobby with no troubles (other than not being
 on their team... they don't like that).</p>
<p>GTA 5 and BF4 work perfectly</p>
<p>Steps that I've tried:</p>
<p>(Pre-troubleshooting: I&nbsp;followed the Xbox Screen Freeze Solution)</p>
<ol>
<li>Different copy of COD: Ghosts </li><li>Cleared cache </li><li>installed disk to HD </li><li>Installed disk to USB drive </li><li>Delete profile </li><li>Reset network settings </li><li>Delete installation / profiles </li></ol>
<p>I believe my xbox is 2 generation / Falcon MB</p>
<p>Has anyone else had these issues?</p>

<p>Hi Bacardi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Just to confirm, this only happens when you are in a party, playing COD Ghosts?
</strong>If so, this is quite odd.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Do you have any accessories plugged in? Also, if there are other consoles on the same network, do those work fine?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</strong>Let us know, and we can work from there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>@Mister Ohnaka - It only happens in COD Ghosts. Lockups happen often but is almost certain when joining a game party, it happens if I invite someone to play or they invite me, doesn't seem to be affected by the XBL Party Chat.</p>
<p>I have one other Xbox on the same network that works just fine. It is a more recent version (black console)</p>

<p>Ok, weird.. <strong>On the effected console, are there any other profiles on it we can test this on?</strong> If it works on another profile on the same console, this will help us isolate the issue to either the console, or the profile.<br />

<p>Hey Bacardi,<br />
<br />
<span>Sorry to hear about what is going on. I may have a suggestion that you might not have tried. I think you are experiencing a NAT issue. Here is the
</span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a><span>for you to follow. The symptoms are pointing in that direction, or at least I think they are. I think its worth a shot since you have tried other steps with no avail.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Please reach back and let us know what you find.</span></p>

    <title>Gamertag Hacked. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sassy vagabond  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag Hacked.</h2>
                    
<p>So roughly 6 months ago my xbox live account was hacked/high-jacked and my gamertag stolen.</p>
<p>Since then, I've repeatedly called mircosoft/xbox live support. As of today, NOTHING has been done to sole my problem.</p>
<p>I've talked to a multitude of different reps, each trying different things to solve my problem before whisking my service ticket away to their mythical "tech" department. (Which is bound by magical principals and has no contact number)</p>
<p>I've sat on the phone with several reps that have been incredibly helpful, we've found a dummy account linked to my own gamertag that mirrors everything including credit card information whenever it's updated or re-entered. But each time, after we've sat
 down and looked it over, my ticket is then sent "upstairs" and I'm promised a call back; which is never placed. I have yet to get a single call back from anyone at xbox in the entire 6 months this thing has been going on.</p>
<p>This shows a horrible lack of principal, and a blatant disregard for your customers.</p>
<p>Honestly I've lost all hope in ever attaining my old gamertag, and all I'd truly want now is to gain access to my download history and be able to redownload all the arcade games/game updates and map packs that I've bought over the years...</p>
<p>I'm on here hoping to find someone else that's maybe gone through something similar and has been able to get microsoft to listen, and take action.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>Ridiculous, worst, most horrible customer service of all time.</p>
<p>Just got off the phone with xbox again for the millionth time, only to have them tell me FINALLY that there is NOTHING they can do.</p>
<p>So I ask them to allow me to re-download my arcade games onto my new gamer profile only to be told no.</p>
<p>Sorry, nothing we can do.</p>
<p>Which is a complete lie, as I've been gifted microsoft points before to attempt a gamertag change to fix the problem.</p>
<p>All in all the absolute worst experience I've ever had with a company.</p>
<p>Shady, and down right rude.</p>

<p>It wasn't through any phishing site.</p>
<p>It may have been through the Bungie.net breach that happened a few months back. (Seeing as that's the only site other xbox.com that I've ever logged into.)</p>
<p>The reason a license transfer won't work, is that whenever I recover my account it recovers a blank dummy account instead of my own. So it doesn't even have license over the content I've downloaded.</p>
<p>That being said, I don't think it's too much to ask (since I'll never, ever get my old account back) that I atleast be able to re-download my content that I PAID for...

<p>My Account has gotten hacked in the last week, I was able to get it back with quick thinking, I got home from school, saw that it was no longer on my hard drive, I was able to get it back because he did not change the password nor email account so was able
 to get it back and change everything. I then contacted xbox live and told them what had happened and that I have credit card details on it and it turns out he spend 100 dollars on Halo:Reach Map packs.. After I was helped, I was told that it was going to be
 going under investigation by "Escalation" or something like that, since it's only been a small time since I was told Im still wondering if anything is going to happen and if I will get a refund. The Reason I can not get a Refund easy is because He bought stuff
 with the 6000 microsoft points which makes it nonrefundable. So yea. </p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion Amrita.&nbsp; The setting to apply Windows key comibnations on the remote computer was already in place.&nbsp; That was the first thing I checked when troubleshooting, so this is not the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the problem may be because I've read that for some odd reason the Windows 7 keyboard shortcuts are dependent upon Aero being enabled?&nbsp; This seems ridiculous.&nbsp; If this is true, is there a way to enable Aero via remote desktop from Vista Home basic?&nbsp;
 I'm not thrilled about having to do this even if it's possible, as my remote desktop is usually over a slow network connection.</p>
<p>I assume this problem should be readily reproducible by Microsoft staff.&nbsp; I assume this is a defect in Remote Destkop?</p>

<h2>            windows 10 tablet mode language change</h2>
                    I am finding that within windows 10 tablet mode, apps are labeled in either english or german. It is about 25% german and of course the tabs I use most are in german. I have been unsuccessful in finding a way to change it. Is there any ideas on how I can
 change over to all english?&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
-&nbsp; Did you make any changes to your computer after which the issue started?<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you to follow these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check if you are able to open it in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are able to start Intel graphics properties in safe mode, I suspect there is a third party software conflict causing the issue to occur, hence, I'd have you put your computer in a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a> state.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Perform <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SFC scan</a> and check if the issue is related to system file integrity.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may also test the issue in a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new user account</a>.<br />

            This issue happened before so I decided to reformat my laptop. At first the problem is gone but when I installed the drivers for my laptop and restarted, it happened again. Not only the graphics properties but almost all HP and Intel applications won't
 open. I always have this CLR20r3 error.&nbsp;<br />
I don't know what caused this error. So I decided to download and install all the updates in Windows but the problem still persists.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I tried all the steps you suggested but none have solved this issue. Is this related to the .net framework 3.5? Maybe I have a corrupted version, but I doubt that.<br />

<h2>            Windows goes to sleep if you leave it idle for a minute.</h2>
                    <p>Originla thread: Sleep - WIndows 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After upgrading from Windows 7 I notices that Windows 8 sleeps but ignores activity. The computer goes to sleep if I let it go idle for a minute after using it for a period longer than scheduled idle sleep time.&nbsp; I have it set to 1 hour, I can use my computer
 for an hour, however, if I stop using it for 1 minute after the hour of use it will go to sleep. Window 8 is frustrating.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to disable the sleep feature. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas about Windows 8 sleep issues?</p>

<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>It's not a matter of configuration, it is apparently ignoring the activity on the computer. If I set it to sleep in one hour it will go to sleep in within a minute after I stop using it after the hour has pasted. There is no reset on the timer for activity.
 It will hold the sleep mode however, as long as I keep working without stopping for a minute.</p>

<p>Try creating a new power plan and use that one, I've seen other users solve the problem that way.

It doesn't make any difference - if you wake from sleep by lifting the cover, or pressing the power button, the computer will go into sleep within 2 minutes or less of being idle (settings 5,10,30)<br />

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

<p><span>Also you may try to boot the computer in clean boot state and try to install updates.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To perform a clean boot on a computer that is running Windows 7: <br />

4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, run Windows Updates and install the available updates.<br />
Note: Make a note of all the updates those were installed. You can do this by reviewing the update history from Windows Updates website, by opening it from the control panel.<br />
<br />
If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot and then installing the updates, access the link below and see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual”.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />

<p><span>You may also try to download the standalone version of the update to your desktop and try to install it manually. To download the standalone version
 of windows updates follow the steps below:<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
1. Make a note of the update with the KB no when your computer try to update and install it.<br />

<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have mentioned that <strong>“Jaybird Bluebuds X incompatible with Windows 10”
</strong>few devices might<strong> </strong>not be compatible with Windows 10 because the drivers should be compatible with Windows 10, those drivers are released by manufacturers, so I suggest<strong>
</strong>you to contact the manufacturer for further support and check whether any updates or drivers are available for this device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

    <title>How to import WLM folders from backup - but where are they&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akphoneguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to import WLM folders from backup - but where are they&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Bad news my C drive crashed. &nbsp;Good news it was backed up in the Cloud. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup was not a mirror image of C drive so now many folders downloaded to my new hard drive.</p>
<p>So, I have to find the many folders that existed in WLM before the crash and import them. &nbsp;This is somewhat confounded by multiple logons previously.</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>logon</strong>&nbsp;</em><strong>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows
 Live Mail</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Using the above info (on the web - but not readily found on Microsoft support) I have found many of the folders (hopefully full of data) that were under the storage category.</p>
<p>But, don't see the multiple folders that were under the higher level (Inbox, Outbox, Sent, and some I created and kept at that level.</p>
<p>What file extension would the folders have (and will they be visible - not hidden). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Where would my Inbox be (is it named Inbox) or <em>maybe&nbsp;</em>it has my emailaddress for its name???</p>
<p>and just to make it harder: when I have pointed WLM to one of these folders I get the file is in use by another program. &nbsp;I've made some attempt to recreate the folders in WLM, but there didn't seem to be the 'magic' cure that other users had - but I think
 that is when WLM 'forgot' their folders, not when try to import them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the import function does find the folder, is there an opportunity to tell it (or create) the import into folder. &nbsp;some of my folders in the backed up storage show truncated file names end in 3 alpha numeric, so if its critical to name it exactly the
 same thing - and there is some computer 'lingo' going on that's going to be a bit difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated!+</p>

            <p>First thing to note: the import wizard only imports <em>folders</em>, not individual
<em>files</em>. You should point the wizard at a folder containing folders, not files,&nbsp;e.g. the store folder itself (the one called
<em>Windows Live Mail</em>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each account has a unique name, by default <em>Domain (user)</em>,&nbsp;but because it can't be longer than 15 characters, the account folder might be truncated to something like
<em>Domain (use ab1 </em>where the last three characters are randomly selected. It's inside an account folder that you'll find the account folders like
<em>Inbox</em>. A folder named with an email address only contains the account settings, not messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll find some tips for a successful import in this article: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/wiki/livemail-files/export-and-import-messages/97e1f967-6ea7-4aac-94c9-e95ea8e740c3">

            <p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an import from the identities rather than the subfolders (two email accounts on the original WLM). &nbsp;Before my original inquiry I think I was grabbing folders - not files - trying to do the same but getting the 'busy' message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple problems showed up:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The folders were imported under Storage Folders under a folder labeled Imported Files (I think). &nbsp;Might have been helpful to know this; it wasn't readily apparent.</p>
<p>I had no problem just grabbing flolders and moving them out of the imported Files folder to be under Storage Folders. &nbsp;However, WLM would let me move folder under my account name (i.e. Where Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc were located. &nbsp;The only way I found to
 do this was to grab all the files (i.e. emails) and drag to the Inbox, Drafts, Sent etc or to a folder I had created there. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">That seems ridiculous that the functionality exists under Storage Folders but not under the
 email account level</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;For reasons I don't understand something about the import process has duplicated the two email accounts (i.e. they each show up twice.) &nbsp;I'm thinking that I should not have put in the account info until after the import. &nbsp;I haven't &nbsp;entered passwords
 etc in the duplicate accounts but I believe I'm getting an error message because it is attempting to go to the servers for those accounts. &nbsp;I'd like to make them 'go away' but as they duplicate the other accounts I'm apprehensive about deleting them and discovering
 then that I'm back at ground zero with everything deleted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;A minor functionality issue: &nbsp;When I was re-creating folders under the email account I entered a name slightly differently than I ultimately wanted it. &nbsp;i.e. like Inbox 2014. &nbsp;Then I was entering other folder names i.e. InBox-2013. &nbsp;When I went back
 and changed the name (for consistency) it did not resort alpha. &nbsp;I had to create a new folder with the correct name and move the files/emails to the new folder and then delete the badly alpha sorted folder. &nbsp;Doesn't seem to this non geek too difficult to re-sort
 a renamed folder when renamed and/or to have the ability to have a utility which will move folders up or down in a sequence to the position one wants. &nbsp;For lack of that functionality I have folders named z-peanut, zz peanut etc to get them to sort to the bottom
 of the list. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what its worth I didn't find the article that you linked to be very helpful. &nbsp;Its an easy set of instructions if one&nbsp;<strong><em>plans
</em></strong>on backing up WLM, deleting the program, and reinstalling and reloading the backed up folders. &nbsp;But, it doesn't
<em>really </em>cover the territory such as revealing that folders existent under the email account (as opposed to storage) won't drag and drop, or the question of not setting up the accounts before importing the backup etc. &nbsp;Even for someone planning an export
 and import a few cautions might give them pause or at least have them fully informed. &nbsp;FWIW: It might be worth reminding people about the repair function for WindowsLive - as this could be an alternative to deleting and reloading WLM and far less painful.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>And</em>, as in my case, the backup WLM folders were buried deeply in backup files, the article also doesn't talk about the file string to find the WLM folders. &nbsp;such as: &nbsp;<strong>C:\Users\</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>logon</strong>&nbsp;</em><strong>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows
 Live Mail</strong><span>,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even though my backup to my crash had the WLM backup deeper than this - &nbsp;this gave me enough info to find the WLM folders.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your detailed, thoughtful comments.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I think I was grabbing folders - not files -&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but they must be folders containing <em>folders</em>, not containing <em>
files</em>. That's the difference.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>1. &nbsp;The folders were imported under Storage Folders under a folder labeled Imported Files (I think). &nbsp;Might have been helpful to know this; it wasn't readily apparent.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read this at the end of the wiki article: &nbsp;"<em>The imported folders will be in a folder called
</em>Imported folder<em> under </em>Storage folders<em>."</em></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>WLM would let me move folder under my account name&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you mean <em>wouldn't.</em> This limitation is a general one (not specific to the import function), so that's why it isn't mentioned in the article. Many people are content to leave imported messages in Storage folders where they end up.
<br />
<br />
There is also a good reason to leave archived messages&nbsp;in Storage folders&nbsp;rather than under an account. Removing an account removes all the account folders and permanently deletes their contents. This has often happened accidentally, and it's also different
 behaviour from that exhibited by other programs (e.g. Outlook Express) that don't store messages as individual files. Although there's a warning explaining this when you try to remove an account, it's often ignored, especially by helpful tech support people
 who think they know best.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I should not have put in the account info until after the import.&nbsp;&nbsp;... I'm getting an error message because it is attempting to go to the servers for those accounts. I'd like to make them 'go away'&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Press Alt-F O E to see all the accounts that have been set up. If you see a duplicate here, you can safely remove&nbsp;it so long as you're sure you have other copies of the messages in its folders. To be completely certain, you can right-click on the name of
 a superfluous account in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>. On the <em>
General</em> tab, deselect In<em>clude this account when receiving mail or synchronizin</em><em>g</em>. As always, if you need help interpreting an error, please quote the error message verbatim.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove an account, right-click on its name in the folder pane and select <em>
Remove account</em>. Read and heed the warning!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>When I went back and changed the name (for consistency) it did not resort alpha.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folders will always be sorted alphabetically after re-starting the program.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>For what its worth I didn't find the article that you linked to be very helpful. &nbsp;Its an easy set of instructions if one&nbsp;<strong><em>plans
</em></strong>on backing up WLM, deleting the program, and reinstalling and reloading the backed up folders.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really only deals with the scenario where the user is exporting messages to import somewhere else, specifically to explain the pitfalls that litter that procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>the article also doesn't talk about the file string to find the WLM folders. &nbsp;such as: &nbsp;<strong>C:\Users\</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>logon</strong>&nbsp;</em><strong>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</strong><span>,&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, that isn't necessary in the situation the article covers. The path to the store folder and its name are both user-configurable, so it's not possible to give a general location. This has to be found either from within the program options (press Ctrl-Shift-O
 for Options, then on the <em>Advanced</em> tab click <em>Maintenance</em> and then
<em>Store folder</em>) or from the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>It might be worth reminding people about the repair function for WindowsLive - as this could be an alternative to deleting and reloading WLM and far less painful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not really an alternative. It&nbsp;acts differently from installing, and it's usually better at resolving program performance issues. There's not much that is improved by uninstalling and re-installing, and neither of these actions will make much difference
 to problems with the store folder itself. And again, that's not much to do with exporting and importing messages.</p>

    <title>Xbox Elite Controller&#39;s Wireless not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Elite Controller&#39;s Wireless not working</h2>
                    Hey there, i've recently bough an Xbox elite controller to play games on my pc (rocket league and FFXIV), and when i tried to connect it, it simply will not show up on the Bluetooth search at all regardless of which ever device i try to search on, that
 being on both my laptops and on my phone... I've searched online and most solutions always redirect me to the xbox acessories app to do an update, which i did and it failed the first 2 times... but at the third time the cable got disconnected but it somehow
 said process complete when i reconnected again and now it still doesn't show up... i tried everything with the exception of the process that requires you to have an xbox since i don't own one, so i'd like to know if there's any solution for the wireless not
 working at all, because i do have another xbox controller (normal new version) that works just fine and that one worked even before i knew an update even existed for it but since i also paid for a wireless "elite" controller too it

                    <p>Need some help. I have a Lenovo Yoga 2 11. I have an issue where my PC seems to be restarting every 2 mins. I have attempted to reboot in Safe mode, but I can't get the PC to actually boot into Safe to verify what's happening with the pc. I need some help
 from the community on what to do. I have no CD/DVD drive to load from. Once I log into the windows account is hang there for a moment and poof, the laptop restarts. I have already tried to Shift+Restart on the log in screen to no success. The PC simply wont
 get into safe mode for diagnostics. Once I place the password to login, it takes too long and it restarts again. I need your thoughts!&nbsp;</p>

            Microsoft did the only thing they could when they stopped the reseller from selling their product. Microsoft is not responsible for your loss of the software you bought from the reseller. You gripe or action is with the reseller. This is nothing new, Microsoft
 has always rigorously enforced their right to stop illegal copies of Software. Sorry, and I wish you luck in your quest for refund from the reseller. . Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.
<p><br />

<p>The above opinion is mine and mine alone and doesn't necessarily reflect that of Microsoft, it's employees, or any other member of this forum.

    <title>Latest windows update seems to have messed with my pinned apps such as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zellionrubashi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest windows update seems to have messed with my pinned apps such as Skype</h2>
                    <p>I decided to install the latest update to windows 10 seeing as I got a message that the update was ready. I was expecting some changes. What I was not expecting was that it was going to make using certain apps a nightmare.</p>
<p>I first found that several of my pinned apps were no longer pinned to the start menu.</p>
<p>This had happened before so I thought little of it and started to go in search of my apps to put them back where I wanted them.</p>
<p>Only this seems to be a near impossible task.</p>
<p>I was talking to someone on skype before I updated windows 10 and went to relaunch that program first. Only to find I had to type out the app name and clicking the result took me to the microsoft store. I then had to launch the app from the store. What was
 more disturbing was the fact that even though I had launched it the Microsoft Store and Skype were not present in the task bar at all.</p>
<p>This meant that unless my friend typed something back - at which point I could click the popup that appears on the right lower corner of the screen - I would have to minimise other windows I am using to find the skype window, just to get back to the program.
 This makes the app difficult to use compared to how it worked before. I can click the 'task view' button to speed up this process of finding the skype and microsoft store windows but again it isn't as simple as just selecting it straight off the task bar.</p>
<p>Is there something in the settings I can change to make skype appear on my task bar again or some easier way to get back to the skype window when skype is running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that the 'pin to start' option is greyed out on the skype app in the store and many other apps such as minecraft.</p>
<p>Minecraft on the other hand does appear on the task bar so I have pinned it to the taskbar for now because I have little other option other than convoluted route I must use to get at my other apps. (sudden update: Minecraft has now suddenly appeared on my
 start menu and I was able to drag it into where I usually have it pinned. No idea why I couldn't do this earlier)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that only microsoft store and its apps have been effected (so far as I know). I managed to find mail easy enough and pin that back to the start. The store and apps do not appear on the start menu at all and searching for the mircosoft store instead
 of one of the apps in it just tries to send me to webpages. Is there anyway of getting skype back pinned to my start menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is easy access to the programs and apps I use the most. I don't know why the new update has changed how these apps work or why I can no longer pin them to my start or see them on my task bar. Are they hidden somewhere else in the interface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate some help.</p>
<p>

            Have tried this to no avail. May have to roll back to the previous windows 10 version.

            Thank you for your response. May we know if you've tried rolling back to the previous version of Windows 10? Does the issue persists?<br />

    <title>Error code 8024002D - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malcolm-walker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 8024002D</h2>
                    
<p>My operating system is Windows 7 Professional 32-bit; an upgrade from Windows XP Home.&nbsp; Apart from the important Office 2007 Update Windows Update Office Genuine Advantage Notifications (KB949810), installation of which has failed several times, Windows
 Update is up-to-date.&nbsp; My anti-virus programme is F-Prot for Windows and the signature files are up to date.</p>
<p>When the installation is progressing a dialogue appears requesting:<br />
"Insert `OGA Notifier 2.0.0048.0' disk and click OK"&nbsp; I do not have such disk.&nbsp; When that dialogue is cancelled the Windows Update window displayed that the installation has failed with the error code 8024002D.</p>
<p>A Google search on Error code 8024002D and a search of this forum has not led to achieving a successful installation of this update.&nbsp; I am unable to locate this update in the MS Download Center to enable an attempt at a manual installation.</p>
<p>I would appreciate advice on the steps needed to overcome this failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Error Code: 0x8024002D <br />
means - a full-file patch failed because the source was required</p>
<p>Why not see if placing the installation media for Office in the installation drive rectifies the situation.</p>

<p>TaurArian,</p>
<p>Thank you for responding.&nbsp; Good suggestion but unfortunately unsuccessful.&nbsp; The Windows Update installer didnt find the file and with a manual search OGSNotifier.msi does not appear to be on my Office 2007 installation disk.</p>
<p>On the MS Website I found the file OGAControl.cab but couldn't work out how to install from the INF it contains.&nbsp; However from the Download Center I reached the validation area of the Genuine Advantage pages and both my Windows 7 and Office 2007 installations
 validated successfully.</p>
<p>So I have hidden the update KB949810 in the expectation that will be the end of this problem.</p>
