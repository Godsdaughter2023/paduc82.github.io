            Not the cause of your problem, but you should review it:

<font>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little more detail on the exact message encountered would be helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please review the following:</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software. See this Wiki article:</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2003 won&#39;t receive e-mails but will send.</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone help ? &nbsp;On my PC Outlook 2003 will send e-mails immediately but all of a sudden, since last week, it won't receive any. &nbsp;Send/Receive status keeps whirring round indefiinitely at 50%, then for a few seconds drops to 33% and then back up to 50%.
 &nbsp;Doesn't even throw up and error message, just keeps trying to receive.</p>
<p>My husband is also a user on the same computer and uses Outlook 2003 as his e-mail client also, and his is working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas please ?</p>

<div>If the Excel program launches and operates correctly and you have simply lost the Excel icon for the program menu and associated Excel files in Explorer, this is most likely a small corruption ion your
<i>IconCache.db</i>&nbsp;file. This is&nbsp;<span>a file that holds copies of the icons commonly used on your desktop and other places&nbsp;called</span><b>&nbsp;</b><i>IconCache.db</i><span>.
 It has likely suffered a minor corruption and needs to be rebuilt.</span>
<p>
Close all open windows and click<em>&nbsp;Start</em>&nbsp;then type or paste this into the<em>&nbsp;Search programs and files</em>&nbsp;box,</p>
<span>
<p>%LOCALAPPDATA%</p>
</span>
<p>
... then hit<em>&nbsp;&lt;enter&gt;</em>.</p>
<span>If you do not have Show hidden files, folders and drives&nbsp;turned on, turn it on now by tapping the ALT key, then selecting
<i>Tools, Folder Options</i>. On the <i>View</i> tab's <i>Advanced Setting</i>s, check
<i>Show hidden files, folders and drives</i>.<br />
</span><span><br />
There should be a file listing for</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><i>IconCache.db</i><span>&nbsp;(e.g.</span><em>&nbsp;IconCache&nbsp; &lt;Data Base File&gt;</em><span>). Rename it or delete it.&nbsp;</span><span>Restarting

                    I helped my aunt change her forgotten password and it worked but when we clicked on send verify email to prove its her email it wouldn't send and she can't get into her inbox to check it anyways.<br />
<br />
She also doesn't have another email address to send it too. <br />
<br />
This is what it says:<br />
Call us overprotective, but we need to verify that ******@******.ca is yours <br />
Before you can continue, you need to check your inbox for a message from the Microsoft account team. Follow the instructions in the mail to finish setting up your account.<br />
<br />
It has been 2 days and I've used different computers and it still won't send it. It shows that she has logged in but still can't get to the inbox.<br />
Someone plz help.<br />

            Hi Marty
<br />
<br />I am Robert, an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Is your email directly with Oulook.com, or provided by the employer and hosted on-premises or in cloud? Often, it's the on-premises authentication problem that does this. While emails work, it keeps asking for the credentials.
<br />
<br />If it's provided by a company as a connection to on-premises server, contact your IT.
<br />
<br />If it's with Outlook.com or Office365 directly, then please let us know and we'll see if there may be another reason for it.

<p><span><span>Hey OrlPhRs,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The “enable hardware acceleration” option that you disabled only disables hardware acceleration in Adobe Flash Player when using Internet Explorer. Other browsers
 may be able to use hardware acceleration through Adobe Flash Player because it is a different add-on when comparing Internet Explorer and other browsers. In effect you have two Adobe Flash Player add-ons installed, one for Internet Explorer and another for
 other browsers.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Take a look at this thread for troubleshoot advice to see if you can get Adobe Flash Player to function correctly with hardware acceleration enabled:</span></span></p>

    <title>I downloaded the install ISO from Microsoft and burned it to a thumb - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken floyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            I downloaded the install ISO from Microsoft and burned it to a thumb drive to upgrade from the 1151 version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It worked great until it came time to boot and now I get the icon and the little circle, but it shuts down or restarts. Changing the Boot sequence doesn't change anything and the recovery disk I burned claims it cannot repair the issue. When I try to boot
 to the ISO I get a message stating I am interrupting an upgrade and I am given the choice of removing the medium and continuing the upgrade or leaving it in and doing a clean installation.</p>
<p>This is after giving it hours to 'update'. When examined by an Easus repair disk, I can see the install made hash out of my SSD drive and the small boot partition is now my 'C' drive and my main OS partition is now an 'E' drive.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help before I do a complete clean install and lose some apps.</p>

            Need a bit more info to be of much help. What is the Computer boot type? how big is the SSD and the number&nbsp;volumes as well as their size. You can boot to a command prompt and&nbsp;run diskpart and then diskpart&gt;list volume to get this.

<p>Is their more information needed? I know some of the partitions are supposed to be part of the update process, but the machine is trying to boot and at that stage, some of these primary partitions should be logical and some or one should be active.</p>
<p>At this point I am considering taking all of the disks out of the machine and replacing them with clean disks. Then I'll pull my data off of these.</p>
<p>I am hoping it will be something simple enough I can change partition status and boot from the 'E:' drive.</p>

            <p>Your disks appear to be MBR and not GPT-initialized. &nbsp;If your PC is actually UEFI BIOS mode capable, you would be better off to use that and initialize disks as GPT, but it means wiping your disks unless you use some utility to convert, such as something
 on Ubuntu (but that is risky).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run diskpart to confirm that System is the first partition:</p>
<p><strong>select disk 0</strong></p>
<p><strong>list partition</strong></p>
<p><strong>select partition 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>active&nbsp;</strong>← to make sure the partition is marked active</p>
<p><strong>list volume&nbsp;</strong>← to confirm drive letters for Windows and System volumes</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your drive letters remain as shown, you can try running these commands to repair:</p>
<p><strong>bootsect /nt60 C: /force /mbr</strong></p>
<p><strong>bcdboot E:\Windows /s C: /f BIOS /c</strong></p>
<p><strong>bcdedit&nbsp;</strong>← to display the main parts of the BCD</p>

            <p>What's your exact problem?</p>
<p>Can you boot from this or not?</p>
<p>Something assigned drive letters where there should be none, and it's not the upgrade that did this.</p>
<p>Only your boot partition (e:) should have one, all others should not have them.</p>
<p>This drive also contains an old recovery partition from the OEM setup (HP_Recovery).</p>

            <p>The problem is, I cannot boot my system after the 'upgrade'. I downloaded the ISO from Microsoft and chose 'upgrade'. At a certain point, the machine would not reboot and was in an obvious loop.</p>
<p>Booting through the rescue disk showed all of these partitions which were not on before the update. Before the update, there was C: Boot and OS, and HP's recovery partition. Suddenly I have 2 partitions I never saw before and cannot boot my machine. None
 of the partitions are active or logical, they are all primary.</p>
<p>Where the partitions came from, is beyond me. During the upgrade the user has very little input.</p>

            <p>I have determined the drives are in their proper location. Prior to trying this using a command line interface, is it not possible to make these changes via a disk utility GUI.</p>
<p>I would also need to know what my objective is while I am writing these commands. I would rather replace both hard drives and do a clean install, then reinstall my apps using data from the disks as they are now.</p>
<p>I am not ungrateful in the least for the information I am receiving. I am astounded by those who are willing to help me.</p>
<p>I just need to approach the problem with no destructive effects. </p>
<p>I hope I am stating this correctly.. When I do use the command line, partition C: appears to serve no function or I should say it has nothing I could determine would be helpful when it comes to booting.</p>
<p>Either way, I want to thank those who have helped and those who may in the future.</p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>

            <p>It is hard to say how far into the install your PC got. &nbsp;I believe that there is a point where it initially boots to the new installation files and then applies those to your existing Windows folders, in order to upgrade the OS while leaving most things
 unchanged from the previous version. &nbsp;If you launched the upgrade by running setup.exe from the install media, by the time it restarts the PC, it is done with the install media and is working with what it has copied to your hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The commands listed simply ensure that the existing System partition is marked Active to enable it to boot on a Legacy BIOS device. &nbsp;They also copy the required files to the System partition. &nbsp;Bcdboot points to the install of Windows that you want it to
 boot from, in order to create the appropriate entries in the BCD (Boot Configuration Database) which is also on the System partition. &nbsp;You could actually format the System partition and still use these commands to make the PC boot, but only if the Windows
 folder and partition are actually intact and functional. However, the System volume also contains a copy of Windows Recovery Environment, which would be erased with a format and would need to be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The function of C: is to host the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the disk and the System files. &nbsp;If you run
<strong>dir /a /s</strong> on the System volume (which at the moment is C:, but normally has no letter) you should see a lot of files and folders, but some are normally hidden files. &nbsp;On Legacy BIOS devices, this has to be on the first partition of the disk
 and it has to be marked Active. It then looks to Windows (on the "Boot" partition / your usual C: drive) for the Operating System. The disk could be setup with a single NTFS partition, which could then function as a System, Boot and also have the Recovery
 files all in one place, but this is not standard. I guess keeping them separate allows for Repair efforts that would not be as easy otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your approach to remove the disks and backup your data elsewhere is good. &nbsp;Repairing what you have is only intended to make it operational more quickly than what you are suggesting. &nbsp;Because you appear to be in mid-install, it makes it more difficult to
 anticipate the exact results, but the commands only affect the System partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If for some reason you had no other way to recover your data, you could even install a separate copy of Windows 10 to a small partition on the existing disks (and then use that install of Windows to recover your data) but that doesn't seem to be the case,
 since you are willing to replace the disks to do a clean install.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account as Alias</h2>
                    I've currently got two Microsoft accounts active.<br />
My oldest account is linked with my Xbox Live Gamertag, and as such all emails relating to this are sent to this account. I've been looking into making my newer account (and the email address its associated with) the one that is linked with my gamertag.<br />
I tried adding it as an alias with the intention of making it the primary alias on my old account, but I can't add it as an alias because its already an account in its own right. Any advice?

            <p>Try setting the date back in BIOS settings to August or sometime before it expired. If it boots Windows change the Settings not to auto-update the time until you can upgrade to a newer build. Here is a download for the 14931 ISO, which you could then mount
 to run setup.exe. Keep it offline until upgraded, so that it does not reset the date until complete.</p>

<p>Hello Stephen, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As of the moment, deleting the characters next to the cursor is unavailable. You can only delete characters by moving the cursor to the right side. You can always send a suggestion via Feedback Hub app so that it can be added or included on the next update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To send a feedback on your phone, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>All</strong> <strong>Apps</strong>, search for the <strong>Feedback</strong>
<strong>Hub</strong> app.</li><li>Open the menu icon at the top left side.</li><li>Select <strong>Feedback</strong>, then at the top right side, tap the <strong>
add</strong> <strong>button</strong><strong> (+)</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Suggestion</strong> and fill up the box with the details of the feature you want to be added on Windows phone.</li><li>Select the right category for the suggestion and then submit.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you need more help, feel free to ask the Community.</p>

<p>Feedback Hub app is a free service provided by Microsoft and does not cost anything. You can always send a feedback whenever you want, just make sure your phone is connected to a Wi-Fi. However, if you have other Windows 10 device such as laptop or PC you
 can also send a feedback. </p>

<h2>            how to get preview build 14316 back after rollback to previous build</h2>
                    <p>I thought I had a system bug after installing build 14316 and rolled back to previous build 14295. Now that I fixed my problem, I want to get build 14316 back. I saw an article that said there registry entries that need to be changed but this was for a much
 earlier release and when I checked the registry, the entries were not the same. under windowsselfhost there was a recovered from dword with a value of 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what changes do I need to make to the registry?</p>

<h2>            Something went wrong - error</h2>
                    Powerpoint gave an error stating something went wrong.&nbsp; I bought Microsoft Office 2010through my formercompany.&nbsp; I can't find the original key anymore.&nbsp; Today, my PC crashed because the battery died.&nbsp; When it came back, Office didn't work.&nbsp; I tried to,
 "Quick&nbsp;repair," and then did the online repair.&nbsp; Office opened, it recognized my email,
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and found an account, but then said this product was not associated with my Microsoft account/email when I entered my password.&nbsp; How can I activate my office when the email with the product key
 is too old and was not saved in my email?&nbsp; It was from 2011 or 2012.

<strong><span>Tools to Extract Product Key</span></strong>
<p><a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-recover-your-lost-windows-7-or-windows-8-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.7tutorials.com/how-recover-your-lost-windows-7-or-windows-8-product-key</span></a></p>

 2015 10 01 - Review 22 Free Tools</span></p>
<p>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have all of your product keys / registration numbers available for future re-installs</p>
<p><strong>FYI</strong>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem. The underlying mechanics of Windows 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7
 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: </span></strong>these tools no longer work for Office 2013 and 2016 after MS “improved” the way the key is stored on your computer. You can now only extract the last 5 char of the key, enough
 to match to the real product key you have recorded elsewhere.</p>
<p>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Your original package or purchase confirmation e-mail</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Online download account</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Activation backup utilities From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called
<strong>TOKENS.DAT</strong> to store encrypted product activation keys:</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<strong>Tokens.DAT</strong>
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareLicensing\<strong>Tokens.data</strong><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>C:\Windows.Old\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<strong>Tokens.DAT</strong> (if you did an in-place Windows Upgrade)<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do not expect the Windows.OLD folder to be there until you delete it. Win10 will “help” you by deleting the backout files 30 days after the “upgrade”
</p>
<p>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: OEM (factory install and activated) licenses use a different key than the one reported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the factory can use the PK from the original factory activation. You would have been provided with a separate piece of paper with a Product key for reactivation.</p>

<p><strong>ProduKey</strong> <span>
may be able to extract product key information from a file saved externally</span>. This is useful if you’re trying to get the key details from the backup of a now defunct machine. Try the /Regfile option.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>After installing on my system, I ran the program <span>
<span>à</span></span> AS ADMINISTRATOR <span>
<span>ß</span></span> and then <span>clicked on File
</span><span><span>à</span></span><span> Select Source.</span> Once in this menu it may appear a little overwhelming, don’t worry it’s not that complicated and your not going
 to break anything else. Select the circle next to “Load the product keys from external Software Registry hive”. Now from here you may have to browse to a slightly different location depending on where your windows.old folder is located, but you want to basically
 browse to the following and open this file:</p>
<p><span>C:\Windows.old\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SOFTWARE</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After opening this file select ok; you may have to wait a few minutes for it to load the hive and give you your keys, but if they’re there you should see them and be able to fresh install your MS Office.</p>
<p>Please note that this did work for my Office 2007, it also gave me my Vista Home &amp; Personal Key, and Internet Explorer... lol! I hope this helps someone else too! And remember backup before you do any upgrading/downgrading/or destruction
 to you PC.</p>

Win 95-Win8,<span>&nbsp; </span>V8.4 </p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I tested version 8.4 on Windows 8.0. It reported my Office 2003 2007 2010 product keys correctly.
<strong>BUT</strong> for Office 2013 Pro Plus (local install) it did NOT report the key! Gosh Darn!<span>&nbsp;

</sup></strong></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(the “ends with” is correct)</p>
<p>Superscripts f and g say:</p>

                    <p>Okay, the summary.&nbsp; I work for a hotel as the Executive Auditor.&nbsp; We keep what is sometimes called a "Flash Report" that recaps everything book keeping wise the hotel has done for the day - ie: number of rooms sold, room revenue, food revenue, banquet revenue,
 credit card revenue so on and so forth.&nbsp; If you've ever run a business yourself you pretty much know what I'm talking about when I say you want to produce something on a day to day basis that you can pass around to others and keep somewhere to show how your
 business performed on a particular day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is this.&nbsp; For seven years our hotel has been open and has been using the same Flash Report (we call it a Daily at this hotel but whatever).&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to showing daily and month to date data we also show in an adjacent column last year month
 to date so you can see where you stand now and where you stood the same day last year.&nbsp; Our sister property that the company also owns taught me how to do the company Daily as we trained a bit waiting for this property to open.&nbsp; They keep their Daily on paper
 and have racked up shelves of binders each containing days and days of Daily that they'll look at once to transcribe the data on a daily basis then put it back on the shelf never to be looked at again.&nbsp; It's something that I vowed not to do and when my property
 opened I took action to keep it electronically on the server so that I could simply copy/paste the data which marveled mangement (it's a small company) that I out thought the problem of retention of data and not using volumes of shelf space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, the Daily.&nbsp; It's pretty standard.&nbsp; It has three columns starting with A which the creator used as a line number, B to describe the adjacent field, C is for coding which we don't do so it's blank, D we also don't use, E for Adjustments, F for Daily
 positive activity, G for month to date activity and H for last year month to date activity.&nbsp; Now for the last seven years its been standard so when you're working on 05/29/14 (which I'm working on tonight) you just go back to 05/29/13 and copy column G - month
 to date for that particular point first of the month to the particular day in 2013 - and paste it into column H for the date you're working on.&nbsp; So month to date 05/01/13 - 05/29/13 would become last year month to date for 05/29/14 and then things progress
 each day along the calendar so on and so forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now however because of some internal personal issues the company owner is going through the Daily has changed and become uncompatible with copying and pasting as the layout of the column has changed.&nbsp; Data has been moved around and since 05/28/14 is no longer
 similiar to the Daily before so copy/paste isn't possible.&nbsp; Short of having to do it by hand for the next 365 days, I'm hoping to record a macro that will record where I get the month to date data from in last years Daily and paste it into the last year month
 to date column spaces in the day in which I'm working on.&nbsp; But when you create a macro by having it record your actions and you open a particular day it records opening that particular day and will only open that day.&nbsp; I was hoping to create a macro that inquires
 about the date you want it to perform its actions on.&nbsp; So when I'm working on 05/29/14 I can run this macro and it'll pop-up a box asking me which date I want, I enter "05/29/13" and it'll go to that date, copy the data as I've recorded the macro to do and
 then paste it back in 05/29/14.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it sounds confusing and I'm happy to respond to any questions.&nbsp; While not wildly different corporate mangement didn't consult anyone at the property level before just introducing the new Daily and telling us to just work with it (paraphrasing of course).&nbsp;
 My own boss didn't know he had missed the meeting until the assistant GM inquired about why he wasn't at the meeting that he didn't know he was supposed to have attended.&nbsp; Even I didn't know about the meeting or I would've crashed it.&nbsp; Had I been consulted
 I would've changed a few things around to allow copy/paste to still take place...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to simply write a formula for each cell that will pull the data?&nbsp; But how would you get around the whole moving from day to day thing so that 05/28/14 pulls 05/28/13 and 05/29/14 pulls 05/29/13?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any thoughts and suggestions...</p>

            <p>I'd like to add something to my original question.&nbsp; In leiu of writing a macro which prompts for a date, then looks that date up and copies information.&nbsp; I'm more than willing to open the necessary Daily for the date I'm working on but dated last year.&nbsp;
 Then I could easily split the screen with the same day last year / current year.&nbsp; Is it possible to just write a macro that copies particular fields from whichever Daily happens to be on the screen for say 2013 to 2014?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you have 05/29/13 as the left pane and 05/29/14 as the right pane, is it possible to just write a macro that will copy particular data from one to the other and have it just work that way for whatever two days I place side by side?</p>

            <p>Well, it is easier to let the macro ask for the file and then let the macro open it than to run a macro that needs to figure out which of the currently open files is supposed to be last year's and which is this year's. This gets especially complicated if
 there are more than just these two files open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process of identifying the source file can be made more convenient than it is in the above macro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that this Communities forum does not normally handle complex VBA questions like this one. If you need more than the basics outlined above, you should close this question and ask in the

<h3> grover91  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phone links in Tasks and Appointments</h2>
                    It is extremely handy that Mobile detects and converts phone numbers embedded in emails to links, so that I can click the link to dial.&nbsp; This does not seem to be provided for tasks and appointments, so I cannot simply open an appointment and click on a
 phone number to dial - I have to close the appointment and go back to Today to dial.<br />
<br />
There has to be a better way.&nbsp; Is there any tips or productivity software that converts phone numbers in Tasks and Appointments to links for quick dialing?&nbsp; Is this addressed in Mobile 6?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<h3> stfuitzel  say:</h3>
<h2>            I think Windows 10 Insider Program messed up my computer please help me</h2>
                    <p>This will be lengthy since I've run into so many problems all at once. I&nbsp;signed up for windows insider program for windows 10 and it was working for a while. Everything was fine, up until last night. I saw it needed to update, it updated and then showed
 the restart button so I clicked it and when I checked up on everything the next morning, I noticed everything had stopped working. My mouse (which is wireless) doesn't let me click anywhere or anything on screen because I can't even see my mouse cursor for
 most of the time the computer turns on, but other times it's randomly there yet I still can't move it or click anything at all. The keyboard (also wireless) doesn't type anything down and the computer is touch screen, but nothing happens when I touch the screen.
 I've already tried plugging and unplugging them to different usb ports, but it didn't help. My apps automatically load up once the computer's turned on like steam, google chrome, sticky notes etc. but I can't do anything. I noticed on the bottom right side
 of the screen it says "Windows Home Insider Preview Evaluation copy. Build 18317.rs_prerelease.190111-1556"</p>
<div>It also gives me an error message saying "There was a problem starting C:\Windows\System32\LogiLDA.ll&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>The specified module could not be found." I looked up what that meant and it supposedly happens with logitech specifically (my mouse most likely), but I have no clue how to fix any of these errors. I have tried turning the computer on and off consecutively
 so it can go to automatic repair, but I can't even do anything on that screen because both my keyboard and mouse do not work. And just now as I turned on the computer again a new error now shows that says "Another instance is running</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Configuartion system failed to initialize."&nbsp;</p>

            Most important when using a BETA operating system is to be prepared for issues, such as having wired Keyboard/Mouse try plugin a wired KB/Mouse and see if you have control, also read the info posted by MS about using Preview.

<p>Did you have a 3rd party active security program installed? If so, it's very possible that it didn't recognize the upgraded Logitech driver, and grabbed it into quarantine. That would kill your Logitech mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's one of the many issues you run into with 3rd party security programs in insider builds, because the 3rd party program developers can't possibly keep them compatible with the new insider builds that come out every few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Joe mentioned, you need to connect a wire mouse and keyboard to get control of the system; then, first thing,
<p>
</p><p>Don't be tricked into thinking that deactivating a 3rd party security will make it okay. It most likely automatically reactivates during boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to run insider builds, you need to need to rely on the built-in security program, not 3rd party ones.</p>

<p>I know I personally haven't installed&nbsp;<span>any 3rd party security program. I asked my father who has also used the computer, but he said he's ne</span>ver added anything to the computer either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as I replied to Joe, the machine only has USB connections. I tried other USB keyboards and mice to try to see if they worked, but they didn't. It has no PS2 ports available at all so I believe even if I got a usb to ps/2 adapter, it wouldn't work because
 none of the usb ports are working in the first place.</p>

</p><p>Try resetting the bios to default to see if you can at least regain USB functionality, if not, I'm afraid you don't have any other option. No need to borrow another PC, just go to a friend or relative house to make a bootable USB or DVD. Use the
<strong><em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MCT</a></em></strong>&nbsp;to easily create bootable media and try a repair, or download
<strong><em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Build 18290</a></em></strong> but you'll need Rufus to burn it to the USB stick so you may as well download Build 18317 from
 the link I posted and be done with it.</p>

<p>Assuming that your keyboard works during power-up: before Windows starts (when you first see swirling dots or Windows logo) hold the power button in for 5 or more seconds to power off.&nbsp; Do this twice. On the third power-up, it should go to Repair mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then use the menus to boot in Safe Mode.&nbsp; In Safe Mode, if the keyboard works, try running
<strong>msconfig</strong> and Task Manager to disable all non-Microsoft Services (msconfig) and all Startup items (Start tab in Task Manager).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then see if you can reboot to Windows normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, it will be able to use generic drivers for your hardware and you can proceed to install new drivers, as needed.&nbsp; You could try uninstalling the drivers in Device Manager, if it doesn't work after doing the above.</p>

</p><p>There is another thread complaining about USB not working with Insider builds. It must be only certain types of hardware affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/all/latest-insider-preview-jan-19-2019-kills-usb-ports/236fb290-4c96-4d42-a1ba-3e8ce21e6a98">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/all/latest-insider-preview-jan-19-2019-kills-usb-ports/236fb290-4c96-4d42-a1ba-3e8ce21e6a98</a></p>

</p><p>He would have to boot to the Windows RE of an earlier build, such as the Public build, on a Windows 10 install media USB and then select
<em>Repair your computer</em> from the second screen of setup.&nbsp; Then he would need to roll back to the previous build to regain USB support.&nbsp; Using the earlier build's Windows RE should enable the USB ports to keep working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife has a touch screen. I just had a look, and her touch screen connects via the USB hardware, which explains why the touch screen also quits working.</p>
