                    <p>When I go in Account Setting and change my security info. They always ask me to receive some code from my oldish reserve email which I have not been open for years (more than 5 years, I think). The problem is I can not remember anything about that reserve
 email.</p>

<h2>            MSE will not do daily scheduled scans, but it is updated</h2>
                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p>I have M.S.E. set for daily scans at 2.00 PM (quick scan) but the scan will rarely (never)&nbsp;run.</p>
<p>Every second or third&nbsp;day the icon in task bar is Orange and says I am not protected.</p>
<p>The computer is used daily, but not always at 2.00 PM. Even if on, the scan will not run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update is always there when I check, but the scan has not been done often for several days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no other "<strong>active</strong>" protection running at all, E.G. Malwarebytes or SUPERAntiSpyware.</p>
<p>I have Uninstalled and Reinstalled the program, and have the Real Time and Scheduled scans both set to run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toshiba laptop with Windows7 SP1 Home Premium&nbsp;and all Windows&nbsp;updates installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas please - Thank You -</p>

            <p>Hi Steve -</p>
<p>The reinstalled version is now working almost&nbsp;OK. I check and run the computer for at least 1 hour each side of the scheduled&nbsp;scan times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though it has missed at least a random&nbsp;total of&nbsp;4 scans, the icon has not changed to Orange or Red yet.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found <strong>Win32/Small.CA virus</strong> had infected the computer at some unknown&nbsp;time, so this was removed with DrWeb scanner and the help of Maurice Naggar at the MBAM forum.</p>
<p>The M/soft online&nbsp;scanner found nothing, and MSE also reported nothing found, but it was&nbsp;my Toshiba Action Center that alerted me to the item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally I think this topic&nbsp;can be put to sleep now -</p>
<p>Thanks for the general&nbsp;advice, but I think removing&nbsp;a small infection,&nbsp;combined with&nbsp;a reinstall solved it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards -</p>

            Hi;
<br />I recommend you to install the bellow tool:
<br /><a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/?env=ExRCA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/?env=ExRCA</a>
<br />
<br />It will help you to synchronize your OneDrive accounts. You should select OneDrive -&gt; the client doesn't synchronize.
<br />
<br />Note: It should be installed on the affected computer.

<p><span>Hi Nik,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please first check whether you have updated the OneNote 2016 for Mac’s version to the latest version. If no, update the version, restart the Mac and do a test to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that the data in OneNote Online is fine. If the issue persists after updates, I suggest you try the following and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Close all Office 2016 for Mac applications.</span></p>
<p><span>b. From Finder Go/Go to Folder (Shift+Cmd+G).</span></p>
<p><span>c. Enter "~/Library/Containers" and press Go (Return key).<br />
d. Find the "com.microsoft.onenote.mac" folder.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Select and delete that folder using File/Move to Trash (Cmd+Delete).</span></p>
<p><span>f. Delete this folder: ~/Library/Group\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office.<br />
g. Open Spotlight by selecting the magnifying glass at the top right of your desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>h. Search for and open Keychain.</span></p>
<p><span>i. In the search field, enter adal.</span></p>
<p><span>j. Select all items whose type is&nbsp;MicrosoftOffice15_2_Data:ADAL:&lt;GUID&gt;, and then press&nbsp;Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>k. In the search field, enter&nbsp;office.</span></p>
<p><span>l. Select the items that are named&nbsp;Microsoft Office Identities Cache 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Office Identities Settings 2, and then press&nbsp;Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>m. Quit Keychain Access.</span></p>
<p><span>n. Navigate to &lt;YourUserName&gt;Library &gt; Group Containers.</span></p>
<p><span>o. Find the folders below and move them to Trash.</span></p>
<p><span>UBF8T346G9.ms</span></p>
<p><span>UBF8T346G9.Office</span></p>
<p><span>UBF8T346G9.OfficeOsfWebHost</span></p>
<p><span>Warning:&nbsp;Outlook data will be removed when you move the three folders listed in this step to&nbsp;Trash. You should back up these folders before you delete them.</span></p>
<p><span>p. Restart the Mac.</span></p>
<p><span>q. Open OneNote 2016 for Mac and re-activate it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>thank you for the response however it made the bar across the top go away that says i need to sign in, but instead now a box pop up comes and says that "there was a problem with microsoft onenote and your recent work might be lost". then it prompts me to
 restart onenote and i do, but then the box pops up a minute later.&nbsp;</p>

            Also, many of the steps in the previous directions you sent me were not there, there was no . ADAL, or microsoft office identities, or even the microsoftonenote.mac didnt produce anything i just deleted anything similar to it. Not sure if that means anything!&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can you navigate to &lt;YourUserName&gt;Library &gt; Group Containers</span>&gt;find the folders below and move them to Trash&gt;restart the Mac&gt;open the OneNote 2016 application?
 If yes, do a test to see and let us know the result.</p>

<p><span>Warning:&nbsp;Outlook data will be removed when you move the three folders listed in this step to&nbsp;Trash. You should back
 up these folders before you delete them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, upload a full screenshot showing the version information of the OneNote 2016 for Mac application you are using and check whether the notebooks
 in OneNote Online are fine. You can access the version page via OneNote&gt;About OneNote.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>

    <title>Error Code 0x800CCC0E in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vinfaris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 0x800CCC0E in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>All email accounts in Outlook 2016 are gmail accounts and all worked fine until about April 24, 2019. No changes were made in the computer or Outlook setup before the problem began.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we get a smtp server password box and error code 0x800CCC0E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I verified was that the password is the correct password by logging out of and back into the gmail account. Password is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Windows 10 based computer. MS Office 2016 with Outlook has been set up and running without problems on this computer for a few months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup in Outlook: </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Incoming Server - imap.gmail.com,&nbsp; SSL,&nbsp; and Port 993</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outgoing Server - smtp.gmail.com,&nbsp; SSL/TLS,&nbsp; &nbsp;Authentication = Yes,&nbsp; SSL = Port 465 (there is no way to set TLS to Port 587)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;User Name is set correctly<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gmail email address is verified and correct</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gmail email password has been verified and is correct</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Run Outlook Repair - reinstalled MS Office 2016<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Verified all server settings were correct&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Verified no duplicate accounts</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tried to use smtp port 25 but, as expected, that didn't work</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Changed Google Account settings to "Use less secure apps"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Run CC Cleaner to clean computer and Registry</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to try 2-step verification but since the "Less secure apps" didn't fix the problem I don't see what difference 2-step verification would make. I've seen there are many others who have reported this same problem with earlier versions of Outlook
 and for many nothing recommended seemed to work, and I've tried them all except the 2-step verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this or do we just have to opt to stop using Outlook?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Hi VinFaris,
<br />
<br />My name is Joshua, I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help you out.
<br />
<br />Dear,
<br />
<br />  We can follow the following steps that worked for me to solve this problem, some are very similar to the ones you indicate, therefore, we can validate them to see if it solves what is exposed by you.
<br />
<br />- Validate the firewall and have an antivirus, both must have ports enabled for access to mail servers. Sometimes the antivirus can impact the flow of information, depending on its configuration.
<br />- It can be ruled out that the installer is not damaged, therefore, if possible, try again the reinstallation, but with another installer.
<br />- Having already tried the issue of ports and that is Ok, we ignore that step.
<br />
<br />Additional please we could observe this configuration:
<br />
<br />Let's go: -&gt; "Accounts", then -&gt; "Properties". Choose the option -&gt; "Servers"
<br />
<br />Once there, verify that the box that says \\\ "My server requires authentication" \\\ is checked.
<br />
<br />Enter your complete mailbox and your Password.
<br />
<br />Change the output port of SMTP mails. Remember that you must use secure connections to the server through the following ports:
<br />
<br />Port incoming SSL (POP3): 995
<br />Incoming SSL Mail Port (IMAP): 993
<br />Outgoing mail port SSL (SMTP): 465
<br />
<br />Finally press&gt; "Apply" and then&gt; "Accept"
<br />
<br />I hope these steps can help you with your inconvenience.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards.

<p>Hello Danny, </p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you can have the People Pane visible once you reset your Ribbon:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on <em>File</em>.</li><li>Select <em>Options</em>.</li><li>Choose <em>Customize Ribbon</em>.</li><li>Click on <em>Reset</em>.</li></ol>
<p>You can manually select People Pane by searching the option on the <em>Choose commands from</em>. Select
<em>All commands </em>from the drop-down list.</p>

<h2>            Disproportionate of charts from different samples</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am comparing two bar charts for some reports. The two bar charts are from different data set and is output based on the percentage of the data. However, when I tried to compare two charts, the length of the bar showed weird in some cases. For example,
 the 54% at the right chart is longer than the 55% in the left chart. &nbsp;This is what we need to prevent because when we report this like the graph shown below, it could be misleading. Does anyone know how I can solve this issue?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Double spaced mailbox panel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grandpa waldorf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Double spaced mailbox panel</h2>
                    I like having several mailboxes for different categories like business, friends, family, clubs, etc. &nbsp;I am also forced to have separate boxes for POP vs WEB mail. &nbsp;Is there a way I can change to single spacing in the mailbox panel so that all of my mailboxes
 can be visible at once?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As a workaround, I tried grouping Friends and Family as sub folders under Inbox to save space, but the count of unread messages for Inbox does not include the unread messages in the sub folders. &nbsp;I guess if that bug were fixed I wouldn't have a problem.
 &nbsp;As a matter of fact, it would be nice if each mail account showed the total of unread messages for all of the mailboxes under it. &nbsp;Then I could really shorten the list and see which accounts have new mail.</div>

 click "Browse" and make sure the folders you want&nbsp;the view to search in&nbsp;are selected:</p>

<p>When you click OK, it'll show you email from all of the folders you selected, regardless of where they are in the folder tree. I usually keep my Sent and Outbox included so I can see the entire conversation, including what I initially send to others.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you've finished creating it, just right-click on it and put it into your Favorites. You'll have to click on that view every time you start Outlook, but Views are such&nbsp;a powerful tool it beats out that small inconvenience. Please note, Search Folders
 do NOT span mailboxes.</p>

            Thanks, Stanimal. &nbsp;I did do some playing with a combined unopened mail search folder and there some interesting possibilities. &nbsp;For the way I have operated, it actually made things just a little worse because there has to a combined one for all pop accounts
 plus one for hotmail and one for gmail and the search folders don't show up unless all of the individual sub-folders are showing. &nbsp;I really could use double the number of folders in the left panel. &nbsp;That would let me know at a glance that I have had 3 messages
 from customers, 4 from prospects, a few from a support person, and 1 from a family member in the last hour. &nbsp;I don't always read all messages in an hour, but I can usually remember how many were in each box the last time I checked.

            Did you mark the search folders as favorites? That will put them at the top of the left-navigation view. Also, you can just rename the folders and place them outside the Inbox; prefix the folder names with something that groups them together. I truly don't
 see how the search folders could have made things worse.

<p>Please verify if you are using a Mobile or mail client in accessing your account.

<p>One of the possible reason wht your emails&nbsp;are automatically deleted is because y<span>ou are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - unread filter not working</h2>
                    <p>I know variations of this have been asked before, but mine is a very simple use case, it is happening to several people in my office and as yet I can find no adequate response or solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2016, the built-in 'Unread' filter simply doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Viewing email via OWA the filter works fine so it's clearly an Outlook Windows Client issue. I have tried updating Outlook (build 16.0.6741.2071) and the issue remains. Previous posts had suggested this bug was found and fixed in an earlier version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot below shows the mix of read and unread email being returned by the filter.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's actually not what I meant. I want to make a landline or mobile call using my Skype credit to the people on my iPhone contact list. These people don't necessarily have Skype nor do I have time for invitations but need to reach them immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the earlier versions it was easy to go through your iPhone contact list and select there which real (not Skype account) phone number to call. Now I can only invite and not select a real number at all. To make things worse, I can't copy-paste the same
 numbers directly any more as I have the country codes in my contacts and Skype forces another country code. Thus, I need to copy the contact number, paste it on iPhone Notes, delete the country code, copy the number and, finally, paste it on Skype. N-o-t very
 practical...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice,&nbsp; &nbsp;Mika</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the clarification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid that there isn't any option to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't any option from the dial pad to view your iPhone contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do instead is to open the iPhone contacts from your Skype contacts and you can click the number from there and it will be dialed automatically from Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try that instead of manually typing in the number from the dial pad.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your efforts! The method you say does "work" but is cumbersome as it has no search feature. Imagine that I have some 500 contacts and need to call to "Zoo". No search means scrolling down 500 contacts. And of course the next call goes to "Yankee"
 with a new scrolldown...</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if that's the available tool then my wish is that Skype/MS seriously considers returning the search function for external contacts.</p>
<p>

 this&nbsp;<span>core functionality of Skype got broken mid-2017 (when&nbsp;</span>Skype was revamped to compete with Snapchat) and it is still not fixed - in spite of the outcry from users - and there are no reassurances that it will get
 fixed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>The inescapable conclusion is that Microsoft prefers users to&nbsp;<em>"Sync Your Contacts"</em>and/or&nbsp;<em>"Invite People to Skype"</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This might be for purely commercial reasons, or it might be something
 more sinister.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Wikipedia,&nbsp;<em>"The 2013 mass surveillance disclosures revealed that Microsoft had granted intelligence agencies unfettered access to supernodes and Skype communication content."</em></span></p>
<p>
<em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>
<span>I guess we have to find other ways to make long-distance calling convenient and economical again.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Actually, later on I realized that Skype Apps on iPhone and iPad are completely different! In iPad, there’s no access to iPad local addressbook. However, with totally different looking UI, searching “Contacts” gives you all your Skype AND local address book
 contacts. For local contacts, you can select the phone number you have. And pay for the call, just as I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same applies for Skype App on Mac. Why on earth this is not the case on iPad, remains a mystery. As many other ways Microsoft is making our lives hard. One reason I am able to call my friends the way I want also with a Computer. That is a Mac, not PC
 :-).</p>

<h2>            turning off autofill suggested email addresses Outlook 2016</h2>
                    In the good old days before the change to Outlook 2016, the only suggestions that came up when I was sending an email were to people I regularly contact.&nbsp; Now it turns up EVERY email I've ever used.&nbsp; This is especially aggravating when I'm using my iphone
 because the screen isn't large enough to allow me to see many of the suggestions.&nbsp; I want to stop this "feature" but can't find the appropriate tabs, etc., mentioned in the responses.&nbsp; I don't know why I don't see the options mentioned when I'm using my computer.&nbsp;
 I am running Microsoft Vista if that matters.

<h2>            Outgoing emails goes to Draft</h2>
                    <p>I can no longer send mail from either of&nbsp;my outlook.com mail accounts. When I hit the send button ( on either acct)&nbsp;the mail goes to drafts folder and remain there no matter what I do. I notice when I go options&gt;accounts&gt;connected accounts&gt;manage your connected

 the same thing.</p>
<p>Please tell me how to correct these issues</p>

<h3> solanumtinker  say:</h3>
<h2>            I was wondering if MSN.com realise that auto opt in is illegal with the EU&#63;</h2>
                    When I clicked on MSM.Com a pop up said (paraphrasing)"That by continuing to use this site you agree to X Y Z for analytics ect." That style of agreement IS covered by EU LAW and IS ILLEGAL. It has to be a manual opt in with all the relevant sections covered
 and link DIRECTLY from that pop up.<br />
<br />
The "Learn More" is not enough to get around that and the "by continuing" is covered as not being compliant. There has to be a button to click on that says agree and it CANNOT be selected by default.
<br />
<br />
IS MSN aware of this? The hammer has not dropped on such sites as of yet, but it is coming.

    <title>E71X looses MEdia Net &#40;and other problems&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffny---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E71X looses MEdia Net &#40;and other problems&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>About 4 days ago I could not get my E71X to access the AT&amp;T MEdia Net content (news, weather, ect). I eventullally figured it was using my WiFi connection instead of the AT&amp;T 3G connection for internet (althought Google Maps still worked when I had no WiFi
 connection!!???). So I set the phone to "Always Ask", so now I get these 4 choices when I open the phones web browser I have to manually select one of these:</p>
<p>- Operator "Proxyless"<br />
- Uncatagorized - 1 access point<br />
- Search for WLAN<br />
- Internet - MEdia Net</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can't I just get the phone to use the 3G access unless that is unavailable, then use a WiFi connection??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And can anyone tell me what "Operator "Proxyless"" is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also been trying to find some good apps to run on my Symbian S60 E71X, I am not having much luck. Any good web sites out there? I am not even sure how to get apps into the phone!! I tired using Bluetooth to copy a picture from my Mac to the phone
 and even though it looked like it copied I could not find it in my phone. I eventually found one copy in my email, and the E71X could not even open the TIFF file. The AT&amp;T music player in the E71X is AWFUL!! I listen to 4 hour long Howard Stern shows I record
 off Sirius. But there is now way to fast forward in this player (that I can see)! On my iPod I just click and scroll to the hour/minute and press play. Why is there no way to do this on the E71X????? And a 2.5mm audio jack (on the SIDE of the phone no less)!!
 What are you guys at Nokia thinking? So to use all my headphones and ear buds I need to carry around a 3.5 to 2.5 adapter, and hope I don't lose it? Crazy. And this Clock app, why such a tiny analog clock? Why no options for larger analog or digital clocks?
 And doesn't the Clock app even show the date!??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the E71X is not an Apple product or iPhone. But it clearly shows why Apple is taking the cell phone business by storm. Every day I seem to have some technial issue I am trying to figure out (taking a lot of time out of my day). That's from someone
 whos been building and using computers for over 30 years...forget about a novice. And where are the apps? And how do I get them into the E71X from my Mac (a couple apps I did see require PC Suite)? And are there any good (non-MEdia Net) cell phone web pages
 (with or without video)? I am wondering why I need to spend $30 bucks a month for intenet. Can the E71E play podcasts? I saw an app for that somewhere but the app appeared to be two years old and I could not see where to download it. Why can't I charge the
 phone by the USB port??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really want to like the E71X.....but I when I compare it my sisters iPhone (it's interface, apps, media integration) I am coming to the conclsion, the E71X is good for one thing: making phone calls, and not much else, unless you want to spend a lot of
 time trying to jump through hoops and searching online on how to get things to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            ....oh, and I am just curious. Can someone tell me why is it to use my Nokia E71X as a Bluetooth modem with my OS X PowerBook do I need to use the script called "Nokia Infrared"? That just makes no sence.....

            I just discoverd another issue. If I enter an event iCal on my computer and sync my calander to the Calandar in my E71X the event won't sync to the E71X &gt;&gt;UNLESS&lt;&lt; the event is set to repeat. And if I set an event to "repeat", say, every year then it will
 then copy when I sync...if I then set 'repeat' to "None" and sync again and the evet dissapears from my phones calander......grrrrrrrrr

<p>I also discovered, besides using an incompatible 2.5mm audio jack, there appears to no way to get video out of the E71X.....so you can use video glasses like those available from myvu.com, is that correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It'd be fun to what YouTube or other web video on myvu glasses.....and I suppose there is no app to let you easily sync your MP3's and "MP4" vidoes (or podcasts if you could play them) from your computer to the E71X (either by Bluetooth or USB)?? Apple saw
 the need to get video out of portable devices some time ago, yet my just released E71X does not even attempt to address this ability?</p>

<p>Three other questions (and one solution):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Is there a way to turn off that incessant beeping (or turn it down) EVERY TIME you press the "Navi Key" [or "scroll key"] to move the cursor around the screen?? I am trying not to annoy people around me and when I am trying to use the web browser and
 my phone just keeps going BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP with every tiny cursor movement......grrrrrr....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Can I change the font size in Address Book? I have never worn glasses but at 47 now my eyes are not what they used to be when reading close up. I just bought a pair of those $1 eye glasses at the dollar store in fact for reading. Those tiny labels in
 (Mobile, Tel.(home), Tel.(work)) are hard to read, in fact I called the wrong number today because I had trouble read the tiny font in Address Book! Can I change the font size and or text color? Are there other Address Book apps out there I can download and
 try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Is there a way to bookmark MEdiaNet video content? I like to check the Weather Channel but it takes 62 "clicks" to pull it up on my E71X!! Why can't I create a "short cut" icon on my main menu I can just click ONCE to pull this up? Having to click 62
 times is ridiculous...especially when there seems no way to turn off that Navi Key beeping...BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP....did you guys at Nokia actually spend some time using the E71X before shipping it??</p>
<p>(Select MEdiaNet as ISP (4 clicks), open Bookmarks (3 clicks), goto MEdiaNet (4 clicks), select "Video" (21 clicks), "News and Weather" (23 clicks), "The Weather Channel" (3 clicks), "Your Current Conditions" (4 clicks))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find out how to fast forward through MP3's in the "AT&amp;T Music" app, you hold the right side of the "Navi Key"...</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Ok, I finally found out how to turn off the beeping of the "Navi Key", it's under:</p>
<p>Settings/Config./General/ Personalization /Tones/Keypad Tones</p>
<p>...three levels and off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also found the setting to change the tiny tiny analog clock (with no minute marks.... seriously this "clock" is just a tiny 3/8" blue disk). It was 12:17 when I switched the display to "digital". It's worse than the disk! The E71X has a LCD display that
 is a couple inches wide and tall and Nokia only uses 5% of that screen area for the time display...in the "Clock" application! AND the number sets are connected making them VERY hard to read! The bottom of the "1" and left side of the "2" are actually CONNECTED.
 I did not even know I was looking at numbers when I first saw it! The same goes for the second pair of numbers, when you have a 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 or 9 as the last digit parts of the number abut the right side of the 3rd digit. This in insane. I would love to know
 the name of the guy at Nokia who designed this idiotic "Clock" app where the time display is made as tiny as possible and jammed up into the top left corner of the LCD display....while 90% of the display remains black and unused. Are there any 3rd party Clock
 apps? This one from Nokia needs to be deleted right off the phone. It's USLESS.</p>

<p>I really hate to keep complaining about the E71X. But as I try and figure out some of the things on this phone I am just dumbfounded at the way some of the things look and work. The phone needs a seriously re-done Address Book and Clock (among other improvments).
 And I did not even get into some of the demo "game" apps on this phone, where some of the text appears to be only a few pixels tall....on a phone that appears to have an LCD display approching 100 dpi........insane. Well, if this is the best smart-phone interface
 Nokia can come up with Apple has nothing to worry about. And I REALLY do want to like my E71X. But I will tell you, the ONLY thing keeping me from getting an iPhone is the $60/mo AT&amp;T data plan.</p>

<p>Another bad "user experiance" with the Nokia E71X...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We go to my girlfriends mothers saturday. She lives way out in the country. Virtually no AT&amp;T signal, let alone a 3G signal. Ok, she has WiFi. I go to connect to that.....opps, it's password protected. Ok, someone has to go down to the basement to get the
 NetGear box, the password is written on it. Ok I get the random 10 digit password and enter it...Ok I now have WiFi access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple hours later I go to use the WiFi again. Guess what? My Nokia E71X didn't automatically remember the password! Someone has to now go back down to the basement to get the box and password again so I can enter it AGAIN. eeeeee......why would this phone
 not remember WiFi hot spot passwords?? Does Nokia REALLY think people can remember random character passwords???? Crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did figure out I could MANUALLY add a "Destination" [aka "WiFi Hot Spot"....who at Nokia came up with "Destination"??]. You have to manually click into "Settings / Config. / "Destinations".... then save the password MANUALLY.&nbsp;Buy the way, the Nokia E71X
 appears to remember the WiFi hot spots I used....just not their passwords!!! Dumb!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also use my sisters iPhone to get my 10 year old nephews new cell phone #. What a nice thing to use....you just go in there, run your finger down the screen until you get the name you want.....and you can actually READ the names!! Unlike the text on the
 E71X address book that is insanely tiny tiny!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought Nokia was opening an app store last week? I really want to get a new Address Book and Clock app for my E71X. I'd also like to find a way to have WEP passwords automatically saved! And find a way to get icons on the main menu to automate access
 to favorite web pages with just one click....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on Nokia, you guys need to step up your software game.....the E71X next to an iPhone is like a DOS box next to OS X.......but you could easily fix a lot of shortcoming with some new software.....</p>

<div><span>More E71X dumbness.....</span><br />
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the Camera app on the E71X. How do take a picture or record video? The left and right "Selection" keys are not used to trigger a picture or video taking. And if you go to Help it says to use the "Capture Key" for pictures and the "Record Key" for
 video. Well, WHAT KEYS ARE THOSE??????? The "Camera" app, another piece of crapware on for the E71....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally found the Ovi app store. The way Nokia has this apps "organized" (I use that term loosely!!) on their "store" is HORRENDOUS. The few apps I did download would not run on my BRAND NEW E71X. It would just say the apps are incompatible with my phone.
 Oh, and Nokia does not even have its own "Nokia Internet Radio" app on Ovi! I had to fine that elsewhere, along with the Nokia Podcast app. I installed them.&nbsp; The Nokia Podcast software would not even run on my (brand new) E71!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to download the Java version of Handmarks PocketExpres from their web site. It says "Available for Palm, Symbian, Windows Media, Java, Brew, Blackberry". But when you go to download it there is no clear version marked for Symbian, after try a
 couple that would not work I just downloaded the Java version. And even then I hand trouble getting this app to do &gt;&gt;anything&lt;&lt;. Pressing the center Navi key has no effect. I finally figured out you have to press the tiny Return key on the E71X. And the ONLY
 thing I think I was able to get to work was the Weather. This is a pretty **bleep** app on the E71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after wasting a couple hours of frustrating time trying to find some apps for my E71X I found ONE that I was able to get working, "Nokia Internet Radio". Unbelievable. It is also amazing the number of totally useless web sites there are that claim to
 have apps for the Symbian S60!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apps for the Symbian S60 E71X are a DISASTER. You can't find them and the ones you do find are **bleep** and usually don't run at all or have issues with the keys on the E71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you guys at Nokia have any idea what a HORRIBLE user experience the E71X provides????? I have a list of other issues I did not even get into here too.....like why when making a call does the "Loudspeaker" button start off on the Left Selection Key.....then
 disappear while the line is ringing.....then re-appear on the RIGHT Selection key (which you have to wait to see and to press)????? Why??? Who is the user interface "genius" at Nokia who came up with this idiotic phone behavior???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should have just bought an iPhone. There is so much to the Nokia E71X that is downright ridiculous and annoying it's unbelievable. Again....I would love to know the names of the guys at Nokia who came up with this software and ridiculous user interface
 and how things "work". My God, you pick up an iPhone and you immediately appreciate the slick easy to use (and read) apps, where how to do things is obvious and easy.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E71X is a HUGE waste of time with **bleep** software and a horrible TINY user interface.</p>

            You, my friend, are a "whining little b***h"! I received a users guide and a getting started guide with my awesome e71x&nbsp;and 90% of your concerns can be found somewhere in one of them. I think you need to give me your&nbsp;"horrible" e71x, so I can give it to
 someone who with appreciate it, and go jump on the bandwagon and get your trendy iphone already. I bet that bought it on Amazon for .01 and are still not satisfied. Good luck and quit your whining, nobody cares!!

            I had to give you kudos as I agree 100% with you.&nbsp; While I don't have the "x" flavor, I didn't have any trouble figuring out my E71 - between google &amp; the owner's manual I pretty much figured everything out on my own.&nbsp; Geez.&nbsp; And I'm an old lady-LOL.

            Extending on Steve's reply, OS X does not permit deleting files while using the Open or Save As dialogs available in the programs you use. You must use an OS X Finder window to navigate to the location where the file is stored &amp; delete it from there.<br />

            Drag the file to the trash, just as you would any other file you want to delete from your Mac.
<div><br />
<div>But if you mean the list of files you see in File | Open Recent or the like, there's probably some way of removing it by editing your prefs file but that's a whole lot more complex to sort out than it's probably worth. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>But try PowerPoint | Preferences and either remove the check next to Track recently opened documents or change Display XX documents to a lower number.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or if it's set to, say, 10, open some other presentation, save and close it.</div>
<div>Repeat until you've shoved the unwanted file off the recent list.</div>

The part you left out is that you have hundreds of these addresses and they each have very little in common that could be used as a point to make the split.&nbsp; Right?</p>
<p>Do you have a few more examples that might represent the majority of the addresses?</p>
<p>Any chance there could be something in common that could be used as a split point?</p>
