<h2>            Best Windows Movie Maker replacement  for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does Windows have an app to replace Movie Maker for Windows 10? I would buy it right now if I knew where to get it.</p>
<p>I have tried a couple of products I found on the internet and they are complicated and don't have the ease and elegance that Windows Movie Maker had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...has anyone found a replacement that works just like Movie Maker did?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>"Not Supported" means if you cannot get it to work on your own, no one will officially assist you from the company(ies) involved. &nbsp;Steering a vehicle with your feet and operating the pedals with your hands is "not supported" in most vehicles - doesn't mean
 you could not make it work - but if you do, the manufacturers are not responsible for any issues you might run into (perhaps literally.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Not supported" has never meant (that I know of) that something will not work - just means you cannot expect support from whomever is telling you it is not supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply did a Google search originally (Bing would probably have worked too... perhaps even Yahoo or another search engine) to locate the Microsoft web page I pointed you to. &nbsp;Why doesn't Microsoft make it more prominent that Windows Movie Maker is available?
 &nbsp;I guess that depends on your point of view as to whether it was prominent already or not (I would say it was - I didn't do more than type in Windows Movie Maker Windows 10 in a web search engine and found that link) and what realistic expectations you have
 in terms of making it more prominently displayed for the public. &nbsp;Also, it is not supported (as stated) in the environment mentioned/being researched - so I guess that is a good reason not to 'advertise' it, eh?</p>

<h2>            Do I need WinZIP Disk Tools&#47;Registry Optimizer on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've Windows Defender, do I then need WinZIP? I'm not subscribed to WinZIP and don't know what it does for my computer other than goes through it and say it can update or clear it from unneeded files/programs, but it dosen't clear it or so because I'm not&nbsp;subscribed
 to it.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm curious and are begins to get annoyed of it poping up when I start my PC, search through it and then don't do much more then say this need to be fix but it won't do it unless I pay. I can pay for
 it, it is just that I need to know if it worth it or not.</p>

<h2>            Which flash drive is best for xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a pny flash drive from krogers with 16 gb on it, once i got home, i configured it to work on my xobx; it worked for apx. 2 days, one afternoon i get on the xbox and the flash drive doesn't show up as a storage device. So I bought another one, the
 same flash drive from the same krogers, the same thing happened after 1 day of me configuring the device, please leave your comments on how I can prevent this or help in any way.</p>

<p>If I'm not mistaken, the USB drives go to sleep on the console when not in use. Did you take it out, re-insert it, and the still didn't read?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway, flash drives are notorious for failing, but using a name brand will probably reduce the chances. I just went to Office Depot and bought a 16GB flash drive that was under $15.</p>

<p>It's still working. Kingston, I think it is.</p>

<p>I agree Sandisk is a great USB Flash drive to use with your console. &nbsp;I use them on my PC and quite frankly they are the only ones that I typically use. &nbsp;I have used others but they seem to just fall apart or stop working entirely. &nbsp;Sandisk ones hasn't done
 any of that to me yet. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Why would you buy another one???? &nbsp; Take the product along with the receipt back to Krogers. &nbsp; &nbsp;A defective device refund or exchange is warranted. &nbsp; &nbsp; (Kroger sells Scandisk and Kingston along with the store brand) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May I ask why not just get a HDD?

            My daughter is listed as an adult and I need to change her to a child. &nbsp;The only way I can see to do that is to delete her adult account and add her as a child account. &nbsp;What are the repercussions of doing that? &nbsp;

<h2>            Xbox 360 ne s&#38;&#35;39&#59;allume plus </h2>
                    
<p>bonsoir,</p>
<p>J'ai nettoyé ma console xbox 360 Premium cette aprem avec un sopalin et un peu d'eau ainsi que le DD avec un coup d'aspi.</p>
<p>Résultat de cette brillante idée : La console ne s'alliume plus. Aucun signaux lumineux que ce soit par le bouton ou la manette ( elle s'allume la manette mais pas la console. )</p>
<p>Le boitier d'alim est en orange fixe et je doute que le problème vienne du boitier que je n'ai pas nettoyé.</p>
<p>Je rajoute que j'entend un petit composant se balader quand je secoue la box...</p>
<p>Dois je la faire reparer? J'y tiens notamment a mes succès et mon profil donc racheter une box ne m'enchante pas...</p>

<p>Quelles sont les solutions/ Démarche?</p>

<p>Cordialement.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 failed to reset wifi after storm.</h2>
                    Windows 10 lost wifi after storm.&nbsp; Recycled everything (router, modem, computer) twice.&nbsp; Wifi was up and working with other devices.&nbsp; W10 kept refusing to get to the wifi, each time the problem solver telling me to cycle the router.&nbsp; Wrong! Did that twice.
 &nbsp; I finally restored to Windows 7 and everything worked fine with no problem.&nbsp; Microsoft can let me know when this gets fixed.&nbsp; It's impossible to communicate with Microsoft, even to report a bug in their product.

<h2>            Question about Xbox Live Gold Family Pack converting on the 27th</h2>
                    
<p>My Gold Family membership was set to renew on 3/5/2014. What will happen to the remaining time that I paid for? Also will I be able to sign up for home gold without xbox 1? I do plan on eventually buying the xbox 1 but It will probaly be a few to several
 months after its release.</p>

<p>Your remaining time gets converted into regular, separate Xbox Live memberships for the accounts on your console for either the remaining duration or longer (I recall someone mentioning you get an extra 3 months but I can't confirm that and doubt it).</p>
<p>I believe it would just change the auto renew to a different, single account membership. I'd just turn off auto renew as the Family Pack is being removed and it won't let you buy it.</p>
<p>I'm unsure about home gold however as I am not sure whether Microsoft has planned to release the plan for 360.</p>

<p>I can confirm they are giving away extra 3 months. You can read more about the conversion here -

<p>Currently Home Gold has only been announced for the Xbox One. You would have to have individual subscriptions on the 360.</p>

<p>I also got the message about xbox cancelling the family membership. I read teh FAQ and yes, we get 3 months free... &nbsp;My questions... so am I back to paying $60 a year X4 accounts because we play on several consoles? (We have 2 just in house, my son likes
 to go game at his friends houses, plus going to the LAN center....this is a gaming family) &nbsp;And can someone explain this gold home thing? I can't find any info on it to see how it's going to be different. &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't have a pre-order for the new xbox (so prolly
 won't have it right at release). Is this going to affect play on the 360 at all? &nbsp;I'm hoping I can use my same account for both systems....</p>
<p>anyone? &nbsp;I'm feeling very lost with this. </p>

<p>So then my families accounts will be converted to regular gold and should be good for another 10 months than correct t? From August to September is 7 months plus the 3 additional bonus months. Then after 10 months I just have to worry about what I will do
 if I don't buy the xbox 1 to get the home gold.</p>

<p>@ZombieDad001 - That's correct. </p>
<p>@syrensilly - Once the family plan is completely cancelled, it will go back to how it was before it started. You'll be back to purchasing individual subscriptions for each account. It would be best to keep an eye out for deals on prepaid cards. You can almost
 always find them on sale for $30-35. &nbsp;The Home Gold thing will only be for Xbox One. There's not a lot of information out about it yet, but basically if you were to have a gold subscription on the console, that subscription would cover all accounts using that
 console. The Home Gold will not be available on the 360, so you would still need individual subscriptions on that console. Regular gold subscriptions will work on both consoles though so you can still use your account on both.</p>

<p>Total rip off, I'm now paying 4 times the amount that someone with a xbox 1 or ps4 would pay. Expected Microsoft to look after its customers instead I feel like I'm being forced to buy the xbox 1. afraid it will be ps4 next time.</p>

            <p>Hey there, CreepyShoe46! While you would be paying more than Xbox One users, understand that Playstation users need to pay for PS+ now to do everything that the Xbox One users do, and there currently isn't a way to share the premium account features like there is on the Xbox One.

    <title>Printing to brother HL-2140 on print server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielannetta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing to brother HL-2140 on print server</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>I am having issues printing to my brother hl2140 printer. My printer is connected to my home network via the USB port on my NAS. The NAS acts&nbsp;as a print server. With any other pc I have added it as a printer on a network and used the normal brother drivers
 from there.&nbsp;A few thing to add.&nbsp;If I&nbsp;connect the printer directly to my surface 2 it works fine. It uses "brother laser leg type1", however when I use this driver to connect it as a network printer (which it does see) it does not work. It seem to fully run
 through the installation process but I can't even print a test page. When I looked at the brother support site it says for RT to use "brother laser leg type 2" driver which I can't find. Its basically missing from my driver list. I am also up to date with
 all windows updates. Really appreciate if anyone can help </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi - the reason you have not been able to find it is because I mistook what should have been IJ for U. I have found the driver listed on this download site (http://www.driverscape.com/download/brother-ij-leg-type2-class-driver) but it is not a site I have
 used before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found this (http://support.brother.com/g/s/id/pdf_pub/win8_winRT/builtin_driver_name_list.pdf) - not sure how up-to-date it is as my printer is not listed but it might help the search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel - I am assuming that you have tried the Advanced Print Setup option - this offers a list of Brother drivers and, with a bit of research on the Brother website I found the one that was needed (http://support.brother.com/g/b/faqend.aspx?c=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfcj6520dw_us_eu_as&amp;faqid=faq00003050_000#network).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the relevant page from the same source for the network connection of your printer&nbsp;</p>
<p>(http://support.brother.com/g/b/faqend.aspx?c=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=hl2140_all&amp;faqid=faq00003050_001#network)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Windows logs me on with a temporary profile</h2>
                    I have an ASUS laptop which keeps logging me on to a temporary profile. I tried renaming the profile's temp profile to bak and using the original profile. This did not work, it kept reverting to the temp profile. I was able to create a new profile on the
 computer, this worked for a while then the new profile starting logging in as a temp profile. Any new ideas for me?&nbsp;

</span><span>Kelly,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This problem occurs if the current user's profile was accidentally deleted from the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to
 modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry
 if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;1. Log on to the system by using an administrative user account other than the user account that is experiencing the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Back up all data in the current user's profile folder if the profile folder still exists, and then delete the profile folder. By default, the profile resides
 in the following location:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>%SystemDrive%\Users\UserName</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Locate the following registry subkey:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Under the ProfileList subkey, delete the subkey that is named SID.bak.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note SID is a placeholder for the security identifier (SID) of the user account that is experiencing the problem. The SID.bak subkey should contain a ProfileImagePath
 registry entry that points to the original profile folder of the user account that is experiencing the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. Exit Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7. Log off the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>8. Log on to the system again.</span></p>

<p><span>Windows</span> ReadyBoost can use storage space on some
removable media devices, such as
USB flash drives, to speed up your computer. When you insert a compatible device, the AutoPlay dialog box will offer you the option to speed up your system using
<span>Windows</span> ReadyBoost.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Plug a flash drive or other removable media device into your computer. This should automatically open AutoPlay.</p>
<p>If AutoPlay does not open, it might have been disabled. For more information, see
Troubleshoot AutoPlay problems.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <span>General Options</span>, click <span>
Speed up my system</span>.</p>
<p>This will display the Properties dialog box for your flash drive or other removable media device.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>ReadyBoost</span> tab, and then do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To turn ReadyBoost off, click <span>Do not use this device</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To turn ReadyBoost on, click <span>Use this device</span>, and then move the slider to choose how much of the available space on your flash drive you want to reserve for boosting your system speed.</p>

            HI Eric.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can run the Printer Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC. 
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.   
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.   
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot.
<br />

    <title>Black Screen when computer is awakened from sleep mode following - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axxxtw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen when computer is awakened from sleep mode following Windows 10 Anniversary Install</h2>
                    <p>Computer worked fine and dandy with Windows 10.&nbsp; When computer came out of sleep mode the wonderful Windows Spotlight picture was there as was the time and date; a description of the picture; and also questions as to if I like the picture or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMMEDIATLEY after "upgrade" to Anniversary Edition of Windows 10, when computer comes out of sleep mode, BLACK SCREEN but with text (time and date; description of picture; do I like the picture or not) and when mouse is moved or keyboard hit, taken to log
 in screen with Windows Update picture and no issue with logging into my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent over NINE hours on the phone with "support" under SRX1350570662ID.&nbsp; All the last guy did was log into my machine; download the ISO (he hung the phone up after I answered, stating he would call me back which he never did) and run it.&nbsp; PERIOD.&nbsp;
 He texted me in the text chat window that he KNEW there were corrupted files.&nbsp; Funny, the problem remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding insult to injury, he never phoned me back and every time I phone 800 642 7676 for assistance I am thrown into level 1 loop and get nowhere, always being told I will be called back.&nbsp; I have not been called back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Goodness.&nbsp; The machine worked just dandy before the Anniversary "upgrade".&nbsp; When will a real tech contact me who knows what they are doing instead of someone reading from a script and GUESSING what to do????</p>

</p><p>Why has Microsoft repeatedly lied to me about this matter and refuses to act on support case
<span>
1350570662?&nbsp; Nobody has phoned me since the "tech" simply downloaded the iso and ran it.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue I confront is NOT that
 I cannot access my machine:&nbsp; I CAN.&nbsp; The issue is the reality that when the computer "wakes" from "sleep" mode I have a black screen, coupled with all the correct text; I can access my login screen which DOES have the "Windows Spotlight" picture and I can
 login to my system.</span></p>
<p><span>Thus far the "suggestions" are at
 best redundant and do NOT address my issue and at worst are an utter waste of time.&nbsp; It is darn frustrating.</span></p>
<p><span>I'd rather work with an answer like
 "We don't know.&nbsp; We're aware of this problem as it has been reported by 4,000,000+ other users and we're working on it" instead of layering one OS on top of another.&nbsp; The registry must be so jacked up at this point it is beyond amusing.</span></p>

<p>My pc updated today 2016 10 18 with the anniversary upgrade. When it went to sleep it failed to wake up with a black screen. It did it a second time. Each time I pressed my reset button and it then effectively started from what was a shutdown and I had to
 log in and open my files which have obviously suffered the equivalent of a power cut.</p>
<p>I'm so far not impressed that Microsoft has owned the problem and the link above doesn't sound like you understand the problem at all. Please let me know when you have sorted this mess out. My computer was new this year with a new windows ten purchase, not
 an upgrade.</p>

            <p>1. &nbsp;Yes I am referring to a third party application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. With the Comfort 5000, I was able to change the functionality of various shortcut buttons on the keyboard. &nbsp;To change the calculator app, all I had to do was go to the Mouse and Keyboard Center, go to basic settings, scroll down to calculator and then
 browse to select the app I wanted it to open. &nbsp;I tried to do these steps with the Scuplt, but I don't see where it's anything that plain and simple.</p>

            I too would like a solution to this as the Win10 native calculator app is lacking. &nbsp;It also, when you press the calculator button, launches the calculator but doesn't make it active. &nbsp;So if you start typing numbers they are in the previously active app,
 not the calculator.

<h2>            windows xp update caused my computer to blue screen and now will not start. </h2>
                    windows xp update caused my computer to blue screen and now will not start.&nbsp; There have been no changes to my system hardware or software otherwise.&nbsp; After installing the windows updates it asked to reboot the computer.&nbsp; Upon restart the computer blue
 screens and goes to the prompt menu for safe mode and last known working configuration.&nbsp; None of these work, not safe mode or otherwise.&nbsp; The only thing it will do now upon turning on is quickly flash the blue screen and restart again to this prompt menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This is really annoying as I have important work files on this computer and cannot afford to reformat it!&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my trust into using windows and keeping it updated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon installing your updates it has made my system fail, and will not restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going
 to be highly upset if this windows xp update causes me to have to reformat, and lose important work files!&nbsp;
<br />

            I ordered the XP disk from Dell and did the re-install. It is working fine now. The Dell support tech had me do some updates from the web as well. I haven't had any problems since. What ever happened with the automatic updates completely wiped out my operating
 system. At least I don't have to buy a new computer. <br />
<br />
If nothing else works, try reinstalling your operating system. That worked for me.

<p><span>You can&nbsp;borrow and use a&nbsp;Microsoft Vista DVD (Retail or OEM System Builders License)&nbsp;, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop
 case&nbsp;determines which Edition is installed. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>
