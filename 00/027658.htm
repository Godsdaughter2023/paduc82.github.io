<h2>            Archive quota &#38; Time</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled archive feature for a Office 365 Business Premium&nbsp;account and&nbsp;archive quota is 25 GB not 50 GB. The mailbox is full but after a few days enabling, only 300 KB data moved to archive&nbsp;mailbox . Why is it so slow? How do I make it faster?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi BrendaTon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the SR and our engineer had replied you as the followings:</p>
<p><span>"Based my understanding, the issues you may encounter before are:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Archive quota is 25GB.</span></li><li><span>Archive performance is slow when enable default retention policy.</span></li><li><span>After selecting "Personal 1 year move to archive" for Deleted Items folder and running the command "Start-ManagedFolderAssistant -Identity "alias". Messages received from 06/08/2015 still
 exist in the folder.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to explain these one by one.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Archive quota is 25GB, which is incompatible with the 50GB limits.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>Ans:
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Archive mailbox Provision sometimes are done gradually in the backend. Hence, your archive quota can be 25GB initially. But now from the log (badone.txt), it behaved normally.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Slow archiving performance.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Ans:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow archiving performance is the main issue we need to address in this case as it may impact your business.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>In the forum thread, you mentioned that “The mailbox is full but after a few days enabling, only 300 KB data moved to archive&nbsp;mailbox&nbsp;”. Does this problem still exist?&nbsp; As we check
 from the backend today, the totalitemsize is 14.74GB. In the last day, it was less than 10GB. which shows that the archive mailbox size is increasing gradually and normally.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d148886f-7725-48de-849f-2277aabe93ee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d148886f-7725-48de-849f-2277aabe93ee" /></a><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>You can also monitor this by yourself. Use the PS below after connecting to Exchange online powershell:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Get-MailboxStatistics -Identity (this is where you type the Email address) -archive | fl
</span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>In this way, you can check how many items have flow into your archive mailbox.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>We can also check the totalitemsize of primary mailbox from the log – badone02.txt, the affected mailbox’s totalitemsize is now 34.7GB. It is not a nearly full mailbox anymore, specifying
 that archive function are working.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82632611-8fd8-4c03-a3f2-d732b04f8be7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82632611-8fd8-4c03-a3f2-d732b04f8be7" /></a><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the thread, you also mention that after using command: Start-ManagedFolderAssistant -Identity "alias", “Messages received from 06/08/2015 still exist in the folder.”
</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Here, I would like to clarify the function of ” Start-ManagedFolderAssistant”. When your mailbox size is smaller than 10MB, using this command can manually move messages to the archive.
 But when the size of mailbox is larger than 10MB (in this scenario, the affected mailbox is nearly full at start, which is far more than 10MB), the retention policy run automatically onetime every seven days, even when using this command. That is to say, using
 this command to force the task only works when the mailbox size is smaller than 10MB.

            Hi sachin and thank you &nbsp;for your response. My communication may not be very techno savvy. &nbsp;I dont think I downloaded any app to my tablet I just signed up through the internet. &nbsp;The toolbar appears on my laptop outlook and I have microsoft office on my
 laptop. &nbsp;I dont have microsoft office on my tablet and could this be the the issue do you think?

    <title>Outlook 2016 will not send emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janellethomlinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 will not send emails</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed Outlook 2016 on my computer and have it linked to my Office 365 work email account. &nbsp;Just about everything works, all the folders are visible, messages come in as expected and everything appears to sync, however emails from Outlook 2016
 do not send. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know if they are getting stuck in the Outbox because my Office 365 account does not have an Outbox showing on the OWA or in Outlook 2016. &nbsp; After pressing send the message just appears to go away, never shows in the Sent folder or arrives at its
 destination. &nbsp; Note that messages sent from this account on the web app or from my phone work fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a personal Outlook.com account linked to Outlook 2016 and everything works perfect from that account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>For your above troubleshooting tips:</p>
<p>1) New Outlook profile:</p>

<p>Attempt to start Outlook: &nbsp;"Microsoft Outlook has stopped working; A Problem caused the program to stop working correctly, Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."</p>
<p>3) sfc / scanow: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Verification 100% complete.....</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>2) Microsoft Supoprt and Recovery Assistant: </p>
<p>Test #1: &nbsp;Office 365 Connectivity Failed on IPv4</p>
<p>Test #2: &nbsp; Office 365 readiness checks all passed (including Network connectivity, verify sign-in credentials, Domain registration checks, Remote job: Tenant and account information, Protocol status enabled for your office 365 user, Autodiscover), &nbsp;Outlook
 installed version, etc) - "System settings look fine"</p>
<p>Running recovery.... </p>
<p>Cleared credentials and re-entered; Outlook has re-started and is updating folders....</p>
<p>Test email DOES NOT SEND</p>
<p>Running Recovery - Outlook started in Safe Mode</p>
<p>Test email SENT CORRECTLY</p>
<p>Restarting outlook in Normal Mode</p>
<p>Test email DOES NOT SEND</p>
<p>Disabling Outlook Add-ins: &nbsp;McAfee Email Scan, Outlook Change Notifier, Team Viewer Meeting Add In</p>
<p>Test email SENT CORRECTLY</p>
<p>Everything appears to be working now - in the end it looks like it was the Team Viewer Meeting add-in that was preventing the emails from sending. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<h3> jaysmi23nz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win X 10162 loading a seemingly unresponsive black screen with mouse pointer on boot</h2>
                    <p>I did the update from Build 10159 to 10162 and after the required restart I cannot get Windows properly started.<br />
<br />
On boot, we first see the BIOS, then the Windows loading logo, then the screen goes completely blank except for a movable mouse pointer where I would expect the Lock Screen.&nbsp;<br />
The mouse works across both of my screens, the sleep button on my keyboard sleeps and wakes like normal, and strangely enough if I mash SHIFT, the Activate Sticky Keys dialog appears fine. Same behaviour in Safe Mode/Low res mode so on the balance, I highly
 doubt a graphics driver issue.</p>
<p>I tried to blindly log in but if it worked, I don't know as nothing changed on screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dual boot with W8.1 and that works fine. I can browse the Win X partition no problems. Ran a chkdsk on the WinX from boot and while it said it fixed some errors, there is no change to my black screen problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any ideas? Otherwise looks like I'll be downloading and running the 10162 ISO afresh.</p>

    <title>When I try to open an excel file that is on a CD without copying to my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dustinyoder  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I try to open an excel file that is on a CD without copying to my computer first, I get a read only error.</h2>
                    This issue seems to be only in the newer versions of Excel.&nbsp; When opening with an older version I don't get the error message.&nbsp; Our clients are used to this old behavior, can we force the new Excel to open files without the need for writing to the disk
 when opening.&nbsp; I assume opening an xls file from any read-only drive will have this issue as well.&nbsp; I am using excel for mac version 15.18, but this issue also happens on a new windows computer, which I'm assuming is running a fairly new version of Excel as
 well. This problem opening files is happening with old excel files as well. We have files from years ago that used to open from CD, that now will not.&nbsp; Is there a workaround for this?&nbsp; Am I just doing something wrong?

            I am wondering about opening an Excel file that is currently stored on a CD.&nbsp; Is there any way to open that directly from the CD rather than copying locally?&nbsp; We had been able to do this in previous versions of Excel, but now we cannot.<br />

            <p>It is read-only because it would be impossible to save to a CD so any changes you make will be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can (a) copy from CD to hard drive or thumb drive, or (b) open in Excel from CD and immediately do a SaveAs to hard drive or thumb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps in the past you had a CD-R configured to allow writing. I have never used a CD to hold any files except for archival purposes, so I could be wrong.</p>
<p>

            I don't want to actually save the file again to the CD, I just want to be able to OPEN it at all from the CD directly.&nbsp; I think the new Excel version is trying to create a 'lock file' on the CD and so it fails to open saying the CD is read-only.&nbsp; Why in
 the world would it be impossible to OPEN a file because the disk is READ-ONLY. nice.&nbsp; Is anyone else able to open an excel file that is on a cd using Mac Excel v15.18 or later?&nbsp; I think this happens in Office 2016 editions as well.

<p>You're kidding right? To change one email address, i have to check 7500 users???? The word "STEPS" should not even be needed in a process like this. How utterly absurd. How about you fix yammer so we just go in and change an email address for one user the
 same way as almost every service on the planet does?</p>

<h2>            Outlook In-Cell Column Editing Ability While in Date-Conversation View in Inbox</h2>
                    Hi Team,<br />
<br />
I'd really like to take advantage of the in-cell editing functionality for a custom column in Outlook. However it seems that this functionality does not work if your inbox is set to Date-Conversation view. I think the DC view is the only view that clearly organizes
 your conversations. Is there some kind of workaround that would allow me in-cell editing within the DC view?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Steve

<p>Hello PMSteve_2019,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using In-cell editing functionality, this depends on how you set up the data on the project. It would be better to provide us a screenshots and tell us how did you enable the in-cell editing
 so we can try it on our end. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Sherry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem as the OP.&nbsp; I cannot provide screen shots due to liability, but I followed the following link to the letter.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough when I toggle between to any other view (Categories, Name, Subject) I can add notes with no problem.&nbsp; It is only when I toggle to DC view that the option is no longer available</p>

            No. &nbsp;Apps running in the Preview will still run in the final. &nbsp;For Windows 7 and 8, check your Get Windows 10 app for programs that you will have to remove or will be removed by the installer during the upgrade. &nbsp;There haven't been many on my computers
 and they are typical ones like Backup programs.

<h2>            Odd issue with Excel with Macro crashing &#124; VBE7.DLL &#124; Please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm running out of options with the end-user I'm supporting in our firm so I'm hoping that you can give me some proper advice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our user reported that whenever he opens an Excel with macro, it will randomly crash. I mentioned randomly since he has tons of Macro enabled Excel files in our shared drive and he can open some of them. Now the weird thing is that whenever he experience
 an Excel file crashing, he will either ask his peers to re-send the file to him or have them re-save the same Excel file and it will work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really bizarre since if the macro enabled Excel file has an issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. His peers &nbsp;will NOT be able to open it</p>
<p>2. Why is that if the Excel file is re-sent via E-mail, he will be able to work on the file?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's his machine/ office setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 x64-bit</p>
<p>MS Office 2016</p>
<p>32GB RAM</p>
<p>Excel only has Bloomberg and Developer add-in</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've done extensive troubleshooting on this such as&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Repairing his Office. </li><li>He was initially Office 2013 before and I've upgraded it to Office 2016</li><li>Did this in Registry<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VBA\7.0\Common</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp;Type:&nbsp; DWORD</span><br />

<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp;Value:&nbsp; 0</span></li><li>We have even swapped his whole PC!&nbsp;</li><li>Disabled HW Acceleration via registry</li><li>Re-created Excel profile in Registry</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>This is what I can see in Event logs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pulling my hair on this issue and driving me nuts. Good thing that there's a workaround but still, it is hindering his daily tasks. He is the only one in their team having this issue!</p>

            Has anybody found a fix on this issue yet? Been playing around with patches and in some cases installing KB3172443 fixes the issue but in some still crashes. Must be a combination of several factors/patches but have not figured out the puzzle yet.
<br />
Really frustrating.

<h2>            Simple Function for Cumulative Sum</h2>
                    With all of the money behind MS, why can you not have a "simple" function than does a cumulative sum? I have used SigmaPlot for decades and it has a single function (cumsum) that you can use to get a simple cumulative sum of a column. I calculate growing
 degree days for grapes (mean daily temperature - 10C) from April 1 to October 31. Then sum the daily growing degree days (setting negatives to 0 - by hand - not that many and not that time consuming) from April 1 to October 31. I can find no simple way to
 do that in Excel

            <p>It would be better if you had an example to work with but excel does cumulatve sums</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No need to manually having to change growing days (assume that the first growing day in in A2, enter the following formula in B2 = max(0,A2) copy down formula</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now starting with B2 and you want to have a culmulative total starting in C2</p>
<p>enter the following formula in C2 = C1+B2 and copy that formula done (culmulative formula solved)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>

 not exactly an Office Web Apps issue. &nbsp;In fact, the problem is that the feature relies on a browser plug-in. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For Internet Explorer the ActiveX extension is either installed with Microsoft Office, or offered to be installed the first time you click the button.</p>
<p>For FireFox the browser add-on is installed alongside Microsoft Office 2010 provided that the Office Tool called "Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Support" is installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no plug-in is currently available for WebKit based browsers such as Safari or Chrome.</p>
<p>Other than "open in client" every feature of the Office Web Apps should be supported in Chrome. &nbsp;With Chrome, you should still be able to download a copy of your document and then open it directly in Microsoft Office. &nbsp;However doing this will not push your
 changes automatically to SkyDrive when you save.</p>

<p>To print multiple badges/labels for multiple people you would generally start with a single badge/label layout on your Publisher page and then do a mail merge and print
<em>multiple pages per sheet.&nbsp;</em>This would then give you 6 badges with 6 different names when you printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to print just one badge for one person and print it to a label on a partially used sheet of labels then you should create a new Publisher page with 6 labels on the page that matches your sheet of labels. Then if you want to print to any specific
 label/badge on the sheet, you will fill out the badge information on just the label in that location on the page and do a standard print rather than a merge. You might want to print to a regular piece of paper the same size as your labels sheet and make sure
 everything aligns before you waste any labels.</p>

<h2>            Trojan horse message popped up</h2>
                    I had a nessage pop up while using a site i commonly use on microsoft edge. There was an alarming noise on the computer and a message popped up say "this site says" and explained that there was a trojan horse virus. I did ctrl+alt+delete and immediately
 ended microsoft edge. I started a scan but im concerned i actually have the virus. Does anybody know what happened? What should i do?? Would windows defender detect a trojan?

<p>
 for this problem is that you have conflicting security software still installed fully or partially on the PC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<p>
 Norton, Trend Micro?&nbsp; If you reformatted/reinstalled the operating system did you also reinstall a trial version of a security program? &nbsp;Did you remove such programs to include using the appropriate removal tool (McAfee Removal Tool, Norton Removal Tool, etc)
 and then reboot the computer?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/2bcb53f7-7ab4-4ef9-ab3a-6aebfa322f75" title="This document is intended for assisting those using Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.

<h2>            Project Server 2010 does not open MS Project file in Project Professional 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have Microsoft Project Server 2010 with sevice pack 1 installed and am using Microsoft Project Professional 2010. When I try to open a project for editing in Project Professional from the Project Server 'Project Center', Project Professional 2010 launches,
 but the project selected in Project Server&nbsp;does not open in the Project Professional window. This problem does not occur for other users whose permissions appear to be configured the same as mine. Any idea what might be causing this error for me? Is there
 perhaps an installation error affecting the way Project Server and Project Professional interplay on my computer?
</p>
<p>I can open and edit the Project file from the server if I open the file directly in Project Professional 2010 (i.e., don't launch Project Professional from Project Server).</p>

</p><p>I installed Windows 10 today but now I'm unable to send emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Outlook 2013 from Office 365. I can receive emails and all other programmes are functioning normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled my anti-virus software (to ensure that is not adding complications), but no effect. I've also removed Add-ins from Outlook. Also tried starting Outlook as Administrator (just in case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When 'sending' fails, I get error code Ox800CCC13 "Cannot connect to the network ..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two email accounts on Outlook and neither can send emails.</p>

            myself and a friend have done the same.&nbsp; I contacted MS Tech support desk to no avail.&nbsp; they suggested the ISP was at fault but I tried setting up my email on a Windows 8.1 laptop and it worked fine.&nbsp; definitely a Windows 10 related issue.&nbsp; in searching
 the internet I did see a post about having to reinstall office after one of the upgrade but I had assume this was fixed as it was dated December.&nbsp; I wonder now if we have to reinstall Office to resolve the issue.&nbsp; I am not keen but may have to try this if
 no other help comes.

            I need emails ASAP so I have installed eM Client.&nbsp; It's free and it imports everything from Outlook.&nbsp; I am now up and running until the problem is resolved.&nbsp; Interestingly it claimed my imported file had been corrupted!&nbsp; So I suspect that Windows 10 install
 has somehow done this as it worked before.

            <p>I tried running sfc /scannow as a last resort, but just after it declared it had found and repaired a file, the computer re-started, but never made it to through boot process. After many attempts at trying to restore/refresh ... etc., even tried bootrec.exe
 with various commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>End result is that my PC has had to be totally wiped and a fresh installation of 8.1 applied. Guess there was another fault in there that I'd not been aware of and Windows 10 was the tipping point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will be sticking with 8.1 for a while me-thinks. Thank goodness for OneDrive!</p>

            This is not difficult in VBA.
<div><br />
<div>If Me.comboxname = "On Loan" &nbsp;Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MsgBox "your message"</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div><br />
<div>It could be as simple as that. It does depend (whether you use a macro or VBA) on what value is actually stored when you make a selection from the combo. You need to check the RowSource and Bound column properties of the combo.</div>

<h2>            time to scrap win 10</h2>
                    <p>why did MS let the three year olds trash Microsoft software to the extent its all unusable,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since the 50 year olds and above who could write software retired, we just have faulty bloatware that's unusable made by children out of a lunatic asylum, 3 mouse clicks when one used to work, magic toolbars that constantly update so nothing is where you
 left it, continuous updates that break more than they fix, and more and more spying apps&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>we now have a security patch that makes favourites unstable under 50% of the webpages out there.&nbsp; So you have to close them down and open blank one so favourites doesn't crash out before you can select one.&nbsp; That really irritating bug turned up in dec 16</p>
<p>
</p><p>media creation tool only runs once, I get a nag to reboot, that just wastes my time and doesn't help at all&nbsp; So I re download and its just the same !!!&nbsp; BROKEN</p>
<p>
</p><p>the world would be a better place if Microsoft sent everyone home we all ran win7 probably&nbsp;got office 2003 out at least they work and you don't get RSI trying to use it</p>

            Are you talking about the Insiders/Preview Beta versions or the RTM versions, as I have upgraded well over 400 systems for people and have had very few come back complaining as I found that Windows 10 RTM works very well after some learning, just like
 when Win 7 came out all new systems do have a learning curve. If you are not happy with Windows 10 Preview/Insiders with it glitches, crashing, issues, problems that we were all warned about before joining.

<p>I'm always disappointed to see posts, such as yours, from people who obviously lacked the prerequisite computer knowledge specified by Microsoft for joining the insider program, who now find that they can't handle the task, so, rather than gracefully going
 back to the publicly released version, where, with a little help from someone with a little computer knowledge, could get along quite well, choose to badmouth and ridicule Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It reminds me of the wise old philosopher, who once said, "the fact that one hasn't yet learned to ride his new bicycle is hardly justifiable cause to refer to the bicycle and its maker with derogatory terms".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Numerous ones of us, who do have the specified prerequisite computer knowledge, are, and have been, running the preview builds successfully. We understand that we are running builds that may well have bugs to be dealt with, and that the purpose for running
 those builds is to provide feedback to Microsoft, which they may find beneficial as they proceed in developing Windows 10 for public use.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We testers don't all have the same interests, so different ones of us use various parts of the builds more than others. I, for example, (in my 80th year of life) primarily use the the basic operating system to run my own choices of programs. I have no interest
 in games, "tiles", etc, so you would not see any such things on any of the computers at my place, but all of my computers (of various ages and capabilities) do what I want them to do, very well.&nbsp;

<p>I certainly agree with that, Colon. Moans can be of value to the developers ... but that is quite different from resorting to badmouthing and meaningless ridicule that some that seem prone to do.<br />

<h2>            OneNote 2010 does not recognize this file and it cannot be opened</h2>
                    
<p>I am using OneNote 2010 and am having trouble with one notebook and got the following error message.</p>
<p>---<br />
OneNote does not recognize this file or it cannot be opened.<br />
It may not be a OneNote file or it may be corrupted.<br />

<p>All notebooks&nbsp;were created with OneNote 2007 last year.&nbsp; I'm not able to open one of them.&nbsp; How can I repair/recover this notebook?</p>

<p>I'd first check if you have a backup of the file before it was corruped.&nbsp; In OneNote, go to File--&gt;Info--&gt;Open Backups, and open the latest backup.&nbsp; If the file looks fine,&nbsp;you can drag it into your notebook and delete the corrupt file.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/825779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB article 825779</a> describes how to repair a OneNote file.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd first create a back-up copy of the corrupt file&nbsp;in case&nbsp;something goes wrong and you need to try again.&nbsp; Then click Start--&gt;Run,&nbsp;and
 type:</p>
<ul>
<li>onenote.exe /forcerepair "<em>filepath</em>" </li></ul>
<p>where <em>filepath</em> (in quotes!) is the full path to the file that is corrupted.&nbsp; You can get this path by hovering the mouse over the section tab in OneNote.&nbsp; It's probably something like, "C:\Documents and Settings\<em>your-name</em>\My Documents\OneNote
 Notebooks\<em>notebook-name</em>\<em>section-name.one</em>"&nbsp; If you still have OneNote 2007 installed, be sure you run the 2010 version of onenote.exe (instead of typing onenote.exe above, type "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\onenote.exe")</p>
<p>Are you using (or ever used) the Beta of OneNote 2010?&nbsp; Where is the notebook stored? (local machine, network share, etc.)&nbsp; Files normally don't get corrupted by themselves unless some other program interferes...</p>

    <title>Printed MS Project GANTT Chart completely different from the GANTT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emilysam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printed MS Project GANTT Chart completely different from the GANTT chart view</h2>
                    <p>I am having a lot of trouble trying to format GANTT chart bars in my MS Project 2016 file.&nbsp; I have a custom field (Text1) called Project Manager that I am grouping my tasks by.&nbsp; I then want to have my bar styles changed so that the only text displayed is
 to have the Name field on the Inside of the bar representing the task.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought using Format &gt; Bar Styles should work but it just seems broken - when I select all tasks and then open Bar Styles, I can see that it is setup correctly in the Text tab of the
 Task row but that change is NOT reflected on the bar styles on the screen.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that didn't work, I then went in and changed each and every tasks bar style separately and that worked - my bars look how I want them on screen.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now I need to print this file to a PDF using the Print to PDF driver included in Windows 10.&nbsp; When I
 do that, the bar styles in the printed output are totally different than what is shown on the screen.&nbsp; &nbsp;A couple of them are correct, showing the Name field on the Inside of the car and nothing to the Top, Left, or Right.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of them seem to be setup as
 the default though with Resource Name on the Right, and nothing on the Top, Left, or Inside.&nbsp; I've tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Using the Organizer, copied the default GANTT Chart and GANTT Chart with Timeline views into my file, overwriting the current view.&nbsp; I then tried to use Format &gt; Bar Styles and it didn't work.&nbsp; Despite making the changes described earlier, the bar styles
 just stay the same as the default.&nbsp; It's like that Format &gt; Bar Styles function just doesn't work for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Created a brand new blank project file, copied all my tasks and start/end dates in, copied my resources in, created my custom Project Manager field and copied that data in.&nbsp; Then I tried Format &gt; Bar Styles again.&nbsp; Same thing - Project will simply NOT
 format all my bar styles per the settings I make in Format &gt; Bar Styles.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the only way I can get the bar styles the way I want is to format them individually, but then they won't PRINT properly.&nbsp; Seems like Project is fraught with bugs.&nbsp; Hoping someone has some advice as this is super frustrating.</p>

<p>emilysam,</p>
<p>First and foremost, is your Project 2016 fully updated? It should be version Winproj.exe version 16.0.4627.1000. If not, do a Windows Update. Note, if you are using a subscription form of Project, it is automatically updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming Project is fully updated but you still have an issue, try a basic new file.</p>
<p>1. Create a fresh new file with a few tasks and resources (i.e. don't copy anything from your other file).</p>
<p>2. Edit the Bar Styles to show the task Name field inside the bar. Note, you do not have to select all tasks as the bar styles will apply to all appropriate tasks that meet the bar style criteria.</p>
<p>3. Are the Gantt bars displaying according to your customization? If so, try a PDF.</p>
<p>4. If the basic bar styles are NOT displaying as you want, check to be sure that your customization is in fact active. Remember, the bar styles hierarchy is in reverse order (i.e. if there is a conflict, bar styles lower in the list (bottom) will take priority
 over conflicting bar styles higher in the list (top)).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the test file works okay, then I'd check your "live" file very carefully to see how it differs from the test file. That should give you a clue as to why bar styles are not working as desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>
