    <title>mouhid.sys problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bro cope  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouhid.sys problem</h2>
                    My Win 7 system died completely after awaking from sleep, downloading some update, installing and rebooting.&nbsp; Now it goes directly to a blue crash screen.&nbsp; It will not boot under any boot option at all.&nbsp; Straight to blue screen crash dump.&nbsp; I booted with
 logging enabled and the last driver to be loaded was mouhid.sys.&nbsp; (I put the drive in a new machine to look at it).&nbsp; The program size was 30.5K, which according to what I have read&nbsp;is&nbsp;off by 2X.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I tried to download and replace the file thinking that if this was a trojan, maybe I could get the machine to boot.&nbsp; Win 7, will not allow me to chage the file, even though it is the I drive, and I am the administrator.&nbsp; It says I need approval from "TrustedInstaller".&nbsp;
 How in the world do I get that?&nbsp; I am not installing from a website.&nbsp; Can anybody help me?&nbsp; There is a lot at stake here.

<p>When connecting to Xbox Live it says that i can't connect to my wireless adapter (FBN). I've tried everything on the support form and it still doesn't work....&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to send it in if anybody has any other suggestions, but if no one does I guess I'll have to.</p>

<p>Hey guys, please try disabling the security settings on your router temporarily, and then try connecting. If your wireless connection shows up then, you should be able to re-apply your security settings.</p>

    <title>Your PC did not start correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thebriwhi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your PC did not start correctly</h2>
                    <p>I started having trouble starting my computer yesterday. It was on for part of the day, and after I left it alone for a while I came back to
<strong>"Automatic Repair: Your PC did not start correctly. Press 'Restart' to restart your PC..."</strong></p>
<p>I've tried almost every option available:</p>
<p>Restart takes me back to the same screen.</p>
<p>Continue and exit out to windows 10 gets me back to the same screen.</p>
<p>Reset this pc (both choices) tells me "There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made."</p>
<p>System restore tells me I have no restore points, though I am 99% sure I had it automatically add them every time update. I know for sure I had them before I upgraded to windows 10 when I was on windows 7, but that was a while ago.</p>
<p>I don't have a system recovery image from since I before &nbsp;updated to 10.</p>
<p>Startup repair I let run for about 9 hours before I gave up on it and reset the pc.</p>
<p>I've also tried starting in safe mode, where it gives me the frowny face BSOD with the error
<strong>"Critical Process Died"</strong>, which is probably the key to the whole thing. It doesn't say which process that is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thoughts on this are that it must be an automatic update and restart that my pc ran yesterday, since it was already on and running just fine last time I saw it. I didn't do anything to the system while it was running yesterday, I just used it to play
 some games on Steam. I'm about out of ideas and would like some advice before I have to reformat and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC info:</p>
<p>Its a custom build, I don't know the exact information since I usually just check my system info on the computer when I need that.</p>
<p>Its an AMD 8 core at around 3 or 4 GHz, and an MSI motherboard, 8GB of ram. Nvidia GTX 660 card. All about 2 years old</p>
<p>I've got a few drives, the OS lives on a Corsair Force SSD, most of my other programs live on a Sandisk SSD (Both under a year old), and the rest of my files and programs live on a Western Digital drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            As you posted no info about your system, age, make/model it is hard to give you a proper answer it sounds like your HD has failed (bad sectors), you could try doing a 'clean" install using another HD as your system has digital entitlement (prior activation)
 it will auto activate after installing and log on to the internet.

            <p>It has gotten worse. I located the usb I had the my windows recovery files on. I booted with that and was partly able to perform the "Reset the PC" option. Both types got me past 50%, then told me they failed and no changes had been made. But since I ran
 those I'm no longer able to even get to the error screen, if I try to boot off of the drive it tells me "An operating system wasn't found. Try disconnecting any drives that don't contain an operating system...". This is even though the drive with windows on
 it is the first boot priority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I've been able to run chkdsk off of the usb and the only problem was "Failed to transfer logged messages to the event log with status 50". According to that there are 0kb on bad sectors.</p>

 I then tried the product key that came with the download of Media Center, which caused mwe all the problems to begin with, but that did not work either.&nbsp; Does anyone have an idea how to get a working product key?<br />

    <title>Surface 2 battery drain during sleep due to Tegra I2C Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jono_23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 2 battery drain during sleep due to Tegra I2C Controller Driver</h2>
                    <p>I have had my surface 2 for a few weeks now. I also have a type 2 cover. Most of the time when it goes into connected standby (sleep) mode over night it drops 1-2% per hour, which is terrible. I have tried all the normal things like making sure I have all
 updates, turning WiFi and Bluetooth off, closing all apps, putting it to sleep with and without type cover attached, pressing button to put it to sleep or just closing the cover. Nothing seems to fix it. Sometimes it doesn't drain anywhere near as fast and
 looking at powercfg /sleepstudy report I think I have found the culprit:</p>
<p>Tegra I2C Controller Drivers&nbsp;&nbsp;(\_SB.I2C5) and &nbsp;(\_SB.I2C3) </p>
<p>I also have Unregistered Device SE which is active 100% of the time during every sleep, even the ones where battery drain is about 1% every 5 hours. Any idea what these are and why they are active during connected standby and draining my battery? On a side
 note, when active my battery seems to last between 6-8 hours rather than the 10 hours that was stated by Microsoft. Can this be fixed or Is my surface defective?</p>

            <p>Hi Jono_23,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very sorry to hear that you are experiencing the battery issue with your Surface 2. That is concerning that your device is draining the battery so quickly, and I will try my best to get this issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, do you have all Windows updates on your device that's currently available? Look at Windows updates history under Control Panel to see if they were all successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all updates were successful, I'd suggest you try a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/refresh-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
refresh</a>. There are two ways to perform a refresh:&nbsp; from within Windows and from USB recovery media. Since you seem to be able to sign into your account, my suggestion is to try a refresh from within Windows:</p>

<h2>            how can i be sure that the new windows cd key which i&#39;m buying is genuine&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just saw and offer from a local site (mainly for selling game cd keys) in which windows 10 pro with CoA price was listed RS 1700 (approx. $17) now i'm not sure that whether they are selling genuine keys or not. I've bought steam keys from them several
 times and they have a good track record, but they just email us a key. no other physical document or cd, just a key in email. and it worked for games. but win10 pro in just $17? that's something making me suspicious.</p>
<p>win10 pro is there with CoA and without CoA. Another version of win10 on the same page "without CoA" and is more expensive&nbsp; than the version with CoA ($100 actually, but now on $15 bcoz on sale). So is CoA a bad thing? this formula
 is also same for win10 home with CoA which is cheaper than the win10 home without CoA on the same page. below is the link of site</p>
<p><em>&lt;Removed link&gt;</em></p>
<p>now what I ask is</p>
<p>1. should I buy from there or not? </p>
<p>2. is it safe or not? </p>
<p>3. it may be the used (and deactivated by host from his computer) to use it again, or will it be the new one?
</p>
<p>4. should I buy with CoA or without CoA</p>
<p>5. when i'm finished buying, installing and activating it while logging into the windows from my MS account, will this window be added in my MS account? can I format it from my pc and install it on my other pc without enterin cd key again, bcoz it will be
 linked to my MS account?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Farooq,<br />
<br />
<br />
Buying online can be quick, convenient and a great value; however, it doesn't always give you the same opportunity to see exactly what you're getting as walking into a regular store.<br />
<br />
That being said, it would still be the best if you buy Windows products at the <strong>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows?icid=TopNavSoftwareWindows&amp;SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you still want to pursue with buying at the local site you saw, here are some <strong>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">tips</a></strong> that can answer all your questions about genuinity and safety.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>1. should I buy from there or not?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Don't buy from there, the prices are too go to be true. Windows 10 retails for $119 to $199. Even the cheapest way of getting it (OEM System Builder license) starts at about $90 or $70 for a student discount.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. is it safe or not?</p>
<p><strong>No, because Microsoft and Amazon are the only ones authorized to license digital downloads of Windows 10. They could be selling MSDN keys.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. it may be the used (and deactivated by host from his computer) to use it again, or will it be the new one?</p>
<p><strong>A genuine retail Windows 10 license can, but we can't verify the authenticity of the licenses on that site. Remember, the prices are too good to be true.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. should I buy with CoA or without CoA</p>
<p><strong>You should not buy anything from there at all, purchase directly from the Microsoft Store.

<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes, you can, learn more about transferring licenses:</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>also:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN)
 or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided
 is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either
 giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The
 person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused
 and blocked the key from further use.</span></span></p>

            <p>It's hard to conceive of a situation where a home or office user would need anything close to 32 GB of RAM. Perhaps if they were rendering complicated 3D video. Or maybe if they have several virtual machines open at the same time. Does that apply to you?
 Otherwise, Windows isn't going to use more RAM than it needs merely because you installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else: A 32-bit operating system can't use more than 4 GB of RAM no matter how much is installed. And a portion of that is needed for system overhead. If you have a 32-bit version of Windows, 3.24 GB is probably the most RAM you can use.</p>

<p>There are certain essentials to be successful for speech recognition. First of all, you must have a good microphone that not only recognizes your words clearly but eliminates any background noise or noise from within the computer. Microphones built into
 notebook computers them to not cut the mustard. They pickup lots of background noise and very often pick up internal noise from within the computer. The best microphones have real noise canceling and use a USB audio input device to bypass electronic noise
 within the computer.</p>
<p>Also, you must not speak to the computer in a conversational tone like you would talk to another person. You must enunciate every word clearly. It also helps if you speak in phrases. This is because the system is comparing each word to words before and after
 it for context clues. For example:</p>
<p>"Two boys went to see a doctor because they ate too much food," or "They're going to park their car over there."</p>

<h2>            internet windows opening repeatedly at random times</h2>
                    <p>An internet browser would open on it's own and go to a Microsoft page or sometimes a bing search. It then keeps opening more and more of that same page. This starts happening at seemingly random times, even right after I turn on the computer. The browser
 it does this on also seems to&nbsp;be randomly chosen from the ones I have. If I turn on flight mode it sometimes keeps opening the pages but cant connect to load them or instead start opening tips repeatedly and loads a page there telling me to connect to the
 internet.</p>

            Hi, km2238
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />When you reset your network, Windows will forget your Ethernet network, along with all your Wi-Fi networks and passwords. It will also forget additional connections, such as VPN connections or virtual switches, that you’ve created. Resetting will disable and then reinstall all your network adapters and set other networking components back to their original settings. You’ll even have to run through the questions you saw when you first installed Windows where you select whether you want your PC to be discoverable on the network.
<br />Once you’ve exhausted your other troubleshooting efforts, resetting the network is easy. Open Windows Settings by pressing Start and clicking the Settings button (or just by pressing Windows+I on your keyboard). On the Windows Settings screen, click “Network &amp; Internet.”
<br />On the “Network &amp; Internet” page, select the “Status” tab on the left and then, on the right, scroll down and click the “Network reset” link.
<br />The “Network reset” screen warns you about what will happen when your network is reset and also lets you know that a restart will be necessary. Click the “Reset now” button to reset the network and restart your PC.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try right clicking on the SETUP or INSTALL file on the CD and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You most likely will need to run in in Compatibility Mode for a previous version of Windows...</p>
<p>Win 7 for instance...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I attempted to check with Kodak for updated software\drivers, and based on what I found, Kodak doesn't even make web cams... I could find NOTHING about web cams.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did see software and etc. from various sharing sites with a search, but that might be a last resort, and you may end up with the same problem anyway.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try the Troubleshoot Compatibility, or right click on the install file on the CD... Open&nbsp;the CD&nbsp;instead of running it. You should see something like "SETUP" or "INSTALL"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Right click on it, select Properties, then select Compatibility Tab at the top...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Part way down there will be a check box and a menu for Compatibility Mode. Try a previous version like Win 7, or even before. You might check "Run As Administrator" down near the bottom also.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then double click the file you set the compatibility of, to start the installation.</p>

<h2>            &#34;No Audio Output Device is Installed&#34; no audio found in Device Manager</h2>
                    
<p>I am using a Compaq Presario laptop with windows Vista for a couple years with out any sound problem.&nbsp; Yesterday, May 12, 2010 the sound stopped working abruptly. &nbsp; There were 5
<strong>important</strong> window updates installed that morning. &nbsp; I tried to do system restore to a previous date but the restore would not work successfully.&nbsp; I received an error message saying the restore was unsuccessful.&nbsp; I tried other dates no restore
 date was successful each time the error message showed up.&nbsp; We had no thunders storms or power surge occurred.&nbsp; We looked in device manager and sound is not even listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know where to look in the bios for a sound card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point after several restarts the sound worked fine but only lasted a short time and the same problem with the sound re-appeared.&nbsp; Now we have no sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas what could it be?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyway to determine if the problem is
 in the sound card or rather software related?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you have a nice day</p>

<p>If you can't do a system restore, try uninstalling the 5 important updates one-by-one (don't boot for each one - wait until you've uninstalled them all to re-boot).&nbsp; See if you still have the same problem or if removing the updates resolved&nbsp; it?</p>
<p>Go to Start / Control Panel / Add Harware and select to search for new hardware to see if it finds the audio device and maybe even finds the drivers for it and installs them as well.&nbsp; It may not work, but ti's worth a try.</p>
<p>Go to Start / Controll Panel / Device manger and look for the audio device.&nbsp; Go to View and click Show Hidden Devices to make sure it isn't hidden for some reason.</p>
<p>Go to the computer manufactuerer (if the audio device came with the computer) or the audio device manufacturer to get the most recent device driver for your device and your version of Vista and install then.&nbsp; Check to see if they show up in Device Manager
 and click on it to see if it says no problems are detected.&nbsp; Then see if you have audio again.</p>
<p>It's hard to determine if it is the card or the drivers or the software.&nbsp; The best way to do this is to uninstall and reinstall the software (if you have any special software for the audio device) and to update the drivers as previously suggested.&nbsp; If that
 doesn't work, it's either the card or something with Vista's software.&nbsp; The only way to really test the card is to move it to another machine and see if it works on that machine.&nbsp; If it does then it's probably something to do with the computer and not the
 card (try using a different slot when re-installing it if you have the option to do so).&nbsp; I know of no audio device diagnostic software available anywhere.</p>
<p>If we determine the card works, we'll do a thorough testing of the system to try to find the problem and resolve it - I'll post those procedures if necessary once you try the above and then reply with the results.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Speakers plugged into back panel of motherboard but no sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maceoharewood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speakers plugged into back panel  of motherboard but no sound</h2>
                    <p>I've tried every solution posted -&gt; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01 but nothing fixed my issue. However the thing is that I know it's not my speakers since they work when plugged into my phone. I also
 use a headset but that seemingly isn't messing with the speakers since I tried just removing the headset from my pc but the speakers still didn't work. 2 days ago I reinstalled windows 10 and my GPU was having driver issues, so I was constantly removing the
 GPU and now I'm worried I might've messed up my motherboard's sound because of that. If anyone has any other suggestions I'm all ears! The speakers that I use are the Logitech Z200, I'll post a picture of pc specs in case that's needed.</p>

<p>Thanks for the effort but the thing is I already did all of this multiple times and it never worked for my speakers and the speakers that I use (Logitech Z200) don't have drivers.</p>

<h2>            Enforcement</h2>
                    <p>is there a way to find out why your account is suspended? Like specific text? I got banned on 1st of june for 2 weeks...when ban was finished could'nt communicate but got back in multiplayer. Allthouch wasn't able to communicate. Then 1 week after end of ban got another ban for 2 weeks out of nowhere. As far as I am concerned the whole ban enforcement system is pure garbage but that's beside the point of difficult knowing exactly why you were banned if no explanation or quote is given. It's like if we jailed criminals without telling them what they did wrong, would be useless. I know I have called few welfare crack addicts on world of tanks useless and such but right now seems like I got banned twice for same offense. Any explanations available.? What is this hidden unaccountable gaming supreme court?</p>

            <div>Hi,<br />
1.&nbsp;Is the user accounts exists on a single computer?<br />
2.&nbsp;Are you trying to do Windows Easy trasnfer over the Office network or the cable?<br />
Follow the suggestions and see if it helps.<br />
<div><strong>Method 1<br />
</strong>You may choose ten profiles at a time and do the transfer multiple times and check.<br />
<div><strong>Method 2<br />
</strong>If it’s over the Office network, you may use the Migration tool that gives more customization options to do Windows Easy transfer:

    <title>Is there any way to transfer Mass Effect 2 &#38;amp&#59; 3 DLC licence - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is there any way to transfer Mass Effect 2 &#38;amp&#59; 3 DLC licence to the origin on pc&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>No one wants to buy everything again when they change platform, so it should be possible to transfer the dlc licence to the origin pc app, as EA who own origin make ME2 &amp; 3. Not just for mass effect but for other games too?</p>

<p>It's not an option for Mass Effect. But there is an EA bundle of the Mass Effect Trilogy on PC. You can pick it up for as little as £10 these days. It includes a lot of dlc AFAIA.</p>
<p>As to the idea itself, Sony have adopted the transfer/ownership thing across their own platforms, Vita, PS3, and PS4... for select games and content.</p>
<p>Microsoft share the vision of a deeply integrated ecosystem. So it's safe to assume that this feature will exist for future "select" titles and software across X1, PC, tablets and phones and whatnot.</p>
<p>Read: Future! Not games dating back to 2007 that you might have picked up in any number of sa<span>les in a<span>lmost a decade</span>, and that you're now expecting a fu<span>l</span><span>l PC version at no cost. The cheek!&nbsp;<span>lo<span>l</span></span></span></span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Ahem. Also, streaming content is a thing... who knows what the future holds for dead platforms with content still in the ether? You might be able to stream the console versions you own on your PC in future...</p>
<p>... though why you'd want to when the PC versions of Mass Effect smoke the console versions, at a very good price... is anyone's guess. Da future doe, anyfing is possib<span>le.&nbsp;</span>{XD</p>

<h2>            Rotate Video into proper side downloaded from smartphone</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wondering if someone have the experience on how to rotate&nbsp;a video downloaded from smartphone into proper side. When recorded the video on the side, that means the smartphone brand&nbsp;logo on the right side, in order to record the video into a wider view,
 we can see it properly as smartphones have the auto rotation screen function, but if we just downloaded it into PC through Windows, it will still show the video on the side as the monitor do not have this capability, that means you need to move your head on
 side to watch it, as such we need to rotate the video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

===========================================<br />
Two programs that can rotate your video clips are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Freemake Video Converter<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 )<br />
(***Carefully read *all* the install screens...there <br />
may be some items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />

    <title>Windows Photo Viewer not working and will not open pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> im_etten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer not working and will not open pictures</h2>
                    <p>I did a clean install of Win 7 64bit last week. I had Win XP and started all over with Win 7. I have everything installed&nbsp;back onto my PC and it all seems to work except the Photo Viewer. I can not get it to open and it is set as the default for all pics.
 When I opened a pic I would get a COM surrogate error and another window over that error asking if I would like to send info to Microsoft. I clicked yes and all the errors disappeared. Now when I open a pic I can see the system thinking and then nothing happens.
 I have tried the following to test / resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Used paint to create several documents for different types (jpg, bmp, png). None of these types will open in the Photo Viewer.</p>
<p>All other PC's on Win 7 in my house can open the same pics just fine so I know they are not corrupted. I have the drive shared that has the pics on it.</p>
<p>Run SCF /scannow - This did not correct the problem.</p>
<p>Installed the Windows Photo Gallery - This did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did notice that the Windows Error Reports have an APPCRASH every time I try to open the Photo Viewer. There is also an Application Error in the Windows Error Reports that says that there was a application fault for&nbsp;dllhost.exe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I need to do to fix this? Can I reinstall the Photo Viewer or do a system repair?&nbsp;</p>
