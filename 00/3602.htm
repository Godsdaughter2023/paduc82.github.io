    <title>Suggested Contacts not working in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Suggested Contacts not working in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>When I first installed Office Professional 2010 the Suggested Contacts feature worked but it now doesn't even though it is switched on in the File/Options/Contacts page. I fear I've altered something else but I can't remember what. The Suggested Contacts
 folder is now empty and nothing is added to it when I send an email to an address not held in my Contacts folder.</p>
<p>I have several email accounts within Outlook.</p>
<p>I have also installed QuickBooks Contact Sync for Outlook v3.0.171 which is for Outlook 2002, 2003 and 2007 but seemed to work with 2010, although it now says Outlook contacts and QuickBooks are synchronised even though this is no longer the case. So something's
 wrong there as well.</p>
<p>Any ideas would be welcomed.</p>

<p>Is the quickbooks addin still enabled? Look in File, Options, Addins.</p>
<p>Did this problem occur after the last round of office updates this week? If so, try uninstalling the update and reboot.</p>

            Thanks for these suggestions Diane but neither provides the answer. I've just disabled the QuickBooks add-in and rebooted but the problem persists. And it has been a problem for several weeks - well before the last round of updates.

            <p><span>I too have the same issue. One day it was working and the next it just stopped. If you select another folder it will find all the emails and you can select the one you want.
 The folder somehow was moved or altered, I did not install any other software that would have caused this. Outlook has not crashed and reopened in safe mood so not sure what caused it. Even now when I type in a email it will not remember it for the next time.

            This thread is over 6 months old. There is a good chance your problem is not the same at all. State your Outlook version and a complete account of the problem you are having. Your post describes a problem with searching your Contacts Folders, which has
 nothing to do with the original post which was about the autocompletion cache.

            can anyone offer a suggestion as to what to do when outlook just keeps creating more and more suggested contacts folders with nothing in them??/ 



This feature is the biggest piece of **** int he Microsoft inventory of ****.  I have been selling and recommending Microsoft apps to the small business world for over 25 years now and I have never seen such a piece of **** as this purported feature. 



Any feature that automatically takes control, that you cannot disable and remove should be illegal.  As far as I am concerned this **** is worse than any virus problem I have ever had to deal with on clients systems 



Every week I have people calling me and complaining about the malicious "Suggested Contacts" monsters and all I can tell them is to complain to Microsoft, but since it is virtually impossible to get to anyone at Microsoft who gives a dam, they just shrug their sholders and make some comment about finding a more reputable product from a  more reputable company.

            <p>I have the same issue, one day ok the next it stopped working, and I to have multiple Suggested Contacts folders. The one folder I have to navigate to does have email address
 but no names for those addresses. I selected all contacts like I was sending a mass email, then I started one by one of editing those contacts by adding their names but stopped after just a couple. Then I deleted the email without sending and to my amazement
 it now WORKS… So give it a try and see if it helps.</p>

            That is simply the standard method for populating the autocompletion cache with your Contacts data.&nbsp;It would not affect the unwanted creation of multiple Suggested Contacts Folders. What happened to those? &nbsp;

            Hi Bob
<br />
<br />There are many many websites that provide free fonts for download, most fonts are free, the only thing is you should always check that a font is not copyrighted, if it is, you should download that font from the official website, because copyrighted fonts are not free and royalties need to be paid . . .

                    <p>This happens in all browsers, both on PC and OSX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was migrated to "Outlook Mail" this past Saturday 10/8.&nbsp; Since that time all of my folders have disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some searching and saw this came up back when people were on the Outlook Preview.&nbsp; Some suggested to wait 24 hours, it has been 4 days now</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>I still have all of my folders showing in my local Outlook 2016 (16.0.7127.1026) windows client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I search for a message on outlook.com which is contained in a folder locally, the search does find that email.</p>

                    I'm getting an error in opening my email inbox, so I went looking for scanpst to fix it but the file isn't where it's supposed to be.&nbsp; I had a virus, which has since been fixed, but it may still be part of the probelm. Looking in C:\Program File\Microsoft
 Office\ Office 12...&nbsp; I'm using outlook 2007 and Window 7.&nbsp; Help?

<h2>            the default body text box for slides is messing up the font face&#47;size, powerpoint pro plus 2013, windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i save and reopen powerpoint slides, or duplicate them, the font size for the default body text box is being altered to be the same as the title text box. Specifically, it's going from Arial body size 28 to Arial header size 44.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? It's just changing it on its own and its annoying to keep changing it back.</p>

            <p>Here's how you can fix this:</p>
<ol>
<li>In PowerPoint, open the presentation to the slide that keeps changing font size.</li><li>Choose <strong>VIEW&gt;Slide master</strong>.</li><li>The Slide Layout responsible for the selected slide will be in the main window.</li><li>If the text placeholder reads <em>Click to edit Master title style</em>, then the wrong type of placeholder has been used. Replace it with a content or text placeholder by using
<strong>SLIDE MASTER&gt;Insert Placeholder</strong>.</li><li>If the text placeholder displays several levels of text with the first line reading
<em>Click to edit Master text style</em>, it's the right type of placeholder. Select the text level (probably the first level) that is set to 44pt and change the size to 28pt.</li><li>Close the Slide Master to return to your presentation, then save it.</li></ol>

<h2>            OneNote 2016 doesn&#39;t show select location dialog after screen clip</h2>
                    <p>I have OneNote 2016. If I choose "Take screen clipping" from the context menu of the system tray icon, everything works fine. However, if I press the hot key (Shift+Win+S), I see the cross hair, I can select a region, however after selection the usual dialog
 “Select location in OneNote” doesn't appear. Why it might be?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong></p>
In Windows Creators Update Shift+Win+S is intercepted by the explorer and starts Snipping Tool. The solution is to reassign the hotkey in OneNote. See here: http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/onenote-screen-clipping-shortcut-key-change

                    Let me start out letting you know that all I know about Excel I have taught myself, so please don't laugh if you feel that my question is dumb. &nbsp;I am developing my own Log Sheet to use to log vehicles in and out of a facility. &nbsp;I must show the dat and
 time that the vehicle comes in and the same for when it departs. &nbsp;I am using this command line to get the initial date ; &nbsp;=IF(G4="I",TODAY()," "), where G4 is simply a trigger entery. &nbsp;I am trying to use this line to get the time: &nbsp;=IF(L4="o",NOW()," "), again
 L4 is simply used as a trigger. &nbsp;The problem is that every time I initiate the command it changes any previous dates and times to the current time and date. &nbsp;How can I get the date and time for each entry without the previous entries changing. &nbsp;I have read
 and searched and can't seem to glean the correct formula to do this correctly. &nbsp;Here is what the log looks like.

<h2>            Excel 2013 version 15.0.4841.1002</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Yesterday my Excel 2013 was updated to version&nbsp;15.0.4841.1002 and after this update I can no longer send htm files to excel..</p>
<p>This files are generated in an htm format, loaded in internet explorer and then send to Excel for analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This seems to work fine with the previous version of excel.</p>
<p>Also I can' t find any notes about the new build of Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I tried to open manually the "mht" file with excel but with no success- no error message, no event in "Event viewer" , any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there a way to downgrade to a previous version?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />

<p><strong><span><span>Issue recap:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The Excel team has made a change in the behavior of certain file types to increase security. This change came in the security updates KB3115262, KB3170008, and KB3115322. Previously, when you
 tried to open an HTML, XLA, or XLAM file with an .XLS file extension from an untrusted location, Excel would warn about the mismatch between the file extension and content, but would still open the workbook without Protected View security. After the security
 updates Excel no longer will open the workbook because these files are not compatible with Protected View and there is no warning or other indication it was not opened.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for your patience and input—community suggestions drove our decision to change this behavior in a way we hope will be much better for your workflows!</span></span></p>

<h2>            Office 365 will not install by the usual means. Is there another way&#63;</h2>
                    <p>1. </p>
<p>How can it be so difficult to install Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consistently get the following error message: 35 times so far. I have had it installed on this Vaio laptop both on Windows 7 and Windows 10, but had to reinstall due to other problems with Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2577109-d732-49f8-84ef-d531ca5bb58e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2577109-d732-49f8-84ef-d531ca5bb58e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried to install it in every which way possible except from within an other network environment.</p>
<p>I have tried Fix It, manual uninstall 2016 and 2013 instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done everything under this link suggestion <strong>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manually-uninstall-Office-2013-or-Office-365-1d1110d5-75a4-4154-969e-4260ff29b232?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</strong>,
</p>
<p>and this one&nbsp;<strong>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manually-uninstall-Office-2016-or-Office-365-4e2904ea-25c8-4544-99ee-17696bb3027b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've clean booted, I've had firewalls on and off.</p>
<p>I've spent 2 hours on Answer Desk doing the bidding of two different technicians.</p>
<p>I have reset the system to an earlier time and I have upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and recovered back to Windows 7 again when one of the Microsoft Answer Desk technicians managed to remotely uninstall my network adapters and cut me off from the
 Web entirely for two days (one way to end a complicated chat support session).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background: I previously had Windows 7 running fine with Office 365 2013 working equally well. Then I succumbed to the Windows 10 &nbsp;"Download me, I'm better, safer, faster" offer and installed Windows 10. After using FixIt once, I was able to install Office
 and get it running. However, there were problems elsewhere with the scanner and other aspects and also I needed Word German Spell-Check and this wouldn't install (in exactly the same way as the whole Office Suite won't install now). So I uninstalled Office
 and reset the laptop to an earlier date. Since then I have recovered back &nbsp;to "Windows 7 due to the above mentioned technical support fiasco.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and the&nbsp;<a href="https://stores.office.com/myaccount/advancedinstalls.aspx?subsid=ayNH4QAAAAAAAAEA&amp;entitleid=ayNH4QAAAAAAAAEA_2C610574#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download
 offline installer</a>&nbsp;link doesn't work - the web page simply doesn't load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there another way to get Office installed? The intended way doesn't seem to be working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please.</p>

    <title>Appointment notes indicator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattydr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Appointment notes indicator</h2>
                    This is a different issue than I have seen on the forums, but may be related to the issue of losing note information in appointments.<br />
<br />
My problem is as follows:<br />
Almost everytime I create an event/appopintment on my desktop in Outlook 2007, when that appointment is synced to my Tilt, it shows an icon that there are notes related to the appointment.&nbsp; This happens whether there are notes or not.&nbsp; As I do enter notes with
 certain appointments, but not all, I need to be able to distinguish which appointments actually have notes and those that do not.&nbsp; When I open the appointment on by phone, the notes field is completely blank and I have to enter a character, then erase it,
 before it will show that there are no notes.<br />
<br />
I always make sure that the notes are blank on my PC before saving and closing.&nbsp; this happens on every type of event, single instance, recurring, appointments made by dragging an email to the calendar, etc.<br />
<br />
Is there something that happens in the sync that makes the phone thinnk there are appointment notes when there are not?<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speed for downloading programs could vary depending on your provider and you can take note of some possible solutions for this by reading through the steps provided in this link

Office is taking long to install</a>. That article would suggest some steps such as trying to use a wired connection instead of using WiFi for a better connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with the results and if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to post back.</p>

    <title>Build 10525 not activated after refresh - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter johnson uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10525 not activated after refresh</h2>
                    <p>I joined the insider program In December and had no problems with the various builds until yesterday, when my PC crashed with a system service exception error. Researching this I ran the driver verifier, which failed so completely that I couldn't boot the
 PC. </p>
<p>The only options were to do a clean install or a refresh. I did the latter.</p>
<p>Several hours later, reinstalling my applications, I learn that Windows won't activate (error code 0xc004c003), despite still being build 10525 and proudly boasting that it's a Win 10 Pro Insider Preview Evaluation copy, and there's nothing physically changed.
 If I want to activate MS want £199 for a new license. So I spend nine months testing Win 10, MS messes up the activation and I have to pay - that's a neat business model.</p>
<p>The alternative seems to be to start again, to revert to Win 8.1 and upgrade again. But whilst I downloaded Win 8, I still have the license key for it, there seems to be no mechanism for downloading it from MS.
</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>The alternative seems to be to start again, to revert to Win 8.1 and upgrade again. But whilst I downloaded Win 8, I still have the license key for it, there seems to be no mechanism for downloading it from MS.

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

            Did a Win 8.1 install immediately followed by a Win 10 upgrade on a spare SSD which activated properly. Decided to leave the remainder of the configuration, including applications installation,&nbsp;until next week and reverted to the original SSD, which now
 shows the 10525 build as activated. Thanks Max. (I had Googled Win 8.1 download but Google wasn't very helpful.)

            I'm kind of in the same boat here.&nbsp; I have a Surface Pro 3 that came with 8.1 and I've been a part of the Insider Program since early in the year.&nbsp; Had problems with Build 10525 yesterday and did a Reset PC and it pretty much reset the PC with a fresh
 Build 10525.&nbsp; There is no other OS partitions or Windows 10 from end of July sitting on the SSD.&nbsp; I've been told to go back to 8.1 and upgrade through Windows 10.&nbsp; Only problem is I need an OEM iso image of 8.1 for my activation key.&nbsp; I don't mind having the
 10525, I just don't like not having a legitimate Windows 8.1 or 10 back on my SSD in case of disaster recovery (reset PC).

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been experiencing problem accessing my Hotmail in past weeks. It seems like I've went through the authentication, but the content of my email box never showed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I go to mail.live.com and entered my ID and password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then the page stayed at <a href="https://login.live.com/ppsecure/post.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=11&amp;ct=1367275367&amp;rver=6.1.6206.0&amp;wp=MBI&amp;wreply=http:%2F%2Fbl168w.blu168.mail.live.com%2Fdefault.aspx%3Frru%3Dinbox&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=64855&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;cbcxt=mai&amp;snsc=1&amp;bk=1367275366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It then showed <a href="https://mail.live.com/?id=64855&amp;rru=inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://mail.live.com/?id=64855&amp;rru=inbox</a> showing following error message:</p>

•Look for the page with your search engine.<br />
•Refresh the page in a few minutes.<br />
•Make sure TLS and SSL protocols are enabled. Go to Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Settings &gt; Security</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friend was able to successfully access his own Hotmail account on the same computer, so I believe the computer is configured correctly. Please advice. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issues from over a week now, I can access no accounts out of 4 tried, I've tried using IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the service's status and it's all working good.</p>
<p>I've cleaned the cache,&nbsp;chronology and cookies&nbsp;for all the browsers, I couldn't try another computer but I tried using a proxy server, and with a proxy server it does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing my IP (I've a dynamic IP) and it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also made a malware's scan with both MalwareByte's Anti-Malware and Microsoft Security Essentials. I've ran a full, deep, antivirus scan with MSE of every physical and virtual drive as well&nbsp;a scan of any device connected or that has been connected with
 my PC in the last month. I've also turned off the wi-fi on my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access Windows Life Profile, Calendar, Contacts, OneDrive, Word, Excel, PwerPoint, OneNote and Office Online without problems. I can also chat using Skype without problems and I can login into Skype without any problem.</p>

<h2>            Issue regarding setting up Windows Live Account on Nokia Lumia 610</h2>
                    I have not inserted the SIM card yet, so I am basically trying to set up&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;Live Account on my Lumia 610 using WIFI. However, after keying the email address and the password, the system notifies me that I am signed in and then

            If you open Internet Explorer, can you browse to live.com? What about any other sites? Basically, verify that the WiFi is actually working on the phone.<br />
<br />
The other common symptom of a Windows Live ID failing to sign in is if the password is too long. If it's more than 13 characters, shorten it.<br />

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Answers Forum.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I wanted to verify with you if you were able to setup other email accounts on the phone?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also how many characters is the password? If the password is above 13 characters see if you can try shortening it and add the Windows Live Account again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best Regards,</div>

            First of all, resetting the phone works because it return the configuration to the original language pack's.
<div><br />
<div>Well, this phone can't work if the options: Region Format and System Locale is not set to one of the original languages in the phone. If you already changed this setttings, you will need to reset the phone, change again without reset don't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ok, knowing that, lets go:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1 - Reset your phone and choose the proper language pack (remember all the languages, you will need at 4º step)</div>
<div>2 - Do the same configurations of your hotmail, etc.</div>
<div>3 - Enter the settings menu and search for REGION+LANGUAGES</div>
<div>4 - In REGION+LANGUAGES, set REGION FORMAT only for one of the five languages presented at the first configuration in the phone. In SYSTEM LOCALE put the same language of region format. In browser and search you can put any language.</div>
<div>5 - Press the button in REGION+LANGUAGENS to apply the changes and reboot the phone, this process will fix the problem.</div>

<div>We're signing you in to Windows Live</div>

<div>
<p>and you are signed in!</p>

<div>Oops! We're are having a problem that we can't solve at the moment. Please try again</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have 2 live.com accounts and a gmail.com account and I get the same or similar results with all</div>
<div><br />
<div>sometimes I don't see, or miss, the "and you are signed in!" message</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes after waiting while the dots fly past at the top of the screen, then the screen just goes back to "add an account"</div>
<div><br />
<div>My password is less than 13 characters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problems has existed since I bought the phone from a Nokia shop in Singapore, did initial setup over wifi and then used it with a variety of sim cards in various countries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can log into the accounts no problem if I use my computer web browser, or Outlook or log in from Outlook Explorer on my Lumia 610</div>
<div><br />
<div>But what I can't do is get my contacts and calendar on my phone!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Over the last few days I have downloaded Zune, and then after many difficulties finally updated the software, but the problem continues!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After my good old Nokia 6085, that updated to Outlook using Nokia Suite, this is incredibly frustrating!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have my region set to New Zealand, but how can this cause a problem!</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access restricted: Due to organizational policies you can't access these resources is a due to SharePoint Online's location-based conditional access policies. If it's bound to access only in the corporate network, they lose access when they check it outside
 the premises. You can see it here for more information: <em><strong><a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2016/09/26/enhanced-conditional-access-controls-encryption-controls-and-site-classification-in-sharepoint-and-onedrive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enhanced

<p>
</p><p>We'd like to know what version of Office are they using, Office 365 for Business, Office 365 Home, etc.? So that we can assist you appropriately. We look forward to your reply.</p>

</p><p>It appears that something like that might be in "Word for Windows 10", which was announced last week (see

<p>I am sorry to hear about your problem.&nbsp; Please try the following and provide a response to each question?</p>
<p>If you select some text and then press Ctrl+x is just that text cut from the document?</p>
<p>If you then press Ctrl+v, is just the text that was cut from the document pasted?</p>
<p>If you select some text and then press Ctrl+c (which should copy that text to the keyboard) and then move the selection to another part of the document and press Ctrl+v, is the text that was selected pasted into that location?</p>
<p>If none of this works, can you send an email message to me at dkr[atsymbol]mvps[dot]org and I will make offline contact and try and help you further.<br />

    <title>Insoluble margin errors after section break &#43; page orientation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonno50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insoluble margin errors after section break &#43; page orientation change</h2>
                    <p>Please note, this is <em>not </em>the "section breaks lead to multiple pdfs" error that has been dealt with elsewhere (although that also happens at the same time). I have seen the many posts on that problem, and know the workaround. This question is specifically
 about margins after section breaks&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the problem in Word for Mac 2011 + El Capitan&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You want to create a landscape page (typically with a table) in document that is predominantly portrait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. You use a section break, change the page orientation change within the section, then use another section break &nbsp;after which you &nbsp;return to portrait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. It looks fine on the screen, but when you come to print - either to pdf, or by previewing the print in the print dialog box, the text on the page (sometimes more than one page) after the return to portrait gets shifted about 2.5 inches to the right, leading
 to text bleeding over the RH margin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. There is nothing visible in the page layout, margins, indents etc. that causes this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. There seems to be no way of solving it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I gather, this is a Mac-specific problem. I've had a <a href="http://jonathanstill.com/2011/12/22/it-tips-22-how-to-put-a-landscape-page-into-a-portrait-document/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how-to page on how to insert landscape pages in a portrait on my website </a>that's had thousands of hits over several years, and several positive comments. but I guess they were Windows users: the problem has been flagged by a Mac user, and I've now replicated
 it on my Mac (ironically, I learned the trick on a PC, but didn't realise the problems it caused with printing on a Mac).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm interested in good workarounds, but more than that, I'm interested in whether Microsoft have a solution to what seems like an unconscionable problem with the software, given that this is a very commonly needed function of a 21st century word processing
 application.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Let me first emphasize that I am not using El Capitan, so I am not able to test on that version of OS X. It very well could be isolated to that version but it seems that other versions of Word would be affected in a similar manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can say is that I cannot reproduce the problem using Word [v14.6.0] running on OS X 10.10.5 [Yosemite]. I've repeatedly tried to induce the result in various ways, even going so far as to create the 2nd Section Break within the Table, itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is lacking from that user's message is version information. Most commonly, problems related to printing are the direct result of Office, OS X and/or printer drivers being behind on updates. It's imperative that older software [such as Office 2011] be
 kept fully updated when running on OS X versions more recent than that for which they originally were designed. From what I've seen, this seems to be particularly true of OS X 10.11.x [El Capitan].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pursuant to that, my experience suggests that if the content looks as intended on screen but fails to print as displayed, the fault typically lies with the print subsystem. What is shown in any print preview (including the
<em>Quick Preview</em> of later OS X versions) is based on feedback from the subsystem. IOW, if the document looks correct on screen, Word is holding up its end. The aberration in the preview display or on paper usually is the result of the print subsystem
 incorrectly interpreting the information sent from the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the variables involved, we can't always rely on Apple pushing out the most current revisions to printer drivers. It's often overlooked, but in many cases more current drivers are available from the manufacturer's web site. I've even had a few
 instances where the mfr recommended using a driver different from the one supplied for a particular printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pointless to speculate further, though... There just isn't enough detail in that user's message to enable pinpointing the actual cause. Of course, if the cause isn't known it's virtually impossible to suggest a cure :-)</p>

            <p>I'd recommend that you revise your how-to page. Instead of inserting one section break, converting the rest of the document to landscape, inserting another section break, then converting the remainder back to portrait, try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insert 2 section breaks into the portrait document, one at the beginning and one at the end of the area to be changed. Then switch the orientation of
<em>just</em> the pages between the 2 breaks. You'll get a more reliable result. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is that Word takes the margins of your portrait page and rotates them 90 degrees when applying them to a new landscape page. (Bottom margin measurement is applied to left margin, left margin to top margin, etc.) Then it rotates them back when
 switching to portrait, but it doesn't always get them right, especially if you fixed the margins for the landscape area before inserting the second break.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can post your problem file to OneDrive or other cloud storage, then post a Share link here, I'll be happy to have a look at it and let you know what is causing the problem.</p>

            That sounds like very good advice, and I will change the page accordingly (with a credit of course). However, in this particular instance, it doesn't seem to solve the problem. I can't upload the file because it's not my data, but I will try to reproduce
 the problem in a dummy file and then upload it.&nbsp;

            <p>I am the person with the unsolvable problem...Yesterday &nbsp;I spoke with a (support line) microsoft technician (and then his supervisor) by phone and the final advice was "there is nothing more we can do at this time."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using: El Capitan (updated to OS-X 10.11), Word from Office 2011 (v. 14.6) and a Brother printer</p>
<p>(HL2270DW) (updated driver, utilities, and other software for chip installed in Brother machine in January</p>
<p>2016). Everything except Word is completely up to date, but thanks for suggesting I check all of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this setup, I am currently unable to print any page correctly when moving from landscape to portrait: either the margins are incorrect (2.5 inches to the right and left hand margin runs off the page), or I am unable to have a page</p>
<p>number printed. In all cases, my screen shows up ok, but the printing does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only "fix" I was able to do was to copy the page in a text book, change text direction. However, not</p>
<p>all of the material inside the text box prints correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I have not yet tried is to upgrade my Word to 2016. Given my dissatisfaction with Microsoft</p>
<p>at this point (and the numerous complaints about bugs online) I am not yet willing to try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to submit a paper for publication because of this problem and the requirements of the journals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have inserted the two section breaks (as suggested by John Korchok below) and this does not fix</p>
<p>the problem either. I will upload my document shortly and will label it "try_onedrive"</p>

            <p>Hi &nbsp;Bob Jones:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for working on this - however, when I print your file, page numbers show up</p>
<p>on the screen but they are not printed. No page numbers after page 1. In addition, the double&nbsp;</p>
<p>underscore line under table 2 shows up on the screen but it is printed as a single solid line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, given the fact you found a "corrupted file"--does this mean I need a new version of Word?</p>
<p>Also, this is odd, given the fact that this same problem occurs on both my home Mac and my</p>
<p>office Mac...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing: I am unable to print page numbers for virtually any word document that moves</p>
<p>from landscape to portrait, even if there is one word on each page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the same operating system (El Capitan), Word (version 2011, with updates), and</p>
<p>Brother printer HL-2270DW in both settings.</p>

            <p>My apology... I was focused on the 3rd page issue &amp; overlooked the 2 points you spotted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The page numbering partly is my fault... I failed to check the Footer specs. However, this is a common issue with some printers when an orientation change is imposed. Pursuant to that, I found that I have similar problems if I generate a PDF using my Epson
 driver. However, if I select an HP driver the PDF renders perfectly. I've sent a copy of the PDF to
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/iaf5l7sodshq8op/try_onedrive.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the 3rd page of the document is set as an A4 paper size whereas the 1st 2 pages are Letter... That creates additional complexity which can confuse any printer :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The line was due to the spec in the document being for a .25 point double line which is rendering on paper as a single line. This, also, is a printer issue, but changing it to .5 point resolved that... the others are .5 point so they print as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The corruption issue is document specific. I don't meant to criticize, but it has to do with how the document is constructed rather than being a matter of which version of the program is used.</p>

<p>Verify that you have a default e-mail program set from Control Panel&gt; Default programs&gt; Set program access and computer defaults&gt; Custom&gt; click the down caret.</p>
<p>The default e-mail program must be installed on the computer- e.g.Outlook Express, Windows Mail (Vista), Windows Live Mail, Thunderbird, etc.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Which e-mail program are you using? Windows Mail (Vista?)</p>
<p>2. If using Windows Mail, see if your settings match these:<br />

<p>Is your antivirus program scanning outgoing messages? AVG and some other programs have this capability.</p>

            <p>Microsoft Security Essentials doesn't scan outgoing mail. It's not the cause of this problem.</p>
<p>Is Windows Mail the e-mail program?</p>
<p>If there are messages in the Outbox which have already been sent, delete them.</p>
