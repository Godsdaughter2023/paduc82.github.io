<h2>            Browser-enabled Form opening in xml format for guest link</h2>
                    
<p>i need to set up a form that can be completed by an onboarding client and submitted to our sharepoint library. i have build a browser-enabled infopath form and shared a guest link as shown below with my test external user. rather than simply opening in a
 browser, the infopath form opens in xml and comes up as code. how do i gather information from clients external to our office 365? (we have e3.)</p>

<p>hi samantha,</p>
<p>to collect information from external users via an infopath form, you may need to create a form library on your sharepoint online team site, publish the browser-enabled infopath form to the form library, and then share the library to external users. however,
 the library can’t be shared via an anonymous link, you need to enter the email addresses of the external users to share it, and the external users need to sign with a microsoft account to access the form library.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c573ce3d-0def-49ae-895b-539baf5a0fcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc573ce3d-0def-49ae-895b-539baf5a0fcc" /></a></p>
<p>there are&nbsp;some other options you may consider to gather information from external users:</p>

<p>I have indeed published the InfoPath form to a form library in SharePoint. It is a browser-enabled form and in admin for the Tenant, external sharing allowing for anonymous links is turned on. I am not trying to allow access to the entire library, rather
 just share a form that is to be completed externally in a browser and submitted back to the SharePoint library. As far as I can tell by the links below, I should be able to do this without sending an email invitation. (An email is not practical as the link
 is embedded into a larger questionnaire.)</p>

<p>Hi Samantha,</p>
<p>It could be somewhat confusing, however, it is different between sharing a single document file and a form template published on a form library. When a user fills out an InfoPath form and submit it to the form library, the user need to have Add permission
 on the library not only a single file, which is different from sharing a document file for which the external user only need the permission on the file to view or edit it.</p>
<p>Since it is not feasible to share a library anonymously, the invitation email is inevitable for sharing an InfoPath forum to external users. Therefore, to collect information from external users, we suggest you consider the other options I provided above.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Eric Yang</p>

<p>I think what support is trying to say is Msft doesn't allow anonymous interaction with lists or libraries in SP Online at all. SP Online is very limited and isn't really designed for anything other than internal use. A license and log on &nbsp;is required even
 if it's a free external license. Your only options are either:</p>
<p>to use the public site's ugly contact form app (from SP store)</p>
<p>or a regular list and the anonymous workaround &nbsp;(see this for how to: <a href="http://365.webbrewers.com/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=8)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>It is possible, in fact I have just achieved exactly what you are trying to do!</p>
<p>You can either check out my post: [View:https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/434648:550:50] or in brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a generic access account in Office 365, no license required. </li><li><em>Simple solution:</em> publish your web form template to a form library, create the .xml file, then share that .xml file with the generic account. Use workflow or manually email the 'anonymous' user with the standard 'formserver.aspx' link and login
 credentials for the generic account. </li><li><em>Complex solution:</em> copy multiple web form templates to any document library 'Forms' hidden folder (tip: use SPD), export the form template component files to get at the .xml file, modify these to reflect the location of the form template (tip: 'href'
 tag), copy the .xml files to the document library, folder or document set, share the .xml file link and credentials with your 'anonymous' user. Now you have multiple forms all in the same place. If you deploy to a folder or document set, you can't use Submit
 so have to simply save the form after editing. </li></ul>
<p>Suggest you read the caution in my post above regarding Limited Access - not quite as 'limited' as I would like.</p>

<p>It would appear as if something got corrupted on the install of Build 17063 (please refer by build #, not the date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try a System Repair, when you get to the login screen, press and hold the Shift key and restart computer. If it cannot repair you may have to roll back to previous build and try again.</p>

    <title>Skype Chat on Outlook displays deleted messages from Skype App. Is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph mark mirasol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Chat on Outlook displays deleted messages from Skype App. Is this a bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I don't know if any one of you have noticed this issue in Skype chat on Outlook, but I noticed that deleted messages on Skype keep showing up in Outlook.<br />
<br />
I discovered this issue when my friend on Skype accidentally sent me a message. It was deleted right before I was able to read the message, and the person apologized for a 'wrong send.'
<br />
<br />
This was done on a Skype app for Windows. So it displays: 'This message has been removed.'<br />
<br />
I opened my Outlook.com in IE11, and check on some work mail. After a few minutes, that friend (the one mentioned above) messaged me on Skype again and so, the Outlook in-page messaging app notified me. I opened the message list and saw the new message. I scrolled
 up just to check previous messages, and to my surprise, the supposed deleted message(s) on Skype (the wrong sent message) is displayed there visibly on my Outlook messaging screen. And because of that, I figured out that my peers were talking not nice about
 me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This might be an issue regarding protection of someone's privacy (though I am a bit disturbed upon the learning the truth about my peers), and it was really a stroke of chance I discovered this issue. I don't know if this issue have been discovered by others,
 or have been there since the beginning. This might be a bug. To MS, Skype, or Outlook.com people, please advise.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no idea to where to address this issue to, but if any Outlook.com staff or Skype or MS staff be able to read this, I hope you'll be able to resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Joseph<br />

<h3> ed geiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Version of Outlook on the Web is Slow to Load when Opening Application</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 365 Starter Email version of Outlook on the Web.&nbsp; I have noticed the time to load Outlook has increased the more I use the application.&nbsp; I assume it is because my mail and attachments are taking more time to download to my laptop computer.&nbsp;
 Speed on other applications, programs and downloads all seems to be working fine, just starting up Outlook is slow.&nbsp; Once it is started, speed seems to be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wait about 2-3 minutes to see my mail once I click to open Outlook and another 2-3 minutes before I can open anything, a total of 5-6 minutes.&nbsp; I tried just leaving the mail tab open, but once a day I still have to re-sign in and download everything again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume the problem is that my mail and files are just getting larger and taking longer to download.&nbsp; I want to know if I use "work off-line" or if I Archive old mail, will this fix the problem?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to find a better explanation Archive function but can't seem to find that either.&nbsp; Do Archive files stay on the cloud until accessed rather than downloaded?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I categorized this question under Office 365 for Business because there was no category for Office 365 Starter Email.&nbsp; Purchased through GoDaddy web hosting and domain services in case that helps clarify.&nbsp;

<p>What if change to another browser, computer or network? Can you reproduce the same issue? Do other users under the same network encounter the same issue? For my personal experience, this issue may related to your network or browser if you’re using Exchange
 Online mail.</p>
<p>Generally, we can use archive feature to reduce the size and improve the performance of the primary mailbox. More information, you may refer to these articles:

<p>Hi Jeff Medina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. I understand that you can’t see an email you searched in outlook. For further help, I need more information about your issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

    <title>Tablet Mode &#40;Continuum&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesverrier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet Mode &#40;Continuum&#41;</h2>
                    <p>As someone who does actually use Win8 in a pure touchscreen environment (An HP&nbsp;touchscreen 'kitchen computer' - wall mounted with no mouse or keyboard - Steven Sinofsky would love me!) I was keen to see the Tablet Mode in the January Build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First&nbsp; - just pre-release stuff, I imagine&nbsp;- is that despite the fact that&nbsp;I conducted the entire install (entirely problem free by the way) without a mouse or keyboard attached, tablet mode did NOT activate until I found the toggle for it in settings, and
 on the first reboot after install, it turned itself back off again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the option to set the start screen background to match the desktop seems missing in action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compared to Win8.1, my immediate reaction was how cluttered the Start Screen&nbsp;looked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The column of apps on the left was something I wanted to disable immediately (I didn't pin this stuff to the Start Screen for a reason!) and took way too much valuable
 screen space.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would personally much prefer this to be optional and&nbsp;pushed to a second page out of sight.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that my login name has shifted to the top of this column doesn't fill me with confidence that this will happen though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The task bar rose into view a little too often unasked - further adding to clutter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new tile grouping system was less discoverable - the clean install appeared to have set up a number of empty groups, but it wasn't immediately obvious where they were (except for some randomly floating elipsis symbols here and there.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's only when
 you add text and tiles&nbsp;that you can get a clearer sense of where stuff is.&nbsp;&nbsp; This again could just be incorrect defaults that will be sorted for the final release.&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial set of tiles were assigned to groups in a way that seemed random - it certainly
 hadn't inherited my&nbsp;groups (or group names) from Win8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the very rigid alignment grid used in Win8 has been relaxed somewhat - I could drag tiles so that they partially lined up with others.&nbsp; Not sure this is an advance really, as it's only going to produce very messy looking Start Screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text used for the tile context menus was very rough and pixilated - another pre-release thing...</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>hi ralfmusterd,</p>
<p>do you refer to <strong>onedrive for business</strong> or <strong>personal onedrive</strong>?</p>
<p>if it is <strong>onedrive for business</strong>, check the following three points:<br />
1.if a file is infected with a virus, users can't sync the file from the <strong>
onedrive for business</strong> client. refer to:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/virus-detection-in-sharepoint-online-e3c6df61-8513-499d-ad8e-8a91770bff63?omkt=en-us&amp;ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">virus detection in sharepoint online</a></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=36347f90-3d5f-47ff-966c-1a7f7ba99001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d36347f90-3d5f-47ff-966c-1a7f7ba99001" /></a><br />
2.in case the online files are affected, if you have edited them before, you can refer to the solution of scenario 3 in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3134213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">kb&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;to try to find the old version to recover them.<br />
3.if the option 2 does not work, please engage microsoft by opening a <strong>support request</strong> as soon as possible. we will work with you to evaluate the situation and assess the best option available to recover the desired content. we'll first work
 towards recovering the content through the various methods available through the ui/scripts.</p>
<p>if it is <strong>personal onedrive</strong>, as this forum mainly focuses on <strong>
office 365 for business</strong> online services, we'd suggest you post to our dedicated&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/forum">onedrive forum</a> for expert help(<strong>participate -&gt;ask a question</strong>). engineers there are able
 to give you a clear answer about the encrypted files on personal onedrive. thanks for your understanding.</p>

                    <p>I need to be able to work with multiple pdf files that will open in separate tabs from One Drive for Business.&nbsp; I saw posts back in 2016 where it did not look like it was possible.&nbsp; Surely by now MS has solved this inconvenience?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a way to open multiple PDF files from One Drive so that the PDFs open in separate tabs?&nbsp; This is a huge inconvenience and requires then a few extra steps of having to open another browser tab, navigate back to the same folder of PDFs and
 open the next PDF.&nbsp; Then repeat the same step multiple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Chrome browswer and not looking to switch to MS browswer.</p>

<p>Hi AJG-ATL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it does work the way you mentioned. You can, however, use the alternate way to open the PDF in multiple tab without opening a new tab and then navigating to folder of PDF’s every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, click the <strong>ellipses</strong> beside PDF name (don’t click over PDF name), choose
<strong>Open</strong>, click <strong>Open in browser</strong>.</p>
<p>

<p>does holding the hash key down change the profile i seen some issues here about this before&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>try the following and set up phone again</p>
<p>reboot your Nokia E51 by switching it off before removing the back cover and battery. After 10 minutes, replace the battery and back cover, then switch the phone on. This acts as a temporary measure to reset the software of the phone and refresh the device's
 memory. Check and see if you still have the same issue.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest that you update your phone software. Nokia Software Updater allows you to keep your phone up to date and improves the overall performance of your mobile phone. Kindly log on to the following link for Nokia Software Updater:<br />

    <title>How to open an Office document that is in a SharePoint document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kidder12rd  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to open an Office document that is in a SharePoint document library with Office Web Apps enabled&#63; &#40;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: IE 11</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered an issue when trying to open an Office document that is in a SharePoint document library with Office Web Apps enabled? (SharePoint 2010)&nbsp; It's causing our users errors that is based on a specific behavior.&nbsp; (Note we never had an issue
 with our Surface RT's running Windows 8 RT or 8.1 Preview.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The following steps causes the following message from IE 11.&nbsp; "The document could not be opened for editing.&nbsp; A Microsoft SharePoint Foundation compatible application could not be found to edit the document."&nbsp; Please note this message appears when we are
 using IE 11 from Desktop mode...not the modern (Metro)&nbsp;IE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Click on an Office document that is in a SharePoint Document Library&nbsp; </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; With Office Web Apps enabled this causes the document to be opened in the browser.&nbsp; Ex.&nbsp; Microsoft Word Web App.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In the browser tool bar there is an option to "Open in Word".&nbsp; When selected the choice of opening in read only or Edit mode is given.&nbsp; Choosing either and selecting OK opens the document in Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Once the user is finished working in the document Microsoft Word is closed and the browser is on the screen.&nbsp; When another document from is clicked on it is opened in the browser - Microsoft Word Web App.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; If the user clicks on "Open in Word" an error appears titled Microsoft Word Web App.&nbsp; "To open this document, your computer must be running a supported version of Microsoft Word and a browser that supports opening files directly from the Office Web Apps."&nbsp;
 This worked in Step #3 but now it fails.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; When the user presses back on the browser he sees the same SharePoint Document library he has been working at.&nbsp; If he tries to open any document an alternate way by hovering the mouse over the document and then clicking on the "down" arrow and choose
 the option "Edit in Microsoft Word" a message stating "The document could not be opened for editing.&nbsp; A Microsoft SharePoint Foundation compatible application could not be found to edit the document."&nbsp; is displayed.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The only resolution to this issue we have found is to close the browser and open an new browser session.&nbsp; If the user always ignores using the Web App on always opens the documents stated in Step #6 everything is fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please note - This never happened on the Surface RT when running Windows 8 RT or 8.1 Preview.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also, when I look at the Managed Add-ons it states that Office Document Cache Handler's status is "Incompatible"&nbsp; When referenced against Surfaces running&nbsp;Win 8.0 or 8.1 Preview this status was always "Enabled"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This has been recreated on 10 different RT's that were just pulled out of the box yesterday that were immediately upgraded to 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Final Note - We took 2 of these RT's that were failing and formatted them using a USB recovery from 8.1 and then did a fresh install (Not downgraded to 8.0 and then updated again) and the problem does not occur.&nbsp; This is not a solution in my mind because
 I don't want to do this 250 more times for all the other RT's in our organization.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Whew...that was wordy.</p>

<p><span>Hi </span>Amy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message in the screenshot indicate that a specific browser setting caused the issue. Where did you get the information that this can only be performed in IE?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest use the safe mode with the browsers to check the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or as you don’t change the billing information a lost, you can just use IE to update the information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook </p>

<h2>            Transition to next slide starts as soon as last animation on current slide plays</h2>
                    <p>I'm sure this has been discussed before, but I'm preparing a presentation for an important interview and I've spent too much time already searching for an answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my slideshow, I'm giving a point by point breakdown on a topic. I have applied animations to each point, so that they only appear when I am ready to move on to the next point. But for some reason, after I click to trigger the last animation on the current
 slide, it automatically moves on to the next slide as soon as the animation stops playing. Obviously, I want my audience to be able to see my point before moving on. How do I make it so that two separate mouse clicks are needed to</p>
<p>1) start the last animation on the current slide and </p>
<p>2) move on to the next slide?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In transitions, all slides are set to advance on mouse click. I have the box to advance after a certain time period unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Yep.&nbsp; I've had Office365 installed on a HP Revolve for near on 12 months and it's now telling me that I have only 1 more day to activate.&nbsp; I think the message that my copy isn't activated started appearing on 31DEC13 or 01JAN14 - hence the 15 days will be
 up tomorrow/next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What gives?&nbsp; Help&nbsp;button&nbsp;informs me that Office365 is automatically activated, and there's no other suggestions (for Office365).&nbsp; I have tried re-installing Office365, but message still the same!&nbsp; I have it installed on another laptop and that doesn't seem
 to be affected?&nbsp; Perhaps it could be something to do with calendar setttings in Outlook (as this appears to be related to 01JAN) as this only affecting some computers, maybe computer regional settings . . . .&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get Error Code: 0x4004F00C.</p>
<p>When the Activation screen appears, I've clicked on the "Change Product Key" button and then "Sign in with an active account instead" and used my Live account which has the Office365 subscription.&nbsp; This appears to work&nbsp;as it tells me my computer is now linked
 to the Live account, but it doesn't do anything, activation error next time an Office365 app is launched.&nbsp; What is surprising is that I have to input my email (and password), when the computer is alread logged into a Live account (i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those that always offer the obvious; uninstall, reboot etc.&nbsp; Been there done that (wasted lots of time).&nbsp; Anyway, I need a fix soon as I&nbsp; only have 1 day left!!!!&nbsp; Help.&nbsp;

            <p>Ok, now I feel like an idiot.&nbsp; I ran a few scripts (try Bing search on error code) which outlined the Activation status of Office.&nbsp; I saw an instance of Visio in there (which isn't part of my Office365 subscription) and double checked "Uninstall Programs
 and Features".&nbsp; Sure enough there was a copy of Office Pro sitting there along with Office365. Uninstalled Pro and all is sweet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestng when I uninstalled it, the Win8 start icons were still there and still work for Office365.&nbsp; Not sure how it's all set up, but the same start icon must default to local installed copies before searching for 365&nbsp;versions of programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh well, you live and learn.&nbsp; Anyone else having this Activation issues with Office365 might want to check for stray installs of other Office programs . . . . .</p>

            The only way I fixed it is to wipe the machine and did a factory restore... And it now works fine with windows 10. This was after 10 installs and uninstalls and a 2 hr Microsoft remote assist. I decided to wipe and reinstall the the computer..&nbsp;

            <p>Agreed, I'm now Win10 and after my 3rd or 4th upgrade and degraded (and bringing all the issues with it), I have now completed a "clean" install and things appear to be working correctly.&nbsp; Fingers crossed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish that MS would have devised an "upgrade" method that would enable a clean install of Win10, it would have saved me countless hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice, don't frig around with it (anything).&nbsp; Just upgrade, get Win10 activated and then straight to setting and do a clean install.&nbsp; Do it once (well twice really :-) ) and get it right.</p>

            <p>I also prefer this for the same reasons as you. Here's how I do it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On the top menu bar, go to Tools &gt; Customize keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In the categories list, scroll down to All Commands and select that</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In the "Find" box type "nav" and then select "NavPaneSearch"</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. In the box marked "Press new keyboard shortcut" do that... ***if you want to use cmd + F or control + F make sure to first go to the command called "EditFind" and remove that shortcut from that command</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Click "Add" and then the shortcut will appear in the "Current keys" box above. Finally, click OK to close the dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I've done, and now the sidebar find/replace opens whenever I press control-f (I left cmd-f as the shortcut for the main search box just in case I want to use that for some reason).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Repair Install for IE10 on Win8</h2>
                    I am having SO many issues with IE10 on my Windows 8 Pro machine. I was hoping theres a way I can do a repair install or reinstall it. I even have these issue with No-Addons. My issues are hard to explain but I'll do my best.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Say I have 2 tabs open, i'll go to open a new tab and the body of IE will show that new tab page but I won't actually get a new tab. Instead it just shows me the new tab body on the second tab. However, if I go to the 1st tab and back to the 2nd tab, the
 2nd tab returns to the page it was on before opening another tab</li><li>Another issue is when I try and open a link. Whether i'm already on the page or opening from Outlook email, doesn't matter, IE will come to a halt for about 2 minutes and then resume except the link wont open in a new tab, it opens in a new window.</li><li>Say I have 3 tabs open, when I close the 3rd tab, the first and second tab grow in width. For example, say having 3 tabs open, from the first tab to the 3rd is 3 inches wide. When I close the 3rd tab, the width of tab 1 and 2 grow to remain that 3 inches
 wide instead of shrinking down to the 2 inches.</li></ul>
<div>There are a few other minor issues but the biggest frustration is the time between going between links. Clicking links sometimes takes a few seconds other takes a few minutes. I know it is not the website nor my internet nor my connect as it only happens
 in IE and doesn't matter which site. It looks like it froze but you can still click around and sometimes it will jump to that page without any loading indicators like it normally does, sometimes it will remain on the same page but the URL will change and sometimes,
 a new window with that link opens.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please tell me there is a way to do a repair install on IE10. I've tried doing the restore advanced and the reset options in internet options but the issue still remains.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div>Rich</div>

            <p>Depending on the version of Windows 8 Pro you have, e.g. Desktop, Tablet, etc.&nbsp; you may be able to restore your computer to its original factory default settings&nbsp;by doing a system REFRESH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 10 is part of the Windows 8 operating system.&nbsp; The only way you can re-install it is by reloading Windows 8.&nbsp; This is possible, through something called<strong> REFRESH</strong>, which is a WIN 8 option that saves your personal files (documents,
 pictures, videos, Windows Store apps) and uninstalls everything else. Then it reinstalls Windows 8, updates your system, and reinstalls your personal files.&nbsp; It will also reinstall a clean copy of Internet Explorer 10.&nbsp; Essentially, REFRESH puts your computer
 back the way it was when you bought it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how many programs you may have bought, downloaded, or whatever, but if you do a REFRESH it will
<u>uninstall all of them</u> and you will have to reinstall them one at a time.&nbsp; It will leave a file on your Desktop telling you which programs it uninstalled, so you can reinstall them.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; You&nbsp;may need the original discs&nbsp;or product code to reinstall
 some applications, so before doing a REFRESH, be sure you can do that.&nbsp; Also , if you bought your own antivirus software (other than that which came with your computer) you will need to contact your Antivirus software provider and request a
<u>temporary</u> deactivation of the software, so that when you go to reinstall it, you won't have to buy another license. &nbsp;REFRESH
<strong>will not</strong> remove any pre-loaded programs that came with your computer (MS Office etc,); &nbsp;only those that you
<strong>have added</strong> since buying your computer.&nbsp; When you re-install your programs, it is a good idea to install only one and then check your computer's operation to see if your original problem reappears.&nbsp; Then move to the next one, etc, then to peripherals.&nbsp;
 You never really know where the culprit is but, as long as you're starting over, it is a good time to eliminate potential problem causers, one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should write down the website address of all sites you have Pinned to Start, because they will be gone and you will have to go back to the site and pin them again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When REFRESH is finished, it will automatically start applying all of the Windows
<u>updates</u> that have accumulated over the past few months.&nbsp; This will take awhile, but what you have&nbsp;pre-installed on your hard drive needs to be updated.&nbsp; While REFRESH is running, DO NO TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER!&nbsp; It may seem like nothing is happening at
 times.....just wait.&nbsp; You don't have to do ANYTHING!.&nbsp; When REFRESH has finished it will return you to the Start screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make it happen..................</p>
<p>At the Start screen type <strong>REFRESH</strong></p>
<p>Select "Settings"</p>
<p>Select "Refresh&nbsp;your PC"</p>

            Sadly...I did not read carefully enough and didn't expect to lose all my applications. Its my fault for not reading carefully but figured it was like an SFC /scannow kind of thing. Is there anyway I can revert back just so I can finish the work day and
 do the refresh again over the weekend? If not, is there a way I can look at a list of applications I had installed? In other words, I'm hoping it saved a txt file with a list of programs in Programs and Features.

            I was gonna do the refresh.... But my new computer didn't come with the Windows 8 disc. I guess that's a Gateway or WalMart thing. So I'm kinda afraid to do the refresh. I've got a guy that is gonna replace my Windows&nbsp;8.1 with Windows 7. I think I'll like
 that better any ways. Windows 7 still works on my other computer that I had to bring out of retirement. Thanks for your help. It is much appreciated.

            <p>You&nbsp;don't need the Windows 8 disc.&nbsp; REFRESH reloads the Windows 8 "clean copy" that is on your hard drive.&nbsp; The only way your&nbsp;friend can replace WIN 8.1 with WIN 7 is to erase everything on your hard drive and reload WIN 7 from a disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are willing to "loose everything", why not just try the REFRESH first.?&nbsp; Only takes about 30 minutes !!</p>

            I had to reload this page twice just to reply. lol Ok I'm gonna try that tomorrow if the grandkids don't come over. Thanks Yep I knew I'd have to wipe the whole computer out for the Win. 7 Luckily I haven't had this computer long enough to loose a lot.
 But since I don't have to have the Win.8 disc I'm gonna try the refresh. This is the first computer I've bought without any disc for the WIndows and drivers. So I've been a little careful about what I do on this one. But now at the end of the road of desperation
 with this thing. I use my old computer more than this one right now. So I guess there isn't much to loose. Thanks for taking the time to help me. I now have some hope on getting this thing back to somewhat normal. Thanks to all .

<h2>            Problems with universal apps when using 2-factor authentication on Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just figured out this problem with Windows 10 build 10130. I can sign in just fine during setup using my e-mail, password and authenticator app, but when Security and Maintenance would ask me to verify my identity, it would open a dialog box saying Just
 a moment, which would quickly close, and then open again. This would repeat until I close a dialog box manually. I thought of reporting this through Windows feedback, but that isn't working either. So, is there any workaround for this issue, other than disabling
 two-factor authentication?</p>
