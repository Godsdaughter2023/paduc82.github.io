<h2>            How to turn off ONLY the display on Surface Pro 3&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Plese, I just want to be able to turn my display off. Nothing fancy here, nothing new. This has allways been possible on every windows so far. On my Surface Pro 3 it seems impossible! Windows is supposed to be powerfull and by buying a SP3 I was expecting
 to do everything a PC does. A simple thing like turning JUST my display off!!</p>
<p>Connected standby is great and all, but if Microsoft could just&nbsp;ADD IT&nbsp;and not FORCE it on me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please someone tell me there is any way to accomplish this simple task! I don't care how complicated the solution is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so so so much!</p>

<p><span>Hi Hattrik21,</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thankyou for Visiting Microsoft windows Vista
<span>&nbsp;</span>answers Forum.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Horizontal Scroller canot be disabled&nbsp;the settings of comes by default.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Advantages of Horizontal Scroller in windows Explorer:<br />
The Horizontal Scroller displays multiple images(jpg, png, gif or swf ) that can be scrolled automatically or via a scrollbar. When scrolled manually, the scroller auto-snaps to the closest image. Each image has a link that opens when you click on it. Images
 and links are configured through an XML file.<br />
Use it to show featured products on your homepage, or showcase your latest projects, or as the navigation to different sections of your website, etc!<br />
Features:<br />
1. &nbsp;Resizable<br />
2.&nbsp;Have multiple items per screen or just one.<br />
3. Auto scroll (optional) with adjustable scroll speed, and pause time<br />
4.&nbsp;Auto snap (optional) to the closest image when scrolling. You can adjust the snapping speed.<br />
5.&nbsp;Blur when scrolling (optional) with adjustable blur amount.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if this worked.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

            Hi Ern504, please try this to see if you can get your system to boot from the installation media:
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

</p><p>Really had me stumped as why I turned here. I happened to get a text while doing this and unlocked my phone to view it and found the fix. Just unlock your phone and it will ask you if you want to allow computer access to your photos and videos on your computer.
 Click accept and then refresh file explorer and you'll see the folders like you remember.

<h3> marcus henriksen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot, no matter what</h2>
                    Suddenly today my M2. drive's windows crashed, and now it can't start up. I've tried using USB recovery but literally nothing happened. Tutorials about this tell you to go into windows aso. when I can't even boot the PC. I cannot get to the troubleshoot
 menu. I have an option to start in safe mode with command prompt, but if I choose that the PC just restarts and bluescreens, a loop. I really need to get into my PC because I need my files.

            Confirm if the flash stick boots on another PC, then if not create it over again using only Media Creation Tool making sure to follow exactly the steps on the download page here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If confirmed it works follow these troubleshooting steps for reinstalling:  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Overwatch LC-202 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morgan cobley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overwatch LC-202</h2>
                    For the past two days, I've been getting disconnected from Overwatch, with the error LC-202 (lost connection to game server). This is happening every 20-30 minutes, kicking me from both games and the menu. I've tried every step blizzard recommended, from
 disconnecting and reconnecting my linked blizzard account, to running diagnostics that were perfectly fine, and to reset my router. However, the problem is still persisting. This has never happened before, and it's making the game unplayable. My game is not
 lagging, and is perfectly normal otherwise. I tried contacting blizzard support and they said that they couldn't do anything and it wasn't a problem with their servers. Any suggestions?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let me assist you with removing your Facebook contacts from Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you configure a Microsoft account to Windows Live Mail? The Facebook contacts that you are seeing on Windows Live Mail is from the email account that you configured to the mail client that is connected to Facebook. If you already removed the connection
 of Facebook to your email account, check if this is reflecting on the email account by accessing it via web. You can also reconfigure the account to Windows Live Mail to refresh the connection and for the changes to show. You can click on this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for steps on how to configure your account to Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Technical Support Phone Scam</h2>
                    Hello, I recently recieved a call (about 5 minutes ago) from Microsoft. They claimed to be &nbsp;technical support from Microsoft. They told me that my computer has been sending alot of error and warning messages to Microsoft. They told me that the messages
 and stuff said that my computer had downloaded malicious malware and it could corrupt my system and internal hard drive. Next they told me that they haven't seen me respond and have now called to help me resolve this message. ( I stopped to think about what
 they told me because I have had been having a lot of slow boot issues and Windows taking almost 5+ minutes to start up.) So played along for a while but only for a minute. The first guy said let me connect you to our senior technical specialist or something
 like that. So i got connected. The second guy said, "Hello my name is _________ Snyder (I only remember the last name).They brought me to my event viewer and after that I hung up in suspicion and securuity/privacy. They tried calling me again but i rejected
 the call. Please give me opinions on this issue. I want to know whether it is a scam to take over my computer and steal my identity/etc. or is it really Microsoft trying to help fix my computer.&nbsp;<br />
Some info on the "technical support guys":<br />
Both were male. One had a strong middle eastern accent while the other one had a slight middle eastern accent to it.&nbsp;<br />
One of the men claimed to be the Senior _______ (don't remember the middle word) Specialist. Said his name was ________ (don't remember first name) Snyder.<br />
Traced the location of the call. Approximate location is New Hampshire, USA. That is all I know<br />
Please help! Also give suggestions on anything that might be needed to change etc.

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors <br />
existed on your computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or <br />
worse to steal your identity. <br />

Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make <br />
unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

                    I recently upgraded my motherboard and other hardware and reactivation is not working. I have tried using the default code give out in other forums and it did not work. Windows 10 is linked to my Microsoft account and when i use the troubleshooter to select
 the pc i'm currently using all it says is "<span>We can’t reactivate Windows on this device.
 Try again later." I do not have the old product key anymore as it was an only windows 7 home premium and it said that it was registered as a virtual key. Phone support was useless essentially said i needed to buy a new product key because i didn't have the
 product key from like 4 years ago.</span>

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. 
<br />
<br />As you have used the troubleshooter, the only way is to contact support.
<br />

<p>Phone support said that my key was something along the lines of "the default key" or something like the but the guy was very hard to understand. Chat support was just a bot up until it said it couldn't solve my problem and gave me a phone number. Is the
 chat support with live agents on a certain time zone?</p>

<p>I'm afraid I don't know about Chat Support for sure as I've never had to use it. The phone number should be local to you but that doesn't mean you get a local human. Keep trying until you get someone you can understand properly. I know it's annoying but
 it may be your only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Produkey gives a key listed under Internet Explorer and that is usually the original key. Does that match the key you have.</p>

            I had a old text file that said my product key was the same key as the internet explorer so I believe that is the original key.

<div>With this drivers no more BSOD and the joystick will be fully fontionnal (with force feedback) on 7sp1 and vista sp2.</div>

<h3> jzames  say:</h3>
<h2>            ICS. cannot start all dependencies. windows 7 ultimate</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to connect my laptop to my XBOX 360 through Internet Connection Sharing (ICS). When i try to enable, I get an error message that says, "An error occurred while Internet Connection Sharing was being enabled. The dependency service or group failed
 to start." So, I searched online to resolve this issue and all I've found on it is that a service needed by ICS is not running.</p>
<p><br />
These services are:<br />
<br />
Application Layer Gateway Service, Network Connections, Network Location Awareness (NLA), Plug And Play, Remote Access Auto Connection Manager, Remote Access Connection Manager, Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service, and Telephony.</p>
<p>They are all activated except Remote Access Connection Manager and Remote Access Auto Connetion Manager because i get "Error 1068: The dependency service or group failed to start." when trying to start them. Also, Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service
 is set to automatic as well but it will not allow me to start it. It says "The Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service service on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs."</p>
<p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>As far as the 3rd party security, application please read this. The example and the specific circumstance are different but the principle is the same.</p>
<p>Many of these application deem part of the network aspect of Win 7 none functional.</p>

            Hi,
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with Windows 10. I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue could occur if there is some processes getting struck or some third party application is conflicting with the system process.
</span></p>
<p>To assist you better, please provide the information:</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the Computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. When you say that "I keep getting a message that a plugin is having prob;em", when exactly are you getting the error message? Are you getting the error message when you try to open any browser?</p>
<p>Refer to the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to boot the Computer in Safe Mode and check if the issues is occurring or not. After following the below steps from the link. Under the options. Please select Safe Mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a>
</p>
<p><span>If the issues still persist, refer to the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2</span></strong><span>: I would suggest you to boot the Computer in clean boot mode
 and troubleshoot with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the below link to enter into clean boot state. The below link can also be applicable to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Clean boot disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using
 a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing
 a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However,
 you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.

</span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
What does the third line do? The <em>"</em><em>nResult = LaunchAppAndWait(szCmdPath, szCmdLine, WAIT);</em>"<br />
<br />
We're thinking that the priority is to run the bat file in order to launch the program properly. But anyway, you may want to share this
<em>case</em> to our ITs in TechNet, and they might be able to explain how it should work:

    <title>Downgrading to Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennis michaeltiffany  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downgrading to Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have to be honest with you, I don't like the way that Microsoft is forcing users to accept the Windows 10 upgrade, without giving customers the option of staying with previous versions of Windows. It would seem to me that since there are only two kinds
 of operating systems, for the most part, those being Microsoft Windows and OS X, Microsoft should have a little bit more of a variety in the kinds of operating systems that offers for computers. But this is not the case. Microsoft seems to not care what version
 of Windows customers generally prefer. My preliminary research has shown me that there are many, many, people who prefer Windows 7 over Windows 10. I am one of those people.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a computer with Windows 10, although I would have much preferred to have a Windows 7on the computer. It was a good deal, and I thought that I would be able to downgrade to Windows 7 later. I didn't realize that Microsoft is now making it
 incredibly difficult&nbsp; to downgrade any computer preinstalled with Windows 10 down to Windows 7.&nbsp; Because I didn't want to put myself in a bad situation by erasing my hard drive on my new computer without knowing if I could downgrade the system, I installed
 a clean hard drive compatible with the new computer (an HP Envy desktop, 12GB RAM, 2TB HDD) and attempted to install a fresh copies of Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; I tried both the USB install option by enabling Legacy Boot and disabling Security Boot, and I tried
 the disc option.&nbsp; Both failed for one single reason; the files loaded up just fine in preparation for install, but when I got to the point of my input (choosing a language at the beginning of the process), the mouse and keyboard did not work.&nbsp; There was no
 functionality at all for either of them.&nbsp; No matter what I attempted to try, I could not get the mouse and keyboard to function.&nbsp; I scoured the Internet for answers, and tried dozens of suggestions.&nbsp; I called the Geek Squad (whom in my opinion are overrated,
 and showed it when I called), I called HP, I tried calling Microsoft, all of whom had no suggestions at all.&nbsp; I could not get the mouse to move or the keyboard to input anything.&nbsp; Dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was obvious to me that keyboard and mouse (which are wireless and came with the computer) did not load the drivers when the computer loaded up the Windows 7 files and began the installation process.&nbsp; So I tried dividing the hard drive with the Windows
 10 installed, to install Windows 7 on the&nbsp;partition, but I was met with the same obstacle.&nbsp; No input from the mouse or keyboard.&nbsp; So I thought I would use a USB mouse, trying all of the USB ports available on the machine and ended up with the same result.&nbsp;
 I had read online that many people with this issue have found success using a PS/2 mouse, but there are not ports for this on my computer.&nbsp; Other people have said that the only way I could install Windows 7 on my computer is to 1.) use a virtual machine, or
 2.) clone sector by sector a hard drive with Windows 7 already installed on it, which I am perfectly capable of doing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is most disheartening about this experience is the fact that Microsoft never gave me a choice as to what operating system I wanted to use.&nbsp; They are forcing people to upgrade to Windows 10 even when they don't want to, and have developed tactics in
 which people's computers are being upgraded in the middle of the night while they slept.&nbsp; Those who hold out and refuse to be upgraded are constantly being bombarded with reminders to upgrade.&nbsp; In my mind it seems to me that the reason they are doing this
 is because in the near future Microsoft is planning to go into the subscription market, forcing people to pay a monthly service to use Windows rather than buying the software outright (because we all know that Microsoft isn't making enough money as it is).&nbsp;
 Whatever their reasons for the Nazi-like way they are trying to police what operating systems the world uses, the point is that it's offensive to me that they are forcing me to use an operating system I do not want just because they CAN.&nbsp; I didn't not like
 Windows 8, nor did I like Windows 8.1, and I do not like Windows 10.&nbsp; It's that simple.&nbsp; But because Windows is virtually the only operating system available for PC right now, for the most part, Microsoft is forcing change down our throats, and I don't like
 it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft is going to go to the subscription service, as I suspect, and as so many now are electing to do (Adobe, for instance), this would be a great time for new software and operating system developers to get into the game that Microsoft has dominated.&nbsp;
 For my part, I'll just have to learn Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...there it is.&nbsp; Is it now impossible for me to downgrade my computer from Windows 10 to Windows 7 without cloning a friend's hard drive?&nbsp; I have no ports for mice on the back of my computer except for USB, and I have two types of those -- 2.0 and 3.0.&nbsp;
 m I going to have to create an image of Windows on a USB or disc so that it would include the mouse drivers I need to install the operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I ideas do you have?</p>

            <p>A lot of the information in your post is a combination of speculation and assumptions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice you went through all these attempts to install Windows 7, but you never actually gave Windows 10 a chance, and see how it works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, not everyone likes having their existing version of Windows upgraded to Windows 10 for logical reasons: application and hardware compatibility, age of the machine, environment where the machine is being used etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You own a computer "preinstalled" with Windows 10, which means, it is "designed" for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you hear persons complain about wanting to install Windows XP on a new HP in 2009 or 2010?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you hear persons complain about wanting to install Windows NT 4 Workstation on a new Compaq in 2000 or 2001?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, depending on the model machine, both Intel and Microsoft have made a decision to phase out Windows 7 support on computers using the Intel Skylake processor. Yours might just be one of those.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downgrade rights is often limited to computers that come preinstalled with Windows 10 Pro OEM. In such cases, the OEM will modify the system to accommodate older versions of Windows. This is usually an exception available to large enterprise customers or
 small businesses. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Microsoft supporting different versions of Windows? The company does that. Windows 7 is supported until January 2020, Windows 8/8.1 until January 2023.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has not plans to make Windows 10 a subscription service, but regular free upgrades are expected such as the upcoming
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggest if you are desparate to keep using Windows 7, is to return the computer, then purchase an approved computer already preloaded with Windows 7. You can also purchase a Windows 10 Pro preinstalled machine, which is likely to have support for older
 versions of Windows. You can normally find these in the business section of popular brand websites such as HP, Lenovo or DELL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is Windows 10 really free and do I have to pay for it after the first year has passed?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I have to pay for updates and fixes for Windows 10?</strong><br />
No, updates, fixes, security updates, features all remain free. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows
 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and&nbsp;5 years extended support.</p>

 I must have worded that wrong...there isn't a partition on the hard drive, it just says unallocated and when I tryed creating a partition it said that it wasn't able to. And with nothing on the hard drive I can't get to a start screen or anything so that I
 can run a 3rd party tool.

            Can you boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode, using a Windows Repair CD? You can ask a friend to burn one for you.
