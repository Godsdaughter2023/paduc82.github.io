<p>Hey Xbox Gamer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out! Before continuing, I'd like to clarify a few things. You mentioned something about age authentication. Could you expand as to what you mean by that? I'd also like for you to let us know if you are referencing the iPin security
 application and what certification site you are talking about. We hope to hear back from you soon! :D</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 reset help</h2>
                    <p>So never really needed help before but kinda stumped with nothing to do and no money to buy a new OS so this is what happened to me. Im not very good with this type of thing so that why im here i guess but first off ill start by saying i bought this pc its
 quite old but its fine for me it had windows 7 something i cant remember the exact version but when i got it i ugraded to windows 10 because i liked windows 10 but here we are now something i should probably say is it has 2 1TB harddrives dont know the exact
 version but it has 2 but in the windows interface it only had 1 2tb harddrive idk how this worked and i didnt really look into it because it didnt seem important another thing i should probably say is whenever i booted my computer up before it would have this
 "press any button to skip disk check" and it would count down from 10 and if you didnt click a button it would go to about 9% or so and then do nothing just reboot and do it again didnt think it was that big of a deal to me so i left it be but last night when
 i decided i wanted to reset the pc i just kinda did it didnt think it would do much harm other than cleaning it up didnt even get the product key which was a big mistake on my part i think.. so i let it go through the 100% and after that it would just reboot
 and reboot go to a black screen and reboot i quickly remembered that the lights on my mouse would turn off whenever that skip disk check thing would come up but the keyboard wouldnt so i pressed the keyboard keys a few times after it would boot to the black
 screen and sure enough it was at the disk check thing but shouldnt it not go to that? i selected the option on windows 10 to delete everything except the os as if i had just got the pc but when it would go past that stage of me pressing those buttons to blank
 buttons would pop up and i have no clue what they are because they're litterally just blank with outlines i so i ended up pressing both of them hoping one of them would be a repair button but i dont think any of them were so here i am with a pc that is supposed
 to have a os but i have no idea how to access it i have the 1st boot device as RAID:RAID Ary 1 if that helps with anything if any more info is needed just ask i dont know if i explained this good enough its really sloppy imo but i dont know how to explain
 it the right way :/</p>

            <p>Seems like you're in a bind. Your best way forward is to create a recovery drive on another Windows 10 PC (make sure it's running the same edition as you were, for example home or professional) and boot from it. From there try the repair your PC option.
 Depends on how bad the OS is, you probably would have lost your data.</p>

<p>So i have the windows 10 ISO on a bootable USB i booted up to the USB selected repair and all that fun stuff but since i had 2 harddrives that were technically 1 to the computer it has 2 different things of windows "Choose target operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10 On volume 3</p>
<p>Windows 10 On volume 3"</p>
<p>what should i do about this? should i just do the first one boot the usb again and then do the second and see if that fixes it? thanks for reading/replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I dont mind if i lose everything except the os i could care less about everything else i had nothing important on it. I had already backed up all the things i needed to a usb so thats not a issue if i lose everything. The only thing im scared about
 is losing the OS i really dont have the money to get a new one or i would just do that.<br />

            <p>Again, let me stress that this is a tricky situation that you find yourself in. Without knowing your exact configuration, proceeding from here will most likely lead to data loss. Having said that, I suspect that your drives maybe configured in a RAID 1 type
 of configuration (drives are mirrored). In order for that to work there is a device driver that needs to be installed on Windows during the installation procedure. You can obtain this driver from your motherboard manufacturers website. However if you do not
 need your drives in RAID and you do not want your data and you have your Windows serial key available, I would suggest just re-installing Windows on either one of the drives and formatting them both during the installation procedure.</p>

<p>Hey thanks for the reply again Sam. Yes they are in raid 1 and they do need to be in that mode or else when it goes to boot it says "Operating sys missing" or something along those lines. Is there any command you can do in the command line to get the windows
 key? i never got that cause i thought this would be a 1 button press operation so i didnt bother. I also dont know what mother board i have where since i bought it from some random guy. If i was to find out that information how would i go about installing
 the drives on the system? Thanks sam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: the PC is a dell studio xps 7100 with upgrades such as: the 2 harddrives and a added 6GB of ram making it have a total of 12GB of ram in total. other than that i dont know if anything else has been touched or modified.</p>
<p>Oh yeah! i remember having a program called amd raidxpert or something along those lines would i need that again?<br />

            <p>If your Windows 10 was upgraded from a previous version of Windows then the key remains the same. Look around on your chassis to see if there's a Windows serial sticker. You should be able to enter that key during installation and it should work. I've checked
 the Dell website and there doesn't appear to be a RAID driver listed for Windows 10. Keep in mind that Dell has not certified the XPS 7100 with Windows 10, although in most cases it will work just fine. If you can live without the RAID and you have the serial
 from the previous version of Windows you can go ahead and format the drives and re-install the appropriate edition of Windows 10.</p>

<p>I looked around the case and i have found a sticker that has dell on it and a code like this: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX are you sure this will work if i just install windows 10 and put this in? ive heard that upgrading from windows 7 to 10 changes the
 key and such if this will work and i do go about reinstalling this how would i do it? should i just completely disconnect one of my hard drives from the motherboard until after installation of windows? sorry for all these questions and thanks for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: (im bad at posting these things.. jeez) so i looked on the sticker more and it says: Windows 7 Home Prem QA. which version of windows 10 should I use so that the key is valid?</p>

            <p>You're not stuck without an OS. You have a digital entitlement to Windows 7 Home premium which you've updated to Windows 10. That is your OS. I think you should be fine from here with just the install, but at worst case scenario you will need to reinstall
 Windows 7 and update it again using the USB stick you created. Like I said, you have nothing else to lose from here. Just wing it and see how you go, let me know and I will try to further assist you. Good luck.</p>

<h3> hkvalhe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Arno hunt down Shay Patrick&#63;</h2>
                    In the game, we come to know that it was the former Assassin, now a Templar by the name Shay Patrick Cormac, whom kills Charles Dorian - Arno's father in the other game Assassin's Creed Rogue. This leaves me to the question: Why didn't Arno Victor Dorian,
 the prostagonic in Unity, try to find the real truth about his father and hunt down Shay Patrick Cormac and ultimately kill him, if it wasn't Connor with his american assassins? This could be a new DLC for Unity. For Arno to hunt down Shay Patrick Cormac and
 kill him, in revenge of the death of his father, Charles Dorian. Other than that, the game is great, despite having some bugs yet to be ironed out with patches.

                    last night i installed windows 7. I have a problem with sticky notes right now. After each startup i get the notification that the meta tags of several sticky notes are corrupted. I don't use stickynotes so i don't want to see this. Someone any idea how
 to get rid of these notifications and/or the automatic loading of sticky notes on startup?

            You may use the free Autoruns tool (from Windows Sysinternals) and see and manage what's running at startup.<br />

The legitimate Sticky Notes executable file name is StikyNot.exe and is located at C:\Windows\System32 folder.

    <title>Privacy Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael gerbasio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Privacy Issues</h2>
                    <p>The biggest reason for me switching back to Microsoft from Google for my business, personal and mobile use, I wasn't comfortable with Google's privacy policies and the data they gather. I've pretty much divorced myself from Android and Google services. After
 all, you're allowing an advertising company to give you free software which trades privacy for services. Not judging, this is the business model so you join or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read this article:</p>
<p>http://bgr.com/2015/07/31/windows-10-upgrade-spying-how-to-opt-out/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(107, 107, 107, 1)">"We will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your
 emails, other private communications or files in private folders), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>and it drives me nuts. I'm paying a software company for software, and they're still gathering and using my private data. Am I better off with Apple, or Linux? I don't need MS to make a good faith effort to watch over me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointing I'll have to invest a good deal of time to figure out what they're accessing and what they're doing with it. If my choice is to pay to have no privacy or get free services and have no privacy, guess what, I'll go back to Google.</p>

            <p>People seem to need a one sentence answer to a complicated question (it is in their nature), so that is what is provided in a statement like what you are quoting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows or any operating system provides different things for different people.</p>
<p>Whereas one person might want all the online services they and get another shuns them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly if you are Microsoft and you are providing those services you have to declare that there are times when you in fact do things like look at people's emails or whatnot to provide the services requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course the very fact that the company makes such a statements sets off the person that doesn't want any person data shared for any reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also on top of that there are laws in this country.&nbsp; A company can't truthfully say "We will never share your data with law enforcement."&nbsp; Well not without going to jail.&nbsp; So that is one reason for "necessary to".</p>

sums up the company’s 45 pages of terms and conditions by saying:&nbsp;<br />
“Microsoft basically grants itself very broad&nbsp;<br />

            <p>I'm not sure how enterprise users are going to deal with this. As a consumer, I don't like it. there are no advantages of using Windows over Google services at this point in regards to privacy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what will hospitals, doctors, financial institutions do to protect their data? I'd like to find out so I can do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS doesn't just limit their data gathering and data exposure to law enforcement. The way I read&nbsp;it, they have the right to all data on my system, all my internet activity, can keep it as long as they want and can use it any way they want. Am I misunderstanding
 this?</p>

            <p>People seem to whatever. Look buddy you are not arguing that they don't share stuff you do not want shared. And they do that. They share stuff you don't want shared, pry where you don't want prying, and spy where you don't want spying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That I don't want it and can't prevent it is all that matters. All the other info is just fluff so you ought to not say that "a company" (which company are you talking about????) "can't truthfully" (sure they can, all they have to do is NOT STORE IT) "without
 going to jail". Companies never go to jail. Never heard of a company in jail.</p>

</p><p>Facebook is a social service, treat it like you would having a public conversation. Obviously there should be things you don't say on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yeah, I don't use chrome because I know it tracks me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For job hunting, the current system of using references is ****. Employers essentially abuse potential hires this way. Credit cards do a credit check, which is strictly a number to represent your financial status, and repayment capabilities, and not exactly
 what you buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm not going into a gender issues debate with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not what I make available in and for public conversation, it is for unpatented/non-license protected/unpublished works. You can include other private information like medical history in that list as well. These are the kinds of things we can
 computer without setting off any flags.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Privacy? Believe it or not, it still exists in this world, and should continue to do so.</p>

            <p>to answer your enterprise question, their solution for that is to use Windows 10 Enterprise which isn't released yet.&nbsp; in the enterprise "long term servicing branch" they get a lot more control over things</p>
<p>
</p><p>that leaves out a small business like mine, where we are too small to be a part of the LTSB so we will run with Windows 10 Pro on domain controllers and turn off as much as we can by Privacy settings, GPO or firewall blocks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think they are collecting any more than Google already is and most seem to accept that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the privacy issues and the somewhat rocky rollout, Windows 10 is a very good OS.&nbsp; Best Windows yet IMHO (flame on I suppose)</p>

    <title>System Protection - Restore &#34;drive&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weaver2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Protection - Restore &#34;drive&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I was, possibly foolishly, going through the system protection settings today and notice that the Restore drive had protection off.&nbsp; I went into the configure settings and enabled it.&nbsp; Noticing that the drive size was at 5.45 Gig with a max set at 20.1 Gig.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hitting apply and ok, I thought about it and thought that maybe that was a bad idea and went back in and turned it off.&nbsp; When I did this, it gave me a warning that there would be no protection for that drive and that all restore points would be disabled.&nbsp;
 Thinking that there wouldn't&nbsp; have been any restore pts there anyway, since it was already disabled, I figured not a big deal.&nbsp; When I said ok, that 5.45 Gig current usage disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I just screw something up?&nbsp; If so, what do I do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, in advance.</p>

<p>Did I just screw something up?&nbsp; If so, what do I do now?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Naaa…&nbsp; there's nothing wrong with disabling the system restore feature. &nbsp; However, why disable an internal backup system? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty harmless, and only takes up as much space as you've allocated.&nbsp; It does provide excellent protection if you installed a piece of software that wasn't compatible with your PC, the restore point could get you back to where you were before the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd recommend that you leave it enabled on the C:\ drive...&nbsp;</p>

<p>In system protection, it shows 2 drives in the list.&nbsp; One of them being C: the other being Restore with a folder icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was the Restore "drive" that I enabled it on and then disabled it; which is when I received the warning of deleting the restore points and the amount of space being used was cleared from 5G to zero when I disabled it.</p>

    <title>Codemasters introducing DRM on Xbox 360. Will it harm Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johntiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Codemasters introducing DRM on Xbox 360. Will it harm Xbox One sales&#63; &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    

<p>Firstly, apologies for the&nbsp;long post. I'm very&nbsp;concerned about the effect this company may have&nbsp;on&nbsp;Xbox one sales.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong></span></p>
<p>Codemasters were due to release their&nbsp;Formula One&nbsp;2013 game&nbsp;in the Americas on October 8th 2013. On that day, many American gamers trudged of to their local gamestores to pick up their F1 2013 game, some had it pre-ordered. Unfortunately for them, it was
 cancelled. Codemasters basically expected their customers to visit their official website on launch day just to make sure Codemasters didn't cancel/delay the launch day on launch day. And that is exactly what&nbsp;Codemasters did.</p>

<p>Here is a detailed thread on the issue. It is taken from Codemasters official forums [31 pages].</p>

<p>http://community.codemasters.com/t5/F1-2013-General-Discussion/NA-F1-2013-physical-retail-release-date-to-be-revised-Digital/td-p/369352</p>

<p>As you can see Codemasters do not reply much to their customers. Nearly 1 month on and Codemasters have no release date set for the psychical boxed&nbsp;[disk] version of F1 2013.</p>

<p>In many threads on Codemasters forums,&nbsp;Codemasters are pushing the sales of&nbsp;digital download copies. Codemasters are blaming the distributors, but we all know that is complete nonsense.</p>

<p>They are just a greedy corrupt company who want money for making broken and bugged F1 games this past 5 years.They treat their customers like crap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>PRESENTLY: </strong></span>For the life of me I don't know why MS or Sony allow their games to be published on their Games on Demand and PSN services.</p>

<p>They [Codemasters] are also placing spyware on people's computers, I have 100% irrefutable proof of this. If Microsoft is interested in this issue, then I will have no problems in explaining and submitting to them all I have witnessed from Codemasters. Does
 anyone know where I can report this activity? Should I file a report to Microsoft or the law enforcement/FBI in regards to computer and privacy&nbsp;intrusion? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I do not care about Codemasters anymore. After buying their dodgy, glitched, bugged and broken games this past 4 years I refuse to buy anything more from them ever again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>FUTURE CONCERNS:</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>
</strong>Here is my main concern.</p>
<p>Sony is due to release the PS4 in the Americas on the 15th of November 2013</p>
<p>Microsoft is due to release the Xbox One in the Americas and Europe on the 22nd of November 2013 {I have my day 1 console pre-ordered and can't wait to get it].</p>

<p>Between the 15th. and 22nd of November there is a very important sporting event in America. Its the Circuit of the Americas Formula One Grand Prix Race. The race is due to take place in Austin Texas on the 17th of November. Codemasters will be out in force
 in America to promote the digital download of their F1 2013 game&nbsp;on the&nbsp; very same week that Microsoft will be trying to promote the Xbox One.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Codemasters actions could potentially have a very negative effect on potential sales of Xbox One. We all know that Microsoft's Xbox One initially recieved very bad press in regards to DRM issues and all was reversed by Microsoft in June 2013.</p>

<p>It seems likely that Codemasters will not release F1 2013 [boxed disc version] in the Americas due to low sales in Europe and their own greed, and will push push push for the American fans to buy the digital download version&nbsp;which was released on PS3 on
 the 8th of October 2013 and on Xbox 360 on the 15th of October prior and after the Austin Texas Formula One Grand Prix Race. In otherwords, between the 15th and 22nd of November 2013.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I live in Europe. I bought my F1 2013 game at my local gamestore. It was the 'Classic Edition' version. It cost me €69.99. If I went to digitally download the game plus the classic content it will cost me €82.47 on Xbox £60's Games on Demand Service. To
 digitally download it, it will cost me an extra €12.48. And yes, the new F1 2013 game is just like the others in the series, it is bugged and broken. The game is 1 month old and already there is 19 pages of problems. Here is the official Codemasters&nbsp;Technical
 Assistance forums. They do release patches for fixes but they don't work. Last year I bought F1 2012 for my 360. There was many issues with it. After 200 hours of gameplay, I confirmed the game was broken and unplayable. Codemasters released patches/fixes
 for the Xbox 360 console but they had no effect on the game. They were 'placebo' patches. I know this to be true cos I have on Xbox 360 online and another 360 not connected to the internet.</p>
<p>After downloading the patch/fix for my online X360, I then inserted the game into my other 360 without downloading the patch/fix.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>There was absolutely zero difference between both.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I said, I'm very surprised that Microsoft allows Codemasters games to appear on their service, especially when you consider that Codemasters is a potential threat to the potential sales of Xbox One.</p>

<p>I can just hear the Sony fanboys scream " Never mind DRM on Xbox One, Microsoft and Codemasters are giving it a trial run on the Xbox 360. I bet Microsoft will include a terms of service policy update and re-introduce DRM".</p>

<p>I know Microsoft has no intention of doing any such thing but if all above starts to spread around the gaming communities, it may put a nail in the coffin of Microsoft's Xbox one much to the advantage of Sony's [already released and much cheaper] PS4 console.
 And all because of what? Some stupid little company like Codemasters who have treated their customers like crap this past 4 years.</p>

<p>I wish Microsoft much success with their new Xbox One console. I can't wait to play it. Go Microsoft go.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>TOO LONG/DIDN'T READ VERSION</strong></span></p>

<p>Codemasters will be pushing F1 2013 digital only sales during the week that Xbox One is due to be released. The digital download will be more expensive than the boxed/disc version which they have cancelled/delayed in the Americas. Remember the furore about
 DRM when the Xbox One was announced, well I guess on release week there will be much more talk about it. Never mind DRM on Xbox One, it seems that Codemasters and Microsoft are going to give it a trial run on the Xbox 360 on the same week that they are due
 to release the Xbox One.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I view Codemasters as a liability to Microsoft. If I was the boss at Microsoft I'd be ceasing all connections both business and personal wise with that company. Seriously, Microsoft, I hope you take note of this post. I'm sure all involved in Microsoft wants
 to forget about the whole DRM fiasco last May. Codemasters will be pushing all that into the gamers face again, on the very week that you guys/gals at Microsoft are trying to hype up the sales of Xbox One. I wish you all well on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love Xbox, and I want the Xbox One to be at least&nbsp;as&nbsp;successful as the 360, so I just thought I'd throw all this out there. Are Codemasters a potential threat to our beloved Xbox One. One thing is for sure, they're certainly not going to be helping things.</p>

<p>What do you people think?</p>

<p>Thank you a virtual duck. I was posting in my views on their official forum board. My views were about the game not working so good. I was listing out issues. I was also writing about concerns regarding online safety and cyber-bullying. As I was wriying
 my post, mid way, Codemasters banned my account. I was only mid way writing it, I did not have it publically posted on their forums. It was like as if they were watching what I was writing and banned me before I posted it publically.</p>
<p>I have it screen capped and saved. I had a lot of problems that week with my computer. If I changed my settings on my computer, they were switched back. I also lost control of my ISP's router. When I checked my computer settings, all listed UNTRUSTED PUBLISHERS
 were put into my TRUSTED PUBLISHERS list.</p>
<p>I had a week of hell. I restored my computer and downloaded Microsoft security Essentials, and I think all is ok now but I know Codemasters sites are laced with bit.ly url links which can easily hide malicious code.</p>
<p>I created another account and brought this to the attention of Codemasters Administration, they just banned me straight away without explanation.</p>
<p>Their site is supposed to be secure and is verified by verisign but yet, you can put in any nonsense into the sign up/register and it will let you through.</p>
<p>Codemasters do not address cyber bullying issues. If you bring it to the attention to the &nbsp;Codemasters administration, instead of asking and enquiring about where on their site is this occuring, they just simply ban you.</p>
<p>It seems like codemasters don't care about anything, anyone but themselves and money. They're a disgraceful company.</p>
<p>Thanks for reply A Virtual Duck. Much appreciated :)</p>

<p>I like your use of the word 'subtle' A Virtual Duck. I'm certainly not afraid of any International/National Security organizations intruding into my computer. I have nothing to hide from them. I will invite them and grant them permission if they want to
 check out my computer but as you said, when a small group of unknown people like Codemasters are using illegal means to access my computer then its very likely to assume that they are also using the same tactics on other peoples computers, maybe even young
 kids. Seeing as they don't care about cyberbullying or any online safety advice, I agree with you and publically state that all involved in Codemasters are a complete plague on the industry and to their customers.</p>

<p>@Pkvas, I put in 200 hours beta testing it. It was broken. I wanted to be 100% sure it was broken before I publicly stated it was broken. As for fun playing it, no, it was far from fun. Anyways, I'm completely finished with that company. They make broke
 games and treat their customers like crap. I'll never give them another red cent.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br /> 
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />Try these procedures: 
<br />
<br />1: Change the display settings: 
<br />
<br />Sometimes, the issue may be caused due to incompatible display settings. Changing the settings or restoring them to the default settings might solve the issue for you. 
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows key once 
<br />2, Select Settings from the start menu 
<br />3. Click System 
<br />4. In the System window, select the Display tab in the left hand pane (if it isn’t already). 
<br />5. In the display tab, change the size of your text using the bar on the right pane. This should be the bar under the Change the size of text, apps, and other items: 100% (Recommended) You can choose any percentage except for the 175%. Setting the bar to 175% is known to cause the issue. 
<br />After selecting the font size, click Ok and check if the error persists. 
<br />
<br />================ 
<br />================ 
<br />
<br />2: Close Programs like Anti-viruses 
<br />
<br />1. Press CTRL, SHIFT and ESC key simultaneously (CTRL + SHIFT + ESC). 
<br />2. This should open the Task Manager. 
<br />3. In the Task manager, click the Processes 
<br />4.. The Processes tab has a number of columns, look at the Description column and find the process that is related to the AVG anti-virus. It should have a name AVG or something related to AVG. 
<br />5.Select the anti-virus process from the list and click End Process (bottom right corner). 
<br />6. Click Yes when prompted for confirmation. 
<br />
<br />Once done check if the problem is solved or not. If you are still experiencing the problem then make sure there aren’t any other security related programs running in the background. There might be programs other than the security programs that might be causing this issue. Try to turn off as many applications as you can to see if the problem is solved. 
<br />
<br />============== 
<br />============== 
<br />
<br />3: Restart the File Explorer 
<br />
<br />1. Press CTRL, SHIFT and ESC key simultaneously (CTRL + SHIFT + ESC). 
<br />2. This should open the Task Manager. 
<br />3. In the Task manager, click the Processes 
<br />4. Locate and select the Windows Explorer. 
<br />5. Click the Restart bottom at the bottom right corner 
<br />
<br />This will restart the file explorer and that will be the end of the problem. 
<br />
<br />============= 
<br />============= 
<br />
<br />4: Change File Explorer Options 
<br />
<br />1. Press and Hold Windows key and press R 
<br />2. Type control panel and press Enter or click Ok 
<br />3. Type File Explorer Options in the search bar 
<br />4. Select File Explorer Options 
<br />5. This will open the Folder Options 
<br />6. Select the General tab if it isn’t already 
<br />7. Select This PC from the drop down menu in Open File Explorer To: 
<br />Once done, click Ok and the problem should be resolved. 
<br />
<br />
<br />=========== 
<br />=========== 
<br />
<br /> 5: Clear the Cache &amp; Create New Path 
<br />
<br />1. In the toolbar, right click the File Explorer icon and select Unpin from toolbar. 
<br />2. Press and Hold Windows key and press R 
<br />3. Type control panel and press Enter or click Ok 
<br />4. Type File Explorer Options in the search bar 
<br />5. Select File Explorer Options 
<br />6. This will open the Folder Options 
<br />7. Select the General tab if it isn’t already 
<br />8.In the General tab, click the Clear button in the Privacy section. 
<br />9.Now, close the Windows Explorer by clicking the X at the top right corner of the window 
<br />10. Right click on the Desktop at any empty space. 
<br />11. Click New and then click Shortcut. 
<br />12. This will open the Create new shortcut 
<br />13, In the dialog box, type C:\Windows\explorer.exe and click Next. 
<br />14. Rename this file to File Explorer and click Finish. 
<br />
<br />I hope it works.
<br />
<br />Best Regards, 
<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>3. Type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command and press Enter key.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>If that doesn't works, try these steps:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>1. Search for 'windows powershell' using Cortana or Windows Search.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>2. From results, choose Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>3. Then type/paste following and press Enter key:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Repair-WindowsImage -Online -RestoreHealth</strong></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>

<h2>            Getting into BIOS without having UEFI capabilities</h2>
                    I am very new to just PC’s, let alone knowing things regarding software. I have recently realised that after a 3D mark run, my CPU’s boost clock was the same as the base clock (well actually slightly less for some reason at 2.78GHz and my base clock was
 2.8GHz. But I found out that the only way to either check if intels turbo boost feature is enabled or not and enabling it if not is by going into the BIOS and changing it from there. I have a intel i5 760 which is capable of turbo boosting to I think around
 3.2-3.3GHz. This is an issue as I don’t seem to have UEFI, and on startup I try holding down or constantly pressing delete which I looked up is apparently the correct key for a foxconn motherboard but nothing seems to happen when I do this and I cannot find
 a way to get into the BIOS. Some of what I’ve said might be really stupid and obvious or not make any sense because I am stupid and do not know much regarding this in the slightest.

<p>windows fast boot power option wont let most computer access bios with that esc key press .. .you can usually bypass the fast boot feature by giving the desktop focus with a click and then Alt+F4 will bring up the shutdown select menu - Restart and then
 try your Esc key to enter bios. </p>

<p>(1) What is the <strong>System Model</strong> that shows in <strong>MSInfo32</strong> (ask Cortana)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BING that for a site specific to your computer. There may be driver updates, articles, &amp; software that may permit BIOS-like adjustments while still booted to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(2) Try...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) "<strong>START, Settings, Update &amp; Security, Recovery, Restart Now</strong> (under Advanced Startup)"...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This reboots to the on-board Recovery Environment (same as "<strong>Shift+Restart</strong>"),</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; at the "Choose an Option" screen.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try doing that after a restart...&nbsp; You would enter Bios the same whether you are using UEFI Bios or Legacy Bios...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start tapping the key just before and while you see the Foxconn screen, or whatever appears first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a Foxconn motherboard, but my machine also uses the Del key to enter Bios...</p>
<p>It also uses F2 as a second option... Some machines use ESC...</p>

            Thanks everyone for helping, @Mikep I have tried using the Alt+F4 to shutdown and have tried multiple keys on different occasions to try and enter the bios but cant. @PCR Just PCR when I boot into the advanced options section in troubleshooting I cannot
 access UEFI firmware settings as I’m pretty certain now that my PC does not support that for whatever reason, and sorry for being a but stupid but i searched up &nbsp;the MSInfo32 but from the page I’m directed to I’m not sure what to actually look for etc. and
 @slance310, when I restart no matter what way I seem to try it I cant seem to find what way I can get the foxconn screen to show up although I have seen it show up before but I don’t know under what circumstances it does, because I had seen it say press Del
 key at the bottom but I haven’t seen the screen at all since I’ve actually wanted to get into it. Appreciate the help though thanks! I’m closer to working it out since....I think.

<p>You are welcome. I thought what I wrote would get to BIOS Setup whether it is UEFI or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) <strong>MSInfo32 </strong>is the System Information Utility. Ask Cortana for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, type MSInfo32 into "<strong>Right-click START, Run</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;What is the <strong>System Model</strong> &amp; <strong>BIOS </strong><strong>Mode
</strong>in it? They are on the System Summary page.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some machines have a setting in the Bios for a "Delay"... This determines how long the machine would display the Foxconn type screen before continuing to Windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP laptop was set to "Zero" by default... As you can imagine, that makes it quite difficult to hit the DEL key at just the right time... Maybe your's got reset or something... if you even have one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try hitting the DEL sooner if possible... Tap it repeatedly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility might be your keyboard... It may not be loading quick enough for your attempts with DEL to actually happen before Windows boots... You might try a different keyboard or USB port if it is USB... Or maybe even a PS/2 keyboard...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the first thing you are currently seeing on your monitor, and how long before it appears ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>An easy way to determine if your machine is using UEFI Bios is to look at your OS drive in Disk Management... If you see a "EFI" partition, you are using UEFI Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not, you are using "Legacy" Bios... This is something that can not be easily switched... it requires a different type of HDD setup for UEFI or Legacy, and would for the most part require reinstalling Windows...</p>

<h2>            Vista only works in safe mode and cannot do a system restore - HELP</h2>
                    I have not been able to get on my desktop pc for 2 weeks now.&nbsp; I can operate it in SAFE mode only and have limited functinality.&nbsp; I've tried doing a system restore and it says I have no system restore points and wont work.&nbsp; Also get some kind of message
 about a security error.<br />
<br />
Before all of this happened my system locked up during a configuration update in step 3 of something. Not sure what was going on but woke up one am to my screen locked on this update that wouldn't ever go away.&nbsp; Had to restart the system (the bad way) by turning
 it off then on.&nbsp; Ever since then, na da...<br />
<br />
Keep looking thru the forums for answers but none seem to be specific to my problem. Even called DELL and all they said was to reinstall OS.&nbsp; That&nbsp; means I would lose all my data which I can't afford to do.&nbsp; Too large to back up on disks.&nbsp; They said it was
 a Windows problem and not their problem. Dont you love service.<br />
<br />
Can someone help guide to a fix where I can get fully functional and yet not loose all my files, please.&nbsp;

            You may have to do a Backup of your Data&nbsp;if below does not work(buy an External Hard Drive), and then do a reinstall..<br />
<br />
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the
 Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>

<p>In both Vista and now Windows 7, in My Pictures (or Pictures) whenever I add a picture to the Pictures folder a new folder is created with two smaller versions of the picture are created, one 127x160 and the other 270x338 pixels, both with vcm_s_kf prefixs
 in their filenames. I assume that these are created for email or uploading purposes, but the folders that are created just get in the way, as I don't have a need for these smaller files, they just take up disk space and folder view space.</p>
<p>Is there any way to turn this action off?</p>

<h2>            Metal Gear Solid V&#58; Ground Zeroes Data Wipe Question</h2>
                    A few months ago, I went on the forums and asked about the connection Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain have. I have a glitch within' Ground Zeroes that doesn't allow me to collect all the Fox patches to proceed to
 the FoxDie Easter Egg. The one solution is to wipe all saved data on on Ground Zeroes to fix the problem, but Phantom Pain's saved data is linked to Ground Zeroes. So when I wipe Ground Zeroes' saved data, will it also wipe Phantom Pain saved data? I would
 like to keep my saved data on Phantom Pain, so if it does do that, is there another way to reset Ground Zeroes so I can reach the FoxDie Easter Egg while keeping my progress in Phantom Pain intact? Thanks for the help.

            Hi Ray.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You're User folders including Music, Documents, Pictures, Desktop, etc should be  under C:\Users\Your User Name.   I would keep files sorted into these and then manually drag them to external or the cloud for backup regularly - makes it easy and simple so they don't get chewed up or lost in some backup program.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            <p>I have a new computer (HP Pavilion 500-054) with win8. I am using Bose companion 2 series II speakers.</p>
<p>Everything worked just fine until I upgraded to win 8.1 and then no sound. I do not have a sound card so it must be on board sound. Trouble shooting shows No sound in windows. Is that even possible?</p>
<p>Anyway how can I fix this? If I remove Win 8.1 everything works fine again.</p>

    <title>Alternate driver for PA3845U-1DV2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charles trujillo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alternate driver for PA3845U-1DV2</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Toshiba&nbsp;Satellite 15" for portability but&nbsp;scarified a cd/dvd RW. I did not realize at the time&nbsp;that I would want 3 programs that would be very costly to download when&nbsp; made the purchase of the computer. I was looking for a low cost solution
 to get that capability so I purchased a Toshiba PA3845U-1DV2. My computer recognizes the drive in devices, when searched says it's the most current driver, but&nbsp;in the explorer window when look at the devices, when you put a cd or dvd in, the drive disappears,
 the drive its self&nbsp;makes the usual drive noise the light flashes but no&nbsp;windows media&nbsp;player comes up on the computer.
</p>
<p>Question: have I gone to low cost, to low tech (something no longer supported), if so what are my alternatives in the low cost solution.</p>
<p>I'm not even opposed to a kit that takes the old drive from my old computer and making it my new external drive.</p>

    <title>Migrating to Windows 10 Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julianbassett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migrating to Windows 10 Mail</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please help me with this issue? I've installed Windows 10 on my PC, the previous OS being W7. My email client is Outlook 2007, and during the process of migrating from Outlook to the Outlook.com Mail feature (import from email apps) I got the
 following error: "Something happened while we were checking your PC, and we can't move to the next step. Please refresh the page and try again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried that, and have the latest IE11, the add-on that does the migration, and I've deleted the browsing history and still no joy. For some reason the calendar on the W10 mail is fine, picking up the appointments in my Outlook with no issue. From what
 I can see, many appear to have had the same issue, with not much success. Any further advice over what's gone before? Maybe I need to reset the process and restart - how do you do that? Grateful for any help, as I'd like to make the Windows 10 Mail work.</p>

            <p>Yes Kalpana, I'm setting up Mail on my Windows 10 installation. As I go through the steps, it ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If you use a desktop application like Outlook, Outlook Express or Windows Live Mail, you can import your emails, contacts and account info into Outlook.com.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened that page in Windows Explorer, as it requests. It says next: </p>
<p><em>You can import emails and contacts and add accounts from these applications.
