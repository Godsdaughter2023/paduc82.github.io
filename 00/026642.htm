<h2>            OneNote Sections Lost After Fresh Install</h2>
                    <p>Good morning - a user's Surface was randomly rebooting, so I decided to do a fresh install of Windows [using the built-in utility] with the option to preserve their data. After the installation, the user signed into OneNote and noticed all of their activity
 from the past two months missing. I tried resyncing the Notebooks, I've checked the recycle bin, I checked OneDrive, etc. and found nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at my user audit logs, I can only see that Notebooks were accessed around the time of the reinstall - so, this current set of outdated notebooks is the only activity I have for this user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the Windows.old folder, but could not find a reference to OneNote's local data in the expected location - Users/username/AppData/Local/Microsoft/OneNote...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a search of that Windows.old folder and found several OneNote folders - one had a cache that seems to have a bunch of .bin files that correspond to the user's activity...I assume these are cached references to sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to be unable to do anything to retrieve this data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can I roll back to the previous build? This a Surface Pro 5 running Windows 10, Office 365 subscriber - I used the system utility to reinstall Windows yesterday [5/9/19].</li></ul>
<p>I assume the user was working in OneNote 2016 and, perhaps, was not syncing to OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can I reinstall OneNote 2016 and somehow link up these old cache files? Would all of the older OneNote files have been deleted when the Windows install replaced OneNote 2016 with the new version.</li><li>Would OneNote 2016 files or backups be located elsewhere on the user's machine?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><span>I would imagine, if the user wasn't syncing to the cloud, that these notes/sections are somewhere on the Surface or in the Windows.old folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, you may try the following steps to add the notebook:</p>
<p>1. Install OneNote 2016;</p>
<p>2. On OneNote 2016, go to File &gt; Open &gt; in "Open from other locations", click "This PC" &gt; click the upward arrow to go to the root folder;</p>
<p>3. Browse to the Windows.old folder &gt; go to Documents/OneNote Notebooks;</p>
<p>4. Open the notebooks from the notebook files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if there is any update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response, Nathan - unfortunately, the user's Documents folder is empty in Windows.old - other than the OneNote cache folder that has all of the .bin files, I'm not seeing anything that I think would have even the text of the Notes [an
 xml or any kind of human readable file]. I can see all kinds of OneNote related files, but cannot find anything this user did between February and today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We became an official Office 365 client in March, when I did the domain switch and we started using @domain instead of @domain.onmicrosoft.com. I know after I did the domain switch, I needed to refresh my Notebooks to use the updated username. Might there
 be something there? I can't imagine the user was still logged in&nbsp; with "onmicrosoft", but is there a way to see if there's another user "bucket" somewhere? In the O365 Admin Panel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are additional troubleshooting steps I can try, let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid we are unable to restore the notebooks from the .bin files. However, from my side, I can find backup notebook files in Users/[username]/AppData/Local/Microsoft/OneNote/16.0/Backup. If you couldn't find any .one files in this folder, in case they
 are in somewhere else, you may search for .one or .onepkg in File Explorer and see if you could locate any of them. If none .one or .onepkg files exist in Windows.old, you may try retrieving the files from OneDrive for Business from
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restore-deleted-files-or-folders-in-OneDrive-949ada80-0026-4db3-a953-c99083e6a84f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the Recycle Bin</a> or by <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restore-your-OneDrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reverting the whole OneDrive for Business to an earlier time</a>. If the notebooks still exists in OneDrive for Business, you may also retrieve the lost contents by using Version History to restore the notebook to an earlier version.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows Defender &#40;Win8&#41; terminates during scan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gravmat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender &#40;Win8&#41; terminates during scan &#40;0x800106ba&#41; - Def Update 1.145.1429.0 - Fixed&#58;  1.145.1493.0</h2>
                    I've had a persistent problem with Windows Defender the last month.<br />
Quick scan works fine, but whenever I try to do a full scan or a custom scan of one and one drive, the Windows Defender service self terminates and gives me the error message "Windows Defender couldn't scan your PC. This programs service has stopped.... " With
 the error code 0x800106ba.
<div>I've checked a lot of other posts and solutions that turned up when I Googled and Binged this error code, but none presented a solution to my particular problem.</div>
<div>
<div>The service is set to start automatically, and it restarts without a hitch whenever this problem turns up- but it will always crash again if a full scan is attempted.<br />
I've tried to utilize another Anti-malware tool (MalwareBytes tool to see if the problem could be caused by something in my system, but this yielded no results. The problem persisted both while the third-party tool was installed, as well as after it was removed.<br />
I have also attempted to run the Windows Resource Checker from commandline as administrator, but this did not detect any problems.</div>
<div>As of now I'm at a loss for what to do.<br />
I suppose one could try to boot up a Windows 8 disk and try a system repair, but it seems unlikely that this would do much good.</div>
<div><br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>It has already been escalated to a contact in MSFT. It was done as soon as I became aware of it being more than this one thread. My contacts (and what they do) in WD are far more limited than MSE at this point, so I can't ping a huge list in the hopes of
 increasing the odds of getting a quicker response merely due to availability (and that would be inappropriate anyway).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot estimate or guarantee a response here within any timeframe - hours, today, Monday, or next week. I will provide any information I'm given and allowed to pass on as quickly as I get it. Whether there will be a direct response from MSFT or not is
 completely unknown and up to them - sometimes they do and sometimes they communicate through us or pick one thread to serve as the focal point. They may also just fix it and let that be that (and hopefully tell us to tell others to "try again" or do a manual
 update first or whatever - but we too simply must wait and see).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may also turn out to be something related but totally different (meaning an issue with W8 rather than Defender) and the truth is we simply don't have enough information to tell yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know nobody wants to hear "please be patient" but I'm sorry to say that's the best advice I can offer at this point while letting you know that we're doing everything we can to get the right people involved to make sure this gets resolved ASAP (whatever
 that means) no matter the cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>&lt;EDIT UPDATE:&nbsp; Try updating now and <strong><u>make sure you get a definition verion after 1.145.1490.0.&nbsp; This should resolve the problem.</u></strong>&nbsp; Though not officially confirmed by Microsoft, too many people are reporting that this fixes the issue
 for it not to be the case unless some other problem that's probably more individualized is the case - in which case please open a separate thread.&gt;</p>

            <p>All of that is exactly as expected.&nbsp; The problem from the first report to the resolution was never anything but a Microsoft problem in the definitions they'd released and continued until 1.145.1490.0 where things were mostly fixed but some peripheral issues
 remained for people (though most didn't notice them unless they tried to do certain related things like an MBAM scan).&nbsp; The following releases fixed even that and resolved everything.&nbsp; Everything else here and in the other threads and all the wild speculation
 was all red herrings and/or possible workarounds ranging from reasonably good to totally lunatic (many of which aren't visible at this point).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, some people will have problems that seem to persist, but actually are and were other individual issues with their computers which were masked by the global problem with the definitions.&nbsp; These will need to be addressed individually on a case-by-case
 basis and anyone who can manually update to a version beyond 1.145.1490.0 should first try to download the full manual version from the MMPC
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/howtowd.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/howtowd.aspx</font></a>, reboot, do a manual update just to be sure, and then see if that fixes the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then please provide more details in a separate thread including all the related information about the failure from Event Viewer (provide all else and a request for help in how to get the Event Viewer information if you don't know) and
 we'll help you on a case-by-case basis since that's how to resolve any problems which persist if the above doesn't work.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might be a possibility that this is a synching issue or account activation issue. First, kindly check if OneNote application is updated and activated. Second, open OneNote online
 and check if you will still be able to see your notes from there. Lastly, try logging out your Microsoft account on your OneNote application and sign in back again. This will refresh OneNote app.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There is a possibility that your Office application is outdated. To properly isolate this issue, kindly verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried updating the Office application?</li><li>Have you tried repairing the Office application?</li><li>Have you tried running Windows update to receive improvements with font packages?
<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Thank you for the answer. I do updates regularly, today the last time. I have repaired Office today. Nothing changed regarding my problem, which continues. The incredible thing is that I have no problems for writing Hebrew vowels in Excel nor in Power Point.
 The problem precisely occurs with Word, which unfortunately is my word processing program... Funny enough!</p>

<p>Hi -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave up with using the Word symbols for Hebrew, and started using the Society for Biblical Literature Hebrew font.&nbsp; It works very well, has all the nekudot and trope symbols, and even knows how to correctly shift a vowel symbol when you add a trope symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes a little time to get used to - be sure to read the instructions and the keyboard map - but if you do a lot of Hebrew, it's invaluable!</p>

            Thank you. Yes, I do also use the SBL Hebrew fonts. Unfortunately the problem remains, it is not a question of style. As I cannot write vowels with Symbols, neither can I write vowels with any other font. It seems a problem on Word 2016 (at least my Word
 2016). I should add that my Word 2016 version is in Italian, perhaps the problem regards only the Word 2016 Italian version. But I have asked other friends of mine working in Hebrew with Word 2016 Italian version, and for them it is OK. I wonder if Microsoft
 could check it someway, I mean, how the Word 2016 Italian version is working with Hebrew fonts.<br />
Thanks a lot.

            We recommend reinstalling the Office 2016 application to further troubleshoot this issue. Kindly refer to the article below:<br />

<p>No way. I have tried even uninstalling Office in Italian and reinstalling it on English. No way. My computer is 64-bit. I have tried both possibilities, installing Office at 32-bit and 64 bit.

            <p>What version of Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2003 and earlier, it is very likely (99%) that Win 10 would not migrate it into the new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2007+ - Officially there should be no problem. Those versions are "compatible" with Win 10 and should be carried over.&nbsp; Unofficially... maybe yes, maybe no .... "most" will carry over no problem. But there is a small, but significant number of people
 who report problems with Office installations after doing a Win 10 "upgrade".&nbsp; Were these problems caused by the upgrade, can't say for sure, but it sure is a co-incidence that Office installations that ran "for years" suddenly stop working ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best bet is to make sure you have the installation file and product key/ registration numbers for all installed software.&nbsp; Run key extraction program(s) to get this information BEFORE the upgrade!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing the "upgrade", do a full image copy backup to an external drive, that will run off of a bootable DVD/USB so that you do not exclusively depend on the Win10 backout option.&nbsp; When you have problems with Win10, there seems to be a correlation with
 the backout not working also .... And the backout has a 30 day time limit. </p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>PS</span></strong><span>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have all of your
 product keys / registration numbers available for future re-installs</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>FYI</span></strong><span>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem. The underlying
 mechanics of Windows 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:
</span></strong><span>these tools no longer work for Office 2013 and 2016 after MS "improved" the way the key is stored on your computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>O<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation e-mail</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Online download account</span></li><li><span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</span></li><li><span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Activation backup utilities </span><span>From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called
<strong>TOKENS.DAT</strong> to store encrypted product activation keys:</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<strong>Tokens.DAT</strong>
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareLicensing\<strong>Tokens.data</strong><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>C:\Windows.Old\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<strong>Tokens.DAT</strong> (if you did an in-place Windows Upgrade)<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Do not expect the Windows.OLD folder to be there until you delete it. Win 10 will “help” you by deleting the backout files 30 days after the “upgrade”
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: OEM (factory install and activated) licenses use a different key than the one reported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the factory can use the PK from the original factory activation. You would have been provided with a separate piece of paper with a Product key for reactivation.</span></p>

<h2>            How to change default proofing language as a user or admin</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Im sure this has been answered before but I cant find it.</p>
<p>When using WORD ONLINE or EXCEL ONLINE our users have the default proofing language set to English US, however we need to be English UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cant find where a user can set a Default proofing language<br />
<br />
We cant find out if we can set a default for all our users.</p>
<p>I believe this may depend on where they create a document e.g. OneDrive, the App Launcher menu or Sites, so im looking for any way to set the defaults.</p>
<p><br />
Can you assist.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>This default proofing language is decided by the default language of the site where you created the document. You can check the default language via Gear icon &gt; Site settings &gt; Site Administration &gt; Language settings.</p>
<p>However, this default language is specified when the site is first created and cannot be changed. Specially for the OneDrive for Business library, the language is specified when the Office 365 tenant is created since the site collection which hosts the OneDrive
 for Business libraries is automatically created at that time.</p>
<p>I noticed that there are other community members have the same requirement and we welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through our

<p>hi david,</p>
<p>we can change the display language in onedrive for business. however, it's not feasible to change the default language either with powershell or in sharepoint admin center. it is determined when we set up the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b998301f-0388-4460-9183-19f7993239ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db998301f-0388-4460-9183-19f7993239ea" /></a></p>
<p>in this case, users need to manually switch the proofing language in office online (<strong>review&gt;spelling&gt;set proofing language&gt;english uk</strong>).</p>
<p>thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>It's not feasible to change the default proofing language. We need to manually switch it after we open the document.</p>
<p>We understand that it will be convenient if we can directly change the default proofing language. The best way to influence our products is to submit your requirement via Uservoice. Your good suggestions will help us improve our products.<br />

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't find some Official articles about the detailed differences of these two licenses. Based on my understanding,<a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/06/20/microsoft-stream-now-available-worldwide-new-intelligent-features-take-enterprise-video-to-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Microsoft Stream</a> is newly released stand alone video service license, Stream for Office 365 is the license for video services in Enterprise E3 plan (It should be like that there is Office 365 ProPlus stand alone license and&nbsp; also Office 365 ProPlus license
 under Enterprise E3 plan).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may assign both these two licenses or one of them to users for using Stream services. If you encounter further issues about Stream and these two license, please feel free to post new threads in our forum. We can look into the issue further in the new
 thread.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hello Gigeesh,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Connection fee is a charge paid by a consumer to a utility or communication service provider for hooking up or connecting to their server.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Connection fee is charged because Skype needs to hook up to another company and use their service in linking the call.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It applies to all calls to mobiles and landlines made using Skype Credit, where the call is answered and lasts longer than a second.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            5800xm can&#39;t install any QT-Based application</h2>
                    
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I've found this cellphone lying around in my brother's house, with the screen broken. He said it was a great phone till the screen cracked out of nowhere (touch area intact, lcd glass intact), and he didn't bother fixing it, bought the **bleep**
 bitten fruit phone.</p>
<p>anyway, I brought it back to life two or three days ago. A new batt (actually, two - the normal battery and the clock's batt), a screen (cheap nowadays) and a lot of WD40 on the board, to flush out the oxidation. Had the v20 FW and I've updated it OTA to
 v60.0.003 (released 09-22-2011)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone is working great. Everything works as expected, but for some reason, I can't install QT applications (To be more exact, ANY application on Ovi store that says "Might download more than 12mb, wifi is required" or something). I've been told to do a hard-reset,
 which has been done in both ways: By code and by keypresses (Green + Red + Camera + turn on phone). The last one did make a difference: The "XpressMusic" and the hard key lights doesn't turn on anymore (I don't care, so don't worry). With a "fresh system",
 I couldn't install it either. Then I've been told to install one by one those dependencies that the Smart Installer does for us.</p>
<p>The culprit seems to be the <strong>PIPS</strong>, which doesn't install neither with a strong pray.</p>
<p>I've tried almost everything, I didn't try removing the SD Card and install it without, hard-reset without SD and SIM card (Seems like to me that it goes to a even freshier system this way) and select a different location (I'm selecting my actual place:
 Brazil). Other applications works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what I'm supposed to do? They've told me to hack the phone to get a logfile from AMD or something, which would help me solving my issue on my own, but I'm too chicken for flashing a phone and all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone Model: 5800 XpressMusic (might be mid 2009 made)</p>
<p>Type: RM-356</p>
<p>Firmware: v60.0.003 (Updated OTA from v20)</p>
<p>Not hacked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>There was unfortunate problem with 5800 XpressMusic PR6 firmware but this firmware version is now being properly handled by Smart Installer and Qt application installations work again. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>To use an Access 2007 database on a website you need .aspx pages written for asp.NET running on a server that supports the&nbsp; .NET 4 framework.<br />
For any other version of the framework, or "classic" ASP save the Access 2007 database as an earlier version - 2003 or earlier.<br />
Note that FrontPage 2003 only reliably supports asp.NET 1.xxx</p>

<h3> ben altman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel VBA error &#34;Run-Time error &#39;1004&#39;&#58; The formula is incomplete. Make sure it has an ending square bracket &#40;&#93;&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am writing a macro which after working on a number of pivot tables successfully suddenly came up with the error&nbsp;"Run-Time error '1004': The formula is incomplete. Make sure it has an ending square bracket (])". When googling I found someone with the same
 issue on this site but there was no solution posted. The line causing the issue in my case can be demonstrated with the below line:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">pt.GetData("Col_1 B")</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error occurs when the pivot table being referenced for Col_1's value of B is ambiguous because it also contains another Col_1 with B which is distinguished by another column's value in Col_2. E.g.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b316ab39-e461-4918-bafb-cf794e1923ca?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b316ab39-e461-4918-bafb-cf794e1923ca?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Col_2 contains both AE and AW for B, the error occurs. I don't know why that specific error occurs though adding a "]" to the end changes the error to "An item name cannot be found..."&nbsp; If I do the following, the error is avoided and a value is returned:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">pt.GetData("Col_1 B AE")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ben</p>

            nokia really need to release a update for 311 to fix many problems.<br />
<br />
i bought asha 311 because lots of good reviews, the phone is of-course good but some application are in very bad features, like video player is very basic, cannot play next video automatically or manual, the forward/next button is only a show .<br />
<br />
there's lots of apps for s60 but why not much for s40, nokia should have upgraded s60 and added in asha series (i am not good with OS) but as a normal and always nokia user, i really hate 311 features.. where samsung galaxy android (asha price range) have many
 cool features..<br />
<br />
i like to see google maps (through browser) but the maps showing like pictures.. not good when you are traveling and don't know where to go and nokia downloaded maps are not good for directions :/<br />
<br />
i still hope nokia release a update for asha 311 to fix this simple annoying issues.

            You mean turning it off? Apparently, Nokia disabled turning it off in most of their phones, since its illegal in some countries to take pictures without it making an audible noise (to prevent voyeurism and other things). One fix is turning your profile
 to Silent. Works on my E63. Not a very covenient fix, I might add, but it works.

<h3> despurado  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Field Value in Existing Record</h2>
                    
<p><span>I’m really stuck on how to accomplish the following:<span>&nbsp;</span>In the first ComboBox (“EntityCode”) of an existing record
 on a continuous form, if the user selects a different code and confirms it in a msg box, then that value is selected, and all other (combo &amp; text box) fields’ values in the record are cleared out so new values can be entered.<span>&nbsp;</span>(Essentially
 replacing an existing record with a new record.)</span></p>
<p><span>The original code was:</span></p>

<p><span>Private Sub EntityCode_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer)<br />
If Not Me.NewRecord <span>&nbsp;</span>Then</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dim intAnswer As Integer<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>intAnswer = MsgBox("Do you want to change the Entity Code?", vbQuestion + vbYesNo, "Entity Code Change Message")<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>intAnswer = MsgBox("Do you want to change the Entity Code?", vbQuestion + vbYesNo, "Entity Code Change Message")<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If intAnswer = vbNo Then<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If intAnswer = vbNo Then<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cancel = True<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cancel = True<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.EntityCode.Undo<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.EntityCode.Undo<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Else</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Else</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.ComboBoxX = “”
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.ComboBoxY = “”</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.TextBoxZ = “”</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>End If</span></p>
<p><span>End If</span></p>
<p><span>End Sub</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above worked fine until we had to change some of the other fields to Required = Yes and Allow Zero-String Values = No.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could someone suggest a better way to accomplish the objective described above?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks much.</span></p>

<p><span>I’m really stuck on how to accomplish the following:<span>&nbsp;</span>In the first ComboBox (“EntityCode”) of an existing record on a continuous
 form, if the user selects a different code and confirms it in a msg box, then that value is selected, and all other (combo &amp; text box) fields’ values in the record are cleared out so new values can be entered.<span>&nbsp;</span>(Essentially replacing an existing
 record with a new record.)</span></p>
<p><span>The original code was:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Private Sub EntityCode_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer)<br />
If Not Me.NewRecord <span>&nbsp;</span>Then</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dim intAnswer As Integer<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>intAnswer = MsgBox("Do you want to change the Entity Code?", vbQuestion + vbYesNo, "Entity Code Change Message")<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If intAnswer = vbNo Then<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cancel = True<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.EntityCode.Undo<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Else</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.ComboBoxX = “”
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.ComboBoxY = “”</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.TextBoxZ = “”</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>End If</span></p>
<p><span>End If</span></p>
<p><span>End Sub</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above worked fine until we had to change some of the other fields to Required = Yes and Allow Zero-String Values = No.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could someone suggest a better way to accomplish the objective described above?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks much.</span></p>

<p><br />
If fields are required at the table level, then you will not be able to set them to Null, and if they don't allow zero-length strings you won't be able to set them to "", either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What exactly are you trying to accomplish by clearing out all the fields, just to have the user re-enter them?&nbsp; Why doesn't the user just enter new values in place of the old ones?</p>
<p>If you really have to present the user with a blank record (except for the EntityCode field, you could preserve the new entity code, undo the change to the current record, delete that record, go to a new, blank record on the form, and enter the new entity
 code there.&nbsp; Bear in mind, though, that the user wouldn't be able to undo the delete and so avoid wiping out the old record.&nbsp; Or I suppose you could get the user to enter the new record, and only then go back and delete the old one.</p>
<p>Another alternative might be to pop up an unbound form for the user to enter new values for all the other fields, and then when they click OK, enter those values into the currrent record.&nbsp; That would allow you to update the current record without ever setting
 required field to Null/"".</p>
<p>However, I don't really understand why you would want to do any of this.&nbsp; Why do you need to present the user with blank fields?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your responses. To answer your question, the reason I need the fields cleared out is that several of them are Combo Boxes with lookups that are&nbsp;filtered based on the&nbsp;Entity Code value; also there are other fields that would be invalid for different
 reasons, but again based on the Entity Code.</p>
<p>When I tested leaving the values there, it was possible to save the record with fields containing values of the original Entity Code which, of course,&nbsp;would create bad data.</p>
<p>Thanks for your ideas.&nbsp; I'll see what might work, given my limited (but thanks to this website, getting better) VBA skills.</p>

<br />
I see.&nbsp; My inclination would be either to insert valid default values for the dependent fields, based on the new entity code, or else go with the idea of deleting the old record and creating a new one (copying any values from the old record that are *not* dependent
 on the entity code).&nbsp; Post back if you get stuck in the VBA.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your entry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Recovery tool should assist you to get your Windows Phone back to the previous version as suggested on Windows phone 10 Technical preview webpage. I would suggest to try Manually to reset your Windows Phone (link 1) or, as last resort you need to
 contact the Nokia support (link 2)</p>

<h2>            Word&#58; cycle through MS Forms 2.0 optionbuttons and change settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to loop through every optionbutton in my document and change the layout from "in front of text" to "in line with text".</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get started I tried to figure out the object model code to specifically only target the optionbuttons (after which I still need to figure out how to change the actual format) but when I loop the document using the Name or ID of the objects, it doesn't
 show the actual name I've assigned to these (not all of my controls are optionbuttons).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me limit my loop to optionbuttons, and then change them to "in front of text"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Some Gmail folders missing in Outlook.com Connected Account</h2>
                    <p>There are a handful of Gmail folders missing in Outlook.com after connecting my gmail account. We use gmail as our corporate email and I want to at least use Outlook.com vs gmail web app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 6 folders (labels)&nbsp;that did not show up. I use gmail labels to organize. When connecting my account I chose to Import into existing folders. The connected gmail account constantly shows "Update in progress" which I assume will always be the case
 as it is always checking for new mail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight would be appreciated. </p>

            <p>Somewhat resolved. It has taken more than 36hrs for all the folders to show up in Outlook.com. Those folders that were missing are now visible but no messages within them (yet). I'm hoping that more time to allow for synchronization/import will resolve the
 issue entirely. </p>

<span><span>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do choose to upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, please be warned, it will make your recovery partition in operable, requiring that you have separate recovery media for reinstallation if necessary.</p>
