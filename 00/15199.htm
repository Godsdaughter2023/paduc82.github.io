<h2>            Office 365 Group Calendar Categories</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to categorize by color for Office 365 Group Calendar events?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do this is the old Outlook Online, but not in the New.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Old</p>

<p>New</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, when I set the category in old Outlook Online, it carries over into the New Outlook Online and retains the color.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3867bf52-a888-4653-9519-ffc0a2fcb1fe?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3867bf52-a888-4653-9519-ffc0a2fcb1fe?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can set Categories on My Calendar in New Outlook Online, but not for the Group calendars.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried removing and reinserting the SIM on the phone? You can also try to use another SIM for us to further isolate the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

                    <p>So I have a problem with my other email address! I've put in every password it could have and still cannot access it! I think someone has hacked it! I've been trying for about a month to get back into it but it isn't working, Ive sent to many requests to
 get a new password sent to this email but they keep coming back that I haven't sent enough information. Please help me I don't know what I can do! The email that is attached to it was my student email and that is no longer access able. I do still have access
 on my phone but cannot change the password through the app!</p>

<br />
<br />
Just to verify, when you said have access on your phone, are saying that you can only access your outlook account through your phone and cannot sign in using the Outlook web?
<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.

            No security code as I have no way to send it to myself as the email I had set up as the back up email is inactive now as it was a student email address, it sent me a code to verify the email I'm using to recover my email address but that has not done anything
 other than allow me to send a report

    <title>Canceling Skype without losing Hotmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reniecampoli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canceling Skype without losing Hotmail</h2>
                    I foolishly signed up for Skype thinking it was free. Seeing that it wasn't, I decided to close the Skype account. However, it says that if you close your Skype account, you lose your Hotmail account. I have been in tears for the last half hour, nearly
 hyperventilating, thinking that I could lose my Hotmail account, which I've had for many years. I have too many things associated with my Hotmail account and can't lose it. When I signed up for a Skype account, I didn't use my Hotmail address; I used another,
 non-Microsoft-related email address. Does this mean that my Hotmail account will be safe if I cancel Skype? For the time being, I cancelled my cancellation of Skype. Please advise ASAP. Thanks.

<p><span>Hello RenieCampoli, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, I would like to inform you that Skype-to-Skype calling is free. This means that you won't be charge if you made the call on Skype and is calling someone also signed into Skype.
</span><span>You would only be charged if you use premium features like Skype calls to landlines or mobiles, voice mail, SMS texts. Kindly refer to this link:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>Secondly, I have checked your Skype account, it was not created using your Hotmail email address. With this being said, it is not linked to your Hotmail and it is safe to cancel the said Skype account. What will be deleted is the Microsoft account
 created in the background when you signed up to Skype using a non-Microsoft email. Rest assured that it will not affect your Hotmail account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you need anything else. </span></p>

    <title>Message View - Scrolling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nbrammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Message View - Scrolling</h2>
                    This may seem like a small issue, but i am looking to upgrade and one thing i hate is when reading text messages that are longer than one screen view, they scroll down line by line, rather than full screen. The newer nokia's such as N95 and 6500 classic/slide
 all seem to scroll by one, two or more lines at a time (very annoying), whereas the more pre-historic models scroll a screen at a time. Is there anyway i can change this on the newer models in settings or anywhere? Or if not, can anyone recommend an attractive
 modern model that still has this feature?

            Don't know any phones to recommend, but note also that indepdendent application developers can also create messaging applications that you can use instead of the built-in applications (at least for S60 based phones like the N95 and others).

<h2>            Excel 2010 - White Box Appears On Desktop Randomly when executing Alt-Tab to change screens</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A white box appears when I have an Excel window active and I Alt-Tab to another screen. &nbsp;The box only appears about 5% of the time that I perform this operation, and its appearance seems random. &nbsp;The box is about 2"x3" and resides in the upper left hand
 side of my desktop. &nbsp;It covers desktop short cut icons on my desktop. &nbsp;It has no controls and cannot be moved. &nbsp;It is however represented in the Alt-Tab popup, but selecting it does not allow me to close it. &nbsp;The only way to make it go away is to log out and
 back in to Windows.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Ernie,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for taking a look at this.&nbsp; Answers below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Which Operating System running on your computer?</span></em></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 Professional is installed on the computer that has the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>When did you start experiencing it?
</span></em></p>
<p><span>I noticed the problem the very first day that I got my new computer back in December.&nbsp; The computer was new.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</span></em></p>
<p><span>Nope, it was a brand new computer.&nbsp; My employer simply installed MS Office, Outlook, and National Instruments LabVIEW.&nbsp; I’ve used it pretty lightly since, mainly staying within the bounds
 of the programs that I run.&nbsp; Sometime in March I found an add-in for Chrome (the browser that I mainly use) to make new tabs always start with my homepage, which is Google.&nbsp; I also made a registry change in April in a failed attempt to get Outlook to properly
 add Calendar entries into my calendar from .ics files generated from Lotus Notes.&nbsp; Other than that, I’ve basically just been a user of MS Office and various mainstream engineering tools.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>What's the size of the Excel file that you are accessing?</span></em></p>
<p><span>The problem doesn’t seem to follow any particular spreadsheet file that I have noticed.&nbsp; There is one Excel file that I have open every day.&nbsp; It contains a large number of small worksheets…
 there is a worksheet for each day of the year for me to keep track of my hours.&nbsp; It is 69kb.&nbsp; I’ve used larger files back in Jan/Feb in the 8Mb range.&nbsp; They were large because they have a lot of embedded pictures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>Have you tried any troubleshooting to resolve the issue? If yes, tell us more about it.</span></em></p>
<p><span>I haven’t done too much.&nbsp; A little poking around in Google to see if anybody had a similar problem.&nbsp; I do see comments about a “white box”, but none exactly like mine.&nbsp; My debugging has been
 limited to trying to navigate to it to close it.&nbsp; It is only fairly recently that I finally noticed the pattern that it appears when I Alt-Tab out of Excel.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p />

    <title>Audio issue during incoming and outgoing call in Nokia Lumia 630 Duel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio issue during incoming and outgoing call in Nokia Lumia 630 Duel Sim.</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Nokia 630 Duel Sim few days ago. The day I purchased I had this weird audio problem for both incoming and outgoing call. The problem is after recieving the call there is no sound at all. Even no sound in loudspeaker. It does not matter I call or
 someone calls me the problem persists. So, I contacted Nokia store I bought the phone from, they did a hard reset. Which seemed to fix the problem untill yesterday. I had this same problem again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched the net and found that many other people are having the same issue, and only solution I can see is hard reseting. But it's not a valid solution. Hard reseting everyfew days is just not sensible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More people with this problem should contact proper authority with problem detail as much as possible. So that they could address this issue, and try coming with a fix asap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in love with Nokia and WP 8.1, but this problem seems like a deal breaker for me. I hope they address this quickly, only after addressing this issue, we could hope for a fix. But I don't think Nokia and Microsoft are aware of this problem, and even
 they are aware of this is just a cheap phone. Which makes this issue less noticable :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do hope to get a fix soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Edit: Headphone does not work but headset works during calls. So, it's a speaker problem during calls only.</span></p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your case, if you can live with using the headset when making calls for the time being, I am sure Nokia/Microsoft will release a patch for this issue soon as it's a pretty major fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would see if you can contact Microsoft or Nokia support to get an idea of when to expect a fix - perhaps your Nokia store has contact details they can give you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not happy with that, and want a solution immediately, I would see if you can get a refund - you should have grounds as the phone isn't really fulfilling its function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This seems to be quite a common problem and Nokia / Microsoft must be aware of the issue. I bought my phone from a Nokia store and returned the first one because of the fault. The second one has the same issue and I'm not doing a hard reset every couple
 of days and I can't rely on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly I love the phone and am converted to W8.1 but if the software update isn't out in the next few days it's going back for good</p>

<h2>            Large white space in Word that cannot be deleted</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating a resume, and I was typing my text in and it skipped to the next page before it had even gotten to the bottom of the page, and now there is a huge white gap that Word is ignoring as a gap. If I try to hit backspace, it doesn't delete the white
 space, it just deletes the last character before the white space. If I hit delete before the white space, it doesn't delete the white space, it deletes the first character after the white space. Basically, the program is acting as if this is totally normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a screenshot so you can see what I mean. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 8 but I can't seem to find what version of Word I am using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fd2c369-48e0-493f-88f3-dac0cb44260a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fd2c369-48e0-493f-88f3-dac0cb44260a" /></a></p>

</p><p>Are you using a Word resume template? Templates are usually set up with Text Boxes. There may be one where you are seeing the white space. To remove it: Click into the white area to see if a text box appears.&nbsp; The text box can be easily deleted. With the
 text box selected move the mouse to one of the text box corners until you see a four-headed arrow. Then, right click and click on “cut” to delete the text box.</p>

<h2>            Cannot receive skype calls but can make them</h2>
                    I recently have not been able to receive any skype calls even when my status says I am online. I am able to make calls but incoming calls never ring and only appear as a missed call. I uninstalled and reinstalled skype and was successfully able to receive
 one call before it started doing this again. I also appear as away the moment I am not looking at the skype window.&nbsp;

<h2>            Stereo audio recorder AAC 128&#43; Kbps for N8&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a high quality stereo audio recorder available for N8?</p>
<p>The in-built app can only record at highest of 64kbps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking for one with at least stereo 128kbps capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Im also very surpriced that high quality stereo recording isnt availible in the default recorder, as a musician i would have very good use of it recording rehearsals. The sound is pretty good&nbsp;in video recording.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it is now it is actually fairly good for being mono (but ooh so 60`s :smileytongue:) and not so 2011 ) and stereo recording adds alot to the separation as well as the enjoyment of a recording.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I havent yet been able to find an app for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Nokia or someone else that have the skill, help us out with this !</p>

<p>Works perfectly on my 808, also on the N8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can record up to 384 kbps with 96 KHz.</p>

<p>boss there is no such option available.<br />
after the max. settings also the bit rate goes up to &nbsp;128.<br />
and yes it does do 2 Channel recording.<br />
<br />
Any other similar application which you can refer to us.</p>

<h2>            How to change custom fields for contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hello there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am trying to import my contact- database into Outlook 2016 for mac, running with a hosted exchange server by a provider in germany.&nbsp;</p>
<p>now i get to the problem that i have plenty of information in those contacts which are not displayable through the standard fields provided by outlook- so i have to use the custom fields.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem i am facing is that i see no possibility to just rename these fields or even change the behaviour to be for example a drop- down menu or similar stuff - i thougt this would be standart nowadays...&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an idea how to fill the database with useful information, which i can filter with and search effectively for contacts, id be so happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            I dont think you can modify the fields in outlook contacts. The 2016 mac version as well as previous versions of outlook mac lacks this feature.

ArjunJadhav.</a> Are you using the charger came with the phone? Verify that your charger is working, try the charger with another compatible phone. If the charger is working, press and hold the volume down and power keys at the same time for 15 seconds&nbsp;or till
 the phone vibrate. If nothing happens, the battery may be wearing out and require replacing.

<p>Placouk has already given you the answer: Uninstall and Re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of months ago MS switched default install to 64 bit. If you installed 365 before that you would have 32 bit and it would continue to update that way.

<h2>            New version of Outlook Mail seems slow and choppy and my edited forward wont send&#58; still in draft folder after I hit send</h2>
                    <p>I have tried all day today to forward an email to a friend. I wanted to edit the forward with a comment above as I always have been able to do and did but now the draft does not send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added myself to the send to and it does appear that it is sending, but it stays in the Draft folder and I did not receive nor did my friend receive the email I made to send/forward this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go back into the draft, click to continuer writing, and click send again and nothing again. I have tried sending it 5 times and it looks like its sending but it does not and the Draft folder still shows it in there and the Send folder is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a fan of the new version even after I have explored it and have seen all the newness of it. This new version or updated version of Outlook mail is sluggish and choppy and my system use of the old Outlook Mail was never like this. None of my other
 experiences on my laptop have slowed or become choppy just this new Outlook Mail. Hate it. I'm using Outlook Mail but I have a Gmail too. I forward my Gmail to my Outlook Mail because I "DID" like Outlook Mail better. I'm switching back to Gmail. Outlook is
 just too bother some and disjointed feeling: its lost, IMO, the streamline feeling I got with the old version. I love Microsoft but Gmail is my email of choice again.</p>

            <p>OMG... really?</p>
<p>I write a question to the community and then I decide that maybe it would be a good discussion too so I write it again but submit it to the discussion area thinking I was crafty and might get more info this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then get an email, acutally two emails. One email says they have taken my question and move it to the discussion area. The other emal, yep, says that they have moved my discussion to the question area. Oh how funny but it don't end there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then get an email that there is a REPLY to my question and guess what! Yep, its me and my question/discussion. The reply to my need was replied to by my need? Hellow MS, is anyone thinking or is it all just computer logic you are using now. Remember, you
 only get what you put into it, out of it... now ain't that the truth.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Why does my skype number not show?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Other than Skype Credits, all paid subscriptions in Skype&nbsp;should be checked on the
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype website.</a> For instance, that you have <em>Skype Number</em> and not visible on the account you&nbsp;have&nbsp;checked, possibly, you are signed in on a different account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, you can refer to the notification email you received regarding the payment for Skype Number. Usually, the Skype username is indicated on the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Skype account/s associated with an email address can be checked by these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Go to this <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link.</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. Enter your email address or phone number and select&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important note</strong>: When entering your phone number, be sure to enter it with no spaces or dashes (example: 12223334444).</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">3. We'll show you all the Skype accounts associated with that email address or phone number.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Once you were able to sign in to the correct account, check if your voicemail settings is configured to your desired setup.</p>

    <title>Logo is blurry when converting from MS Word to Adobe PDF - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Logo is blurry when converting from MS Word to Adobe PDF</h2>
                    I am having an issue where I have inserted a logo into an MS Word document, and it looks great in Word, but when I convert to PDF, the logo looks blurry/distorted. I have read numerous threads on this topic and have tried things like making sure word isn't
 compressing images, using a .png, .jpg, and .eps, and nothing seems to work. Any suggestions would be very helpful.

<p>The problem is that MS Word compresses the images when it builds the PDF, resulting in the images having a lower quality (looking blurry/distorted) in the PDF.&nbsp; One way around this problem, is to use a program that can do lossless compression of images,
 when building a PDF.&nbsp; One such program is IrfanView.&nbsp; Here is one way that&nbsp;someone might do this, using IrfanView:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[1]&nbsp; Carefully copy the text and images into PowerPoint, and get the PowerPoint pages to look just like the Word document.&nbsp; To do that, just copy/paste the text/images from Word to&nbsp;PowerPoint, and re-format as needed in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[2]&nbsp; User PowerPoint to save the pages as JPEG images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[3]&nbsp; Open the JPEG images with IrfanView, and save as a multi-page TIFF file.&nbsp; Then, in IrfanView, convert the multi-page TIFF file to a&nbsp;lossless PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The end result of steps 1-3 above, should be that the PDF looks just the same as the Word document does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you do not want to use PowerPoint, and alternative method would be to print the Word document on paper, and then scan it in, building the JPEG images (probably not quite as good of quality as&nbsp;PowerPoint, depending upon the quality of your printer,
 ink, paper and scanner).&nbsp; Then go to step&nbsp;"3" above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the web site for IrfanView (it is free for home use):</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope that the above information might be of some help.</p>

<p>Try "printing" the document to a pdf file using the free PrimoPDF converter that will install itself as a printer. &nbsp;With it, you can set the Graphic Print Quality upto 4000dpi, though the default 600dpi is probably all that you need.</p>

</p><p>The issue was under investigation (around 15 incidents opened and closed, eg SP147556 / SP148109 ) but still happening often and it impacts the daily tasks at the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that something in our account or way to use this? I'm looking forward to hear from you.</p>

<p>Hi Danielle,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience on our forum.</p>
<p>Yes, recently, there are some SIE “SharePoint Online - Delays or problems loading SharePoint Online sites or OneDrive for Business”.</p>
<p>We could understand it is inconvenient if you are using SharePoint and meet the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, based on my check, all the SIE has been resolved currently.</p>
<p>If you meet the issue again, you are welcome to post back.</p>
<p>We will keep working on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<p>Hi Qing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is happening today again, it is really intermittent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you from Microsoft still investigating, </p>
<p>because I can't consider as solved since the slowness and problems to open documents occurs everyday here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See below the message I've got saving a workflow on Sharepoint designer. The pages were available then suddenly stop working:</p>

<br />
Everything is OK after installing Windows Technical Preview. But... when i access the camera, it show
<strong>greenish cast</strong>. Oh my god! Im so unlucky. So i<strong> perform refresh again</strong> (i think, if i refresh my pc, my pc will back to Windows 8 but NOT) Bad things happened.
<strong>The OS is STILL Windows Technical Preview!</strong><strong> All Factory Apps are gone.... HP Recovery Partition no longer work! And, the Display Adapter in Device manager is gone too</strong>. Only WinUCRD.wim in D:/recovery.. the remaining</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>And i want back to my Factory Windows :'( I have try to install Windows 8.1 via iso but it

            <p>If you have made factory recovery discs when you first got the computer then you have to use those. If not you will have to contact HP for help because it is not possible to go back to Windows8 now any other way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to re install Windows8 from disk . Contact HP to see if they will send you recovery media&nbsp;and you will probably have to pay for that</p>

<p>
</p><p>My Recovery Partition still exist, but i think it no longer work. Before i refresh my PC, the recovery partition is hidden. But, after i refresh my Windows Technical Preview PC's, the recovery partition now unhidden and show many files, such as WinURCD.wim.
</p>
<p>I don't know what i can do now with WinURCD.wim but i think it can solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My friend have both, windows 8 &amp; 8.1 disk. I have try it install Windows 8 From DIsk. But after Windows 8 Copying files, and reboot,
<strong>it's only show command prompt and some message error in the command prompt.</strong> After that, the installation was not successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have try install Windows 8.1 too. But it stuck at <strong>93% </strong>and show "Windows 8.1 Installation has failed".<br />
<br />
3. Can HP Service Center Indonesia solve my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If i cant rollback to Previous Windows, it's okay. But i facing many trouble in Windows Technical Preview like Missing display adapter (now
<strong>I Can't install display adapter!</strong>), greenish cast in camera, etc. I just wan't my PC normal again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't do anything <strong>RIGHT NOW.</strong> I very confused darthro! Im very need help because

            Hi, TREEZY20. Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions. When you say 'singning', do you mean 'sign in'? The application requires your account to be logged in to be able to receive your WhatsApp messages. As the phone does not support multi-tasking and
 apps cannot run into the phone's background, you'll need to access the app to be able to be notified if there is a new message on your app account. For more info about the app, visit this link:
<a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/s40." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/s40.</a> Hope this helps.
