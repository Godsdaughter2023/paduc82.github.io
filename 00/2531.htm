<h2>            Outlook for Mac Sync with iCloud contacts</h2>
                    <p>One of the most important reasons I want to use Outlook for Mac is to get around the Group email issue with iCloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the new version, I cannot even export from my iCloud Contacts to import into Outlook. &nbsp;With a sync mechanism for Outlook and at a minimum iCloud Contacts, the Outlook experience becomes un usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion on how to use iCloud Contacts with Outlook for Mac.</p>

            <p>Support for CardDAV and CalDAV (which iCloud uses) has not changed. Outlook for Mac will not sync with it nor Google nor any other service using these protocols.</p>

    <title>Bing Ads Editor Import from Excel issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bing Ads Editor Import from Excel issue</h2>
                    <p>Good day, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user that when importing an excel selection (or file) into Bing Ads Editor, the BID values change (actually multiply) from what the current rate is. For example, a 7.55 bid will change to 755. I assume this is a csv issue, but I am unable to locate
 a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formatting is correct, and the time zone selection when prompted after import is correct.
</p>
<p>I have tried the same file (and selection) on another PC and it works perfectly fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the settings on this computer (regional, language and Bing options) to a working computer and everything is exactly the same, but when importing (or copy pasting) the data the BID values will multiply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help,</p>
<p>Nanette </p>

<p>
</p><p>We apologize of the issue you are facing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please let us know the following:</p>
<p>1. The versions of Bing Ads Editor (BAE) where it works as well as where it does not work.</p>

            <p>Hi SF Hurst</p>
<p>I am sorry that I do not arrive with an answer to this problem for I too am having the same experience as yourself with that ridiculous MSN page appearing upon exiting from Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I thought I would just draw your attention to the conflicts which exist between Microsoft Moderators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On reading other posts about the same subject I have found ----</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 26th Feb 2013 MS Moderator DeniseT stated that Outlook.com Sign In page was the default setting upon exit.<br />
On April 6th 2013, MS Moderator PaulM stated there was absolutely NO faciity to allow any exit to MSN.<br />
On August 14th 2013 MS Moderator Neil_S stated that going to MSN upon exit was the absolute default setting.<br />
And now we have MS Moderator Vivien_M stating it is the default setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I have only started to experience this since I installed Internet Explorer 11 a couple of weeks ago.<br />
This was an update following a full clean re-install of O/S Win7 Home Premium, prior to which I was using Internet Explorer 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hate the MSN page, and if Microsoft don't come up with a way of making the exit page a configurable option (e.g. signed out, but still in Yahoo which is my desired default) then I shall be changing away from both Internet Explorer and Hotmail/Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps??</p>
<p>Ian</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS ----- I have just uninstalled IE11 and returned to the (I think) only reliable version of IE, namely IE8, and I have lost the stupid MSN page appearing on exit. I now get a blank page, but I am still in a Yahoo environment.</p>

            I agree with Patterson. It is annoying to be thrown back to an idiotic Hollywood news and propaganda site.&nbsp;We just want to&nbsp;land on our home&nbsp;page.&nbsp;No solution has been&nbsp;offered in the last three years. "By default" is not an explanation.

    <title>Auto forwarded emails from secondary accounts to primary account will - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lunar_21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto forwarded emails from secondary accounts to primary account will not sort into designated folders&#63;</h2>
                    I have 3 hotmail accounts which were all linked together but from yesterday that feature is no longer available.&nbsp; To continue to access these accounts I have set up automatic forwarding from my secondary accounts to my primary account. To prevent the automatically
 forwarded emails from being sent to my primary account's inbox I have set up a rule for sorting new messages so that mail received from my secondary email addresses is automatically moved to a folder in my primary account. Although I have designated a folder
 for messages from each email address the new mail hasn't&nbsp; been moved to these folders and is just sent to the inbox so all the emails are mixed together. Please can you provide a solution to this issue so I can forward mail from secondary accounts directly
 in to a folder within my primary account?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before adding a Yandex account on the Outlook for Mac client, please check if the POP or IMAP settings of the email account are enabled. About adding a me.com account on the Outlook for Mac client, please enable 2-step authentication for your Apple account
 and configure the email account with app password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I noticed that you are using Outlook for Mac client version 15.33. The Outlook for Mac client is not up to date. Please update your Outlook for Mac client to 15.35 170610 to check if it helps. If the problem still persists, please give us some
 screenshots of the email accounts configuration interface. With screenshots, we will clearly know what happens on your side and help you find a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

                    I hit restart and it just restarts. then I log back in, wait for windows update to notify me again of a restart, I have let it schedule a restart and have left my laptop on. plugged in and awake, I have scheduled my own restart, again leaving the pc on,
 plugged in and awake, and this just keeps going on, no installation actually ever happens.

                    <p>When opening and viewing pictures in Microsoft Photos App, pictures are shown blurry for 2-3 seconds, then they are shown normally -sharp. Is this windows 10 mobile standard ? Because on windows phone 8.1 it was working perfectly - sharp pictures instantly.
 I cannot look at these blurry images.&nbsp;</p>

Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset try to check if the issue persists.

<h2>            1520 updated to 8.1 from 8.0 reset it self and booted up into DEMO mode</h2>
                    <p>Strangest thing.&nbsp; I was standing in a park, a picnic, holding my phone.&nbsp; It vibrated and rebooted.&nbsp; On return is was in setup for DEMO mode. Nothing I could do could stop it. After it finished, I went to about and was going to reset it, but no reset option
 existed.&nbsp; Only Update Demo content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a DEMO phone.&nbsp; It's a 32gb 1520 from AT&amp;T, online, not the store.&nbsp; I've had it since February.&nbsp; I've reset it dozens of times.&nbsp; Had Preview on it and rolled back via the Nokia tool 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; Did the update on Thursday when it rolled out&nbsp;
 from AT&amp;T.&nbsp; No hiccups since then.&nbsp; I used the phone several times this morning with no issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only thing I can think of, I may not have been paying attention and may have accidentally entered an incorrect password 3 times...I may not have noticed the warning screens, so it could have reset itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, into DEMO mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there even a setting for that, that is user accessible, on reset???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never knew...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset via the NOkia tool and no issues moving forward.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY software installed between now and then.....the Microsoft lock screen beta....hmmmmm&nbsp;</p>

            That is very strange, the demo mode of a phone isn't accessible from the user they are phones that are sent to providers like at&amp;t and these phones are not sold instead after the phone had stopped being sold they either throw it away, keep it or send it
 back to the manufacturer. Entering your password into your phone over 3 times shouldn't reset your phone, although holding the power button and volume down button for over 10 seconds will reset your phone but not into demo mode, I don't think that Microsoft
 would release an app that had this kind of capabilities. For you to solve this problem I would suggest going into an at&amp;t store and explaining your problem, it doesn't matter that you bought the phone online since you are still a customer of theirs.

<p>Mr. ForumModerator. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I unmarked this as an Answer because a..its not.&nbsp; I STRONGLY recommend you revisit the training manuals, and other forum information about what you posted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First.&nbsp; DEMO is a build of the OS.&nbsp; In this case, the build had the last 5 of 33019.&nbsp; Of course its not user configurable, and should never be seen by a user.&nbsp; But, the fact that I did is the issue now, isn't it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, phones marked as DEMO pop up on this forum from people making purchases off of such places as eBay.&nbsp; Usually these are phones that have been 'liberated' form a store and sold illegally.&nbsp; You almost never see this happen from an online purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 A DEMO phone is not configurable in a store, usually.&nbsp; But is never configurable by a user.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Third, I've had my phone since February.&nbsp; If its a DEMO phone now, it would have been then .&nbsp; Its not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, of course Microsoft would not deliberately ship any software that changes mode without intention.&nbsp; The point that I installed a BETA software, and shortly there after DEMO mode appeared after reset.&nbsp; This is obviously a mistake.&nbsp; You should report
 this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifth, I strongly recommend you revisit the RESET options available on Windows Phone.&nbsp; Know the difference between soft reset and factory reset (aka hard reset).&nbsp; Also understand a phone cannot be setup from a soft reset.&nbsp; Review reset options, enterprise
 packages and security.&nbsp; You will see a phone reset from incorrectly entered passwords is indeed an option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sixth, I unmarked this as an answer, because it was not one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I expect to be banned for this 'observation'.&nbsp; If does not change the fact that as a Forum Moderator you need to be careful in how you reply.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to you...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS</p>

            <p>Okay I understand your points 1 and 2, in point 3 you say about how it's never come to you that the phone was a demo, this might be because the 1520 was shipped which update 3/Lumia black already installed so the 8.1 update would have been the first update
 since you bought the phone. I'm thinking that when you updated using the preview it didn't take into consideration the demo mode but when you updated it after reverting back with the at&amp;t approved Lumia cyan update it took the demo mode into consideration.
 Was the lock screen beta app the first app that you've installed since updating to 8.1 after the revert?</p>
<p>You won't be banned as the observation didn't break the code of conduct to my knowledge and finally, I'm not a forum moderator</p>

<p>hehe.....so I wasn't seeing things.&nbsp;&nbsp; I resolved it by reflashing.&nbsp; I did have some friends within MS that I reported this to and I did get a reply, but not an official response.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently DEMO mode is no longer a separate install.&nbsp; It can be accessed via a combination of strokes only during a specific portion of setup.&nbsp; Reversing the steps during the specific portion of setup removes demo mode.&nbsp; I do NOT know the steps, so don't
 ask.&nbsp; But I was told they were so random it was almost laughable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yes, it is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; You and I are proof.&nbsp; And yes, the Flash resolves it.&nbsp; And, since it happened to me, it has not happened again.....</p>

            Hi, Thank you for your answer. Unfortunately this does not resolve the issue. Now it got even worse - now I cannot delete emails from my Inbox and get the same message (actually I did not modify anything this was a message I wanted to delete without opening.
 I was trying to check and uncheck these options but nothing helps. I am losing tremendous amount of time on trying to do something - this was always working ok in earlier versions. Do you happen to have any other idea?

            hello gabriellav sorry to hear that it hasn't resolved your issue 
<br />
<br />i would suggest you to try open outlook in safe mode 
<br />win+r
<br />outlook.exe /safe
<br />
<br />if problem is gone restart your outlook 
<br /> &gt; Options &gt; Add-Ins &gt; Manage COM Add-Ins 
<br />now you will be promoted  to list add-ins installed on outlook try disabling each and see which add in is causing the trouble    Adobe Send &amp; Track add-in usually causes the trouble 
<br />
<br />some time is maybe due to corrupt pst file try repairing it

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have an update – I have done everything you have proposed me. Nothing has really changed the issue – it still persists.</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/597dc687-8940-4c6c-bfbe-5d12aab38f0f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/597dc687-8940-4c6c-bfbe-5d12aab38f0f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am trying to drag and drop items from my Inbox, or move them one by one, nothing works. This is what I get. It is in Hungarian though but it says you cannot move the items and access is denied as the items may have been
 removed or deleted (which is not the case).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am helpless.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>This is not abt movig to a public folder. This is abt absolutely all actions I want to make with my emails in the Inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I cannot delete the emails...</p>
<p>- I cannot move them into an archive folder - which I always use to kepp my clients and topics organised (and also to free up space in the server)</p>

<h2>            Account recovery for hotmail and two step verification turn on</h2>
                    <p>I changed my password and turned on the two step verification.&nbsp; When I try to log into the account I receive the message the password is incorrect. When I try to reset the account, the reset is blocked because the two-step verification is turned on. I am

<p>Hi Rey,</p>
<p>Could you provide some more details of your situation?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Which version of Office are you using?<br />
2.&nbsp;Can you see the workflow task under <strong>File &gt; Info</strong>?<br />
3.&nbsp;Have you tried with different files? Will the same issue happen?<br />
4.&nbsp;Which subscription of Office 365 are you using?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>1. Office 2010 Standard</p>
<p>2. No I cannot see the workflow task under File &gt; Info</p>
<p>3. Same issue happens with all files</p>
<p>4. We have SharePoint online plan E1</p>
<p>I have also tried adding the View Workflow Task button in the Quick access toolbar of excel &nbsp;but that just stays greyed out. It seems to be a permissions issue but I do cannot determine where this permission is located.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>hi rey,</p>
<p>in your situation, <strong>office 2010 standard</strong> doesn’t support <strong>
open this task</strong>. you need to have <strong>office 2010 professional plus</strong> to complete workflow tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you want to complete a workflow, you can do that in sharepoint online by following the steps below.<br />
1. create and start a workflow.<br />
2. share the sharepoint site with a user and grant him the <strong>edit permission</strong>.<br />
3. go forward to the shared sharepoint site with the user account and find the started workflow.<br />
4. click<strong> in progress</strong>.</p>

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>I have read that this is not supposed to work with Office 2010 Std. &nbsp;But I am using Office 2010 Std and it is working perfectly fine for me. &nbsp;The attached picture is of my excel 2010 std. &nbsp;If it is not supported in Office 2010 Std, is it supported in office
 2013 std and above? &nbsp;We have SA and can download and install newer version if needed.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Rey,</p>
<p>Because the function is limited in Office Standard, Open this task is not available in Office 2013 Standard as well.</p>
<p>Given your situation, I recommend you complete a workflow directly in SharePoint Online instead by referring to the steps I posted above.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 &#43; Project and Visio 2010 - Product Key Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 laptop with Office 2016 and Project 2010 and Visio 2010. The Project and Visio 2010 programs were installed full from CDs and have been working successfully with their valid/activated product keys. Yesterday, my user tried to open both
 programs and received messages that the Product key needed to change and he only has 2 days until it expires. I've run an Office repair on both programs and re-entered their product keys. Same message/same issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any Windows updates that were installed in the past couple of days and I'm not sure what happened or where else to troubleshoot.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you get the product key before? Is it a trial version? Please open Visio 2010, go to File &gt; Help, would you mind you take a screenshot about this page?</p>
<p>

<p>The Product Key was purchased through our MS licensing. It was installed on a previous laptop, deactivated, and reinstalled on the user's new Windows 10 laptop. Software was working fine up until recently, when it started popping up with the error message
 that the Product Key was not activated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen shot of error message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96818703-ed15-46ff-88c8-779f809a75f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96818703-ed15-46ff-88c8-779f809a75f9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen shot of message inside of software: </p>

<p>
</p><p>Again, I click on the Change Product Key link, enter the same Product Key into the wizard, and it is saved successfully. Then when I Close and reopen the software, user gets the same "activation required" message again.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&gt;&gt;</em><span><em>The Product Key was purchased through our MS licensing.</em></span></p>
<p>About "MS licensing", do you mean the Volume License service center? If that is the case, how did you activate the Visio 2010 before? KMS or MAK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please<span>&nbsp;open command prompt, use the following script to check the license information:</span></p>
<span>cscript.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\Office14\"ospp.vbs /dstatus</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you are installing 32-bit Visio 2010 on a 64-bit Windows 10 operating system, the script is:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>cscript.exe "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office14\"ospp.vbs /dstatus</span>
<p>

                    The problem I am having is with the security certificate. The IT guy loaded it on the phone but they still don't like each other. It says the security certificate on the server is not valid. Support code: 0x80072F06.

            Greetings cpierce!&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!<br />
<br />
The security certificate is only part of the battle.&nbsp; Your IT guy will also need to specifically option Exchange Server to allow you access to your account&nbsp;through your&nbsp;Windows Mobile Device.&nbsp; It might be a good time to advise him that it's still not working,
 and could he please try re-loading your digital certificate again?

            The Exchange Server name in your ActiveSync settings is different from the one required to establish a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. Correct the Exchange Server name:
<ol>
<li>Press Start <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.palm.com%2fus%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkb%2farticles%2fBTN_start.gif" /> and select Programs. Then select ActiveSync.
</li><li>Press Menu and select Configure Server. </li><li>Enter the correct information on each screen: server address, SSL requirement, user name, password, domain, and data types to sync. If you don't have this information, contact your IT Helpdesk.
</li><li>Try to sync again. </li></ol>
<p>This error can also occur when your smartphone was previously set to sync on a schedule, and you recently change it to manual sync.

<p>Greetings H samraj!&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to teh Windows Mobile Total Access forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in answering your question, I was going through the lists of unanswered questions to at least provide an&nbsp;answer to those questions which never received an initial response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of Blackberry on a corporate network generally requires the use of a different e-mail server application.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you migrate to WM, you'll need to do the following:
</p>
<p><strong>1.)</strong> Inform your Exchange Server Admin that you are now using a WM device, so that he/she can turn-down your account on the Blackberry server.</p>
<p><strong>2.)</strong> Your Exchange Server Admin will then want to add your new phone&nbsp;to the list of allowed devices capable of accessing Exchange Server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>3.)</strong> You will then need to point your device at the Microsoft Exchange Server, using the username &amp; password provided by the admin in the steps above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps clarify the situation for you.</p>

    <title>OneNote annotations out of alignment on O365 web version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tws itsupport  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote annotations out of alignment on O365 web version</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a client experiencing issues with OneNote. They are using the iPad app held horizontally to annotate notebooks which allows them to add ticks and highlight things, also adding notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are also using OneNote 2016 on a laptop and OneNote Online. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The client will make annotations and notes using the iPad and it will sync and show up fine on the laptop client version of OneNote. However when they load the same notebook in the Online version the notes and annotations are not showing where they should
 be. </p>
<p>Instead they are further to the right, away from the original work and often slightly higher too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there any reason that annotations and notes might change positions between OneNote versions? Or could it be a compatibility issue between the iPad app and the Online web version?&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>I am having problem with my windows 10 mobile.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have down loaded it&nbsp;to my Blu HD LTE. Now several programs are not working, all of them tell me to go to settings/contacts menu to turn messaging on. However when I go to the settings/contacts menu I find&nbsp;all
 options greyed out. All the applications requiring contact info will not work, This includes among others Cortana and messenger. Has anyone else had and solved this problem?

<h2>            Build 10049 has installed. But post installation has constant network driver&#47;network protocol stack issues on wired and wireless. Korean Media Center&#47;Messenger Center on default user profile desktop &#33;</h2>
                    <p>After 3.5 hrs taken up waiting for the Build 10041 to Build 10049 process to complete (on a 500gb disk drive) then system has rebuilt and started itself ok post installation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there are 2 icons for Korean Media Center and Messenger on the default user profile on this build.</p>
<p>- image attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are issues with the intel network card drivers that were not an issue on the previous 10041 build nor 9926 build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to make you aware that I was unable to get my network card to work on an outlook.com LOCAL account (WITH ADMIN RIGHTS) on which the feedback application would PREVIOUSLY start OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to get my network card to work on other profiles !</p>
<p>
</p><p>wireless card does not connect either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>not a firewall issue - </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the "update to build 10049" process has affected the drivers or the settings within the user profile.</p>
<p>I will try deleting all of my accounts on the laptop and start again with new accounts. All of these accounts have local admin access. The network fault process detects an IP issue - tcp/ip stack not loading correctly.</p>

    <title>Change user name of users syned with Azure AD Connect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefkrau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change user name of users syned with Azure AD Connect</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we started a while ago to use Office 365 and sync our on premise users to Office 365. Internaly we use the domain mycompany.corp but our email domain is mycompany.com. So the login name on premise was always *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Office 365 this was synced to the username *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. We were then able to change the user name to the user's primary email address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in the Office 365 Admin Console. (Just had to change the domain in the user's settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now it seems that this does no longer work. Any newly created user must stick to the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** domain, as I'm no longer able to change the domain setting. Everything in the user's settings is grayed out or read only and nothing
 can be changed anymore. It is also no longer possible to add email aliases in the user's settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a warning that "This user is synchronized with your local Active Directory. Some details can be edited only through your local Active Directory.". That's clear as the user gets synced to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old ones all have the correct domain set. But there, too, I cannot change the setting anymore. Was there anything changed in the sync or on Office 365? And how can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi StefKrau,<br />
<br />
Based on my knowledge, admin need to manage synced users in AD and it is the recommend method. Based on your description, it is the expected behavior.
<br />
<br />
Given the situation, you can also use the PowerShell to change user name (login name). Here are the steps:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn975125.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Office 365 PowerShell</a><br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Run the following PowerShell command:<br />
<br />
set-msoluserprincipalname -newuserprincipalname name@contoso1.com -userprincipalname name@contoso.onmicrosoft.com<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Erick
