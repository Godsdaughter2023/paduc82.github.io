<h2>            can&#39;t open google chrome in windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I have downloaded google chrome, which I prefer to IE as my search engine, but the only way I can access it is by searching for it in explorer.&nbsp; I would rather open it directly from the start page with a tile.&nbsp; I did this in XP just fine, so why the trouble
 now?

<p>Thanks for the answer, Ronnie, but I did all that before.&nbsp; When I try to open google search or google chrome, all I get is the start page all over again.&nbsp; I tried to open both from the desktop and the same result.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems Microsoft is forcing me to use
 IE?&nbsp; I would rather think there is some trick on Window 8 to allow me to do what I want.</p>

    <title>BIOS Setup and Boot keys disabled when Windows 10 is installed. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BIOS Setup and Boot keys disabled when Windows 10 is installed.</h2>
                    <p>Perhaps someone can tell me if this behavior is by design (I hope not) or a bug.<br />
</p>
<p>I upgraded Windows 7 to Windows 10 this weekend on a Dell Studio XPS tower. During the boot process, my F2 for Setup and F12 for Boot Menu will no longer respond to key presses. They worked fine under Windows 7 before the update, and they worked again as
 soon as I restored Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might be a BIOS problem so I update the BIOS with the latest from Dell. The F12 Boot menu key worked once immediately after the flash, but failed again after I let the system boot all the way to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, the BIOS is not UEFI. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would an OS permanently mess around with the BIOS of a computer? The OS should not come into play until after the BIOS hands control over after reading the disk boot record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I boot from CDs for my disk backup software. I also use live flash drives to test versions of Linux.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I going to have to stay on Windows 7 to keep these features?</p>

            <p>My home built computer will no longer allow me to use the BIOS to control BOOT devices. I can not select the sequence with which drives will BOOT; I can disable devices like DVD drives, HDD drives, FLOPPY drives. All attempts to control system devices is
 controlled by WINDOWS 10. Turn the computer on and it will BOOT into WINDOWS 10 and only WINDOWS 10.

            <p>this reply was NOT helpful! The user clearly stated his problems with BIOS choice key began AFTER he installed Win 10... so I wonder why you are telling him how to install Win 10?!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem on my Gateway desktop, which upgraded to Win 10 fine. But sometimes I want to boot Linux from a flash drive. I could press F10 on start and choose device, CD, HDD, USB etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made it work one by repeatedly hitting F10, but not always. The system just goes straight to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It certainly DOES look like Microsoft has done something to interfere. WHAT? I thought the BIOS was independent, on the mobo, and comes before any OS on the HDD. How is this even possible for Win 10 to interfere?&nbsp; and HOW do I turn this off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users shouldn't have to update their BIOS. What if there is no update as on my machine?????</p>

<p>

<p>So basically the 'Fast Startup' option was turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how you turn it off:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to 'Control Panel -&gt; 'Power Options' -&gt; from the left hand column select 'What the Power Buttons Do' -&gt; at the top of the page select 'Change Settings that are currently unavailable' -&gt; scroll all of the way to the bottom and uncheck 'Turn on Fast Startup
 (Recommended)'. Then click 'Save Changes'."</p>

            <p>I appreciate the tip, but it didn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new HP Envy 17 that I had built. It came with Win10 64X and I'm fed up with the OS. I don't want to get into a mess so I've set another partition to load Win7 64X into dual boot. Won't work if I can't access the bios to reorder the start up or use
 the F12 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the next visit will be to HP to see if they can give me access to the bios. If you hear a horribly loud "boom" in the near future, it's not an atomic bomb. It's just me exploding when HP says they can't give me that authority!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again thanks for the insight &amp; effort on your part.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Speed hack detected&#34; while playing a game.</h2>
                    Hey everyone,&nbsp;<br />
Recently I got a new laptop Sony Vaio. And I just started playing this game that I've been playing for a long time, on this new laptop and all of a sudden I keep getting this pop up message saying "Speed hack detected" Now this means that a certain service/program
 is running that is inputting/outputting to much data which makes the hackshield think I'm "hacking" when I'm not. Now I tried disabling each and every single service that is running, (Through msconfig.exe) but the problem still exists. Idk what else to do,
 and I need help! What new program/service is on windows 8 causing this to pop up? Because on my old desktop WindowsXP and Windows Vista the game works perfectly. Please help me solve this issue if anyone can.

What antivirus software do you utilize?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
This error is directly related to the game, not Windows 8 (the software has to be made compatible with the operating system, not the operating system with the software... Once can run without the other but you cannot switch that around.&nbsp; *grin*)<br />

Those seem like the most recent posts about it - with a slew of things to try - but no solid fixes (other than the manufacturer suggesting a dual boot system. hah)<br />

            I use Webroot, the antivirus that came with the laptop.<br />
<br />
And the only solution that I came up with in the past after doing research, was to downgrade to Windows 7 (But I am not doing that). The game makers made it compatible with windows 8 and I have no problem playing the game. That "Speed hack" error comes up at
 anytime, when I'm playing between 10min~60min. Do you have any ideas on which program is running in the background causing that error to come up?

Ok those are all the screen shots of all the services that run on my computer.&nbsp;<br />
"<a href="http://nforum.ogplanet.com/rf/forum_posts.asp?TID=555528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nforum.ogplanet.com/rf/forum_posts.asp?TID=555528</a>" That is a direct link to the thread I created on the game's forums to try to see if I could get any solutions but, nothing, nada.&nbsp;<br />
If possible can you identify the program running from that list that is causing the problem? Because I literally tried disabling just about every single one and it still came up. Or is the problem elsewhere that a certain program is running?</div>

1) Yes only to this game does this issue come up<br />
2) Currently, I only play the game through a Ethernet cable so the connection is fine (From the gameplay it's completely smooth and fine)<br />
3) The laptop is a Sony Vaio, model: SVF15AA1QL<br />
<br />
My thing is, how can I find which application is causing this because I've tried disabling a lot of programs and none of them seem to work.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is what the helpdesk from the game says is the problem:&nbsp;<br />
"<b><span>This mainly happens when you have applications running simultaneously that may be conflicting with Hackshield. This may also include a firewall that does not open an exception
 for the RF Client. We recommend you close all other applications when playing Rumble Fighter.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
</b><span><b>Furthermore, you may also receive this error due to a slow internet connection. We advise you check your network settings and allow exceptions through any firewalls you are
 currently using</b>."</span>

Would uninstalling them fix the problem? I disabled all my anti-virus programs and uninstalled Kasperky but it still comes up.&nbsp;

            <p>I cannot say for sure, but it might.&nbsp; This link tells you how to completely uninstall Kaspersky:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/us/8925#block0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.kaspersky.com/us/8925#block0</a>.&nbsp; Be sure to make sure to tell it to save
 nothing.&nbsp; It could also be one of the new hacking&nbsp;defense features in Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend searching the File Explorer for any remaining files and removing them also.&nbsp; You will need to reboot your computer after this to completely remove them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you will need to re-boot the computer after the uninstalls.&nbsp; If you are comfortable with the registry, you could look through there for any remaining files (CTRL-F to find).&nbsp; Registry changes do not take effect until a reboot is performed.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Fernando,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forums. I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Does the issue occur only while playing music from Zune using Music app?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Did you try restarting the computer and check?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, it shows that the Zune Music Pass content does not play on Xbox Music app on Windows 8.1. This could be due to corruption in registry settings. To fix this problem, use the
 following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.</span></p>

    <title>Picture Tools Tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> royceroberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Picture Tools Tab</h2>
                    I have HP and Asus laptop both with exact same version of Win 10 and both with exact same photo file folders. In the HP laptop, a click on any photo folder and the Picture Tools/Manage tab appears at the top, even if that folder has many sub folders. I
 can therefore do a slide show that includes the folder and all of it's sub folders. On the Asus laptop the Picture Tools/Manage tab does not appear until I get into the last layer of folders and when there are no other sub folders. In fact, the tab usually
 does not appear until I click on an actual photo file but even that isn't consistent. I have a folder with 10 sub folders each with several .jpg photos and the Picture Tools/Manage tab will appear when I click on one of those 10 folders but not for the other
 9. I'm guessing it's a properties or permissions issue but i just can't find it. Please help!

    <title>Curiosity, Xbox One and Backwards Compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jibyo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Curiosity, Xbox One and Backwards Compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>So... The Xbox One is now backwards compatible... But it runs all the games through and emulated dashboard. Will you have access to the whole 360 dashboard from within the Xbox One? or only sections of it while in the game. Say you pushed the Xbox button
 on the middle of your controller and went to My Games on the menu, would that exit the emulated version and take you to the Xbox One version of My Games?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, seeing as it is run in an Emulator... I have all my 360 games now installed on a 2Tb hard drive now that they are supported on the 360. Would I just be able to plug that into my Xbox One? Would it even recognize it? and if it does, would it actually
 be able to play them? Would I have to redownload a patched version of the game or would it run straight off the bat?<br />
<br />
Thank you to anyone who knows.</p>

<p>Pressing the guide button will take you to the Xbox 1 dash but if you press start and back or whatever they are called now will take you to a 360 dash with chat options and not much else
</p>
<p>No you will have to redownload all your games as the file size on Xbox 1 is bigger as it adds the emulator features

<p>All games have to be either re-downloaded (XBLA games) or re-installed (Disc games) this is so that the OS on the Xbox One knows where the games are (probably something to do with registry keys etc)</p>
<p>As for the Xbox 360 OS, I've only used it once so my memory may be a little shaky. &nbsp;I think you don't get a full Xbox 360 dashboard. &nbsp;So when you press the Xbox One guide button while playing a 360 game, you get the little 360 blades dash.</p>
<p>Like I said I think that's how it works, cant really remember as I only used it once.</p>

<p>Disc games are downloaded as well, not re-installed. The only point to the disc is to prove ownership of the title.
</p>
<p>Disk drives on the One and the 360 have a different format and one will not work on the other. In fact the 360 drive expansion is actually pretty picky about what drives it will use as it wants no more than a 512kb cluster size and a lot of 2+Tb drives are
 formatted to 4K and won't work at all (Seagate for instance)</p>

<p>Yeah I doubt you get the full dashboard. It would make sense for it to just have the chat features, friends etc. The other features like the marketplace probably wont be needed. So keep your 360s just in case you plan to purchase more games.

<p>It doesn't really seem to me like true backward compatibility, more like their converting select 360 games into games on demand format, and then having you download them,

<p>It's at least emulating the 360 OS.</p>
<p>I tried Gears of War on my One and then logged into my 360 and was kicked offline on the One.</p>
<p>Live sees the emulated games as being played on a real 360.</p>

<p>You don't have access to the Xbox 360 dashboard when playing backwards compatible titles but you can access the guide menu while the game is playing if you press the back and menu button on your Xbox one controller.</p>
<p>Installed Xbox 360 games on a Xbox 360 formatted external hard drive won't work with the Xbox One. The games need to be installed on an xbox one and modified to work with the emulation.</p>
<p>I'm guessing when backwards compatibility becomes available to everyone the Xbox One store will have digital titles and DLC added for purchase. Digital games you already own will be free to download in the games and apps section and disk based games can
 be installed by putting the disk into the blue ray drive.</p>
<p>I'm really excited to see what the remaining titles out of the 100 will be available to download.</p>

<p>All of it? I doubt it. We're still limited to the 512MB space given to all 360 owners.</p>
<p>I'd like to add that, assuming most of the save files are 64kbs (at least the Rare ones are), you can store up to 8,000 save files on the cloud. The 360 library isn't 8,000 titles big. We can manage.</p>

            <p>Is your computer running a Home edition of Windows 10? If so it would have the remote desktop client to connect to other computers, but would not have the server aspect to allow remote desktop connections in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Home edition, then you would need to upgrade to the Pro version in order to setup the computer to allow remote desktop connections. If you are interested in that process you can check out this article

<h2>            Very Slow Zip&#47;Unzip on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Hoping someone can help me out with this. I just got a new computer and was unzipping something, expecting it to be done in a few seconds (5 meg zip file), but the operation not only took a good 30 seconds, but Explorer seemed to hang while this was happening.
 I have tried to unzip the very same file with 7zip and this did not occur, and the operation completed in less than 5 seconds. Anyone know whats causing this and how to fix it? I am more than content to just use WinRAR or 7zip to avoid the problem in the future,
 but if its a symptom of a larger OS problem I want to fix it now rather than later. Thank you!

There may be an issue, or none.&nbsp; Although you did great in describing the issue - not knowing if all of the hardware drivers are the latest from the individual manufacturers and if this is a clean installation of the operating system you did or if it came from
 the 'factory' with this and who knows what else installed - it's hard to say.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I would recommend installing 7-Zip anyway - it gives you more flexibility than any of the other options discussed.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Why is your Paint.NET installer in a ZIP?<br />
Why is said ZIP file larger than the normal executable?<br />
&nbsp; Paint.NET.3.5.10.Install.exe is 3,669 KB... (about 3.5MB in executable format.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I would question your Paint.NET installer - unless this is not an officially sanctioned distribution and you know what is in it?<br />

            Hi Shenan, thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Looks like I had some kind of older installer, so I re-downloaded form the website, 3.55 zip. Still slow unzip, fast with 7zip.<br />
<br />
I've replicated the issue with another zip of some PDFs and text files I had. Don't really know whats going on...<br />
<br />
As for the system, well its an ASUS Zenbook, brand new, I've updated all the drivers that I am aware of, and its "clean" so far as a system can be clean with manufacturer bloat. (Have uninstalled most of the ASUS stuff).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In any event would you consider this a potentially problematic issue, or can I just let it pass as another Windows quirk..or upgrade to Windows 8?

I used both 7-Zip and Windows Explorer (64-bit Windows 7, i7-3720QM @ 2.6GHz processor, 16GB memory, nVidia NVS 5200M video, 256GB Solid State Drive, eSet NOD32 AV only) and both took less than 5 seconds - including double-click and verification time.&nbsp; The
 7-Zip, as I assumed, took less than 3 seconds.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
What happens if you create a ZIP file (one with Windows and one with 7-Zip) on that computer and place them someplace else on the computer and extract them... Are you still seeing the 30 second extraction time?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
As a test I extracted a 305MB file using Windows - it took &lt;7 seconds.<br />
I extracted the same file with 7-Zip - it took &lt;2 seconds.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
So, there is going to be a time discrepancy when using the built in (likely less efficient) functionality.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; But 30 seconds for 5MB?&nbsp; Ouch.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
A quick search found a lot of references to this type of thing in Windows Vista - I didn't look all that deep to see if Windows 7 had the same reports.<br />

Looks like I get similar functionality regardless of placing the item on a different spot on my computer. I think I'll look some more into those Vista posts you mentioned. Maybe there is a similarity somewhere...thanks for the help.

I would say that for a lot of things where third party functionality has been added into an operating system just to 'make the end-users happy and less inconvenienced in having to get a third party solution'.&nbsp; Not just for Microsoft products.&nbsp; Other operating
 systems suffer from the same truth vs. expectations result of building what I consider to be *too much* functionality in the base OS instead of allowing those who specialize in such features just continue doing so.<br />

<p>
</p><p>VERY SLLLLLOOOOWWWWW:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open .zip folder.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Ctrl-X</strong> to grab what I want.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to where I want it.</p>
<p>4. Ctrl-V to paste it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>REASONABLE SPEED:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open .zip folder.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Ctrl-C</strong> to grab what I want.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to where I want it.</p>
<p>4. Ctrl-V to paste it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the copy function plays nicely with however Windows zip function is set up.&nbsp; However, if you try to cut instead, not so nice.</p>

    <title>SKYPE Protocol constantly trying to connect&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael k mcpeak  say:</h3>
<h2>            SKYPE Protocol constantly trying to connect&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why is this protocol constantly flooding my Wireshark and network feeds? I don't even have Skype or Skype Business but I do have Office 365 installed, at least within my knowledge or permissions I did not agree too this data usage. (Could Office 365 be the
 culprit?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why is it trying to connect constantly multiple times(2-4) under a second? I live out in a rural area and any excessive request is rather unnecessary, especially if I leave my PC on, data costs can add up rather quickly. I'm using an Education version
 of Windows since it was provided with the cost of my paid education but this is getting rather ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I disable the SKYPE requests even if I don't have any form of Skype downloaded or enabled. It is kinda ridiculous at this point, almost seems like a Virus or Malware directly installed but nothing can detect it (Avast/MalwareBytes), since I didn't
 agree to this kind of data usage or activity previously and it just keeps going on and on. I have numerous recognized and verified filters enabled within Avast and MalwareBytes... (not sure if that is their recognized and verified or the communities)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated, I'm just an out of touch country guy who stumbled upon this righteous forum that could help me out with this issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any incite or assistance.</p>

<p>Microsoft has determined that REGARDLESS, THIS IS NOT MY PC I&nbsp; bought, ND THE OS, so I do not have full control if I can not delete stuff on it SOMEHOW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try hooking it to Win 7 to see IF then I have full privileges using Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we have an issue, someone tries to help. BUT, there is so many VERSIONS of Win 10, their screens, cmds, do not look like mine and fixing via customization has become a nightmare.</p>
<p>(yes, typing this, I had to do in "6 sec" increments" but, will be happy to apology if you can tell me why a simple MOUSE gets the intelligence to "turn off" every 6 sec. (exactly, every 6 sec, ie, comm to the OS gets cut)</p>

<p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the date of birth. Unfortunately there is no way to change the date of birth on a child account once it is made. There is an exception if the child account was made in error and the person is 18 or older can send in age verification
 to fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the account was just made he will need to be added to a family with a parent account. Then the family can change the settings as Italian has mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<h2>            No keyboard after windows 10- not device manager or ease of access filter</h2>
                    <p>Hi! &nbsp;My mom has a toshiba satellite laptop. &nbsp;It just forced her to do the windows 10 update a couple of days ago. &nbsp;Since then, she has had no use of her keyboard. &nbsp;My husband set up the virtual one for her to use until we can figure out how to fix the problem.
 &nbsp;But, she has stage 4 cancer, and neuropathy from chemo. &nbsp;So her fine motor skills are poor and extremely painful. &nbsp;Her computer is one of the only ways for her to communicate. &nbsp;We really need this problem fixed right away. &nbsp; I have been all over he internet
 and YouTube searching for a solution, and have been unsuccessful. &nbsp;It's not the ease of access filter. &nbsp;Or device manager stuff (computer says already updated and won't let me roll back to previous setting...and confirms that it is working properly). &nbsp;We shouldn't
 have to reset her entire laptop to factory settings or have to reinstall all her software just because of a windows update! &nbsp;Please help me! Thanks so much, in advance!</p>

            Hi Trish,<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue regarding the keyboard not working might be due to software conflicts. We can try to run the Microsoft easy fix solutions and see if it works. The steps can be found on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get back to us if the steps won't work.

<p>Hi Trish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new device that was recently added to your computer system needs a driver update to let your peripherals run properly on your computer. If the plug and play feature doesn’t work or your keyboard device was not detected by your computer, you will need to
 install it manually. In your case, the devices got reset because of the recent Windows Update. Visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">link</span></span></a></strong> to know
 how to perform a driver update on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, please do continue taking care of your mom once you've done installing your keyboard manually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this works for you.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive missing from navigation panel in Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OneDrive icon disappeared from the navigation panel in Explorer, see the attached screenshot. My files still sync normally, the OneDrive sync client operates normally from the system tray. Files are still accessible either trough&nbsp;C:\Users\***\OneDrive
 or by launching OneDrive from the start menu. I use only the basic, personal version of OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would however be a lot more practical to have OneDrive show up as a tree file structure in the navigation panel, as it normally should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the following, without success after rebooting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resetting Onedrive.exe (trough RUN)</li><li>Updated OneDrive to the latest 'Rolling out' build</li><li>Unlinking, relinking my account</li><li>Full reinstall of the OneDrive client, clearing it's registry entries under <span>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive&nbsp;</span>first after uninstalling</li><li>Checked the following registry values for the key 'System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree', made sure they were set to 1.
<ul>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\{018**FE6}</li><li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\{018**FE6}</li><li>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{018**FE6}</li></ul>

            Lets try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />After that Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version if any sows there
<br />from the Account folders also can be remove all folders if any 
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive again

<p>Forgot to mention this in the orginal post, but fully reinstalling is something I already tried as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried it again with the forced method trough CMD and clearing the registry keys, as you described. Rebooted and reinstalled the latest version. Still no OneDrive link in the navigation panel on the left side of Explorer.</p>

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that whenever you try to install an all app Windows store app, it always shows as pending and is not downloading the app. We’ll help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When did this issue start? Did you make any recent changes to the computer before this issue started?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you logged in as an Administrator?</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Is the Internet connection fast? Do you face any other issues with internet connectivity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be caused due to a slow internet connection\connectivity issue or due to some app errors. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Modern app troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could also be caused due to an app error. So, I would suggest you to download and run the Modern app troubleshooter to fix any app errors. You can download it here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:<span>&nbsp; </span>Network adapter troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 has a built in troubleshooter that can detect and fix issues with internet connection. Refer these steps to run this troubleshooter;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Run the Network adapter troubleshooter.</p>

<h2>            Creators Update resets various settings and registry changes</h2>
                    <p>The 1703 Creators Update resets some settings and registry changes. &nbsp;Here are some examples I've run across that were undone:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Right context menu "Move to folder"</strong> as detailed at&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/add-copy-to-move-to-to-the-windows-explorer-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/add-copy-to-move-to-to-the-windows-explorer-right-click-menu/</a></span>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Remap Caps Lock to Inactive</strong> using&nbsp;<span><a href="https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/</a>&nbsp;</span><br />
</li><li><strong>Un-checking Fast Startup to prevent boot problems</strong> as detailed at&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_devices/windows-10-final-build-black-screen-after-boot/6c216e14-a112-461e-9faa-62594e195b13">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_devices/windows-10-final-build-black-screen-after-boot/6c216e14-a112-461e-9faa-62594e195b13</a></span><br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It is not clear whether such changes are a feature or a bug - for example it is not clear whether the boot problems in #3 have been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certain other customizations are not changed by the Creators Update. &nbsp;As an example, getting the taskbar clock to show seconds as detailed at&nbsp;<span><a href="http://winaero.com/blog/taskbar-clock-show-seconds-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/taskbar-clock-show-seconds-windows-10/</a>&nbsp;is
 unaffected by the update.</span></p>
<p>Presumably there are many other customizations that are changed other than the 3 I noted.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Why can't Microsoft just save your settings before updates and restore them? &nbsp;And if it wipes out your settings purposely, why not warn you that it is about to happen?</p>

<p>I personally started noticing this in Windows XP. I also notice it occasionally in Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an update replaces an old version of a file, and its corresponding registry keys as the case may be, with a new version, you're getting the default. It's not always possible for Windows to keep track of every setting and redo it after an update. Sometimes
 entire features are reworked by an update. It's not like Burger King (if you remember their old commercial about special orders!)</p>

<p>I'm sure there are complexities, and I'm sure there are situations in which people have gotten themselves in trouble with bad registry changes. &nbsp;But the issues mentioned in this thread seem like ones for which one could store previous settings and reconstitute
 them after the update. &nbsp;Microsoft seems to put a very low priority on doing so, and the effect is to create the impression that updates are a problem and that one's computer is no longer a personal computer, but one managed by Microsoft in a way that treats
 your preferences as having very low value. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those of us who are knowledgeable and organized can just keep lists of settings and how to reconstitute them. &nbsp;But the vast majority of users will experience their computer as no longer being personal.</p>

<p>The worst issue I encountered after the Creators Update was it breaking the sync between Outlook and iCloud, as detailed at&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10-mso_o365b/creators-update-breaks-icloud-sync-to-outlook/3ac7ea55-f758-48a8-8169-dedf385bb83d</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a workaround, but the average user won't know what to do and will have calendar and contact information fail to appear. &nbsp;This cripples one of the major types of functionality of a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone asked me to cite the major drawback of Windows I'd cite how updates mess up the user's computer. &nbsp;In contrast, Microsoft seems to assign this issue very little importance. &nbsp;That is a mistake.</p>

<h2>            Updating to Windows 10, What needs your attention doesn&#39;t let me continue until I remove something from my computer that has been removed for over a year</h2>
                    <p>As I've written in the subject I was attempting to update to Windows 10 from Windows 7 and I've gotten to the "What needs your attention" window, where it says I can't continue until I remove "Lynksys AE1200/2500 802.11 Wireless LAN Dongle", problem is that
 hasn't been inserted in my PC for well over a year, I don't even know where it is anymore. It's not listed in my Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if any of you is able to help me resolve this issue</p>

            You reported details of an access violation in svchost.exe. &nbsp;The details indicate that the file stapo.dll was responsible for the access violation. &nbsp;This file is part of the C-Major audio drivers, it seems. &nbsp;You would want to get an update to these audio
 drivers; if you're already running the latest version, try a previous version. If that doesn't help, contact the manufacturer for support for your problem, since they would need to provide updated components that don't cause this problem.

<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troublehooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;sound or svchost.exe_Audiosrv or stapo.dll (Start / Control Panel / Administrative
 Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager
 and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting
 tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do so for your sound card and any other audio device you have installed at least and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device
 manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>
