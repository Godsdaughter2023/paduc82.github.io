Sorry to say so but you have a major problem with your motherboard. You can try this:<br />
<ol>
<li>Disconnect all leads.</li><li>Open the case.</li><li>Gently wipe away any traces of the coffee.</li><li>Wait 24 hours to let it dry out.</li></ol>
If this does not fix the problem or if this is a laptop then you need to get the machine serviced.<br />

<h2>            How to set up signatures with HTML features &#40;Italics, Bold, Colors, etc.&#41; in Windows Live Mail </h2>
                    
<p>Email signatures need style. How can I set up signaatures for Windows Live Mail (Windows 7) with features such as bold, colors, italics, logos, etc.? I've tried creating signatures in Word, then cutting and pasting them into Windows Live Mail Signatures
 section, but these effects do nor carry over.&nbsp;What remains is simply the alphabetical characters in what appears to be Plain Text. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm new to this forum. Recently i've been having a problem with this file ( the title), i think its some kind of virus but i'm not sure. When i want to open a browser i have to go open it through this file, it has a list of programs i can access and if
 a particular program isn't on the list it will download it on Google Chrome ( the browser i was when i got the virus). I can't even use the command prompt, an application not found error pops up. How can i get rid of it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank You</div>

                    <p>Not sure how this happened. Right after a Windows 10 update my Microsoft Basic Optical Mouse (USB) stopped working with my Windows 10 laptop. The device shows up in device manager with a "Computer Icon" - Unspecified at the top of the Icon and "Microsoft
 USB optical mouse" at the bottom. "Need troubleshooting" shows up. I've run "sfc scannow " with no errors. When I attempt to let Windows 10 update the driver for Microsoft Hardware USB Mouse I get the following error: "An error occurred during the installation
 of the device: The driver installation file for this device is missing a necessary entry. Contact you hardware vendor." It's a Microsoft USB mouse so that would Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB port works fine with other USB devices, i.e., Smartphone and thumbdrives.</p>
<p>I've reinstalled the USB Hub Drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rebooted several times</p>
<p>Removed the device and added again....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this? Is there a pointer to the driver that I can download and run?&nbsp;</p>

                    When I try to burn a CD, Windows Media Player burns to 99% then ejects the CD and says it encountered an error, make sure the burner is connected properly, and that the CD is clean and not defective.&nbsp; I am using a Toshiba laptop, Window 10 and used several
 different CD-R's.&nbsp; I'd appreciate some help on this, as the last time I used it (about a month ago) it worked fine.&nbsp; Thank you, Stacy

            Hi Stacy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it worked fine before and now doesn't then it could easily be the quality of the CD's which have a shelf life and can easily go bad over time.  To check this I'd buy some new CD's to try with them.  
<br />
<br />You can also try using a burner app like the expert's choice ImgBurn <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/2597/burn-almost-anything-to-disc-with-imgburn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/2597/burn-almos...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Did you try burning at a lower burn speed to see if helps.
<br />
<br />In Media Player, press Alt on your keyboard, click Tools &gt; Options &gt; Burn
<br />CLick in the Burn speed list box
<br />Choose slow or medium
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Try burning again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />
<br />You can try uninstall then reinstall it to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Expand Media Features
<br />Uncheck Media Player
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Expand Media Features
<br />Check Media Player
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried another pack of CD's and reducing the burn speed to medium based on another person's comment to me, and I was able to burn a couple CD's but now it keeps giving me error messages that it cannot burn the CD because some of the songs have errors.&nbsp;
 For example, I was trying to burn a soundtrack and 5 songs had errors ( when I clicked on them it brought me to a paragraph that said there was no error explanation or something tied to that error and to look into something called "codec"s or something like
 that).&nbsp; If I delete the songs with errors then I can burn the CD.&nbsp; But of course I really like the songs I had to delete!&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>

            <p>I have used each suggestion before I posted my question and the driver does not come up yet there is a conflict. &nbsp;The optional driver was installed as I needed to restore the OEM Windows7.0 Starter software when it was included with my Acer computer. &nbsp; No
 knowledge base was listed on the installed software, it later came up as an optional install just after Service Pack one again with no Knowledge base attached. &nbsp; The conflict causes mechanical conflicts with other hardware used in conjunction with the computer
 itself and with my cellphone which will lock up the software also allows for hackers to enter both computer and cellphone even with firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver does not come up with any device that is listed. I also did a search with the first search through the start button, the computer has the driver installed but it does not come up on the search either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Could you please assist with a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not sure that Souvlaki mentioned his Windows version, but I guess we both provided him the info of what versions he can use to change his language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the&nbsp;good supplemental information about the upgrade and language packs by Ronnie (thanks I voted your post helpful), I&nbsp;provided him with the Answer to his question which was a step by step explanation&nbsp;how to change languages.&nbsp;Might be a good
 idea to combine this into one little nugget of "info goodness" and call it good then:</p>
<p>Here is how you would change the language:</p>
<p>1. Click on start button, then go to the control panel<br />
2. In Category view: click on Clock, Language, and region link. Then click on Change display language link under "Region and language section".<br />
3. In icons view, click on Region and language icon, and then go to keyboards and languages tab.<br />
4. Under "display language" section, choose a display language from the list of installed language packs...
<br />
5. Click Apply</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Only Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise have capability of displaying more than one language.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>If you need to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise, here is the information to do so:</p>

<p>That's the problem though Badger. Online play is free over Xbox Live if you are playing on the PC.</p>
<p>As I said in that thread on the Xbox One board, now that 'Xbox' isn't just a console brand we are going to see this question come up more and more often.</p>
<p>Why do some people get to play online over Xbox Live for free, when others do not? Both sets of people are connecting to the same service, why does only one set of people have to pay for that?</p>
<p>It was a question that was largely ignored with 'Games for Windows Live' because people on PC mostly ignored that too. Now both are using Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Microsoft's PR are going to have to come up with a better excuse than "PC gamers wouldn't pay the Gold sub so we didn't charge them for it."</p>

<p>Which is my point. I don't pay to access the features of Xbox Live. I can play online, Party Chat etc all at no cost. Yet you have to pay.</p>
<p>You, and everyone who has a Gold sub on console are subsidising me and other Xbox Live PC gamers.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong I'm thankful for that but that doesn't stop the question being raised. It can't be dismissed with the argument of "oh but it's pence per day".</p>
<p>I'll be honest, I'm genuinely surprised that you don't care and can dismiss this so easily.</p>

<p>"Why do one group of people have to pay to access multiplayer on Xbox Live when another get it at no cost"</p>
<p>The reason is because Microsoft is trying to get the PC gamers out there to use Xbox Live on PC, if Microsoft charged for this service on PC, the PC gamers wouldn't use it, because there are loads of similar services that don't charge.</p>
<p>IF Sony suddenly stopped charging for PSN, then we may so Microsoft stop charging for Xbox Live, but don't count on it.</p>

<p>Fair enough Badger, can't argue with that. But if I might make one request, please don't just dismiss the reasons why some people are questioning this just because you are happy with it.</p>
<p>Thing is though Shaggy that Sony didn't charge for online play with the PS3, and I don't believe that Nintendo machines do either. So yes you are right to doubt it because why would Microsoft drop the fee when people have proven they are willing to pay for
 a service that the company offers for free elsewhere.</p>

            <p><span>Hi thanks for responding</span></p>
<p><span>The model is a connect 8.9” tablet with windows 10</span></p>
<p><span>I cant get into windows but did attach a keyboard and get to the bios, then selected don’t save and restart from there. It just goes back to the same loop. Rebooting to a circle logo centre screen
 then a quick flash of a small window on the left then back to the logo and the restoring your previous version.</span></p>
<p><span>No error messages I can see but it might be in that window that flash up and closes too quickly to see?</span></p>
<p><span>Cannot boot to login screen</span></p>

    <title>xBox PAL or NTSC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilxyli  say:</h3>
<h2>            xBox PAL or NTSC&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>I am planning to buy xBox but I have some confusions and seek some advice in this regards.</p>
<p>1. Upon search I found xBox360 is region locked. Some PAL games doesn't work on NTSC and vice versa. I also found many people prefer having NTSC over PAL. I live in Middle-east where PAL xBox and games are available but my xBox account is US. So will my
 account work on PAL xBox360? Also, I won MW3 elite and collection codes, will those map packs be playable on PAL xBox with PAL MW3 retail game?</p>

<p>Plus, what are you suggestion which one should I get? PAL or NTSC?</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">ilxYli, neither NTSC or PAL or "better" then the other, so there should be no "preference" between the two. It's simply a matter of what your Region is and what's available along with Support for that Region. If you try "cross-combining"
 Regional Content (Games/ DLC/ Updates and such) you are only going to run into issues.</span><br />
<br />
 Regional as well, as well as the Marketplace Content and Codes used in the Marketplace. For example, MS Points Card from another Region will not work with my Profile and I must use MS Points (and Download Codes) for my Region. Creating an Account outside of
 my Region will not circumvent this, it will still be IP Blocked.</span><br />

<p>Thanks LostKauz. That is very precise and have cleared my confusion. As I mentioned PAl games and xBox are available here, although when creating account I couldn't found country I am living in. So only option I am to chose from is either EU or US. And because
 this region comes under PAL, so I think its better to have PAL xBox for which the games are also available here.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">No problem and if your Region is PAL, I would recommend having a Profile that can use PAL Regional Content. You still might run into issues though if your Country has no Xbox LIVE Support at all.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem is going to be when you try to create a Profile that is not in a Region Supported by Xbox LIVE you will run into a lot of problems due to not being in a Region for Support of XBL. It's because there is no Support for that Region and the
 Account/ Profile is not from that Region (due to being no Support). It's a circulative argument and it as well will have issues and effect both Profile and Content.<br />
<br />
Good luck and if you have any questions, just ask.</span></p>

<p>Yeah. I created recently three accounts. US, UK and local (luckily I found country in the list when creating account.). US and Uk have the same features and offers same content while local one excludes movies and music section along with MS Points and add
 them entirely, which is a bummer. Although I am less concerned about movies and music but excluding MS Point limits many possibilities and leaves with no option but to use CC for purchases. I won't be using credit card at all which means the local account
 for me seems to be useless.</p>
<p>So now I have confusion which account should I go with. Or try one month gold subscription for each to understand the offers and contents and usability. What you suggest?</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">If it was me, I would do it the way it is supposed to be as Supported. Without Support and the correct Country many issues can arise that may make Account Recovery impossible if something was to go wrong later down the line (seen

Just in case you didn't know, you can also Share Content between two Profiles as long as that Content is Licensed to the Console ID it was purchased (Downloaded) on. It's known as a DRM or Digital Rights Management. It works by assigning a License to the Console
 that any Content was first Downloaded on and to the Profile that purchased it on an additional Console ID's as long as it is Signed into XBL.
<br />
<br />
This means any Profile on the same Console the Content was first Downloaded on can play that Content. It can be used to Share Content between two or more Profiles as long as the License is current on that Console (did not change Console ID). One Profile would
 be for purchase only and the other for Gaming Online. You would need to keep accurate Information on both Profiles though if there ever was any problems that require Support.<br />

If that makes sense.&nbsp; <br />

<p>Those are indeed some issues I should take into consideration. I have been reading forums and threads about the LIVE availability here in Saudi Arabia. I even checked LIVE supported countries listed by Microsoft here but none of the middle eastern country
 is found there. Although, yesterday I was able to create account with Saudi Arabia selected as region. This was not available about 2 months before when I tried to create one. This might be an indication that LIVE is possibly coming to middle east as well,
 but of course not sure.</p>
<p>Your suggestion about two accounts, one for purchase and one for play seems quite legit. But I'll update you as soon as I'll get xBox and check out these issues. I have tweeted to Xbox Support and xBox live twitter accounts and waiting for their reply.</p>

<p>As suspected I cannot sign in with my local acc because XBL is not yet supported in this country. So I created UK acc and tried one month free Gold which works the way it is supposed to but yeah some contents are not available but playing online with PAL
 games works. So unfortunetely I have to stick with that for know. Plus, can you tell me If I could upgrade to XBL Gold during my XBL Gold one month trial? Because I heard I can't upgrade XBL Gold until the previous gold subscription is expired.</p>

<h3> scottf93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot upgrade to Windows 10. Says I need at least 2gb of RAM...</h2>
                    <p>I have a machine with Windows 8.1 Pro, 4GB RAM, and 60GB free hard drive space. The Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;upgrade icon never advertised. I downloaded the ISO, created a DVD, and attempted to upgrade and was told I needed at least 2GB of RAM (I have 4). Tried dropping
 down to 2GB of RAM (an action that worked for someone else with the same error message) but same result. I tried copying the installer files to a folder on a secondary drive in computer and installing from there (has worked fine on other computers in the past)
 but I get the same error. Thinking it might be something my family may have installed on the machine, I tried installing a clean install of Windows 10 Pro from the DVD. It installed fine and works great BUT... it is not activated, I do not have a Windows 10
 Pro key, and my Windows 8 Pro key does not work (free upgrade key for Win10Pro is issued at the time of the upgrade). Still hoping errant programs were the problem, I re-installed Windows 8 Pro, ran the upgrade from the DVD and I again get the "you need at
 least 2gb of RAM" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That a clean install works fine says that my hardware has no problem running Win10. However, I am perplexed as to how I am supposed to get my free upgrade if the key is issued at the time of upgrade and I cannot run the upgrade so it will be issued. Anyone
 else run into this particular challenge?</p>

            I had the same problem I fixed it by first using msconfig to disable all Microsoft services on startup. this bypassed the check for pc specs but still failed at the end when rebooting. I then started enabling services a few at a time starting with all
 networking and wlan ones. Then windows update and storage service. I just kept doing this until it completed not really sure what services needs disabled and which needs enabled but it worked for me just keep track of which ones you enable . Its trial and
 error but I guarantee it works because you wind up disabling the service the installer needed to do the pc check and it just continues with the install.

            <p>No key is issued. &nbsp;It is a generic key and is inserted by the upgrade installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need a key and installer will not ask for one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards you do not need a key to reinstall because Microsoft is using a new licensing technology. &nbsp;The upgrader will read your 8.1 licensing data and combine that with Windows 10 data, issue a new license, and permanently activate the system. &nbsp;After that
 your computer becomes a Registered Windows 10 Device on Microsoft's activation servers. &nbsp;It remains an RWTD even if Windows 10 is removed and another OS is installed. &nbsp;That means you can reinstalled Windows 10 as many times and way as you like and do not need
 a product key. &nbsp;If an installer screen asks for a pk you can safely skip and contine with the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why Microsoft is not issuing individual product keys for this upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dummy product key you can find in the system with Belarc or KeyFinder is the same for everybody and is publicaly known. &nbsp;Which is no matter because it can only be used with a system that is already an RWTD. &nbsp;It cannot be used to clean install the software
 on a new system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the reason the why first installation must be an upgrade to a genuine and activated Windows 7 or 8.x system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Product keys are sooooo 2012ish. &nbsp;:)</p>

            If you read his post his problem is that he cannot run the upgrade to have his pc registered as a windows 10 device. It doesn't matter if the key is generic or not if he cant do an in place upgrade. No where in your reply is there advice on the 2gb error
 he receives so why did you bother posting??

            What do you mean the upgrade installer wont make that mistake ? That is what is making the mistake. I had the same problem and its hardware related the ram is getting reported wrong. The bios was right and so was windows but the installer reads it different
 and finds the problem. I ran belarc advisor on my pc it listed 4gb overall system memory but only 32mb installed in the dimm slots when there was really a 4gb stick. That same method that belarc uses is what the windows installer uses. If you go to the windows~bt/panther
 directory you find all the results from these scans. That is how i found that the windows 8, 10, and upgrade assistant all see the ram as 32mb regardless of actually installed ram on my system as well as others with this same problem. Im not sure if its a
 flaw in the ram, bios, or windows but they are not going to change the method of reading ram that they have successfully been using for years just because a few people have problems. If anyone else has this problem download

            Wanted to provide an update... It seems that both of the posts so far have some useful bits. First, I started down the road of playing with services and found that simply disabling the "Windows Management Instrumentation" got me past the error. As soon
 as the installer proceeded past the point where it had been failing, I immediately re-enabled the service and started it in the service manager. It upgraded without any problems. That said, it did not activate immediately. I checked the activation code and
 it had the same code as on my wife and daughter's laptops that upgraded (confirmation that one code apparently fits all on the upgrade though this is problematic if I need to do a clean install after July). Note that even though it upgraded, it has not yet
 activated (at least it had not last night and I have not checked today). I checked that error on the net and the consensus so far is that if you wait long enough it will (at least that has been the case for others with that particular problem

            A product key is not needed once the computer is registered as a Windows 10 device, so once you get it activated it will be permanently activated on the computer even if the software is removed and a different OS is put on it.

            <p>Another update on this... I left the machine online for the entire weekend and it never activated. Based on this, I must assume that the "Windows Management Instrumentation" service is being used to both check for minimum requirements AND to generate the
 new hardware key that would register my computer as being an activated computer. I completely re-installed the computer (clean install to Windows 8.1) and tried the update again. Unfortunately, it still reports that I have less than 2GB of RAM. If Microsoft
 is monitoring this list and has a suggestion (even if the suggestion is "we are working on it. Wait a few weeks"), I would greatly appreciate it. Clearly the machines runs Windows 10 just fine (quite well actually) so this is just a glitch in the prerequisite
 scan and key generation. Here's hoping for a timely resolution but for now, this particular issue remains unresolved. :-(</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is correct in making a short, single "beep" when you first start it to indicate that the Hardware in the Motherboard is working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is called POST (Power on Self Test).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally Power outages damage the Motherboard, but you say the BIOS is working correctly and also that you only get a single "beep" at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; look for your Computer's specifications &gt; find out brand of Hard Drive &gt; go to Hard Drive Manufacturer's website &gt; find and download Hard Drive Diagnostic software and make a Bootable disk from it on the Computer
 you are using to get here, following their instructions &gt; test your Hard Drive to see if it has failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And see if these Hard Drive Tools assist you.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the motherboard is damaged because it continues to beep until I get the error message. He doesn't have access to the internet, so I discounted the problem to be virus related. If the motherboard is damaged, will he lose data if I replace it?</p>

</p><p>Power outages are more likely to damage the hard drive.&nbsp; It is possible that the hard drive is damaged and if so you will have lost all data on it.&nbsp; You might be able to recover the data off the drive but this service tends to be rather expensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to check the hard drive is to attach it to another computer and see if it can be accessed on that computer.&nbsp; If the hard drive is okay then the data on it will be safe.&nbsp; This will also indicate the motherboard is the most likely cause of the
 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Are you saying that it continues to "beep"; not just that one, single "beep"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are numerous "beeps", yes, Hardware is damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can research this using your Computer that you used to get here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"beep" codes normally&nbsp;indicate a Hardware problem / failure.</p>
<p>Go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and look up your PC's specs to see what BIOS you have</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then read this about the "beep" error codes to try and see what has failed:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to ascertain the Hardware&nbsp;problem yourself, contact&nbsp;the Manufacturer&nbsp;if under Warranty.</p>
<p>If not under Warranty, find a good, local Repair Shop to take it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>____________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF the Motherboard was damaged and had to be replaced and was replaced with a different Model, in all probability the Computer would not Boot into Windows and the Operating System would have to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you have put us in the guessing stage as it that has not happened yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it becomes a Windows License problem when replacing Motherboards with different Models, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You are getting too far in front of the problem until you find out what is causing those "beep" codes.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>____________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Saving your files:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can pull the Hard Drive and put it in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure &gt; plug it into another Computer &gt; and attempt to read and copy over your Data that way.</span></p>

            <p>Hello coth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed, some desktop applications (except for the Modern Apps)&nbsp;may appear somewhat blurry or crisp sharp&nbsp;when you compare them with other applications on the screen. Also, which win32 apps are you referring to in this case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to provide an optimal experience on high-DPI displays, desktop applications have to detect the DPI of the display that is being used and then scale their graphical elements, text, and screen layout appropriately. Some applications do not implement
 this. In some cases, the application vendor may be able to provide an updated software version that better supports high-DPI displays.<br />
<br />
If there is no updated DPI-aware version of the application available, you may be able to alter the appearance of the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can disable display scaling for an individual desktop app in Windows 10. Here’s how:</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>In the search box, type the name of the app. </span></li><li><span>Select the app’s tile and tap or click Open file location to open File Explorer on the desktop.</span></li><li><span>In File Explorer, tap and hold (or right-click) the app’s executable (.exe) file and select Properties.</span></li><li><span>Select the Compatibility tab.</span></li><li><span>In the Settings section, select Disable display scaling on high DPI settings.
</span></li><li><span>Click OK and check with the results.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span></li></ul>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Write to us with the updated status and the required information related to DPI settings in Windows, for us to be able to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you please help tell me which problem I have with my laptop when this screen shows up? Initially,&nbsp;I thought it was a serious issue that I could never log in to windows, but then I figured sometimes the laptop could load windows but some other times it
 couldn't. Thus, using my laptop these days is a hit or miss. This problem has happened recently after certain Windows updates. Any advice on how to fix this permanently is most appreciated.</p>

            Hi  lushdimple,
<br />
<br />It would seem that the Windows update has corrupted your Windows Startup and your Asus System is booting into BIOS intermittently, rather than Windows . . .
<br />
<br />The next time your system boots into BIOS
<br />
<br />One the Boot menu enable Launch CSM
<br />
<br />On the Security menu disable Secure Boot Control
<br />
<br />Select Save &amp; Exit and press Yes
<br />
<br />Press the Power Button on your system for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a herd shut down
<br />
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to       
        </p>

<p>No, I didn't. It showed up right after pressing the power on button. Despite exiting and restarting the laptop, this screen is still there.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the ultimate point is to get to the Recovery Environment screen to restore the system? I could get into that point by plugging a USB loaded with a windows installation file and restarting the laptop after seeing the boot screen. Unfortunately, I've just
 figured there was no system restore point to go back to, as windows seemed to automatically turn off that function after certain updates (whilst I was pretty sure I had it turned on). So this morning I manually created a restore point. If I stumble across
 the boot screen again, I will see whether it will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I did was re-setting the windows 3 days ago and I thought this issue would be solved. But it doesn't and I thus am asking for you guys' help in this forum.</p>

            I either hit the save &amp; exit tab on the boot screen, or press the power button to turn the laptop off and on again.

<h2>            Accounting Program printing spooling problems</h2>
                    Having spooling issues when trying to print from accounting (MYOB) program, will not print to a printer, pdf nothing. Any other documents on the computer outside the MYOB program print fine.&nbsp; doesn't show an error it just spools and there is nothing there
 then disapears. Everything was working fine till updated the myob program and now have the problem. MYOB support have not been able to sort it yet either, they say it is to do&nbsp; with Windows Vista as spooling is an interagal part of windows.

<h2>            How change image on initial sign-in screen</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Edge and am finding it, shall we say, alternately annoying and challenging.&nbsp; One of the things I do NOT like in any way is the fact that with recent updates Edge/Microsoft/whoever now controls the image that appears when I first turn on my PC
 -- the screen from which you will sign on.&nbsp; How can _I_ control that image and not Edge/Microsoft?</p>

<p>VM2 - 192.168.2.0/24</p>
<p>
</p><p>Objective: As the subnets are different, I want both VMs to communicate with each other. Hoping any of you can help to achieve my objective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to your help...</p>
