<h2>            Recovering offline contacts locally from Windows Live Mail 2012</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be a simple situation, with a simple solution (I hope). Here it goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Windows XP installed with WLM 2012, and being security conscious... I've upgraded to Windows 7 with WLM 2012. Prior to my upgrade, I ran the XP version of the Migration Tool to export my user profile. Everything went off without a hitch and when I
 ran the Migration Tool to load the profile back on Windows 7, there were no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran WLM 2012 on Win7, all my accounts were intact as well as my messages (surprise)! The only issue I noticed were that my contacts did not make the migration. So, I searched around the Web and my computer for clues on which files/directories to import
 the WLM contacts back... but to no avail. I know that Windows Contacts and Windows Live Contacts are 2 different things. I also learned that I may be looking at importing *.edb files... but when I copied the same set of the directories from Windows Live Contacts,
 I do not see the contact list populated in WLM 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anywhere else I should be looking at? Where are WLM contacts stored and is there a way to retrieve them? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3522.0110)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Online/offline has nothing to do with contacts. What does matter is whether you're signed in or not.<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>I'm wondering if this is the right approach of if there's a different way.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I know of no easy way of transferring the default contacts list from Windows Live Mail 2009 other than exporting it to CSV or VCF. The complicated way is to use a third-party utility to extract data from the database. There were a number of significant changes
 to the contacts database management system between v.2009 and v.2012, so databases created in the one version will not work in the other.</p>

            <span>Hi,</span><span> </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the below questions to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Are you facing this issue after performing the check disk?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What happens when you&nbsp;double click on .chk files?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;might happen when you physically unplug the device before "Safely Removing Hardware" (actually, before the OS has finished writing cached data to the medium).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may follow the below steps and check.</span> </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Back up your existing files to an external medium. <strong>This is important!</strong>.</li><li>Launch File Explorer.</li><li>Right-click one of the folders that has files missing.</li><li>Left-click the option "Restore previous version".</li><li>You should now get a fully populated folder. If any of its files are older than the ones you backed up in Step 1, replace them.</li></ol>

            <p>To answer your questions above,&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I had my flash drive connected to my computer. &nbsp;A box came up and said I needed to repair it so I clicked ok. &nbsp;After that, my files are gibberish and a lot are missing. &nbsp;I looked online and saw were I could uncheck the "don't show hidden operating files"
 box to see if my files might still be there. &nbsp;When I did that, I found a file folder named found.000 with 262 items in it. &nbsp;They are recovered file fragments named file0000.chk, file0001.chk, etc...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing ink that has happened is when I click on some of my files, it gives me the following error message "excel cannot open the file 'March 2016.xlsx' because the file format or file extension is not valid. Verify that the file has not been corrupted
 and that the file extension matches the format of the file."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) when I click on the .chk files, the following dialogue box comes up:</p>
<p>" you are attempting to open a file if type 'System file' (.CHK)</p>
<p>These files are used by the operating system and by various programs. Editing or modifying then could damage your system."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can choose apps and the OK box is greeted &nbsp;out and I can't click on it...</p>
<p>HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>these are VERY important files that I need to get back-can you help? &nbsp;I didn't know Windows 10 had the file history option so it wasn't turned apparently. &nbsp;The whole reason I saved my files to a drive is so I wouldn't loose them... &nbsp;:(</p>

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />You could use this fix from the tenforum to reset &amp; re-register Spotlight: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset-re-register-windows-spotlight-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset...</a>
<br />There’s a bug with Spotlight since the Fall update, if you choose ‘not a fan’ it resets the background to the default photo so you have to run this fix again.

            Apparently, even the CA "techs" didn't manage to remove everything.<br />
<br />
I assume that one or more of the following is gone:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\CA<br />
C:\Program Files \CA\Shared Components<br />
C:\Program Files\CA\Shared Components\TMEngine<br />
C:\Program Files\CA\Shared Components\TMEngine\UmxEngine.exe<br />
<br />
Given that you wanted to get rid of CA Antivirus, I'd delete C:\Program Files\CA and all of its files and subfolders.<br />
<br />
Now to get rid of the reason for the Event.<br />
<br />
First, go back to Services and make a note of the "service name" of the service you found.&nbsp; This is not the same as the "friendly name" that appears in the list of services.&nbsp; As an example, if you scroll down to "Print Spooler" and open its properties, you'll
 find that "spooler" is the the "service name" for that service.&nbsp; Similarly, you'll find "Automatic Updates" in the list of services; its "service name" is wuauserv.<br />
<br />
While you have the Properties for this TM Engine service open, click the "Dependencies" tab, wait a moment or two for the system to scan, and then make sure that there is nothing listed in the bottom box:&nbsp; "The following system components depend on this service"&nbsp;
 (if there are dependent services listed, they are most likely additional remnants of CA Antivirus and need to be removed as well).<br />
<br />
Open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK)<br />
Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sc delete <span style="font-style: italic">servicenameyoufound</span> <br />
<br />
Another method is to download and install Autoruns.&nbsp; Let the scan complete and then click the Services tab.&nbsp; Find the TM Engine service, right-click and select Delete.<br />
<br />
If you use Autodelete, you should look at the Services tab (and probably also the Logon tab) for any additional instances of "file not found."&nbsp; If you find any of these, at least UNcheck the line (which will prevent Windows from attempting to locate the file)
 or delete the entry.<br />
<br />
Finally, it isn't completely clear to me that simply failing to find a third-party DLL file and thus being able to start a third-party service is enough to cause your system to crash.&nbsp; Deleting the service should eliminate the Event 7000 ... but it remains
 to be seen if it will also stop the crashes.<br />

<h2>            Cannot see other computers other than my own on the network - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So the situation is, one of my colleagues at work has upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10. They've since found that when viewing the network, they cannot see any other computers on the network nor the networked external hard drive. As such it's leaving
 his machine isolated. The other machines on the network are 3 imacs, a WD external hard drive and a Windows 8.1 machine (I'm not convinced to upgrade, especially not now..). However he now cannot see any other computers. Printers, scanners, other devices etc
 he can see fine and can also print to a wireless network. It's literally just the other machines and the external hard drive his machine can't access.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Donovan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How are you connected to the network?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are using Windows and HomeGroup option, then you will be able to see only Windows Operating system's not&nbsp;iMac systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A <strong>Home Group</strong> is a group of PCs on a home network that can share files and printers. Using a home group makes sharing easier in a same network.
</span></p>
<p><span>You can share pictures, music, videos, documents, and printers with other people in your home group.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For reference:</span></p>

            <p>On Windows 8.1 this was not an issue. Also we are NOT using Homegroups. We are looking literally through the Network tab in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine can see printers, scanners etc. It's literally just the other computers on the network that can't be seen. This issue has only come about since the update to Windows 10. I'm using a Windows 8 machine and am having no issues with this whatsoever.
 I can only assume some kind of privacy setting or similar that is a bit hidden or something similar within Windows 10's new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is great. Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Networking on Windows 10 1511 update is broken. You can access other Windows PCs&nbsp; - e.g by typing \\<em>computer name</em> into the search bar - but can't see them in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a raft of "fixes" out there but none of them work for me or many other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It' been a problems for weeks now and it's about time MS stepped up to the plate and fixed it.</p>

            We have the same problem at our church.&nbsp; Every computer that has been upgraded to Windows 10 or purchased new with Win 10 is now&nbsp;not visible under the Network folder.&nbsp; We can access them by their network path name.&nbsp; Our problem continues because in many
 cases we cannot even access shared folders on one of the network computers.&nbsp; For example, on the Sanctuary computer we share a folder in Public Documents.&nbsp; All share permissions are set to Everyone.&nbsp; When we try to access that shared folder from one of the
 other Win 10 computers we are denied and no user name and password combination works.

<p>

            <p>Atlast I have a fix! Here's what I did<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Control Panel (by clicking on the Start button and typing in Control Panel, then click the App).</p>
</li><li>
<p>I use Classic View, in which case click on "Programs and Settings". If you use the standard view, I'm afraid you need to find it yourself. Fairly easy.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the left panel, click on "Turn Windows features on or off".</p>
</li><li>
<p>If the Security dialog box appears asking for your OK, give it the OK.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The "Windows Features" dialog box appears.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Scroll down to "SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support" and tick the box. This installs the Samba support.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reboot once it finishes and you should be able to see your PCs and folders on the network. (Fingers crossed).</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If it turns out the SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support was already enabled in our case. However I can only assume that something was not setup correctly. So if the case for you guys is that this is already enabled. Disable it and apply it, it'll then prompt
 for a restart. Up to you if you want to restart then or not. I personally didn't. Once I did this I then re-ticked the box and hit the apply button again. After it had confirmed that it had been applied etc, it prompted me for a restart again. This time I
 did restart and then when viewing the network area if then loaded up all of the computers as well as the other networked devices such as printers/scanners etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found mnemonic keyboard layout in Windows 10 absolutely disastrous. To solve this, I found this site here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://winrus.com/kbd_e.htm#vers2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winrus.com/kbd_e.htm#vers2</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow instructions, the only layout that actually works in Windows 10 would be "<strong>kbdru_ZH</strong>.zip - 1st additional layout with opposite assignment for 'W' and 'V'. When you install, you will see both keyboards under "language", you will be able
 to remove mnemonic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>New Vegas is the buggiest game I have EVER played. &nbsp;And I have been gaming since the dark ages. &nbsp;I don't think I will be getting any of the DLC because frankly, I am ready for it to be over. &nbsp;It is not very often that I switch games midway through a single player campaign, but the endless amounts of resets, freezes, video and audio glitches have done me in(not to mention the recent patch issues). &nbsp;I love fallout, and I can't believe I have actually have to take a break from it just to stomach my first playthrough. &nbsp;This game should have been a 10/10, but all the unaddressed problems from #3 (and the fact that a lot of the same problems seem to be even worse than last time) make this a 7.0 at best.</p>
<p>New Vegas is leaving a bad taste in my mouth. &nbsp;I am glad I waited to get it cheap because this is not a $60 game. &nbsp;If the technical problems don't get fixed in the next fallout title, I think I am done with the franchise.</p>

            <p>Vegas is not Fallout 3. Fans should know by not that it had a different developer, hence the game as a whole was buggier. It is still Fallout, though, and it is still a quality game. I was fortunate in my playthroughs to not have any major difficulties with glitches. People don't seem to remember how buggy every single Fallout 3 dlc was when first released, when they talk about Vegas. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As for Dead Money: I bought the dlc for 400MSP, which is an absolute steal. It is pretty tough, and is not for the light of heart. I didn't mind the radios of doom, but wasn't a fan of the hologram enemies. As always in Fallout: save often.<br /><br />I will be getting the new dlc and all forthcoming dlc, as I love Fallout, and had a better time with Vegas than most, apparently. My only regret is that I didn't find the Burned man quest that the new dlc seems to stem from.</p>

<p>I liked dead money a lot. I dont see why no one likes it. The challenge in that DLC was AWESOME. I played on Very Hard, with Hardcore mode on with no HUD. Took me a little over ten hours to beat it. Had to be very stealthy and careful from the traps and stuff. Plus the limited supplies I had, made it worth it to me.</p>
<p>[/quote]That's why many people, including me, did not like Dead Money. It was so tedious that it pushed my frustration past its limit many times.</p>

            <p>i'm a big Fallout fan and i can't help but buy any and every dlc they put out. Dead Money wasn't particularly enjoyable to play but i did dig on the story and characters that were introduced. I'm hoping Honest Hearts is a big departure from Dead Money.</p>

            That is normally a "pending" charge to test if the card is active and valid. It will not be permanent charge. It is unusual to charge it 3 times, however unless you entered it 3 times or there was a problem with verification. Watch the account to see that
 the charge is dropped after a day or two. Contact your bank after that if necessary.
<div><br />
<div>It is a bad idea to use your debit card for online payments. Debit cards are not as protected as credit cards. It is better to use a credit card instead.</div>

            No, I only entered the card once. It's been 5 days since they charged me (charge date was 2014/01/10), and until now the charges have not been refunded. And yes, I should've gotten a credit card first before adding a payment option to my Microsoft Account.
 But I was in a hurry because I was beating the January 15 deadline to purchase Windows 8.1 Pro.<br />
<br />
Anyone directly from Microsoft who can help?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            That is correct.<br />
<br />
First, let's look at the Microsoft Support Engineer ideas:<br />
<br />
I would not ever follow the Microsoft Engineer suggestion in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">
Method 1</span>.&nbsp; That idea makes no sense.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Support Engineer <span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">
Method 2</span> is not going to work for you (or most people) unless you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD with the same Service Pack as your installation.&nbsp; In your case, you would need a genuine bootable XP installation CD with SP3 and most people
 do not have such an animal.&nbsp; Therefore it is extremely unlikely that will help you at all - and, if your file system is corrupted or dirty, I sure would never suggest that in the first place until your file system is straightened out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Volumes that have file system errors are known as "dirty" volumes. If a volume is dirty, it has experienced file system errors, and you must run chkdsk on the volume to repair the problem.<br />
<br />
When XP starts, it automatically checks the dirty bit on each volume (C, D, E, etc.) and if any volume is dirty, XP will automatically run chkdsk /p on the next reboot on the volume(s) to try to clear the dirty bit.&nbsp; Sometimes that will not clear the dirty
 bit or it may take multiple passes.<br />
<br />
If a volume's dirty bit is set, this indicates that the file system may be in an inconsistent state. The dirty bit can be set because the volume is online and has outstanding changes, because changes were made to the volume and the computer shutdown before
 the changes were committed to disk, or because corruption was detected on the volume. If the dirty bit is set when the computer restarts, chkdsk runs to verify the consistency of the volume.<br />
<br />
Every time you start a computer running one of the operating systems in Windows XP or the Windows Server 2003 family, autochk.exe is called by the Kernel to scan all volumes to check if the volume dirty bit is set. If the dirty bit is set, autochk performs
 an immediate chkdsk /f on that volume. Chkdsk /f verifies file system integrity and attempts to fix any problems with the volume.<br />
<br />
A simple power interruption is something that could result in a drive being marked dirty.&nbsp; Have you had a power interruption lately?<br />
<br />
You can query the dirty bit on a volume from the command prompt window.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the command prompt window.<br />
<br />
As an example, to query the dirty bit on drive D, type:<br />
<br />
fsutil dirty query D:<br />
<br />
Sample output:<br />
Volume D: is dirty<br />
Volume D: is not dirty<br />
<br />
Type 'exit' to close the command prompt window.<br />
<br />
You cannot enter any command to clear the dirty bit - only chkdsk /r or chkdsk /p can clear the dirty bit.<br />
<br />
When chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot either because XP thinks it needs to (perhaps your NTFS volume has been marked as dirty) or you choose to schedule the chkdsk with error correction on the next reboot, the results are shown in the Event Viewer Application
 log.&nbsp; You need to look there for the chkdsk log to see what happened and any problems after chkdsk has run.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for an event sourced by Winlogon, something like:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />

<br />
The dirty bit will not be cleared until chkdsk /r (or chkdsk /p) runs clean either when the system reboots (like the example) or when you run chkdsk /r from the XP Recovery Console.
<br />
<br />
Many times, the best remedy is to just run the chkdsk /r from the XP Recovery Console so you can actually see what it is doing.&nbsp; Sometimes that also seems to be the only way to clear the dirty bit and that way you can see what it is doing.<br />
<br />
Note that you also cannot query the dirty bit from the Recovery Console and you cannot clear the dirty bit by entering any command.<br />
<br />
If for some reason chkdsk will not clear the dirty, you can tell XP to just never check the dirty bit of a volume, but that will not fix your potentially failing disk drive, or it could be the drive just needs to have chkdsk run on it again (sometimes you need
 to run it more than once) or you need to be thinking about replacing the drive.<br />
<br />
If you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD, you can boot into the XP Recovery Console from that (even an SP2) CD will work and run chkdsk /r manually from there and repeat it until chkdsk /r runs clean.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD, say so and I will post instructions so you can make an XP Recovery Console CD and how to run chkdsk from there.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no XP media required.<br />
<br />
I wonder why it is that I have never see a Microsoft Support Engineer post directions on how to make a bootable&nbsp; XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required)... probably because there is no KB article for them to post.<br />

                    <p>A Microsoft support tech just hung up on me after over an hour of waiting on hold and having him stumble through his lines in broken English, and now the support desk is closed so I suppose I'll try here -_-</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to boot into Windows 10, my computer will just give me a flashing cursor (underscore?), unless I specifically choose my SSD from the bios menu. This happens regardless of what order I put it in the boot settings. I have set the partition as boot,
 and as active. And regardless of what computer I hook it up to, it will not boot unless selected by hitting F10 or whatever to get to the boot menu. I really have no clue what else to try. It seems to be a problem with Windows because it is not hardware specific,
 but I have tried reinstalling Windows 7 and upgrading to Windows 10. I'm not too sure whats wrong.</p>

<li><span>You mean to say, every time you need to make changes to Boot Order in BIOS, to start your computer correctly?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suspect that the problem might be due to outdated BIOS </span><span>update
</span><span>or </span><span>with Boot Configuration data</span><span>. Suggest you to check for the latest BIOS update and Chipset drivers for your device hardware on Manufacturer website. If you find a new one, try to update the same to see if it correct
 the issue. If problem still persist, then I suggest to rebuild Boot Configuration Data to see if it makes any difference.</span></p>

    <title>Unable to make a folder writable in Windows Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon lyles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to make a folder writable in Windows Vista </h2>
                    
<p>I am working on an Aspire 3690 Notebook with Windows Vista Home Basic Service Pack 2. I installed EasyPHP-5.3.3 to operate as the WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). And extracted CakePHP 1.3.3 into the document root which is located at c:\program files\easyphp-5.3.3\www\cakeblog\.
 The app\tmp folder and subfolders have 'read-only' attribute and I want to remove this so that I can make the folders writable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing I tried was to change the attribute from Windows Explorer. But every time I make changes here the changes don't stick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second thing I tried was to change the attribute from the command line. From c:\program files\easyphp-5.3.3\www\cakephp\app I tried the following: attrib -r +s tmp. After which I confirmed the changes as follows: attrib tmp. And it returns the folder
 path and S as the attribute. I reload the application on my browser and still get the 'folder not writable error'. When I open Windows Explorer it still has 'read-only' attribute, and from the command line it has the 'S' attribute. I also tried the following
 variations (which all appear to work on the command line but the changes never reflect on the browser or Windows Explorer):</p>

<ol>
<li>&gt;attrib -r +s tmp </li><li>&gt;attrib -r tmp </li><li>&gt;attrib -r -s tmp </li><li>and all the open with the following options appended to the end: /S and /D </li></ol>
<div>The result is always the same: browser app still considers the folders not writable; windows explorer still considers the folders not writable; and a check on the command line does not show any R attribute.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried all the above on an elevated command line. Didn't work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I tried all the above after going into the security tab of the folder properties and granted myself full control of the said folders. I tried again for both user and administrator. Didn't work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The last thing I tried was to move up to higher level and try to change those attributes thinking it might be an inheritance issue. Nothing works.</div>

            Yeah good luck with that! MS can conveniently claim XXXXX apps downloaded to fool developers in developing for Windows which is a failed platform. For example I have all of the bloatware preloaded on my laptop tied to my account. I have 'purchased' 37
 apps LOL. There's Norton Studio and McAfee Central and yet I use Webroot AV and so on...well you get the idea. The sad truth is I never purchased or even installed any apps. In fact I removed all of them other than Camera , Photos, SkyDrive and Desktop. I
 purchased Start8 to make Win 8 usable and the only reason why I have not removed these is because they can't be removed on my HP laptop and on my Lenovo laptop I removed the Store app completely! I will never add a CC# to my account and will never install
 any apps. I got a free $25 gift card with the laptop purchase (which I tried to get rid of and simply pay $25 less) and I still never used it because the whole thing is just sad. I spend about $30 each month on Google play for subscriptions and

<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Unfortunately, it’s not possible to delete the uninstalled app history from the Windows App Store. This is by design, so that in future if you wish to install any of these apps again on your computer,
 you don’t have to search for that in the whole App Store. Instead, you can just select “<strong><em>My Apps</em></strong>” from the Windows Store and then install the apps very easily.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Easily you say, with Store showing all the hundreds of apps I tried out it is now difficult than ever. This really sucks that microsoft is not giving its users any control over the store.</p>

                    <div><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)"><br />
Hello, and thank you for reading,(Hope you do!) Well, okay, So I bought a Logitech H110 Stereo Headset, about last week, for my clan on a game, we used Skype, so after I bought it, I plugged it into the front jack, and it installed and worked fine, until YESTERDAY,
 where I got home from school, plugged into my headset, and started Battlefield Play4Free but, for some odd reason, no sound would come out of the headset, so I thought it was the game, so I went to a YouTube video and There was also no sound, so then I UN
 plugged my headset and plugged it back in, and now I could hear the sound out of my speakers, so then I plugged it in again, and still didn't work, I unplugged it till the point where it would come out and, the '' Windows can now play sounds from this device''
 popped up and, I had my headset on so I heard the little Windows Sound, so then the only sound I can get, is when I unplugged it now, that wont work, so I uninstalled what I thought was my Headset, but it was my speakers,so my speakers got installed on start
 up, and I checked dxdiag and nothing was wrong with it, and I also checked and scanned for updates, via Device Manager, and nothing has worked, Please gimmie some help! I tried to troubleshoot it but windows doesn't detect it plugged it in tryed the back jacks
 also.</span></div>

            <p>Win 7. When the Logitech H110 installs, it appears as only a "High definition Audio Device" - one device appears in Playback tab, two devices appears in Recording. One of the devices in the Recording tab continues to say not plugged in and refers to the
 back panel jack. The other device refered to the front panel jack but initially the microphone wouldn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the microphone work, I uninstalled the High Definition Audio Device via [Device Manager], [Sound, video and game controllers]. Then let Windows find it again. I also, before this, disabled the device in [Control Panel] [Sound] [Recording] tab, then
 showed all devices (including disabled) and re-enabled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You shouldn't have to do it this way :) The headset should also show up as a Logitech device at minimum. Suggest software needs looking at.</p>

<h2>            Problem with auto shutting down by Task Scheduler</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I tried using the task scheduler to shut my laptop off in 12 AM because I fall asleep using it and cannot shut it manually. I read the instructions to set up the shut down and followed all the steps (Start Shutdown.exe; and even add the argument -s)
 but the laptop will not shut down. Furthermore, once I add the task, it does not pop up in the active task list and appears only after the trigger time but with a blank in the location field "\" instead of the location of the shutdown program. I tried it multiple
 times but it did not work. Ultimately, I decided to run the shutdown program myself (just dblclick the shut down button) but nothing happens. Shut down through start works fine, but on startup all my programs from the previous session resume and it seems like
 the computer was on sleep rather on shut down (It does not respond or wake up on clicking a random key though, like in the case of sleep). What can I do to fix this issue?</p>
<p>Also, can anyone tell me what the "-s" does in the argument field?</p>

    <title>Mail and Calendar app icons shrunk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techbuzzard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail and Calendar app icons shrunk</h2>
                    I found that on one of the user accounts on one&nbsp; of my computers the icons on task bar we're quit different from&nbsp; before. Smaller hard to read. Tried rolling back update, clearing icon cache, deleting and re adding user account. None of this worked. What
 does work is going into settings apps advanced and doing a reset. Icons were restored to&nbsp; normal.

<h3> bajaja007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio stopped working on Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: My Audio went silent.</p>
<p>I Tried different programs and even Fix it.&nbsp; Repair program telling me that<strong>one or more components is not working.</strong><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Well, I feel as genius - since that much I know too.&nbsp;</span></em></strong>I
 checked drivers and they are latest and telling me that they work fine. I installed Windovs 7 months ago and it was working fine.&nbsp; I instaled yesterday automaticaly two Critical windows updates and that seem to be culpricht. However, I cant restore previous
 since it listing that<strong> Restore was unsuccessful and therefore no changes.</strong> Three days ago I installed update Office 2010 Pro and there is one glitch as Word alwys freezes. However, even after upgrade sound was working. Is there in the world
 someone who can fix such problem? Help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi Bajaja007,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the exact error message that you received when you ran the Fix it tool?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 were the two critical updates that were installed on your computer after which the audio stopped working?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To check the updates that were installed, open Windows update from the control panel and click on View update history on the Windows
 Update&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 your current speakers set to the default audio output device?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to re-load the current sound drivers by following the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Steps to reload the current sound driver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>,
 type&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Start Search</strong>&nbsp;box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, expand&nbsp;<strong>Sound, video, and game controllers</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 the audio device that was included with the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the device and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the&nbsp;<strong>Driver</strong>&nbsp;tab, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Make
 sure that the&nbsp;<strong>Delete the Driver Software for this device</strong>&nbsp;check box is cleared, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong>Action</strong>&nbsp;menu, and then click<strong>&nbsp;Scan for hardware changes</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You receive a message that states that a hardware device is being installed, and then the uninstalled audio device appears in Device
 Manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Close
 the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>&nbsp;dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try some of the suggestions mentioned in the link below apart from the Fix it tool which you’ve already tried.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tips for fixing common sound problems</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Use System restore utility from Safe mode.<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If System Restore doesn't fix the problem, you can undo the restore operation or try choosing a different restore point.&nbsp;Else, you can try restoring
 to an earlier point by initiating System restore from Safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 F8 while restarting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Windows Advanced Boot Options menu, select Safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you login to Safe mode, try performing system restore to check if you’re able to restore it successfully.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong>If you perform a system restore from safe mode, you cannot undo the changes.</span></p>
