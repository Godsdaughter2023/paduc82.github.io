<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Was it playing fine earlier?<br />
2. Have you tried playing the DVD's in another computer?<br />
3. Does the issue occur on all the DVD's?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the steps mentioned below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Windows Media Player,</div>
<div>a. Click Tools &gt; Options &gt; Devices &gt; Click on DVD and select Properties.</div>
<div>b. Make sure that Playback and Rip are set to Digital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue can be caused by incompatible Codec. I suggest that you <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
remove/uninstall</a> all the installed third party Codec packs, players or video record programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Codecs frequently asked questions</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Codecs-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Codecs-frequently-asked-questions</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Another possible reason is your audio driver. If the issue persists, I suggest that you download the latest audio driver from the manufacturer's website and install it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</a></div>

    <title>Windows 7 genuine problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> milicaivanovic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 genuine problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello! This happened to me about half a year ago when I shut my PC down with a button behind it. The next time I turned on my computer a tab appeared telling me to activate my windows. The screen was black (and it still is) but without the "your copy of
 windows is not genuine" in the down right corner. I didn't pay much attention to this and continued using the computer like nothing had happened and now I regret it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't install my Windows 7 Ultimate on the computer but the store I bought it from had it installed for me. I have the original box for ASUS M2N68 PLUS Motherboard NVIDIA NFORCE 630a WINDOWS 7 Ready ( I literally wrote everything that was written on the
 box) and I also have the CD that came with the box with similar text. When I put the CD in my computer I can find folders for installing windows both 32 and 64 bit but I can not find a product key. The only thing I could find was a product ID (I assume it
 is ID) and that's all.</p>
<p>I don't want to reinstall my windows and lose all the stuff I have on this computer. I wish I could just find the key and activate windows without deleting everything.</p>
<p>Is there any other way I can activate windows, maybe using product ID? Is there any other way for fixing this?</p>
<p>When I try to go in control panel and click activate windows it says that I don't have permission to go there.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance. I apologize if I put this thread in a wrong category.</p>

            I forgot to mention that my PC was a real mess when my sister attempted to rearrange folders in Program Files. I couldn't open pictures, use internet browsers, I really couldn't do anything until I looked for the problem and found that more than half folders
 from my Program Files were packed in about 10 folders my sister made. I tried to put it all back the way it was but there are a couple more programs that couldn't be put back the way they were arranged in Program Files.

            <p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry
 tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions

                    <p>I'm trying to update my Windows 10 and at first I was getting "error code 0x80070005." Then it seemed to go beyond that and my computer was saying that there was a problem with my product key. I'm not sure why... it never asked me to enter a product key,
 either.</p>

<p>It didn't get resolved. I rarely use Skype now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to use Skype predominantly via the desktop app, but now the only way I can use it is directly online. My online account is somehow linked to a very old User ID I had; and my desktop account (which you would think would be the same) was linked to the
 current ID I was using (that Skype no longer recognizes). Every time I try to log in on my desktop, Skype no longer recognizes that User ID and tells me to fix it through Windows Live (I think that was it). Once I go there, I just end up in a loop and nothing
 ever gets resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the online version, the majority of all the contacts I had are gone. It took a while, but I was finally able to figure out how to use Skype online, but it was not simple. Turned out I had to log into Skype via Internet Explorer (doesn't seem to work on
 Google Chrome - which is odd to me). Recently, I was on someone's podcast who used Skype, and for the 1st time ever I sounded like I was in a tin can. I was using the same mic I've been using for calls and I've never sounded like that on any other platform,
 even after that one Skype call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - I don't use Skype anymore unless for some reason I absolutely have to. It would be great if this could still be resolved, but I basically just use Zoom.us now and prefer that at this point.</p>

    <title>Achievement are unlocking after factory reset, achievement before the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> de spikkelman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Achievement are unlocking after factory reset, achievement before the factory reset aren&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>So I've bought a second hand Xbox One twe&nbsp;months ago. Played some Assassin's Creed Unity and Forza Horizon 3 when a friend&nbsp;mentioned that he was getting achievements unlocked. So I look at my achievements and they weren't unlocking after I've done what was necessary to unlock them.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p>After contacting Xbox Support and looking at the forums I deleted my account from the Xbox One&nbsp;and re-downloaded it, that didn't work. After that we tried a factory reset of the console, that has actually worked. Achievements are now unlocking but the ones I've already should have gotten before all this trouble aren't unlocking. I've waited more than 72 hours after the factory reset since that's what the forums say, but the old ones just aren't unlocking. Trueachievements.com also doesn't show them as unlocked.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>In Forza Horizon 3 for example I am level 180 but the achievement for playing through the first race. isn't unlocked.&nbsp;Now are simple achievements like that not really&nbsp;a problem, those I can just replay. But there are more difficult ones I'd rather not do again since they cost a lot of time and effort.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Is there a way to get those achievement unlocked without replaying the whole thing?</p>

            <p><span>Hi
</span><span>Abdul</span><span>,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My apologies, to upload the picture and video in Skype I would suggest you to refer the following steps to share the
 photo in Skype:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Skype and sign in.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the contact to whom you wish to send a picture in Skype's left panel. The main portion of Skype changes to show your recent interactions with this contact.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the words "Send file." These are located between the area where you type messages to send to your contact and the area where these messages appear when you send them. This opens a new
 window.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Navigate to the photo you wish to send in the new window. Click the photo when you find it, then click "Open." Wait for your contact to accept the transfer. It may take a few minutes to send
 your photo.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists then I would suggest you to post the same question in Skype forums and check if it helps.</span></p>

<h3> anabana23  say:</h3>
<h2>            No usb port is working or enabled, all on its own after windows update on custom ibuypower Desktop with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My custom built ibuypower desktop PC with windows 10 does not recognize any of my USB ports (2.0, 3.0, 3.1), so then I have no access to my keyboard or tablet mouse, or anything that connects to USB. I tried connecting a regular USB mouse and it does not
 work. I tried connecting the USB mouse to a ps2 green adapter into the ps2 port, the mouse lights up like it has power but there is no cursor on the screen. The last person to use it said there were updates to be installed when he hit shutdown. I do not know
 if the updates installed properly as when I went to turn it on, I had no access to mouse, etc.
</p>
<p>I have restarted, shutdown with power button (no cursor access to use Windows)</p>
<p>No keyboard and no mouse = no control on anything in windows.</p>
<p>When I enter the bios screen, my tablet mouse with usb works to move around the options but I'm not familiar with the bios screen to see if anything is wrong.</p>
<p>I may just take it to a tech store to try to get it fixed but I wanted to reach out here just in case someone else has had this issue. I will update when I get it fixed. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>5/16/17</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Turns out the usb ports and ps2 port were disabled. Not sure how that happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a tech enable them and now they all work. They mentioned that the device manager said they were disabled. But how did that happen by itself?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>6/25/17</p>
<p>I had another windows update download. It asked to restart the computer so I did. When windows came on, the usb ports were not working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening again? How do I enable the ports in the uefi bios menu? When I look at the menu where it lists usb ports, they all say enable.</p>
<p>What can I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of manually installing or not installing windows updates on windows 10, like how we had more control in windows 7? I feel like I keep running into issues after updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            It's possible that the issue is caused by an outdated driver. We suggest that you install the latest driver for your chipset which is responsible for the computer's communication with the USB ports. Since your computer is a custom build, you may need to
 install the driver that is applicable to your device. You may download the updated driver from your hardware manufacturer's website or ask assistance from their support team for advanced assistance regarding your concern.<br />

            <p>If you push and hold&nbsp;the power button while the windows logo is on the screen the device will power off. (forced power off) Power on again and then repeat until power off. On the third attempt windows should go into repair/troubleshooting if it does then
 you have some options. In Troubleshooting select Advanced. So try that if you can. See if you can use System Restore. Start-up Settings should also give you an option for Safemode.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for reporting this, and sorry for the problem. This may be an error that we already fixed, and is only affecting older versions of the game. Can you please check to see if there is an update for your version of the game? Here's how:</p>
<p>Go to the Windows 8 start screen by pressing the windows key on your keyboard, or pressing the windows button on your tablet.
</p>
<p>Tap the green Store tile. If you can't find it, you can type the word "Store" on your keyboard to bring it up.
</p>
<p>In the Store, tap the green text in the upper-right corner that says "Updates". This appears whenever any of your apps have updates available. If you don't see it there, all of your apps (including this one) are already up-to-date.
</p>
<p>On the App updates screen, tap "install" at the bottom to install all of your available updates. If the game appears in the list, then there is an update for the game available, and you'll need to tap this game's update listing to get it.</p>
<p>We also have an update planned for late March/early April to address some new issues, so keep an eye out for that update too. Thanks for playing!

<h2>            Does MSN Explorer exist for Win7&#63; Have new computer and wish to migrate old email from MSN Explorer mail accounts</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a new computer with Win7. I used MSN Explorer on my older system, and have much saved email I would like to transfer. I cannot find any way to download/install MSN Explorer on my new computer, though I see some mentions of it on microsoft
 site. Does it exist still? Is there another email program that would allow me to set up local (on my computer) mail folders and migrate my old emails? I do not wish to have all old email stored online.</p>
<p>Thanks for any responses</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Feedback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bjd75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Feedback</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to give some feedback on my experience with Windows 8 in general:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background on my relationship with Windows: I have been using Windows since 3.1. I have been Microsoft's first/ best customer- basically I'm the one lined up the first day a new OS comes out ready to purchase it. It did it with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
 XP and Windows 7. Windows XP was the best thing Microsoft offered very honestly. Intuitive and quick.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed Windows 8 Consumer Preview and it was such a complete fail that I had to uninstall it. I should have given Microsoft feedback then but I just didn't. I thought surely you guys would fix glaring issues. You did not. I bought Windows 8 because
 of the extremely cheap upgrade price- otherwise I would not have done it (I also thought that some things would be fixed but nope- they were not). I am writing this now because I know 8.1 is coming&nbsp; out and I want to make sure you are looking at all the things
 that need to be fixed. I told many people after the Consumer Preview came out that 8 would be a complete train wreck/ fail and I see it is from all the reviews and crashing PC sales. When you have Jay Leno on the Tonight Show making fun of it- it is not good.
 The PC industry relies on Microsoft as well to get it right- you guys have let them down. I just don't see how you got it so wrong guys. You have done a&nbsp;great job for a very long time. Someone needs to be fired at Microsoft for letting the current version
 out. I'm very serious about that. You don't see this kind of fail at Apple. Someone is just not paying attention and you guys need to figure out what needs to be fixed to make sure it does not happen again. Didn't you do testing with business users and consumers?
 The current iteration says you did not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issues needing to be fixed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Add the Start button back and don't just have it link to the "Start" page. You need to have it in the same form as previous versions where there is a program list and access to all the different things that users used to have access to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Boot to Desktop. I have a desktop and do not want to use the "Start" page. I spend 99% of my time in Desktop mode. Or change the Start page so I WANT to use it. In it's current form I hate it. If you guys had the Start screen experience right I in theory
 wouldn't have to use my Desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Shut down. This is the biggest fail I have ever seen in the history of history. Seriously guys- I had to Google to find out how to turn off my PC. Complete Fail. You can either add this to the Start menu like before or add something to the corner of the
 desktop. Just do something. You should never have this hidden under 4 steps. The current way is so unintuitive and I'm sure it is a very serious "turn off" to users. Fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) The Charm bar on the side of my PC is hard to access. I have a Dell touchscreen for my desktop and I have to continually swipe to try to get it to come up. Fail. I always end up using my mouse to access this. And I HATE having to position my cursor just
 right to access it. So completely a fail. I'd prefer the charm feature to just die to be very honest and be replaced by the start button where it used to be. There is no value add to having it. I need to be able to quickly and intuitively access my information.
 The charm bar is neither of these. You shouldn't have to think about where to go to in the charm area for something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Bring back the old way to Search in the Start menu. The current way is the ultimate in frustration. Some of the ways you have to do a search for certain things that are now hidden in Windows 8 that were not hidden in Windows 7 is crazy. I've even had
 a Microsoft support person say this. You guys have made something so easy much more difficult and unintuitive. Having to actually type in a search term to find certain parts of Windows: FAIL! There should be a case study written about that on what not to do
 in an OS. Mind boggling to the max. I don't even know what to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Left side bar in the Start&nbsp;Page view to bring up program list. I'm speechless on this one. It is so ridiculous the way it is now I don't even know where to begin. Mind boggling complete full FAIL. Having to scroll to the corner&nbsp;in a very small space (itself
 very unintuitive)- the go over a little and then go down? And if you mess up with how you move your cursor you have to start over because everything collapses. And you can't access it by touch on a desktop- you have to use your mouse cursor because the activation
 area is so far in the corner. Really? LOL guys. Who designed this craziness? This is not intuitive! The pics are so small I sometimes can't even see what I need to choose. I just don't know what to say. You went from having clear program icons at the bottom
 of the screen to quickly and easily go from program to program to this. No. I don't know how you need to change this but it needs to change. There needs to be a static element and there needs to be clear icons for the program choices. I am telling you Microsoft-
 if this is not changed you will lose your customers. No one wants to deal with the current way of doing this. It is a complete FAIL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More on this: You have to navigate this ridiculous setup to try and close things running in the background. So unintuitive. And frustrating to the max. I have to find my app then right click and click close? LOL. No. Go to the corner. X out. Done. This x
 out&nbsp;feature has to be brought back and integrated into the apps. It HAS to be. This is what makes Windows (the old Windows) so great. And you guys killed it with 8! :( I feel like I'm trapped when I open an app- and therefore I use the apps MUCH less. I'm
 in the Internet Explorer App. I need Excel. I have to: click on the bottom left corner to bring up the start menu- click desktop and find Excel. I could do it through the Start menu but it is so busy that it's hard to find things quickly like I can on my desktop.
 Now I need to go back to IE. Top corner- over- down- squint to find IE. click. Ugg! What did ya'll do? No! So frustrating - so not Microsoft. You have to design the interface so everything flows. You should not have to even think. I need to be able to click
 back and forth quickly between apps. Or use touch. Windows 8 is supposed to be about touch and the current setup is so crazy horrible I can't use it like it has the potential to be used. Please put some thought into how to better do this. You guys could really
 make this great if you wanted to and even make it better than Apple. There needs to be some serious thinking being done. Keywords: Quick. Intuitive. You do this for your customers and you have them as loyal customers like you did with me and every other version
 of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Touch- somehow things in your programs need to be more touch friendly. I don't want to have to touch the edges of my screen. Could you design something where a quick double touch anywhere on the screen&nbsp;brings up an open&nbsp;program list to toggle between
 programs? I just feel totally out of control with Windows 8. Put the user back in control. Larger touch friendly buttons? Everything is designed for a mouse clicker. Change this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8) IE app- I really hate this app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) App stability: Horrible. This needs to improve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) The current way on the app screen to have to right click (somewhere in the "grey" area? Really?) to bring up a bar at the bottom then click on something again to control it is so unintuitive. This is one of the worst features of Windows 8. I think whoever
 designed this particular thing should not have a job at Microsoft. I don't know how to improve this but it needs to be improved. You have to think here. FAIL. It is your job to come up with an intuitive interface so the customer can quickly get to things and
 feel confident and in control. That is why Microsoft has been successful in the past. You have previously done a great job for your customers. I just feel lost- even after using the system for awhile. Make things easier. You guys really need to put a lot of
 thought into this interface. Make&nbsp;it simple! The process to add a program as an app to the start screen is ridiculous. If you have to add a couple floating buttons to the Start screen- do it. Maybe "add an app to the start screen". This would make the user
 feel in control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good things: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System stability. </p>
<p>Apps: I think Microsoft has a win with the app approach. It just needs to be tweaked so that I want to use it. Allow me to group types of apps into folders of some sort maybe. I don't want to have to think when I go to access stuff. Right now I have to scan
 a wall of apps. It's too much. And again- allow me to x out of an app. Allow me to quickly switch between apps in an easier way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line: Make it more intuitive. Make the user feel like they are IN CONTROL. Make me want to LOVE to use it- not research how to use every element. There is clear feedback users hate to use Windows 8.&nbsp;You do this and you have a WIN. This is what Microsoft
 is guys- ya'll can do it. I love Microsoft because of your open nature unlike Apple. Make me WANT to buy your product. Take out all these unintuitive and frustrating roadblocks you've put into Windows 8. You guys have the chance to be the best with the touch
 interface. DO IT! And advertise how you have changed. Damage has been done but you can turn it around. This is the only OS you have come out with that I've told friends and family NOT to buy in it's current iteration. Give me reasons to change my mind and
 recommend it.</p>

            I agree 100% with everything here. How could Microsoft possibly think that Windows 8 was a good idea? It's clearly designed for touchscreen tablets; fine, keep it specific to them. Whoever decided to foist it upon high spec laptops and force people who
 have been using previous versions of Windows for up to ten years is just incomprehensibly stupid. Have they not used a computer before? People that use real computers do not need massive square push button apps to use their laptops, it's like forcing a desktop
 to use Ice Cream Sandwich; it's ridiculous. I realise that Microsoft have made Windows 8 incredibly hard to uninstall, but I'll find a way, and I'll burn the Windows 8 OS onto a disc, and I'll burn it in effigy. Down with Windows 8! It's the New Coke of the
 21st Century! Admit it and give us our 7 back! Or at least give people the option to choose their OS, for Christ's sake, is that too much to ask? If you have to force a product on people, to nigh universal disdain, maybe consider a backs

            <p>I tried the upgrade from Window 7 Home Premium ( 32 bit ) to Windows 8 Pro.&nbsp; I was given a key to the Windows Media Center and the download seemed to go nicely.&nbsp; After the installation, I discovered that I could not access my POP mail accounts or some of
 the features I had with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The very worst was that Windows 8 would wake my system from " sleep mode " and despite attempts from Microsoft Windows Technical support, the problem was never resolved.&nbsp; Windows 8 finally " crashed and burned" 31 days after it's install.&nbsp; Despite efforts
 to re-install, I finally decided to re-install Windows 7 Home Premium which I am complete satisfied with.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now use a Mac system and could not be happier.&nbsp; I do use my Windows 7 system occasionally because of some of the features but am truly a Mac &amp; Apple person now.</p>

<div>I just wanted to add my support to the feedback in this thread...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
What a fantastic summary of the dogs dinner that is windows 8. I am so frustrated I am simply unable to to feedback without a torrent of expletives!
<div><br />
<div>I have resisted buying a new machine, knowing the general consensus of the tech community regarding W8... Forced into buying a new laptop.. I purchased a new Dell i5 laptop that stated both W7 and 8 in the description... unfortunately this turned out to
 be an error... only W8.... Oh S H * T.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Offered a refund (What a nice retailer!), Had to decline, as new hardware is a business necessity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>3 days after delivery.... I am ready to throw the fookin thing out of the window....</div>
<div><br />
<div>To sack the individual responsible for this release is way too lenient... A long slow painful death over a period of a least 12 months would be approaching justice.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Release 8.1 - &nbsp;Like putting a temporary patch on the side of titanic! If Microsoft have has any hope of maintaining it's desktop market share then W 9 needs to make an appearance way before the current 2015 scheduled realease.</div>
<div><br />

I'm really unimpressed with Windows 8, which I was told to upgrade to Windows 8.1.   I could not connect with our (Windows) server, which I paid a lot of money for.   I was told I had to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro.  So I called in our expensive team to do that for me.   They took a lot of (expensive) time to work out that I had to downgrade back to Windows 8, move to Windows 8 Pro and then upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro.   WTF!!!!????   GOOD MORNING MICROSOFT!?   



CAN MICROSOFT PLEASE GET SOME NORMAL PEOPLE WORKING FOR THEM? 



I do not have days on end to spare for **** that is supposed to work,  nor a bottomless pit of cash for the alleged experts.    



I COUL DEVELOP A BETTER SYSTEM THAN MICROSOFT HAVE, GIVEN TIME, AND THEY ARE TEMPTING ME.

This is the worst system Microsoft has come out with!!! It sucks horrifically!!!  They twisted a common operating system, known by billions into a jacked up, hard to navigate piece of **** that older Americans who already have a hard enough time using computers will just give up!  Really!!!  Does Microsoft just have to put out something every few years to make an income and keep the world in confused? 



Just improve on what we all know and quit with the bullshit!

            <p>I have never been so disappointed in an operating system.&nbsp; This is my 2nd post on the subject.&nbsp; I recently purchased 2 HP All-In-Ones for a business.&nbsp; I could not believe how difficult it became to setup and install Windows 8 Pro.&nbsp; I finally contacted the
 place of purchase who took the two HP systems back and gave me a full refund.&nbsp; Even after reading the Windows 8 printed manual, I found it difficult to do things like set a default home page in IE 11.&nbsp; Don't even get me started on the network connection issues
 I encountered with the local cable company :-(&nbsp; !!!&nbsp; I was able to get the place of purchase to exchange the HP units for 2 Mac systems which set up in minutes.&nbsp; I use both a Mac and a Dell XPS running Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; Win 7 works just fine on my desktop but
 the upgrade was an absolute disaster !!&nbsp; ( I had to uninstall Win 8 ).&nbsp; This summer I have to help decide on new computers for our school system - won't be recommending Windows 8 for sure.</p>

            <p>So glad I was able to try Windows 8 Pro first as an upgrade to Win 7.&nbsp; After about&nbsp;30 days of all sorts of problems I did uninstall it and Microsoft did give me a refund.&nbsp; The whole experience was a nightmare in-so-far as using my computer.&nbsp; I have set up
 a few systems with Win 8 and none have been smooth, always some issue.&nbsp; This is worse than " Vista Revisited "</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen stop error 0x000000BE on loading Windows XP</h2>
                    <p><span>BSOD stop error 0x000000BE on loading Windows XP</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can't load Windows XP in normal or safe mode ...&nbsp;I keep getting the following BSOD / GSOD (green) error: "An attempt was made to write to read-only memory" with Stop&nbsp;error 0x000000BE (0x806FE800,0x006FE121,0xF78AE784,0x0000000B) at the Windows XP
 start-up screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Over the last few days I cleaned a few viruses (maybe&nbsp;1 or 2&nbsp;rootkits)&nbsp;off my computer using Spybot S&amp;D, Super AntiSpyware, MalwareBytes, AntiVir, CWShredder, HiJackThis, several other&nbsp;online anti-virus/malware scanning engines and then cleaned the
 leftover temp files and registry keys using CCleaner and RegistryBooster.&nbsp; Throughout the process, I made several registry backups using ERUNT.&nbsp; Windows XP did not have any noticeable&nbsp;problems loading throughout all this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Last night, I installed DataPilot software by Susteen (used to backup data from cell phones).&nbsp; This software installs over 300 registry entries along with numerous [unsigned] cell phone drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The installation seemed to go well and Windows XP loaded up fine 2-3 times after the initial install.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I booted up the&nbsp;computer this morning,&nbsp;I received the&nbsp;BSOD error.<span>&nbsp;</span>The BSOD screen was actually greenish colored (GSOD) instead of the normal blue color.<span>&nbsp;</span>I have tried all of the following but still receive the BSOD error:
 I disconnected all USB devices&nbsp;and rebooted; I used some compressed air to clean out the case; I reseated the RAM; I de-/re-attached the hard drives; I tried “last known good configuration”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I try “Safe Mode”, “Safe Mode with Networking” or “Safe Mode with Command Prompt I notice that all drivers load up to a question asking “Press enter to continue loading SPTD.sys” … whether I press enter or not, I still get the BSOD.<span>&nbsp;</span>(I
 noticed that SPTD is related to Daemon tools.<span>&nbsp; </span>I uninstalled Daemon tools last week and didn’t notice any problems at that time.<span>&nbsp;</span>I guess SPTD may still be trying to load.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Disabling the “SPTD” service via the Recovery Console did not affect the BSOD error.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A few other things I tried, of no help …</span></p>
<p><span>I tried restoring a previous “good” registry via ERUNT … no effect</span></p>
<p><span>From the Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD), I ran the following:</span></p>
<p><span>... Memtest86+ … no faults detected after 16 cycles</span></p>
<p><span>... Windows Memory Diagnostics … no faults detected after 6 cycles</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can’t use restore points because I stopped those during the virus removal steps (they contained some viruses).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I just burned a UBCD4Win DVD to look for faulty registry entries.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I read that I can use NirSoft's BlueScreenView to read the minidumps to look for problematic drivers.<span>&nbsp;</span>The BSOD screen is not showing that it is saving minidumps nor could I find any recent minidumps in the “C:\Windows\minidump” directory.<span>&nbsp;</span>So,
 how do I access the minidumps (if they are being produced) when I can’t load Windows XP?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem is related to bad drivers and/or registry entries made by DataPilot, how can I identify and remove those without being logged in to Windows XP?

            I just found this post again and wanted to follow-up in case anyone else has similar problems.&nbsp; It took me almost 2 weeks to resolve it and I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the registry.<br />
<br />
Aside from using many additional websites, I pretty much used various versions of the methods described here ...
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to recover from a corrupted registry that prevents Windows XP from starting</a><br />
<a href="http://www.aitechsolutions.net/winxpnoboot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XP won't boot? - Performing a manual restore of the Windows XP registry</a><br />
<a href="http://www.aade.com/XPhint/XPrecovery.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Recover from a Corrupted Registry that Prevents Windows XP from Starting</a><br />
<br />
I also used various Boot CDs (like <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UBCD</a>,
<a href="http://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hiren</a>'s, <a href="http://www.ubcd4win.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>UBCD4Win</span></a>) rather than the Recover Console to manually copy and fix registry settings that wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
<br />
I learned my lesson -- now I use <a href="http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ERUNT</a> -- crashes don't scare me and only take a few minutes to recover.&nbsp; ERUNT has saved me at least 4 times since my original post.&nbsp; ERUNT is also working well for me on Win7.<br />

<h2>            everything on the computer screen is suddenly huge</h2>
                    <p>So everything on my computer screen was normal and then all of a sudden, the display just changes. This includes the icons, taskbar, apps and the cursor. I've researched this problem online but none of it seems to work. I've tried changing the scale and
 maximising the resolution to 1280x1024 but it still looks too big. I have reset my entire PC and it worked for about 5 minutes, and then it just changed to the enlarged state again. My guess is that I need to increase the resolution to one that is larger than
 1280x1024, but I can't find any options that allow me to do that since that is the largest one.</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
One of the possible reasons why this issue occurs is due to a corrupted or outdated display driver. We'd like to know a few things so we can better address your concern. Please clarify the following:</p>

<h2>            BSOD after installing Auzentech X-Meridian sound card driver.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: BSOD on new system</p>
<p>
</p><p>HI I have just built a new system with Windows 7 Professional and when trying to install my Auzentech X-Meridian sound card driver I got a blue screen. I have tried installing it from the cd supplied with it and also from downloaded drivers and it has the
 same result. I currently have the card installed in another system which is running Windows 7 Home Premium and it is working fine but as soon as&nbsp;it starts to install the Cmedia Oxygen HD&nbsp;Audio Configuration software on the new system it blue screens and restarts.
 Can someone please help with this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

    <title>very poor connection to Thai mobile numbers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            very poor connection to Thai mobile numbers</h2>
                    <p>For several months now, when I try to call Thai phone numbers, I get the message that the number is unavailable, even before the number rings. This may happen several times in a row (7 just a few minutes ago) but finally the call will go through and the
 Thai number will ring. Then, usually, a Poor Network Connection message will show up, in spite of the fact that my connection is &gt;500Mbps down and almost 300Mbps up. This happens on the desktop (4 different computers tried), mobile (three different phones),
 and web versions of Skype using both direct and VPN connections. In fact, calls to Laos and Malaysia connect with no problems, so this difficulty seems to be Thailand-specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, an alternative internet phone service connects first time, quickly, every time, no network problems at all are ever evident, both from the desktop and from mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me the only possible conclusion is that the difficulty is within the Skype network itself, and is very disappointing, since it's a long time to my future non-renewal of my annual subscription. But I can hope that there something that can be done.</p>
