<h2>            Points Crusader Offer on Xbox App Dashboard won&#8217;t claim&#63;</h2>
                    This offer wont claim via Microsoft Rewards App on Xbox One. I tried to claim the offer via the offer by clicking it then click continue then a Green Box appears which if i click B twice both checkmarks disappear and still does not reward me with a checkmark
 for that offer. How do i resolve this?

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. First, let's download the Microsoft Windows Installer Cleanup Tool. <br />
Anyway, here's the link to download: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe</a></div>
<div><br />
Once it is installed, you'll see it listed under "All Programs" on the start menu. Run the tool and you'll see these software listed in there. Click on it and tell it to remove it. That will completely remove and clean up everything.</div>
<div>Once that is complete, go ahead and reboot the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Windows Installer manages how other programs are installed and uninstalled on your computer. Software publishers can use Windows Installer to help make the installation or uninstallation process more consistent from one program to another.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;These are some of the steps which will help the windows installer to work without any error&nbsp;<br />
1) Check if the Windows installer service is started<br />
Click start-&gt;type in services.msc and hit enter-&gt; check for windows installer-&gt;start the service if it’s stopped<br />
2) If Windows Installer does not work correctly, open Problem Reports and Solutions to see if a solution is available.<br />
Open Problem Reports and Solutions by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking&nbsp; System and Maintenance, and then clicking Problem Reports and Solution<br />
3) Unregister Windows Installer, and then reregister Windows Installer. To do this, follow these steps:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. On the "Start" menu, click "Run:.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /unreg", and then press ENTER. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. On the "Start" menu, click "Run". <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /regserver", and then press ENTER.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Because the partition layout has changed since you created that system image, you would not be able to restore it to a different partition. You would receive and error message indicating that its not the same.

 constantly, I'm sure you can see my concern. My security software was deleted as well; Is there a Free Trusted Downloadable Virus/spyware program available? Somone who know what&nbsp;I am talking about..<br />

            Your computer is infected. You need to either go through very thorough removal steps to clean it up or do a clean install of Windows.<br />
<br />
Go through these general malware removal steps systematically - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
Include scanning with David Lipman's Multi_AV and follow instructions to do all scans in Safe Mode. Please see the special Notes regarding using Multi_AV in Vista.<br />

<br />
When all else fails, get guided help. Choose one of the specialty forums listed at the first link. Register and read its posting FAQ. PLEASE DO NOT POST LOGS IN THE MS FORUMS.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).&nbsp;Please be aware that not all local shops are
 skilled at removing malware and even if they are, your computer may be so infested that Windows will need to be clean-installed. If possible, have all your data backed up before you take the machine into a shop.

<h2>            Suddenly can&#39;t Copy &#38; Paste images into hotmail</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For years, I have been able to simply go to Google, Bing, etc.&gt; Images then right click on any image, Copy, then go into Hotmail, right click &gt;Paste, &amp; the image appears. But yesterday, it suddenly stopped. I can right click&gt;Copy, then right click&gt;Paste,
 but nothing happens. I think it's interesting the Paste icon is indeed available for clicking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Win7 HP thru Google Chrome</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have not added any soft/hardware; what could be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks &nbsp;for any/all !</p>

None of this helps because the screen and mouse are completely unresponsive. It is a grey screen and nothing else. Please help. Thank you. This regards a Surface 2.&nbsp;

<h2>            Your Tiscali account settings are out of date - Fix Account</h2>
                    I cannot sync an email account on my Windows Live 2011 with the new Windows 10 Mail, the email is @tiscali and when I click 'Fix Account' on Windows 10 Mail it lists my email address in one field and then requires a password in the other field, what password
 is this? I have changed my password in the settings in Windows Live 2011 for that email account and then gone into Windows 10 Mail and then typed in that same password as used in Windows Live 2011 but it won't take the password. I have successfully synced
 my Hotmail Account and Yahoo Account in Windows 10 Mail but not this Tiscali Account, which is an old ISP company email address BTW, but still works as an email address.

    <title>Shearpoint word wall and dragon priest glitch&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vcovalon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shearpoint word wall and dragon priest glitch&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there everyone,</p>
<p>I've noticed over my months of playing Skyrim, that my game has become more and more glitchy over time, despite the disc being in perfect condition. The glitch which is causing me the most problem at the moment, is that at Shearpoint, a location of the various
 dragon priests, the dragon priest is in fact not showing up.</p>
<p>Now, when going over everything, I've noticed some things, I already have the word from the word wall, in fact I have all 3 for the "Throw Voice" Shout, Shearpoint being a location of one of the words. When I approach the wall, I get the chanting, the odd
 scratching, windy sound, despite the fact I have the word&nbsp;As for the dragon priest, I can only assume he came out the first time I got there, but as to his location now, I'm lost. His coffin is shut, that's the main thing confusing me.</p>
<p>I'd head back over to an older save, but it's been so long since I last went there I would hate to lose my progress.</p>
<p>Just in case people are unaware of which dragon priest, the one located at Shearpoint is Krosis. As for the game itself, it's the standard game, no DLC has been added on, simply the patches that bethesda release.</p>
<p>So yeah, there's my issue, if someone happens to know what i could possibly do to resolve this, I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Valon</p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span>Recently, there have been a rash of Windows 7&nbsp;product keys purchased from auction sites showing up here as non-genuine.&nbsp; They appear to be connected to this HROnline code HrOnline: 0xC004C4A2. If you purchased
 a key from&nbsp;an auction web site (such as eBay),&nbsp;please realize that the seller may have sold that product key to multiple people resulting in that key becoming blacklisted. These keys were never meant for resale; they were meant for software development or
 evaluation depending on the program they were obtained through. If you purchased one of these keys and it has become non-genuine with the above code, you may need purchase a new license for Windows 7. Attempt to validate by going to the link below and follow
 the links provided to repair windows.</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/geniune" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/geniune</span></a><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Added note. You only have a limited amount of time (45 days I believe) to file a claim with the auction sites. Stay away from these keys, if you purchased a key that has turned non-genuine and are within
 the 45 days of purchase file a claim. There are legitimate software vendors on auction sites but if it sounds to good to be true then don't buy it.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>EDIT: Additional information</span></p>
<p>
<span>Things to watch out for.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Lately, there have been several reports of&nbsp;instances of blocked MSDN Subscription product&nbsp;keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media&nbsp;and reciepts,
 if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased it from and report it to
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/piracy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/piracy</span></a></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you have purchased a product key, with or without DVD's or packaging from&nbsp;an auction web site (such as eBay) or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN Subscritpion product&nbsp;key because
 your key has been blocked, you can check a few things yourself.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you received your key with the physical product go to the link below and verify your product.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>To check your PID press the Win Key and pause at the same time, or open System Properties&nbsp;through the Control Panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID. It
 will look something like this: 12345-XXX-1234567-54321.&nbsp; The portion you are interested in is the XXX section.&nbsp; If it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have a "not-for-resale" MSDN Subscription product&nbsp;key.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Suspect: 065, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
066</span>, 067,&nbsp;068&nbsp;for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 7 Ultimate edition</span>, 220 area for Professional, and the 230, 231 area for Home Premium.&nbsp; There are probably others but they should be close to those posted.</span></p>

<div>It is best if you tell us you own a&nbsp;subscription&nbsp;when you post. Many falsely say they got it from MSDN or Technet. You can't buy a retail dvd's or keys from them. You buy a subscription in order to get them.</div>

<p>If you have downloaded the game and already bought it then yes, you can delete it and download it again. I've done this plenty of times with my avatar items and worked, even with games like Fruit Ninja. I've in the past erased the 1st downloads and it still
 worked for me. So, for me it worked and should work for you to as well. In Conclusion, I hope I've helped you and good luck.

<p>Have you done a license transfer to console 2? If not, was your profile signed into xbox LIVE on console 2? As I understand it, if you purchased the game on the 1st xbox then went to play it on the 2nd, you would need to have your profile on console 2 connected
 to LIVE in order to access the content due to the licensing - unless you do a license transfer to the 2nd (in which case, your profile would need to be connected to LIVE on the 1st one to play it on that console).</p>

<p>My forza horizon isnt working either. Tried everything through out the forums. Still not playing and says disc unreadable after the controller buttons screen pops up. Its been 2 days. Now i think i just want my money back. I always buy games on demand and
 this has never happened. Im very disappointed. $39.99 - Forza Horizon.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;pro 64bit build build &#35;15063.296&#41; Windows Shell Common.dll crash when trying to adjust game controllers</h2>
                    <p>As of late when I try to access the properties page for a game controller Windows shell common.dll is crashing, it recovers eventually but this is causing issues with a game Assetto Corsa. it seems when Windows Shell Common is crashing I cannot configure
 any controls within Assetto Corsa making the thing effectively useless to me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The below link is actually very similar to my issue but this "USBJOYSTICK.cpl/USBJOY.cpl" file doesn't seem to exist within windows 10, at least not for me. So I can't try this fix.<br />

I have included a photo below to show what imrefering&nbsp;too as well.&nbsp;</p>

Driver reinstallation/repair/updating along with firmware updating on my wheel did not fix the problem so I am at an impass of what else I can do at this point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to effectively give you a resolution, can you confirm if you have any pending updates for Windows 10? Also, in most cases, drivers for any device should be fully compatible with Windows 10 for that to function properly. We would suggest in contacting
 the manufacturer for the device to get the specific drivers fully compatible with Windows 10. Meanwhile, you can refer to the post of David Galbraith from this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-gaming/windows-shell-common-dll-has-stopped-working-while/a348fcc5-7b22-42d1-ac4a-c8c945e4e1a4">
thread</a> as a reference for a possible resolution on your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with the results and if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to post back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>The device is fully compatible, it has windows 10 64 bit drivers, This isn't&nbsp;just something that the wheel is experiencing its where the biggest issues are being caused but when the xbox&nbsp;one controller is the only thing windows considers a game controller
 is connected I get similar hanging.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As I mentioned I did try that fix but I cant progress beyond "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">%windir%\SysWOW64 ,take a copy of USBJOYSTICK.cpl (or similar name, im not sure if is USBJOYSTICK.cpl or USBJOY.cpl...anyway is easy to find
 it)"<br />
<br />
</span>As far as I can tell these files do not exist on my machine.&nbsp;<br />

So unless I'm looking in the wrong area I dunno what else to do...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kindly attach the screenshot of the properties page that you're referring to that when you try to access it the game is having issues. Also, Can you confirm if you have tried to uninstall and reinstall the game together with the device as well? And have
 you tried creating a new profile for your computer to further isolate the issue?</p>

            It's been too long I can't recall any specific things I changed with the machine, and even if I did this is a very specific thing that comes up the issue could have been lingering for a while and it not come up.<br />

Things I tried: Rebooting, reformating, repairing driver, uninstalling and reinstalling driver with registry cleaner, upgrading driver and firmware of device with registry cleaner, find out if other controllers are affected which they are, try installing old
 USB device drivers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That's all I can really think of of the top of my head.&nbsp;<br />

<p><br />
1) Hold down the Windows key and press “R” to bring up the Run dialog box.<br />
In the "Open" box, type:&nbsp; netsh winsock reset&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p><br />
2) Hold down the Windows key and press “R” to bring up the Run dialog box.<br />
In the "Open" box, type:&nbsp; netsh int ip reset&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p><br />
3) Hold down the Windows key and press “R” to bring up the Run dialog box.<br />
In the "Open" box, type:&nbsp; ipconfig /release&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p><br />
4) Hold down the Windows key and press “R” to bring up the Run dialog box.<br />
In the "Open" box, type:&nbsp; ipconfig /renew&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p><br />
5) Hold down the Windows key and press “R” to bring up the Run dialog box.<br />
In the "Open" box, type:&nbsp; ipconfig /flushdns&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the 'Enter' key.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 1803 &#124; Sound distortions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1803 &#124; Sound distortions</h2>
                    <p><span>Dear all,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since Windows 10 update 1803 my system generates huge sound distortions in several applications (e. g. foobar2000, ZSNES, ...). It's 100% reproducible. The problem was introduced with the 1803 release, and I am definitely not the only one. Many people,
 with different sound cards and systems, are reporting similar problems in different community boards.<br />
I am an IT Specialist and would like to address this issue here and help fixing/testing possible solutions. Together with different communities we already can provide more information (see below).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My system setup:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I use a Creative Soundblaster X-Fi Fatality Pro sound card, with latest available driver.</span></li><li><span>I have already tried a clean reinstallation of Windows 10 1803. </span>
<span>Same problem.</span></li><li><span>When I go back to Windows 10 1709 everything is ok.</span></li><li><span>e. g. The problem is present with foobar2000 1.3.19 and the newest ZSNES emulator, but when running a simple application that forces the system timer to run at higher accuracy, the sound is fine. In my case, it seems even enough to have VLC (VideoLAN)
<span>Same problem.</span></li><li><span>When I go back to Windows 10 1709 everything is ok.</span></li><li><span>e. g. The problem is present with foobar2000 1.3.19 and the newest ZSNES emulator, but when running a simple application that forces the system timer to run at higher accuracy, the sound is fine. In my case, it seems even enough to have VLC (VideoLAN)
 opened at the same moment; the sound distortion is immediately gone in those applications.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Important:</span></p>
<p><span>In the forum of foobar2000 we already found out that the system timer frequency "behaviour" (hopefully you get an idea what is wrong) was changed with 1803. Please refer to this thread: https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,115963.new.html</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you very much for your support. Please take this problem serious.</span></p>
<p><span>I am very happy to provide any help needed. Something must have changed with 1803, which causes these strange sound distortions. Since I am able to reproduce the problem any time, I can immediately can check any new Windows update provided for this
 case.</span></p>

<p>Hello SnakeSnoke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon researching, it seems that foobar2000 1.4 beta version addresses the issue causing audio distortions in Windows 10 1803. Installing the 1.4 beta version may fixed the said issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to foobar2000 change log - version 1.4:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Work around for DirectSound audio stutters with Windows 10 1803 (beta 19)."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check this <strong><a href="https://www.foobar2000.org/changelog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>regarding foobar2000 v1.4 beta 20 for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In case that the issue still occurs, it would be best to send our developers a report regarding this issue through the Feedback Hub. You can either vote on an existing submission or submit a new issue. When you submit a feedback item we gather additional

 frequently to see the status of your feedback items.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span>In order to submit new feedback, please follow these steps:</span> </p>
<p>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for Feedback Hub in Cortana search, then launch the app.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
2. Navigate to Feedback in the left menu, then press + Add new feedback.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
3. Select the Problem, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
4. Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking Begin monitoring (or Start capture) near the end of the form; Stop monitoring when you’re done.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click Submit.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
6. Click Continue using Feedback Hub.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
7. Click My feedback at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).<span>&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>Hello MQMelchizedek Qui,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, we worked together to solve this in the foobar community. I was involved in the beta testing process.&nbsp; In the thread which I linked in the post, you can find much more information.</p>
<p>The problem is now fixed for foobar2000 beta 20 (not with beta 19). Nevertheless the problem is present in many other applications (like ZSNES) and we all want that the source of the problem in Windows itself gets addressed. It's unlikely that all affected
 applications will get an update (for higher timer frequency?). As stated, these sound distortions are present only since 1803 for different sound cards - such as my
<span>Creative Soundblaster X-Fi Fatality Pro.</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow your guidance in the next days. Would love to get more feedback here as well.</p>

    <title>No Calendar Notifications from Windows Live Mail Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kentlrda  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Calendar Notifications from  Windows Live Mail Calendar</h2>
                    <p>As of November, 2014, I stopped receiving notifications &amp; reminders from my Calendar in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use Windows Live Mail/Calendar on 4 different computers and I do not receive notifications on any computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have checked all the settings
 as many people have been advised to do on the forum, but nothing works.&nbsp; I have ensured that I am signed in, that my email address is on my account, etc.&nbsp; Further, when I click on the 'Notifications' tab on the calendar page, it takes me to a Microsoft website
 that says "Microsoft Outlook... That page can not be found.... <a href="https://bay04.calendar.live.com/calendar/404.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/calendar/WLAlertsSettingsRedirector.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://bay04.calendar.live.com/calendar/404.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/calendar/WLAlertsSettingsRedirector.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I can not go to a page to set my notifications, I am unable to completely check my settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, one moment, my calendar notifications were working perfectly, and the next moment (in November 2014), I was not receiving notifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
 email address is:&nbsp;&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp; I have looked at and checked all possible options in my email and there is nothing which refers to calendar notifications (or calendar anything).&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am looking at my Calendar,
 there is no * (options gear wheel) to take me to 'options', and again, clicking on the Notifications tab takes me to the above web page which provides no help at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help that you can offer me would be deeply appreciated as I depend on and use the Calendar
 a great amount.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>By the way, I have Teamviewer on all my computers. So, if anyone would like to go on-line with my computer[s], that would be possible.</p>

 when I go to <a href="http://calendar.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://calendar.live.com/</a> , the calendar that appears does not show my appointments on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the name of the calendar (<strong>Kent's Calendar</strong>) is the same as my calendar in Windows Live
 Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, I am signed in under the same user name in both Live Mail and <a href="http://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://calendar.live.com</a> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I get the calendar in Live Mail to sync with the same calendar at
<a href="http://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://calendar.live.com</a> ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

            <span>Hi
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps suggested by <strong>¡Firedog</strong> dated
<strong>October 12, 2014</strong> from the following link and see if that helps.<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-calendar/windows-live-mail-calendar-will-not-sync-with/b70dcb12-01f3-40bb-b579-b3ff024f8ea5"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-calendar/windows-live-mail-calendar-will-not-sync-with/b70dcb12-01f3-40bb-b579-b3ff024f8ea5</span></a><br />

Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p>Firedog, thank you for your response.&nbsp; I have read the suggested items that you indicate in the thread above.&nbsp; However, in a number of places, you refer to 'the calendar', or 'the message list'.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do not know 'what calendar' or 'what message list'
 you are referring to.&nbsp; With this process, there are two calendars (the one in WLM, and the other in
<a href="http://mail.outlook.live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mail.outlook.live</a>).&nbsp; And, I'm not sure what message list you are referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendar in my Windows Live Mail shows all my appointments and scheduled notifications.&nbsp; Likewise, I am signed into WLM on the same account that I sign into mail.outlook.live.&nbsp;&nbsp; The calendar in mail.outlook.live is named exactly the same thing as my
 calendar in WLM, but, the calendar in outlook.live does not show any of the appointments I made in WLM.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, they are not syncing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think that I should simply try to create a completely new calendar and see if it syncs (and notifies)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help.</p>

<p>I'm sorry you've been neglected. I didn't notice that you'd been referred to an old thread that I took part in. It's not really apparent from your reply on 10 January which of the steps I was leading the other user through that you managed to perform, so
 let's get back to basics. First, in Windows Live Mail:</p>
<ol>
<li>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. On the <em>Advanced
</em>tab, click <em>Maintenance</em>. At the foot of the page, ensure that <em>Calendar</em> is selected but none of the other logging options.&nbsp;Click OK to close the Options dialogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Switch to the calendar window (press Ctrl-2 or click the second icon at the foot of the folder page). The right-most button on the ribbon&nbsp;should&nbsp;show
<ul>
<li>If it shows your display name, click the button and select <em>Sign out of Windows Live Mail</em>.
<br />
After a moment or two, the default calendar should load.</li><li>If it shows <em>Sign in</em>, you're already viewing the default calendar.</li></ul>
</li><li>Click the <em>Sign in</em> button and sign in with your Microsoft Account email address and password. Watch the status bar: there should be a message reading
<em>Your calendar has been updated</em>. Is there?<br />
The account calendar should now be loaded with all your events in it. </li><li>Click <em>Reminders</em>. You arrive at an error page; this is because the address of the page has changed since it was hard-coded into the program. Click the
<em>Go to calendar</em> button. If you're asked to sign in, do so with the same credentials as you used at (3).<br />
Is the calendar that opens the one that is not synchronized with the one in Windows Live Mail?
<br />
</li></ol>

<p>Firedog and Vijay,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not receive an email notification for the 'event' I created to occur today.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to following the steps provided, I have insured that 'notifications' are turned on in Outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, I have insured that
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** are not blocked and that that email address is in my safe senders list.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Windows Live Mail on my 3 computers, and do not get notifications to any of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling WLM, but that doesn't help.&nbsp; I lost 'notifications' last November (2014).&nbsp; It suddenly stopped working after I had made no changes at all.</p>
<p>I appreciate your continued help.</p>

 The procedure I laid out was designed to find out whether your calendar is being synchronized or not, so we really need to see your answers to the questions I posed before we can go any further. Troubleshooting is sometimes very tedious ...</p>

<h2>            Skype connection</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to make a video call on Skype, I receive the message: "Your connection is too weak, please try again later." I'm using the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype version 8.20.0.9</p>
<p>Calling version 2018.16.01.10</p>
<p>

</p><p>iMac (27-inch, Late 2012)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous posts suggest a possible firewall problem. Yet, this is not the case, since:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The computer's firewall is off.</p>
<p>2. Other devices on the same network do not show the problem (e.g., iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, I have a stable and fast internet connection (&gt; 100 Mbps). Any hints will be appreciated! Thanks, G.</p>

            Did you try signing out of Skype then sign in again? 
<br />
<br />Have you restarted your Mac? Sometimes, if you put it to sleep, things like this can happen. Do you have any streaming apps like Hulu, Spotify, Netflix running on the Mac?

<br />If that does not work, try installing the classic version of Skype.

<p>Andre, thanks a lot for the prompt reply. Regarding your suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try signing out of Skype then sign in again?</p>
<p>Yes, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you restarted your Mac? Sometimes, if you put it to sleep, things like this can happen.</p>
<p>Ibid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you have any streaming apps like Hulu, Spotify, Netflix running on the Mac?</p>
<p>None of these (but Dropbox and Google Drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If that does not work, try installing the classic version of Skype.</p>
<p>This worked. First, I uninstalled Skype following:</p>
<p>https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12073/how-can-i-completely-uninstall-and-then-reinstall-skype-for-mac-os-x</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I followed your instructions:</p>
<p><span>Log on to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.skype.com&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=qKdtBuuu6dQK9MsRUVJ2DPXW6oayO8fu4TfEHS8sGNk&amp;r=SE71a1cMhmLUgY-bkApiUw&amp;m=I9SguHgTAen7mSLX6CphnMkgL3Yvvr2pUjLoNoK3xvM&amp;s=pRuv1egA4a5pgSGraz-uteybeDm8_ZVZrnwX0A1u0Tc&amp;e=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.skype.com</a><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Click on Downloads&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Click on the dropdown from the blue button:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Click on Get classic Skype.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Still, that still leaves the questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Why won't the most recent version of Skype for Mac work?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Why on this particular machine, given that in other devices Skype works perfectly?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Why this issue arose out of the blue, since I've been using Skype for decades without problems?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best, G.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>

            The new version of Skype is going through some transitional issues. Hopefully Microsoft is aware of them and is working hard to fix them.
