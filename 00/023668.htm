<h2>            Questionnaire structure and relationships</h2>
                    <p>I have the following structure for the basis of a questionnaire:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tbl_QuestionMain</p>
<p>Main ID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>QuestionMain (Text)&nbsp;(list of questions)</p>
<p>QuestionSectionID (PK number) (each question table has one number e.g. main section questons assigned no. 1, finance questions&nbsp;assigned number 2, etc.)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbe02bca-0e0e-47d9-b323-1fcf518a3b39" height="135" width="260" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Five additional tables as above for section (questions)&nbsp;within the questionnaire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tbl_Respondant</p>
<p>RespondantID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>QuestionnaireMethod</p>
<p>QuestionnaireSent</p>
<p>QuestionnaireReceived</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tbl_Responses</p>
<p>ResponsesID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>RespondentID (FK)</p>
<p>ResponseDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tbl_AnswersMain</p>
<p>AnswersMainID</p>
<p>ResponseID</p>
<p>QMainID</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Five additional tables as above for section (answers) within the questionnaire set up same as Tbl_AnswersMain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if I should have separate tables for each questionnaire section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand my&nbsp;main form is bound to Tbl_Response and subforms bound to Tbl_Answer<em>relevant name</em> but I&nbsp;don't understand how I display the questions and then link the answers.</p>

            You should be able to have multiple questionnaires in one table. You might want to check out At Your Survey found at

            <p>I'm confused by what you describe. On the face of it, your structure is fine. Looks like something I've posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there should be a 5th table:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblSection</p>
<p>SectionID (PK)</p>
<p>SectionTitle</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then You would include SectionID as a FK in your Question table.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yep, I based&nbsp;the structure&nbsp;on your suggestion, amended the table and reviewed the questionnaire to suit. I have this table too which I forgot to include:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tbl_QuestionIndex</p>
<p>QuestionIndexID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>QuestionSection (FK number)</p>
<p>QuestionID (FK number)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been fine on the whole with forms linked to one table and including subforms. I understand having a main form bound to Tbl_Response and subforms bound to Tbl_Answer<em>relevant name</em> but&nbsp;can't get my head around how the questions are&nbsp;displayed.
 Don't have a mental link joining the two as such.</p>

            <p>Can one question apply to multiple sections? If so, then that table makes sense because you have a many to many relationship (obviously a section can apply to multiple questions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your answer table has the QuestionID as a FK. So on your Answers form you can do one of a few things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Include a combobox with a RowSource like : SELECT MainID, QuestionMain FROM Tbl_QuestionMain;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;with a ControlSource of QMainID, Column widths of 0";3" (Or however much space you need for the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;question. Then set that control to Locked so they can't change it.</p>
<p>2) Set a hidden control to QMainID and set a textbox with a Controlsource something like:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; =DLookup("[QuestionMain]","Tbl_QuestionMain","[Main ID] = " &amp; Me.QMainID)</p>
<p>3) Base your form on a query that joins your Answer table to the Question table and includes the</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; question Text, then bind a control to the question text.</p>

    <title>outlook.com email on iphone problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niwashikun  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook.com email on iphone problems</h2>
                    <p>In Outlook.com I have 2 hotmail addresses (A&amp;B). My B address is added to my A address as "Send Only" and my B messages are being forwarded to my A address. I sign in Outlook.com under my A address. I can send messages from either address.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On my iphone, I used to have both (A&amp;B) hotmail accounts added separately. I was able to send emails from either address and when I deleted emails on the iphone they were kept in the online outlook.com.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However I decided to remove the hotmail addresses from the iphone and add the outlook.com. Now my iphone email looks just like Outlook.com including having all my folders etc. Two problems with the change:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. I can no longer send emails from my iphone as address B. The only options are my A hotmail address and my icloud address (which I never use).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Now if I delete a message on the iphone it's deleted on Outlook.com as well. I have set it to save messages to POP folder when device is set to delete them but this doesn't seem to affect messages I delete on
 the iphone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Help with either of these problems would be appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

<p>I bought seven (7) units Laptop for use in the different sections in our office. So, I also bought&nbsp;two (2) pcs.&nbsp;Office 365 Home Premium that each&nbsp;can be installed to five (5) computers so, I installed the first box of office365 to five (5) Laptop. Now, I
 open the second box of office365 and installed it on the sixth laptop successfully but the problem arise when I was going to activate the office I read the message that "I already reached the installation limit". I just wonder why it happened when in fact
 the second box of office has a different product key. </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two (2) Office 365 Home Premium bought from a computer store. After I installed the first five in a laptop, I begin installing the remaining 5 installations to another computer but when tried to activate it says i reached the maximum limit of installation
 when in fact I have two (2) Office 365 of different Product key. .&nbsp; Please Help.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you. . .<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought seven (7) units Laptop for use in the different sections in our office. So, I also bought two (2) pcs. Office 365 Home Premium that each can be installed to five (5) computers so, I installed the first box of office365 to five (5) Laptop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Estaban, if you used the same email account for both product keys go into the http://office.com/myaccount page, you will see that you now have a 2 year subscription, for up to 5 computers.&nbsp; That is a feature / defect of the 365 activation system.<br />
<br />
To do what you want requires separate email addresses.<br />
<br />
BUT, now that you have already associated the product key with an email account you can't change it.&nbsp; That is another feature / defect of the 365 activation system. All you can do is contact MS Support, ask to speak to a supervisor because I guarantee that
 the first person you talk to WILL NOT be able to fix your problem.&nbsp; Hope you reach someone who will cancel one of your product keys and give you a new one.<br />
<br />
Using Home Premium in the Office is a violation of the license terms you agreed to while activating it.&nbsp; You might get away with it.&nbsp; But saying you are doing this on a MS Forum is asking MS to take action. AT the absolute minimum they could legitimately cancel
 your licenses with no refund.&nbsp; If they are feeling cranky, they could send in the "license police" and you would end up being fined thousands of dollars.<br />
<br />
To do what you want would require 7 Home and Business licenses, unless you have situations where 1 person is the primary user of more than one of those machines (not likely).<br />
<br />
Since you need more than 5 licenses you should look in to a "Volume License".<br />
<br />
The Office 365 licensing system is RADICALLY different than the Office 2013/2010 "local" install license that you are used to.<br />
<br />
Office 365 Business licenses are now associated with the individual user account (email) rather than the computer as the "old" 2013/2010 local license system you are used to.&nbsp; Each user license is allowed to install and activate on up to 5 computers that they
 are the primary user on. (What genius in MS decided that the average business user needs up to 5 computers?&nbsp; Maybe in 5 or 10 years, but not yet today.)<br />
<br />
MS assumes you will use individual business email accounts to activate each product key. You can use a single "administrator" account to activate multiple product keys, but then the individual users will not have access to features like the extra skype space
 (Of course, some businesses may see this as an advantage, since they don't want users storing business files in skydrive).<br />
<br />
For 365, MS assumes you will buy a volume license and use the administrator account to ASSIGN users the right to use Office 365. Very different than simply going to the electronics store and buying a bunch of H&amp;B licenses.<br />

<br />
how do I disable certain Office applications from installing. With the MSI you could use the Office Customization Tool to disable components from installing. In Click-to-Run you are installing at a suite or SKU level and to stop people from using them, you
 would need to first remove shortcuts to the unwanted apps. Then you can use things like AppLocker or similar tools to block executable files from running. If you deploy Office 365 ProPlus with App-V 5 you can prevent applications from installing as part of
 the Office suite.<br />
<br />
We also talked about language management and how you would use language properties in the Office Deployment Tool’s configuration XML to download and install Office in different languages.<br />
<br />
if you don’t have Windows Enterprise required to use AppLocker, Jeremy showed another way to block executables using the AppHelp Hard Block mechanism Windows uses.<br />
<br />
http://blogs.technet.com/b/office_resource_kit/archive/2013/04/30/the-new-office-garage-series-click-to-run-customization-and-deployment-deep-dive-part-3-integration-and-automation-with-software-distribution-tools.aspx
<br />
<br />
you can disallow user self-installation in the Office 365 Admin Portal and use software distribution infrastructure exclusively to ensure all Office 365 ProPlus installs happen within your LAN.<br />
<br />
“Can we put Office 365 ProPlus and Click-to-Run builds in our Windows images?”<br />
<br />
Yes. Whether you preinstall Office in your image then capture it or whether you install Office at build time with a task sequence, both will work. If you are installing and capturing the image, Office has been tested to work fine after running Sysprep.exe.
 The main thing to remember in that case is you want to install, but not activate Office. So the procedure would be to<br />
<br />
install and customize your Windows image,<br />
<br />
install Office using the “setup.exe /configure .\configuration.xml” process, <br />
<br />
run Sysprep.exe, then<br />
<br />
capture with imagex.exe or dism.exe.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you are using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit for imaging, there is another important point to remember<br />
<br />

Office Deployment Tool for Click-to-Run<br />
<br />
http://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/tip/New-Office-2013-features-can-help-IT-pros-as-much-as-end-users<br />
<br />
Click-to-Run is a streaming and virtualization technology that lets customers download and install Microsoft Office 2013 components from the Internet. Click-to-Run leverages the Office 365 Web-based installer to facilitate the download and installation process.
 By default, the installation includes the full user interface, with automatic updates enabled. In many enterprises, however, IT needs greater control over Click-and-Run installations than is offered out of the box. That’s where the new Office Deployment Tool
 comes in.<br />
<br />
The tool lets administrators customize Click-to-Run deployments to control how users install Office 2013 products. Administrators can download Office source files to a network share so users don’t have to download the product over the Internet. They can also
 configure which products and languages can be installed, how installations should be logged, whether Office components should be regularly updated and numerous other settings.<br />
<br />
The Office Deployment Tool supports three deployment modes: a download mode to set up a local installation source, a configure mode to configure the Office clients and a packager mode to convert an Office 2013 Click-to-Run package into an App-V package.<br />

How does a company install and control licenses - Business<br />
<br />
Using Click to Run virtualization, the process of getting new users running has substantially changed. Because CTR installations are so fast, you no longer have to pre-install the software for users.<br />
<br />
A business IT Admin controls use of corporate Office 365 licenses through the Office 365 Administration Center online.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Office 365 Administration Center the designated Office Administrator sets up the new USER ID<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setup the associated email account(s)<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setup Office licenses allowed to the userid<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the new User logs in to their new computer<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Internet Explorer the user goes to the “Office 365 Portal” site to get their allowed Office 365 installation<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using the Click to Run installation process, Office 365 is installed and running on a new computer is a matter of minutes.<br />
<br />

Excellent resource to get you started administering your business Office 365 licenses.<br />
<br />
The first video, Exploring the Office 365 Administration Center&nbsp; http://labs.officeignite.com/Guides/Exploring%20the%20Office%20365%20Administration%20Center.htm&nbsp; (9:32), describes how to create new userids, and to assign Office licenses to them. It also very
 quickly breezes by how to install Office.<br />
<br />
The second vidow, Office 365 Overview for IT Administrators http://labs.officeignite.com/Guides/Office%20365%20Overview%20for%20IT%20Administrators.htm&nbsp; (14:00), quickly walks you through setting up new company and users.<br />
<br />
On basic setup page, step 3 “Set up User Access” provides links to instructions on how to set up new users.<br />
<br />
In Service Settings, Downloads, you can control what Office apps the user can download.<br />

The following post will document how to setup a Windows 8 desktop for a cloud user for Office 365. I have already installed Windows 8 and created the local account for my test user. I have logged into the Office 365 portal and had the user change his password.
 The password for Office 365 and the password for the desktop are the same.<br />

<br />
10 minute comparison of MSI and CTR<br />
<br />
Touches on corporate provisioning in”User Based License Model Activation”. Users activate/deactivate, but IT still has control to deprovision the license (starting at about minute 8:15).<br />
<br />
Then in this video / article :<br />

http://blogs.technet.com/b/office_resource_kit/archive/2013/03/20/the-new-office-garage-series-identity-activation-data-access.aspx<br />
<br />
They again say the companies can still allow userid activation while maintaining control of the licenses through Active Directory<br />

Jeremy: So we showed the installation experience for a domain-joined computer where single sign on is enabled and one that is not domain-joined, but installs via the Office 365 portal. In the direct from portal case when you kick off the installation, you will
 see a file that looks something like this:<br />

In a future episode we’ll talk about all of the configurations needed to suppress completely sign-in, first run experiences and user prompts. IT admins have had to deal with these in past releases of Office, but now there are ways to automatically sign users
 in to Office 365 installs picking up their domain credentials. I also showed the effects of deleting the user account from the Azure AD store and how it put Yoni’s Office into Reduced Functionality Mode (RFM) - even if Yoni installs Office on his personal
 devices using his organization’s Office software assets, once Yoni leaves the org the IT department can deprovision his personal installs. That keeps software asset management cleaner and IT is in control.<br />
<br />
Yoni: Don’t forget we also had Mark Russinovich on the show and he explained the security model for online services with Azure AD - in your car. It sounds like they are taking the defense in depth approach to harden the service. And you made him slum it in
 your car, Jeremy.<br />

Overview of ID, Authentication and Authorization in Office 2013<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&nbsp; http://blogs.technet.com/b/office_resource_kit/archive/2013/04/16/new-poster-and-content-roadmaps-about-office-identity-authentication-authorization-and-security.aspx &gt;<br />
<br />
This page has links to 3 posters. The first poster “Identity and Authentication in the Cloud: Office 2013 and Office 365” describes at a high level how to control new user setup in a corporate / small business environment.<br />
<br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&nbsp; http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj683102.aspx&nbsp; &gt;<br />
<br />
This page also has a link to the same poster online (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38193 has PDF and Visio versions of the chart). As well, it goes into more detail with information like the following:<br />
<br />
… Because Office is a tool that is used by the same individual in two different roles, the new Office offers two identities with which users can log on to Office 2013:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Microsoft account, which most people use for personal business<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An organization ID that is assigned by Microsoft, which most people use when doing work for an organization, such as a business, charity, or school.<br />
<br />
The credentials that are used to sign in are recognized as either personal or organizational. That sign-in identity becomes the user’s “home realm” and determines which documents the user has access to on SharePoint, SkyDrive, or Office 365 Services for a specific
 session. Each unique sign in identity is saved in a most-recently used list so that it is easy to switch between identities without leaving the Office experience.<br />
<br />
….<br />
<br />
a personal SkyDrive can be mounted to an organization identity so that personal documents can be accessed at work or school without ever switching identities. Also, when a user authenticates by using an identity, this authentication is valid for all Office
 applications, not just the application he or she signed in to.<br />
<br />
….<br />
<br />
Two logon types are supported when users sign in to Office 2013, a Microsoft account or an organization ID that is assigned by Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Microsoft account (the user’s individual account). This account, formerly known as Windows Live ID, is the credential that users use to authenticate with the Microsoft network and is frequently used for personal or non-business work, such as volunteer work.
 To create a Microsoft account, a user provides a user name and password, certain demographic information, and “account proofs,” such as an alternative email address or phone number. For more information about the new Microsoft account, see What is a Microsoft
 account?. http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268357<br />
<br />
An organization ID that is assigned by Microsoft / Office 365 account ID that is assigned by Microsoft. This account is created for business use. An Office 365 account can be one of three types: a pure Office 365 ID, an Active Directory ID, or an Active Directory
 Federation Services ID. These are described below:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office 365 ID. This ID is created when an admin sets up an Office 365 domain and takes the form &lt;user&gt;@&lt;org&gt;.onmicrosoft.com, for example:<br />
<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organization ID that is assigned by Microsoft that is validated against a user’s Active Directory ID. An organization ID that is assigned by Microsoft and validated against Active Directory as follows:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, a person who has an [on-premise domain]\&lt;user&gt; account attempts to access organization resources.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the resource requests authentication from the user.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the user types in their organization user name and password.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, that user name and password are validated against the organization AD database, the user is authenticated, and is given access to the requested resource.<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An organization ID that is assigned by Microsoft that is validated against a user’s Active Directory Federation Services ID. An organization ID that is assigned by Microsoft and validated against Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) as follows:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, one person who has an org.onmicrosoft.com attempts to access partner organization resources.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the resource requests authentication from the user.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the user types in their organization user name and password.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, that user name and password are validated against the organization AD database.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, that same user name and password are passed to the partner’s federated AD database, the user is authenticated, and is given access to the requested resource.<br />
<br />
For on-premises resources, Office 2013 uses the domain\alias user name for authentication. For federated resources, Office 2013 uses the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** user name for authentication.<br />
<br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819272.aspx<br />
<br />
This page summarized methods of administering Office 365<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
User Account Management<br />
<br />
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819300.aspx<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sign-in for Small Business subscriptions<br />
<br />
Users receive Windows Azure Active Directory cloud credentials—separate from other desktop or corporate credentials—for signing into Office 365 and other Microsoft cloud services.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sign-in options for Enterprise, Midsize Business, Kiosk, Academic, and Government subscriptions<br />
<br />
Office 365 for Enterprise, Midsize Business, Kiosk, Academic, and Government subscriptions has two systems that can be used for user identities:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizational account (cloud identity)&nbsp;&nbsp; Users receive Windows Azure Active Directory cloud credentials—separate from other desktop or corporate credentials—for signing into Office 365 and other Microsoft cloud services. This is the default identity,
 and is recommended for small and midsize businesses in order to minimize deployment complexity. Passwords for organizational accounts use the Windows Azure Active Directory password policy.<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federated account (federated identity)&nbsp;&nbsp; For all subscriptions other than Office 365 Small Business and Office 365 Small Business Premium, in organizations with on-premises Active Directory that use single sign-on (SSO), users can sign into Office 365
 services by using their Active Directory credentials. The corporate Active Directory stores and controls the password policy. For information about SSO, see Single sign-on roadmap.<br />
<br />
The type of identity affects the user experience and user account management options, as well as hardware and software requirements and other deployment considerations.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Custom domains and identity options<br />
<br />
When you create a new user, the user’s sign-in name and email address are assigned to the default domain as set in the Office 365 admin center. By default, the Office 365 subscription uses the &lt;company name&gt;.onmicrosoft.com domain that was created with the
 Office 365 account. You can add one or more custom domains to Office 365 rather than retaining the onmicrosoft.com domain, and can assign users to sign in with any of the validated domains. Each user’s assigned domain is the email address that will appear
 on sent and received email messages.<br />
<br />
You can host up to 600 registered Internet domains in Office 365, each represented by a different namespace.<br />
<br />
For organizations using single sign-on, all users on a domain must use the same identity system: either cloud identity or federated identity. For example, you could have one group of users that only needs a cloud identity because they don’t access on-premises
 systems, and another group of users who use Office 365 and on-premises systems. You would use add two domains to Office 365, such as contractors.contoso.com and staff.contoso.com, and only set up SSO for one of them. An entire domain can be converted from
 cloud identity to federated identity, or from federated identity to cloud identity.<br />
<br />
For more information about domains in Office 365, see the Domains service description.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Creating user accounts<br />
<br />
Office 365 provides five ways to create user accounts, some of which are not available for Office 365 Small Business and Office 365 Small Business Premium: Add single User, Bulk upload using *.CSV files, Active Directory Synchronization, Azure Active Directory
 Module for powershell, Exchange Simple Migration<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Password management<br />
<br />
The policies and procedures for password management depend on the identity system.<br />
<br />
Cloud identity password management:<br />
<br />
When using cloud identities, passwords are automatically generated when the account is created.<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For cloud identity password strength requirements, see Change your password. http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268357<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To increase security, users must change their passwords when they first access Office 365 services. As a result, before users can access Office 365 services, they must sign into the Office 365 portal, where they are prompted to change their passwords.<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admins can set the password expiration policy. For more information for Enterprise and Midsize subscriptions, see Set a user’s password expiration policy. http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=285381&nbsp;&nbsp; For Small Business, see Change how often passwords
 expire.&nbsp; http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=285381<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
License management<br />
<br />
A subscription to Office 365 is made up of a number of licenses to a set of services. An administrator assigns a license to each user for each service that user needs access to. For more information about managing licenses, see Assign or remove a license in
 Office 365 Enterprise,&nbsp; http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=270069 or&nbsp; Assign or remove a license in Office 365 Small Business.&nbsp; http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=270070<br />

Office 365 and Office 2013 – what’s the difference?<br />
<br />
http://office-watch.com/t/n.aspx?a=1851<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What’s the difference between Office 365 and Office 2013 local install?<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/what-is-office365.aspx<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/faq<br />
<br />
The “base” applications are the same. Office 365 is the next attempt of MS to MAKE MORE MONEY! Or at least to create a steady flow of “rental” income rather than the bursts of new version “purchase” income (of course if you read the terms of the license we
 are not actually “purchasing” our local copies of Office, we are just licensing it and MS can revoke that license any time they feel like it).<br />
<br />
Yes, depending on the Office 365 package you get, the monthly rent will sooner or later end up costing more than a purchase.&nbsp; But, if you look at the packages you’ll see that they include more features than the “base” local install includes. Things like “free”
 (well part of the 365 bundle) Skydrive storage. But also things like SharePoint functionality without having to set up your own server installation. server, Office-on-Demand: This option provides a single Office application on demand to users when they need
 it.&nbsp; The Office application is streamed to the PC but is not permanently installed. Office 365 Home Premium allows you to “install” on up to 5 home computers. And a bunch of other “stuff”.&nbsp; Another advantage of the Office 365 bundle is that you won’t have
 to buy “Office 16”, it will appear “automatically” as part of your “rental” deal.<br />

So the question becomes, how safe do you feel running your business in the “cloud”, and storing your personal, confidential, proprietary data files in MS “cloud” storage. The paranoid “security freaks” out there will ask uncomfortable questions like:<br />
<br />
o Do you trust MS not to “peek”? <br />
<br />
o Do you trust your or foreign governments to not “subpoena” your data (maybe without even bothering to tell you a la “patriot act” and it’s various lovely cousins)<br />
<br />
o Do you trust MS not to “leak”, or be hacked? MANY other big companies have, what makes MS invulnerable?<br />
<br />
o Are you positive that the connection between your computer and the “cloud” is unhackable?<br />
<br />
and other similar “nasty” questions that MS doesn’t want you to think about. <br />

<br />
Microsoft Office 2013 makes it easier than ever for users to access their documents when and where they need them. But Microsoft wasn't thinking only about end users when it released the latest version of its application suite. The company also took into account
 the needs of IT professionals who must deploy Office across the enterprise. Office 2013 features include plenty of bells and whistles to make administrators happy, particularly when it comes to security.<br />
<br />
In fact, Microsoft has tackled a number of important areas to make Office a safer environment for enterprise workers. Security configurations have been updated and authentication has been enhanced. Functionality that supports trusted publishers, digital signatures
 and encrypted document recovery has also received a makeover. The latest version Office even includes new and improved Protected View and Information Rights Management (IRM) features.<br />

Keys to Understanding Microsoft Volume Licensing<br />
<br />
The following are a few key organizational characteristics to help you understand Microsoft Volume Licensing policies and programs and to choose the best option for your organization:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The size and type of your organization<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The products you want to license<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way in which you want to use those products<br />
<br />
Programs for Your Organization Type and Size<br />
<br />
At the most elementary level, Microsoft Volume Licensing program models address organizations in the following two&nbsp; main categories:
<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizations with more than five but fewer than 250 computers<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizations with more than 250 computers<br />
<br />
For organizations with fewer than 250 computers, the Microsoft Open Programs provide volume discounts for a minimal up-front cost and are widely available through the worldwide partner channel. Open Programs provide the following three purchasing license options
 for commercial businesses: <br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Value is for organizations with as few as five desktop PCs and offers the advantages of Software Assurance, simplified license management, and an annual payment structure. The Open Value program offers Company-wide, Non–Company-wide options.<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Value Subscription is for customers who want to subscribe to, rather than acquire, Microsoft product licenses. Available in select countries or regions, Microsoft Open Value Subscription provides the lowest up-front costs of the Open Programs with
 the flexibility to reduce their total licensing costs in years when their desktop PC count declines.
<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open License is for customers who want a minimum initial purchase of only five software licenses. This program is ideal if you prefer to pay-as-you-go and change your licensing program as your business grows. You can qualify for volume purchasing under
 the volume feature of Open License. Open volume purchasing is for customers who can meet minimum purchase levels using a system of product pools and points. With an entry minimum of 500 points from a single product pool, this program offers deeper discounts
 for a greater savings. For organizations with 250 or more desktop PCs, Microsoft offers the following options:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Select Plus is for midsize and large organizations with 250 or more desktop PCs with multiple affiliates that want to license software and services at any business unit level while still getting the price saving advantages of being a single organization.<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA) is for larger organizations that want to standardize their desktop IT across the enterprise, but retain the flexibility to purchase Microsoft software licenses and cloud services for different types of users. Based on
 a three-year enrollment term, it provides the deepest pricing discounts and the advantages of Software Assurance.
<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Enterprise Subscription Agreement (EAS) is a Volume Licensing program for large organizations that want to subscribe to—rather than purchase—Microsoft software licenses. This program provides similar advantages as the Enterprise Agreement with
 a lower initial cost based on a three-year subscription and the ability to increase or decrease subscription counts on an annual basis. However, unlike the EA where you retain perpetual use rights for the licenses you purchase, with this subscription agreement,
 you gain access to Microsoft software for only as long as you maintain your subscription.<br />
<br />
In addition to size, you need to consider your organization’s primary function. For example, additional discounts are given to some public sector organizations such as schools and universities.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Volume License 2013<br />
<br />
This article describes how to buy Office using the Volume License terms and Prices:<br />
<br />
http://www.infoworld.com/t/office-software/how-buy-microsoft-volume-license-the-cheap-213214<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt; Lemington Consulting, which works extensively with Access volume licenses, explains the details in its FAQ:<br />
<br />
Is there a minimum number of licenses that must be purchased under a Volume License Agreement?<br />
<br />
Yes. The minimum number of licenses required for a Volume License Agreement is five (5). However, the five licenses can be made up of any combination of products. Quantities of less than five can also be purchased economically by making up the additional license
 using an inexpensive “make up” product SKU.<br />
<br />
Once the initial Volume License Agreement is in place, additional licenses can be added to the Agreement in quantities of less than five. For example, if a company purchases five Office 2010 Professional Plus licenses under a new agreement, three months later
 the same company can purchase one additional Office 2010 Professional Plus license under the same agreement. The minimum license number therefore only applies to the initial Volume License agreement.<br />
<br />
One of the worst-kept secrets in VL cognoscenti circles: The Microsoft DVD Playback Pack for Windows Vista Business is (as you would imagine) quite cheap. I’ve seen it for as little as $7. (Then buy whatever Office product / bundle you want, i.e. genuine VL
 Excel 2013 ($173).)<br />
<br />

The various Office 365 plans have some quirks that you should be aware of before making a buying decision.<br />

Volume License to Get Cheaper Office Apps<br />
<br />
This article describes how to buy a Office using the Volume License terms and Prices:<br />
<br />
http://www.infoworld.com/t/office-software/how-buy-microsoft-volume-license-the-cheap-213214<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt; Lemington Consulting, which works extensively with Access volume licenses, explains the details in its FAQ:<br />
<br />
Is there a mininum number of licenses that must be purchased under a Volume License Agreement?<br />
<br />
Yes. The minimum number of licenses required for a Volume License Agreement is five (5). However, the five licenses can be made up of any combination of products. Quantities of less than five can also be purchased economically by making up the additional license
 using an inexpensive “make up” product SKU.<br />
<br />
Once the initial Volume License Agreement is in place, additional licenses can be added to the Agreement in quantities of less than five. For example, if a company purchases five Office 2010 Professional Plus licenses under a new agreement, three months later
 the same company can purchase one additional Office 2010 Professional Plus license under the same agreement. The minimum license number therefore only applies to the initial Volume License agreement.<br />
<br />
One of the worst-kept secrets in VL cognoscenti circles: The Microsoft DVD Playback Pack for Windows Vista Business is (as you would imagine) quite cheap. I’ve seen it for as little as $7. (Then buy what ever Office product / bundle you want, ie genuine VL
 Excel 2013 ($173).)<br />

<br />
<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
Let's try the following steps and verify the result:<br />
<br />
1) Change the user's account type to an administrator account following instructions mentioned in the article below:<br />
</font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-users-account-type#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0563c1">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-users-account-type#1TC=windows-7</font></a><br />
</span><br />
</span><font><font color="#000000"><font>2) Login to the newly changed administrator account and start all the Office applications and verify if it opens as expected.<br />
<br />
3) If Office application works as expected, change the user account type to a Non-Administrator account.<br />
<br />
4) Restart your computer, log into the Non-Administrator account and once again try starting the Office applications.<br />
<br />
Reply with the result and I'll be glad to assist you further.<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Sign-In Issues</h2>
                    <p>My university have us e-mails accounts with office 365, and up until today, there were no issues. Today, while trying to check it, I was logged out (which I am usually not), so I input my e-mail and password, and it&nbsp;asked&nbsp;if I had changed my password recently
 because I&nbsp;had input my "old" password. I have not changed my password since I have gotten that account.
</p>
<p>No big deal, I'll just change my password. Here I encountered another problem. After inputting the character for the human verification thing, I got
</p>
<p>"Your request could not be processed. </p>
<div>
<p>We're sorry, but we cannot reset your password at this time. This is due to a temporary connectivity issue, so if you try again later, resetting your password may succeed. If the issue persists, please

<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">contact your admin</span> to reset your password for you."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And upon clicking the "contact your admin" link, I got </p>
<p>'Temporary error. There was a temporary error with your session. Please try resetting your password again by

<p>And with that link, I was redirected back to the human verification. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>
<p>This e-mail is fairly important. </p>

    <title>Windows Defender suddenly disabling Save Function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmr1942  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender suddenly disabling Save Function</h2>
                    Windows Defender has suddenly, and with no apparent connection to recent Windows 10 updates or any new programs added to my Surface Pro 4, started blocking my "Save" file function and Save image function, even from such basic applications as Notepad and
 Adobe print/save to PDF.&nbsp; I've temporarily disabled Controlled Folder Access (after many Google searches to find that as an answer), and that step has allowed my work to resume.&nbsp; Two questions: why is this now suddenly occurring in January 2019 (after not
 ever having been a problem earlier, and at a time when I've added no new software, apps or system changes of my own)?&nbsp; And is there no "fix" available that will allow me to otherwise use the Controlled Folder Access feature?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I guess that since we're still in the Technical Preview, that's reasonable. &nbsp;I suppose they left the icon for it so generic because it actually WILL be changed once the OS is finalized.</p>

</p><p>Not likely, Microsoft wants to distance themselves from IE because they think the public perceives that&nbsp;IE was bad, and they think the current programmers could do it better.</p>

<p>If you want to make a line color or width as default, after you draw the line right click on the line and select ‘set as default line’.</p>
<p>Refer the link below on how to change the line color and width.</p>

<p>hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>recently, i had my nokia 5800 xpressmusic checked at store for some problems. i said to them, if the software was the problem, please format the phone. turn out, the problem is the battery. however, they still format my phone and i get the phone just like
 the day i bought it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the problem is, after the format, i am unable to download the application that i always use such as wechat, whatsapp and facebook. when i log in into the nokia store, they said that i have already downloaded those application. is there any solution for my
 problem?</p>

            Hi, shazana_aziz. Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions! Just to verify, are these apps for free or are they paid apps? Before the factory reset, where did you save them? In your phone memory or to your memory card?
<br />
<br />
For free apps, it should let you download these apps unlimitedly. For paid apps, try to reinstall them:<br />
<br />
1. Sign in your account<br />
2. Go to your Nokia Store. If your app is not up-to-date, you can update it by going to store.ovi.mobi on your phone browser.<br />
3. Go to Account &gt; My Stuff.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h2>            Why do I get TWO calendars when importing into Office 365&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am migrating from Office 2010 to Office 365 Home Premium. Before installing Office 365, I had exported my calender as a seperate pst-file, and my Contacts to another pst-file from my Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I now try to import these files, I end up with TWO calenders and TWO Contacts file, even if I have choosen the option "Import to same location..."??? I have tried different to import these files with different options and with very strange
 results!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can I make sure that the items get into the default calendar in Outolook 365 and the Contacts tab respectively, so that when I click the Contacts tab and calaender tab in the lower part of Outlook 365, I can see and manage all my Contacts and calender
 items from my "old" Office 2010, and not having to choose between TWO calenders???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet forum also as there this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. On Technet, even Microsoft Product team will look into your issue.

</p><p>I recently upgraded from Office for Mac 2014 to Office for Mac 2016... and eventhough I really love the new flat, and revised layout look of all the new apps in the suite... I don't like the performance of the software.... it's very sluggish when in use...
 compared to the 2014 version and the launching of the apps takes for ever. Zooming to enlarge content can be very sluggish and unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes 16 bounces in my dock to launch Word, which probably be the most used app of the suite that I use and a similar amount of bounces and time for PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MacPro 12 Core (Mid 2010) with a 520GB SSD and 64GB RAM running OSX Yosemite 10.10.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this very slow launch speeds ? and sluggish in app performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the OSX El Capitan Beta installed on a partition... so I will test now to see if there's any improvement over the current performance in El Capitan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any comments or suggestions most welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Anthony</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have all the lastest versions as per the most recent releases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried them out on El Capitan and they launch and perform a little better. Taking about 10 app bounces to launch Word and PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be moving to El Capitan as soon as I can so at least now I know office will perform a little better on El Capitan.</p>

    <title>calling Skype on smartphone via WiFi without a carrier - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rtischer8277  say:</h3>
<h2>            calling Skype on smartphone via WiFi without a carrier</h2>
                    <p>I think it should be possible with today's smartphones to Skype from smartphone to smartphone without paying for a carrier on either one and without having to turn both apps on first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motivation: WiFi is becoming ubiquitous first in the form of Hotspots, but increasingly at least in big cities . Fx, in my DC area there is xfinitywifi. There are also numerous governmental offices that have public WiFi networks like the Department of General
 Services, fitness clubs, libraries, national buildings, and Starbucks have public WiFi and they are all free of charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Impediments: a lot of WiFi networks are overlapping especially the government ones and there is no coordination. Also, you have to click on the public WiFi hotspot each time to activate it which is an extra unneccesary step. Municipal WiFi is still a rarity.
 There are fake WiFi Hotspots like Verizons'. Its claim is false since their software was developed 10 years ago and hasn't been upgraded since. Another impediment is the Internet provider's broad-area WiFi coverage do not overlap (they are contiguous for the
 most part) . So if I have Verizon fiber Internet with its fake Hotspots, but free coverage, I can't user Comcast's free for customer's xfinitywifi because they don't have a presence in my area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype to Skype comm smartphone to smartphone: technically it should be possible to chat, call and video behind a router without having to have the destination phone turned on to start with. We expect that the callee's device will ring which is the case for
 cell phone calls. WiFi is different from cell data because of Network Address Translation (NAT), but let me wait a bit for that discussion.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test: My test situation is two very cheap Lumia 920s. Neither phone subscribes to cell service, that is, neither has a carrier. Skype to Skype comm works fine for this configuration. But if the destination phone (B) is off, A's call does not go through.
 When calling, if I turn B on while A is ringing, the call immediately goes through, but not before. So far I have only run tests behind a router. I have tested Skype chat from several hotspots and that works fine. When B is turned on A's message goes through.
 Haven't tried phone or video from the hotspot yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Analysis: Presumably Microsoft is working on Skype ubiquitous access so it may be the case that my aging Lumia Mobile Phone's Skype app just doesn't have this feature. Or maybe Microsoft's Skype for Business already has it possibly. A router's NAT would
 stop A's cold-calls to B unless you set up port forwarding like gamers do or kept the connections alive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: the age of the cell tower for phone communications is over. Fiber/cable vs cell data comm capability increasingly is overlapping. But the user shouldn't have to pay twice for roughly the same connectivity. Exactly at what point a smartphone starts
 using WiFi and when it is using the cell's data plan is not, as far as I can see, spelled out, presumably because the big guys are in bed with each other and it is to both's $$$ advantage to keep the end user in the dark. The concept of a smartphone being
 AlwaysOn only applies to cellular service (I call you, you answer the phone) but not to Skype comm service as one would expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else have the same concerns or has made any similar tests?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Difficulites when makeing a video call with two users connected at the same time</h2>
                    <p>Hi all..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I send a video feed to two contacts at the same time.&nbsp; They can BOTH see the video feed and hear the audio from the meeting that is being streamed to them. Great!...But when I play some music they BOTH cant hear the music at all.&nbsp; Now I know that voice
 is word for word and it seems to be fine to send and they can, as I have said BOTH hear.&nbsp; But since music is a continuous stream of sound does Skype in some way have an algorithm or something that limits BOTH to be able to hear the music because I have called
 the two parties at the same time on two different phones while they were hooked up to the conferencing call and sending voice and they BOTH can hear it but the minute I send MUSIC NETIHER can hear it..&nbsp; Why is this? They both have there video and mics turned
 off so it cant be a looping issue or feedback cancelling something out.&nbsp; Does skype require that I purchase skype Business or something or does anyone know anything about this issues?</p>

 to process a rule from a particular sender's domain to do a client side rule? This seems like something I should be able to enable a server side rule for.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated!!</p>

    <title>White bar covers menu and favorites - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            White bar covers menu and favorites</h2>
                    <p>Using Firefox or Chrome, a white bar covers the menu and favorites bar, and the address bar.</p>
<p>Edge and IE function just fine.</p>
<p>This does no happen on my wife's computer which is the same setup/update level as mine.</p>
<p>The only event that coincides with this problem (roughly) is that I subscribed to World grid, a volunteer network which uses my computer's idle time.</p>
<p>Any clues?</p>

<p>Hello ecy20,</p>
<p>A, E, 5, and S certainly ARE valid PK characters.</p>
<p>The only characters I know of not used are the numeral zero and the letter oh, and the numeral one and the letter i, which obviously are much too easily confused.</p>
<p>From which online store did you buy?</p>
