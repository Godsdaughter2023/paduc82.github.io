<h2>            The server you are trying to access is using an Authentication protocol not supported by this version of office</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>All was working well with my Office 2016 Pro Plus software and Windows 10 till about 1 week ago.&nbsp; Thereafter because of a Windows or Office update (I do not know which one of the two is the culprit), OneDrive for Business has stopped syncing.&nbsp; When I try
 to synchronise a libraray from the web page and&nbsp;specify the location where I want to save the files, I get this&nbsp;message</p>
<p>"The server you are trying to access is using an Authentication protocol not supported by this version of office"</p>
<p>I am using Office version 16.0.6001.1068.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;clicked on Update Now to ensure that I have the latest version of Office installed.&nbsp; Windows is updated as well.</p>
<p>Please resolve this problem.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Password Protection in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bettimiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password Protection in OneNote</h2>
                    I have a notebook in OneNote and have one section that I cannot password protect. I get a message that says: "You cannot change, set, or remove password protection for this section because it has not been completely synchronized. Ensure that all content
 in the section is available and try again." There is no error message number. I have synchronized the section multiple times. I have also moved the section and pages into a new notebook (and found a couple of errors along the way which were corrected). I am
 able to password protect other sections in the notebook, but not this one. Any ideas?

<p>I am still unable to password protect one section of one notebook (and, of course, it's my journal that I would like to privatize!). I tried moving the section to a new tab, but I still get the same message. All of the other sections of the other notebooks
 sync just fine and I am able to password protect sections in those notebooks, but not this one. What can I do to correct this to allow password protection?</p>

<p>So I have two issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I also have no option to password protect any section or page on OneNote online. I'm assuming I should be able to right-click to open this feature? If that's the case, it doesn't appear on my right-click menu options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It would be great to be able to open two accounts at once on my OneNote desktop because I have OneNote Gem and I love it's improved search features, among other perks. Is this possible? I have one personal account I've been using for years now, but I'd
 like to create an account tied to a company email.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, <br />

<br />
We've noticed a delay on your post, and we apologize. Please allow us to address both your questions:<br />

<blockquote>
<p>1. I also have no option to password protect any section or page on OneNote online. I'm assuming I should be able to right-click to open this feature? If that's the case, it doesn't appear on my right-click menu options.
</p>

<p><br />
For what we all know, the feature should be available with the OneNote versions: <span>
<em>2016</em></span><em>,&nbsp;<span> 2013,</span></em>&nbsp;<em><span>2010</span>,</em><span><em>2007.

 app is yet to have this feature. </p>
<p>

<p>It is a good idea to have multiple accounts signed in at the same time for OneNote to enjoy premium different features from each. However, it is yet to be applied. What we can do is to add multiple accounts. Please refer

<h2>            Windows 10 TP Build 10041 Startup Errors and Recovery&#47;Refresh Errors</h2>
                    <p>Last night I updated my surface pro 3 to windows 10 technical preview 10041 and it ran stable after update, shut down and in the morning went to school, got to class and when I started up and logged on the desktop would flash my theme color (light blue in
 my case) refresh all the desktop icons and taskbar icons, and than repeat, making it almost impossible to see any icons and none can be clicked on, all I could manage to open is task manager through ctrl+shift+esc. With a bit of looking I read that it is a
 video drivers problem and that I need to uninstall the ones I have and update them, well I can't do that due to the constant refreshing of the desktop. Tried booting into safe mode and that didn't work. So now I am trying to go back to a previous build (in
 my case windows 8.1) to uninstall and update drivers before reinstalling windows 10. From here I try doing a recovery, it gives me an error saying it can't and to do a refresh instead, so I do the refresh and it starts, gets to where it says "refreshing your
 pc 8%" and then gets stuck at 8%, I tried leaving it and hours later it is still stuck. Any idea on how I can successfully backdate or do something to stop this constant screen refresh?</p>

<p>That didn't work but I tried safe mode again and that worked, do you have a direct link to the surfae integration driver update 2.0.1182.0? cause I can't find it. When I go to the download page it doesn't show it and the few that are there are just dates
 for the name.</p>

<p>I understand how I will have to install them, I will need to do it from my pc and move it over to the surface, but I need to figure out which update is the integration update as from what I have seen that is the most important to try and fix this. Could
 you help me find which one is the integration drivers because I can't figure that part out.</p>

<h2>            Windows Insider Feedback Prevented by Locked Incorrect Settings by Windows Insider Program</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to put in feedback about 14901 explorer changes and am prevented from doing so as the submit button is greyed out. I am asked to click to change the feedback settings to Full for data provision, but when I get there it is locked by WIP
 and set on Enhanced. The fact that my settings / data is absolutely irrelevant to the type of feedback I want to give just makes it more frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, if I make the mistake of clicking on the Feedback link in that window my previously written feedback gets trashed with no warning or recovery option, which I guess is feedback I will be happy to give. However I can't engage in the process until
 this lockout is fixed - anyone know how to do it? thank you.</p>

<h2>            Resource monitor does not work following IE10 installation</h2>
                    <p>Checked other community threads on this issue, changing my display properties to default allows Resource monitor to function but Iam not happy to do this as the fonts are too small.</p>
<p>This issue was caused by Microsoft and they should provide an acceptable solution.</p>
<p>Other rolling back IE do not know what to do</p>
<p>Any assistance would appreciated</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No error messages, unable to post screenshot, copy option greyed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem became apparent after upgrading to IE10</p>
<p>First question in troubleshooting "what has changed"</p>
<p>Answer "IE10 installed"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same problem occurred following Windows update kb977074 which I uninstalled and everything worked fine</p>
<p>I understand that upgrading to IE10 installs this update, this is where the problem lies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer&nbsp;has fully up to date display drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I reset my display to default everything works fine but the font is too small so it is not an option</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another alternative is to uninstall IE and revert to Firefox</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a pre-made xls with some marcros that I have downloaded from a website for work. &nbsp;When I try to open the xls I get a "Componet not registered" error and after clicking OK a bunch of times Excel finally crashes and gives me the message below in Event
 Viewer. &nbsp;When I open the file up on the same PC as a different administrator account, the file opens up no problem. &nbsp;However, when I try to open the xls with the user's account (who has been added to the local administrator group on the PC) the event below
 is created? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Excel and Windows are completely up to date as the updates get pushed out every week.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Styles lose their keyboard shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>Every once in a while, the custom keyboard shortcuts that I have assigned to my styles get lost, and I have to assign them all over again. I thought this had to do with the PC or Word crashing (normal.dotm not having a chance to close properly), but I think
 it happens even without a crash having occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advice what might be going on? Thanks!</p>

            <p>If you have modified a style in a given document, and you selected the radio button for "Only in this document" rather than "All documents based on the [whatever] template," then the styles will be limited to that document. If the document was based on the
 Normal template, and you selected the latter radio button, then they should be saved there provided Normal is being saved properly.&nbsp;This of course affects only new documents--not documents created before you modified the styles, though the keyboard shortcuts
 should be effective for all documents that contain the styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check the shortcut key assignments and resave them if necessary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the Ribbon and choose <strong>Customize the Ribbon</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Customize the Ribbon and keyboard shortcuts</strong> dialog, beside "Keyboard shortcuts" in the bottom left corner, click
<strong>Customize...</strong></li><li>In the <strong>Customize Keyboard</strong> dialog, in the <strong>Categories</strong> list, select
<strong>Styles</strong>. </li><li>In the list of styles, select one of the ones for which you have assigned a shortcut. Note that the list will display only those used in the current document, so you may need to add some paragraphs in the relevant styles before doing this.</li><li>"Current keys" should show the shortcut&nbsp;you assigned.</li><li>If it doesn't, assign it again and make sure that "Save changes in" is set to "Normal.dotm."</li><li>Click <strong>Close</strong> to close the <strong>Customize Keyboard</strong> dialog.</li><li>You'll be back in the <strong>Word Options</strong> dialog; select the <strong>
Advanced</strong> tab.</li><li>Under <strong>Save</strong>, make sure the box for "Prompt before saving the Normal template" is checked, then click
<strong>OK</strong> to close.</li><li>Now quit Word. If you are not prompted to save the Normal template, then that's the problem: something is causing the template not to be saved.</li></ol>
<p>At this point you have two recourses, one long-term and one immediate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ultimately, you'll need to find out why Normal.dotm is not being saved. Almost always this is the result of a poorly written add-in. One add-in that is notorious for preventing the Normal template from being saved is the PDF Complete add-in. You'll need
 to check the <strong>Add-ins</strong> tab in <strong>Word Options</strong> to identify likely culprits and temporarily disable them. Long-term you may decide to uninstall them.</li><li>Meanwhile, just to make the changes you want and save them, you can open the Normal template directly, make the desired changes, and save the template. If you know how to navigate to the Templates folder and open Normal.dotm, you can do that, but here's
 a quick way to open it without browsing:</li></ol>
<span>In Word, press <strong>Alt+F11</strong>; the Visual Basic Editor opens. Press
<strong>Ctrl+G</strong> to activate the Immediate window. In that window, type (or paste)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument<br />
<br />
and press <strong>Enter</strong>. The Normal template opens, but note that it may not be on top of all windows. You can close the Visual Basic Editor. Make the desired changes to the Normal file, and then save and close it. If the changes you have made have
 not been recognized as changes (the <strong>Undo </strong>button is not activated), press
<strong>Spacebar</strong>, then <strong>Backspace </strong>to "dirty" the file, thus ensuring that the template will actually be saved.

            Do you know of an actual technical support line for Skype? I could not seem to find one where I could talk to somebody that would be like a real Tech person. Instead of an end-user trying to figure out why the damn thing doesn't work.

    <title>Changing outlook.com user name - still displaying original name after - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changing outlook.com user name - still displaying original name after changing</h2>
                    <p>I just set up an outlook.com email account for a local charity I support, and when going through the process of set up online it asks for a name and surname. I initially set it up in the name of the co-ordinator of the committee, thinking I could add in
 a display name using the generic email address. However when I sent a test email (despite chaging the user name in the profile settings) it still appears in this person's name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want the email to come 'from' the committee not the individual as this person may change over time, and whilst in the short term it is fine, it isn't sustainable.</p>
<p>Other than deleting the account and waiting for the email address to be available again (!), I can't see a way of changing these settings.</p>
<p>On the webmail screen it shows the incorrect name when you hover over the avatar and then when you click through it has the correct 'group' username - which is even more confusing.</p>
<p>Hope someone can help, am finding the help section confusing, so apologies if this has been asked and asnwered, but I couldn't find a query that matched mine, or with an answer that worked.</p>

<p><br />
What would probably be best would be to have the different elements of the address in different columns of the Excel data source so that there are no carriage returns.</p>
<p>Another way of overcoming the issue&nbsp;may be to use the Replace facility to replace "_x000D_" with ^l or ^p</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 cannot connect to Office365, while Outlook 2016 has no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jvd_030  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 cannot connect to Office365, while Outlook 2016 has no issues</h2>
                    <p>Just want to see if anyone has any thoughts on what may be causing this. Using an on-premise Exchange 2013 server in a hybrid setup. Some mailboxes have been moved to Exchange Online, the majority is still on-premise. My mailbox is hosted on Exchange Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the move took place I still was working with Outlook 2013 on my PC. After the move Outlook 2013 failed to connect to the mailbox. Basically it keeps asking for the password and when I cancel that Outlook comes back with 'Can't start Microsoft Outlook.
 Cannot open the Outlook window. Unable to open the set of folders. Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. There is a problem with the network or maintenance is being performed on the Microsoft Exchange server'. Moving the mailbox back from Exchange Online to on-premise
 solved the issue, moving it back to Exchange Online reintroiduced the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then removed Office 2013 from my computer, and installed Office 2016, which connected without any problem whatsoever. The Office 2013 installation on our RDS environment however is still having issues connecting to Exchange Online. I can't open my Exchange
 Online hosted mailbox on there, while mailboxes on the on-premise machine open without any problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically that tells me the configuration of everything (both inside the network, and on the internet) is set appropriatly since Office 2016 has no issues connecting. But Office 2013 remains with having problems connecting to the Exchange Online environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way forward would be to remove Office 2013 from the RDS environment and install Office 2016. This however cannot be done due to a legacy application (which is a core-business application) that is completely unsupported under Office 2016. Since it's
 core-business, and Office 2013 is the last version of Office that is supported, I'm kind of stuck here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can figure out why Outlook 2013 has issues connecting to Exchange Online, and get that to work, we can atleast move forward with moving mailboxes off our on-premise machine and onto Exchange Online. Otherwise I'm stuck leaving the mailboxes on-premise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to do so, I downloaded <a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/</a> to the RDS server, and ran it to see what it would show us in terms of problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was found that the network and connectivity to Exchange Online were reported to be fine. From the reported XML it's also shown that the hostname outlook.office365.com is being resolved to a couple of IP addresses. There is a warning that the used proxy-server
 might cause latency, but it's not more than a warning. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual verification is where the issue seems to be, which reports that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Title&gt;The verification endpoint is checked for -emailaddress-.&lt;/Title&gt;<br />
&lt;Result&gt;False&lt;/Result&gt;<br />
&lt;Duration&gt;00:01:03&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
&lt;ResultTitle&gt;We can't verify your Office 365 credentials.&lt;/ResultTitle&gt;<br />
&lt;ResultUserMessage&gt;Connectivity verficiation verification-endpoints failed.&lt;/ResultUserMessage&gt;<br />

&lt;ResultUserMessage&gt;A problem occurred with one of the certificates that is required by Outlook to safely communicate with Office 365. Contact your system administrator to resolve this problem. You can find more information via this hyperlink: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=808278.&lt;/ResultUserMessage&gt;<br />
&lt;ResultAdminMessage/&gt;<br />
&lt;ResultSupportMessage&gt;We couldn't retrieve the external SSL certificate. We could not validate the SSL-certificate because the SSL-negotiation failed. This can be caused by a network error or a problem with the installation of the certificate. System.Net.Sockets.SocketException

 hostname, Int32 port) bij Microsoft.Online.CSE.HRC.Analysis.Analyzers.AutoD.SSLCertificateAnalyzer.CollectSSLCertificate()&lt;/ResultSupportMessage&gt;<br />
&lt;AdvancedHttpResponseInfo/&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I did not specifically check that whole bit on my system when trying to connect with Outlook 2013, and the above is from our RDS environment (which I'm now&nbsp;scrutinizing to see&nbsp;if it's resolvable) we did have multiple users that found they had issues
 on their PC's connecting with Outlook 2013, which all were resolved as soon as Outlook 2016 was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea as to what might be causing the issue, and how to resolve it (without moving to Office 2016... That's something we plan on doing once the core-business app supports that, which won;'t be until 2019 at the least).

<p>
</p><p>Hi JvD_030,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the detais. Outlook 2013 has been out of support since 10/4/2018. There are several reasons could cause the issue. First of all, I’d like to suggest the following steps to confirm if it is caused by the incorrect password cached in credential
 storage:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close your Outlook.</li><li>Type the words credential manager in the search box in your computer to open the Credential Manager.</li><li>Under the Generic Credentials, delete the entries which contain Outlook in its name, you can even delete all the entries if you like.</li><li>Then close the Credential Manager and restart your Outlook. It will ask for the credential of your account, just type the password in and check the option Remember the Password in the sign in page.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please kindly give it a shot and tell us how it goes at your convenience. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's an RDP environment, which I don't habitually use, I've cleared by profile on there multiple times for other tests, so I doubt something is really cached.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still... I created an icon to start the credential manager (took a bit of searching to find the commandline to start it: rundll32.exe keymgr.dll, KRShowKeyMgr), started it and found no entries in there. It's completely empty, so that's not the cause of the
 issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated, on my personal PC using Outlook 2013 to the Exchange Online box failed, but just removing it, and replacing it with Outlook 2016 solved everything without any credential changes whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the RDP I've pushed to upgrade to Office 2016 over the existing 2013, but as stated, the core business application would drop into an unsupported state. And that's a risk we are not willing to take as a company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a project going that will move the core business application to a new environment with a newer version that will (out of the box) support Office 2016, but the implementation for that won't happen till December 2018. Which means that until that time
 I'm stuck using Office 2013 on the RDP environment (despite it's EOL status). </p>
<p>
</p><p>And if Outlook 2013 can't properly communicate with Exchange Online, that means I'm dead in the water for the migration that the company wants to have the mail stored in the cloud.

</p><p><span>Hi JvD_030,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the details. Please try the following steps to see if it works for you. Please help check if Outlook is in a compatibility mode:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open My Computer/Local Disk C/Program Files/Microsoft Office/Office 15/Outlook.exe.</li><li>If you are using a 64-bit machine, go to C:/Program Files x86/Microsoft Office/Office 15/Outlook.exe.</li><li>Right click on Outlook.exe and click on Properties and then click on Compatibility tab. Check if you have any check mark in any of the compatibility mode options. Make sure you also click on the option "change settings for all users" tab at the bottom of
 the same screen and look for similar check boxes in the window.</li><li>If you see any check boxes in the compatibility mode options, uncheck all the boxes and click on Apply and OK.</li><li>Try to open Outlook and check the result.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the above method fails, create new profile and check if you are able to open Outlook, refer the link below to know on how to create profile:</p>

<p>It's a 32-bit application. Logging onto the RDP server itself, and checking the compatibility settings for Outlook.exe yields no results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.exe has NO settings for compatibility mode.&nbsp; As stated I've removed my profile and recreated it numerous times on the environment, so a new profile (unfortunatly) also does not yield any results.

<p>If I clear the user profile and the problem persists, doesn't that mean no 'LastKnownGoodUrl' exists?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also... If I remove Office 2013 and just plain install Office 2016 everything works, so that would also hint at the fact that the autodiscover information is solid.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... Logged on to the RDP session, and verified the key. The key did not exist.
</p>
<p>So created the key, went back and started Outlook 2013. No change in behavior. Outlook still comes with an authentication window (during the 'Profile is loading' phase of Outlook starting), showing my mailaddress as the one logging in, and asking for a password.
 Filling in the password still results in a re-appearance of the authentication query, hinting at the fact that it can't authenticate me for some reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cancelling the authentication comes back with the aforementioned error: that "Microsoft Outlook can't be started. Can't open the Outlook-window due to the folders not being available. Exchange is not available. There is a problem with the network or maintenance
 is being performed on the Microsoft Exchange server". </p>

<p>Sounds promising... But unfortunatly it doesn't change the behavior. Outlook 2013 still continues to ask for credentials.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your statement on the MAP/HTTP however did give me some means to see about manually configuring the settings, which I found something on

https://oit.colorado.edu/tutorial/office-365-outlook-windows-manual-exchange-configuration</a> on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunatly that one seems to be even less inclined to work than the autodiscover settings. :(

    <title>Run Query and display query results in a Form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catherinehardy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Run Query and display query results in a Form</h2>
                    <p>I'm sure this is very basic, but I need to know how to run a query which then filters the form to only show those records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a form for entering client information (called "Clients") as well as a search form and query that allows the user to search for any category within the Client form. Once the user types in their search criteria and clicks on the "Search" button,
 the results are shown in a table format. All I want is for the results to automatically filter the Clients form when the user hits the search button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I had originally planned to just use the Filter Form function, but because I have several connected/dynamic combo boxes, the filter form isn't the best option.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone provide directions on how to create the macro or VBA code for this?</p>

            <p>That's why I prefer using filters rather then setting criteria. I'm curious as to why your combos are preventing using a filter.</p>
<p>

            <p>When we use the filter, the first combo box will have all the drop down menu options, but the second combo box has no drop down options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example... when we fill out the form, we choose a State and that limits the County options in the next combo box and the County limits the Town combo box options. When we go to filter, all the State options show up, but there are no choices in the County
 or Town combo boxes (with or without choosing a State option first). I assumed there was no way to fix this, but if there is a way I'd LOVE to try it!</p>

<p>
</p><p>The real issue with the combo box drop downs not showing up in the filter form is for another option besides State/County/Town. We have options for Property Class and Property Use. We have a list of about 100 different property uses that fall under 7-8 property
 classes. So it's much easier to choose the property class first and then choose from a shortened list of Property Uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Rowsource for the Property Class is:&nbsp;SELECT [tblPtyClass].[PropertyClass] FROM tblPtyClass;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rowsource for the Property Use is : &nbsp;SELECT [qrytblSalesUses].[Use] FROM qrytblSalesUses;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both combos have an After Update code to requery both Property Class &amp; Property Use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They both work perfectly fine in the form, and when in the Filter Form view, the Property Class combo box displays all the options, but no options show up in the Property Use combo.</p>

            <p>The search form has to remain open for the reference to work. If you are trying to filter Property use based on Property class, do you have criteria in qrytblSalesUses that filters for Property class? What is the SQL for that query. It may be that query
 reacts to the filter and that's why you are having a problem. You should have a table of uses:</p>

<p>PropertyUseID (PK Autonumber)</p>

                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; First post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2013 and Windows 10. Besides English, I have the Russian keyboard enabled, although the problem occurs with either keyboard active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to insert Unicode characters in Word with no problem, but with Excel I get a bell sound and no action.&nbsp; This happens when I type alt+x regardless of whether there is a unicode number or the cell is empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Oddly, I CAN use this method to insert a symbol when I am creating a new AutoCorrect option.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the AutoCorrect function doesn't seem to function mid-word where I want most instances of the symbol (a combining acute accent mark).]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            ALT+X trick doesn't work for Excel. You will have to use Character Map for this purpose. Just type Character in Windows Search and you will get it. (You can also use Insert &gt; Symbol but this is not user friendly whereas Character Map is very user friendly)

            Unfortunately the help as well as the article both mentioned this because of oversight (after all created by humans). This is well known in Excel circle that this is mentioned in help / article but doesn't work.

<h2>            Sharepoint online - no property window on uploading document</h2>
                    
<p>In Sharepoint online we have a document library. The users can upload documents and have to fill out some metadata. The usual "Name" and "Title" and a custom "Categorie" which is a choice from three options.</p>
<p>When I upload a document I get the property window to fill out the metadata. However when my collegae does the same, she does not get the property window at all. The document is uploaded with the defaults.</p>
<p>What can be the cause of this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks, Mike</p>

Hi Blom,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the link. &nbsp;I downloaded the software and installed it onto my WinXP laptop and now I am able to view my .XPS files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is one thing I need to check with you, I read from the download details that this software is able to view and generate XPS files but when I tried to save a page in xps format, it did not appear on my desktop or folder at all. &nbsp;It just disappear
 into nowhere when I click save. &nbsp;How come? &nbsp;Is this only a viewer? &nbsp;In my Windows7 I can create as well as view xps files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please advise.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you</div>

            <p>I haven't used the XPS viewer/creator with Windows XP, but I would assume that it installs as a printer icon so that you can convert files by "printing" them; you should then be prompted for a filename and path.

Alternatively, maybe the conversion uses some default path. Have you tried looking in the My Documents folder? Have you tried searching for files with the XPS extension?</p>

<h2>            OneNote massive memory consumption on large-ish notebooks</h2>
                    I am using OneNote 2010 on a Lenovo X230T as a lab notebook for my graduate research. Naturally, almost all of my notes are ink. The notebook itself is only 178 MB on disk, but it contains a large number of drawings and schematics, all in ink, as well
 as a large number of pages with typed notes. In the last few days I have noticed that, when inking, OneNote will completely freeze my computer every 5-10 minutes or so, and stay frozen for 5-10 minutes. I am designing an instrument that will cost a little
 over a hundred thousand dollars and these drawings are important so rather than do a hard reboot I wait it out, and let the computer start responding again. Every time this happens I notice that OneNote's memory consumption has skyrocketed from around 150
 MB to over 1 GB, peaking at 2.75 GB! Once this has happened I have no choice but to reboot my computer. Even when I close OneNote, and it's displayed memory consumption returns to normal levels, no other programs will run and I have an unusually large number
 of hard faults. It's like the memory stays full even after I close OneNote.<br />
<br />
I used OneNote 2007 extensively in my undergraduate engineering courses to take notes and store homework for classes. I noticed that large single pages would crash the notebook in the same manner, but the overall size of the notebook didn't seem to matter.
 The solution was simple, separate my work over multiple pages at logical break points. It seems in OneNote 2010 that the size of the entire notebook is also an issue. I can make more notebooks, and that's probably what I will resort to doing, but at some point
 the separation will be ridiculous as I try to span the same project over multiple notebooks.<br />
<br />
I am curious, has anyone else had the same issues? Does anyone else find that large notebooks hog memory and freeze the computer? Is there a known fix for this issue?<br />
<br />
Lastly, I know this sounds dumb, but I live in Seattle and would gladly meet with any Microsoft dev or enthusiast to document the problem.<br />

            Can you provide more info on the system configuration.<br />
<br />
Check if there is anything recorded/captured in the event logs:<br />

            I am using a Lenovo X230T with an i7-3520M CPU, 4 GB of RAM, a 500GB HD, and Windows 7 Pro. It has both touch and pen input. I'm not sure what would be helpful about the system configuration so let me know what specific details you are looking for if that
 doesn't cover it. I doubt this is a fruitful avenue, however, since I've had this problem on two different machines with completely different hardware setups. My undergrad laptop was an AMD Turion with 2 GB of RAM, a 250GB HD, and it had the old style pen
 input before WACOM technology.<br />
<br />
The only thing I see in the event viewer near the times when OneNote has frozen is an error in the Service Control Manager, but that error is not always the same application. In one instance it was the SysMain, in another the upnphost service, etc. If you would
 like more specific details from the event viewer, just indicate what they are and I will track them down.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

<p>You may run the fixit from the following article to completely remove all traces of Office 2010 from the machine:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how to remove OVI contacts and OVI store from my e71 in the Applications directory. &nbsp;Both of these apps are useless and don't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a remove in Applications for OVI contacts but it does not remove the application and there is no remove option for OVI store on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
