<h2>            Problems with Skype Instant Messaging</h2>
                    Help! My Skype instant messaging isn't working correctly. My boss and I have used it daily for months and now all the sudden she is not receiving my messages although they show up as "delivered" on my end. She is able to Skype with other employees, but
 my messages are not going through to her. We have both updated our systems. Please help!&nbsp;

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/37a4c8b0-11ac-4bd9-83f8-538b3c5b8122" title="KymberliEastman">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you mentioned your contact does not receive any of your instant messages though the messages are delivered on your end. Have you tried to check on her account and make sure that you are messaging the correct Skype account. Ask of her the Skype
 Name she is seeing on her app and double check it on yours. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are messaging the correct one, check if any of you two are blocked with each other. This is also a possible reason why she is not able to receive your messages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to update your Skype applications and see if the same would still persist. Another alternative would be checking if she could see the message through Skype for Web in this link:
<a href="https://preview.web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://preview.web.skype.com</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the updates. </p>

            No unfortunately we have completed all the suggestions above and nothing is resolving the issue. We have both updated our Skype and restarted our computers. Neither of us is blocked either. This problem has been on and off for the past week. Yesterday
 we Skyped just fine, but the day before it didn't work. Now today again it isn't working. Please help! Thank you!

<br />
<br />Thank you for your feedback, I am so sorry to hear that.
<br />
<br />From what you describe, a more technical help is required to further analyse. As such I will immediately reroute your request to a higher level of Skype support who will help you address the issue.

<h2>            No speaker sound for non admin users</h2>
                    <p>Hej.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home (64), version 10.0.15063 updated as of today (21 Sep 2017) &nbsp; on a ASUS V230IC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use an administrator account i have sound both from built in speakers and when I plug in headphones I have sound in them.</p>
<p>But if I login with a non admin acccount I have no sound from speakers but I have sound in headphones, when plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in contact with ASUS support but did not get any solution other than "reinstall".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I reinstalled using the reinstall option in W10, but did not resolve the problem. A number of ASUS applications got installed in the "reinstall".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled again but this time with a Microsoft DVD to get a clean install with no ASUS applications.</p>
<p>OK, I had to download and install ASUS driver for sound card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realtek Audio Driver V6.0.1.7647<br />
ASUS Audio Sound Control Driver V1.00.02</li></ul>
<p>but the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More testing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start computer</li><li>Login as an administrator, speaker sound OK</li><li>Switch to a non admin account, speaker sound OK</li><li>Reboot computer</li><li>Login to a non admin account, no speaker sound, but headphones OK, when connected.</li></ol>
<p>And yes, I have used the Windows Troubleshooter but did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion?</p>
<p>/Sten-Åke</p>
<p>

<h2>            How do I reset Windows Update components&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Now that I keep coming in this forum via Forums Home/Windows Vista/Windows Update...</p>
<p>This is still a Vista (home premium) case.</p>
<p>I checked the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</span></a>&nbsp;and tried the aggressive fix.</p>
<p>It didn't work. Neither did running CheckSUR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I tried to do it by myself.</p>
<p>I got upto "<span>regsvr32.exe mshtml.dll"</span></p>
<p><span>That failed saying that the dll is already there, but the initialisation entry point could not be found.</span></p>
<p><span>The same happened with the registration after that too.</span></p>
<p><span>It all started from trying to install SP1 manually (it failed) and tried to figure out the cause of the failure</span></p>
<p><span>0x800F081F (CBS_E_SOURCE_MISSING ).</span></p>
<p><span>It looked like both defender and windows update were broken (probably caused by a failing RAM during auto-update).</span></p>
<p><span>CBS didnt initialize and complained about some container and there were problems setting some</span></p>
<p><span>Error Failed to find the CixTarget for Container ...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Error DpxException hr=0x80070002</span></p>
<p><span>and CBS Failed to set some SQM value</span></p>
<p><span>No viruses nor malware has been found.</span></p>

<p>Lets Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace corrupted files. To do this, follow the article</p>

<p>Please answer <strong>all of the following questions</strong> by number in your next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Is Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) or SP2 installed?</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton or McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>1. Like I said, I was trying to install SP1 without success.</p>
<p>2. Defender is broken too (corrupt DLLs, doesn't start)</p>
<p>There is Avast, but the background shields were turned off.</p>
<p>3. No.</p>
<p>4. Norton was there, but I removed it. I think I used the removal tool to make sure it's gone.</p>

<p>Support for Vista Gold (no Service Packs) ended on Tuesday, 13 April 2010. Computers still running Vista Gold "will no longer receive software updates [i.e., updates released on &amp; after 22 April 2010!!] from Windows Update" until SP1 has been installed (which
 will require that several Prerequisite Updates be installed first). See <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2010/04/13/end-of-support-for-windows-vista-with-no-services-packs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • What does it mean if my version of Windows is no longer supported?<br />

<p>That being said, free unlimited installation and compatibility support for Vista SP1 has been extended a third time &amp; now runs through 30 August 2010. Some issues may require more advanced support for which there is a charge.</p>

    <title>The economy in Forza 4 feels way too easy. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolflord92  say:</h3>
<h2>            The economy in Forza 4 feels way too easy.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, granted I race a lot more online against my brothers and friends in private races, but Forza 4 just feels way to easy to level up and build cars fast.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love the game. However, when you give away the car upgrades for free and bonus cars left and right I don't feel that I have quite the challenge that I had in the older Forza games... For instance in the older Forza games, my friends
 and I would create weekly challenge races for ourselves. The challenge usually consisted of a certain car class and a fixed number of tracks and races. At the end, the losers of the challenge would have to "Gift" their cars to the winner. We can still do that
 in Forza 4, but with the cars and the credits so easy to come by; the challenge feels like a lot less of a risk than it&nbsp;was before. It also seems that with this abundance of cars and money&nbsp;that&nbsp;the Aution House isn't as cool as it once was.</p>
<p>Last, I&nbsp;almost feel&nbsp;like Forza 4 hit the ceiling with cars and tracks... There's&nbsp;just so many cars available in Forza 4 that I really don't even see the need to go and download anything. (That is unless they somehow manage to come out with a Porsche pack.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;so far only one of my prize cars been one of those 10 million credits cars. I have a million credits or so, I am level 35 I think, and I don't see being able to afford the other way expensive cars anytime soon. &nbsp;the free parts help a lot but I think the
 economy in forza has been in the past and continues to be a huge negative. it's a race game, I want to play racing, not economy/auction house/designs graphics for sale/ or sell tunes I love that others may hate. for me, it's about building all those cool older
 cars that are out of reach unless I want to pay for car tokens because the game doesn't allow me to make enough credits through normal play. &nbsp;IMO they should bail on the economy and make an actual racing sim rather than try to be everything for everybody....
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; car tokens? c'mon, several of us jokingly predicted the idea of car tokens when we couldn't afford the cars in the last 2 games without becoming a slave to the auction house. greed has gotten the better of turn 10.......</p>

<p>I agree with al joneson. &nbsp;What appeals to me about Forza is the actual racing simulation, in different kinds of cars. &nbsp;I don't care at all about achievements or having to earn experience points or tokens. &nbsp;For me the current balance is fine. &nbsp;Someone like
 me who just wants to race and try different cars can easily get a decent selection of cars without having to think too much about the economy aspect of the game. &nbsp;Yet there is an economy there for people who do like that sort of thing. &nbsp;I'd really dislike
 it if the economy aspect was too in-your-face to be ignored.</p>

<p>It is way to easy. But I think it was b/c of outside sources was making money from FM and Turn 10 wasnt making a profit. So if you up the event races maybe people would be patients and not buy credits

<p>Yeah, it is really easy to get credits, and level up etc. Do a rivals mode challenge and complete about 30 laps with all assists off, and watch your credits and XP climb. However, if you're trying to get the Ferrari and Exclusive Taste achievements, you'll
 be grateful for the easy credits. I'm sitting on 9.6 million and I would say that I'm about halfway to getting them...if that</p>

<p>At first I was dubious, but now I like it.</p>
<p>There are so many different things to do in this game, if you do all of it then the economy does seem much more balanced than in previous games. &nbsp;If you frequent the storefront for designs or tune setups then you will need that extra money to be a competitive
 bidder to get the really cool stuff. &nbsp;After level 50 -- which comes pretty quickly -- you don't get any more cars for leveling up and have to buy the rest. &nbsp;If you don't care about those aspects of the game, then, well, the economic system shouldn't matter
 much to you anyway. &nbsp;It's the leaderboards that should be your measuring stick..</p>

            Hi nguyeann7732 
<br />
<br />Presuming that USB bootable Installation Media is created correctly:
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc:
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>1. Secure Boot is disabled</p>

<p>3. Cannot find a specific option that can enable CSM</p>
<p>4. USB Boot enabled</p>

            Hi nguyeann7732
<br />
<br />Most likely that bootable media is not formatted correctly, have you tried booting another PC from that flash drive?
<br />
<br />Why did you use Rufus to create the bootable media, the Media Creation Tool does a better job of creating the installation media . ..

<p>I do not have another PC to attempt to boot.</p>
<p>I’d initially used the MediaCreationTool to create the bootable media but ended up with the same problem: no USB in boot menu (this is why I tried using Rufus to make doubly sure that the USB was actually bootable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried using MediaCreationTool again.</p>
<p>Restarted computer.</p>
<p>Opened Boot Menu.</p>
<p>No USB Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I’m wondering if it’s an issue with the USB itself, but that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I’ve solved the problem. Turns out that simply plugging in the USB drive to the ports on the backside of the PC rather than the front changed something, and “USB Storage Device” finally popped up. Thank you for your patience :)</p>

<p>If you have a 64-bit processor, you are able to *run* 64-bit Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But note that that does *not* mean you are able to upgrade to it. To change the "bitness" of any version of Windows from 32-bit to 64-bit, or vice-versa, requires that you do a clean installation, not an upgrade. Doing a clean installation means that you
 have to also reinstall all you application programs, reconfigure them the way you like them, reconfigure WIndows the way you like it, and reload all your data files from their backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing this varies, but for most people it's a lot of work, and may not be worth the effort. Whether you would get any significant performance improvement mostly depends on how much RAM you have, what applications you run,&nbsp; and whether you are willing to
 replace at least some of your 32-bit programs with 64-bit versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm concerned, for most people doing this isn't worth the effort.</p>

            I just split the drive for a dual boot with Ubuntu. What an amazing OS!<br />
The install setup everthing...and I do mean everything...even the Network connections. I contacted the community. They are working on an automatic updating system for the OS and drivers. Currently it's not convenient for non-savvy PC Users. But once they get
 that system in place. That's going to be the downfall of MS. History shows that once a company reaches a certain level of success they think that they are invincible and start acting in tyrannical manner such as MS taking my ability to update when I want...not
 when they force it on me&nbsp; which has cost me many, many hours of fixing their **** up. And time is money!<br />
<br />
Another year and MS is out of my life forever.

            Hi Glen
<br />
<br />This can be sometimes dependent on the type of graphics adapter you have installed and the supported resolution. 
<br />
<br />Also, it could mean you need to update the graphics driver if you want it to use all of the monitors screen.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?

                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0597d67d-25c4-4c65-bb37-4c1dc86bd084?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0597d67d-25c4-4c65-bb37-4c1dc86bd084?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached this picture because I don't really know what it is or how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first wifi showing is my home wifi. All is well, I can browse the internet just fine. I've had multiple problems with this laptop over the last year, which I will quickly go over now, incase any of this is related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>December 2016 - Multiple errors about various things (namely the Intel(R) Technology Access TAP Driver, the Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller adaptor and the Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260) adaptor) all experiencing what the troubleshooting tool called
 'driver- or hardware related problems'. Eventually my laptop started showing me the blue screen of death (The BIOs screen???) and wouldn't boot past that. Took it to the shop I bought it from and they sent it off to be repaired (I have a care plan with them).
 It came back with the notes that it was a corrupted operating system, Windows 8.1 had been reinstalled and it all seemed well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>January 2017 - Problems arose again, but different from the above. The laptop wouldn't boot up at all. I took it back to the same place to be repaired. It came back with the mainboard (motherboard???) replaced, all was fine for a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>December 2017 - I got the Your PC Ran Into An Error :( screen randomly, whilst watching something I bought on iTunes. I let it do it's thing, but it just ended up going full circle of error messages and the only option I had was to turn off the computer
 and something else that I don't remember. I sent it back to the same place again for repair, it came back with the notes saying that it was again, a corrupted operating system and that they'd reinstalled Windows and updated my BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW, we get to my current problem. I noticed this 'unidentified network' soon after getting my laptop back from the last repair, but because it didn't seem to be affecting my laptop in any way; I could still connect to the internet and everything. I ignored
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today (and I really don't know if this is connected, I'm planning to ask over on Malwarebytes as well, I'm just adding it here so you have as much information as possible) I got a Low Memory error on my laptop, which is strange because I have like, 12gig
 RAM. The screen went black (but still turned on, as in there was light coming from it, not black as in turned off completely) and the only option I had was to press and hold the power button to power down the laptop. I turned it back on, and everything was
 fine other than Malwarebytes - Web Protection was turned off, and wouldn't turn back on. I Googled the issue and reinstalled Malwarebytes. However, when I tried to put in my license key, I kept getting the error 'Unable to connect to license server. Check
 your network settings or contact your system administrator for help'. WHICH (thanks for bearing with me!) brings me back to that 'Unidentified Network'. I've uninstalled MWB, reinstalled, used their MWB clean tool, restarted the laptop multiple times, shut
 the laptop down and turned it back on, all to no avail. Like I said, I have no idea currently if this 'Unidentified Network' is causing this issue, BUT even if it's not, I still want it gone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some notes:</p>
<p>I never download anything illegally. All of my software licences are obtained through their site.</p>
<p>I never download music or TV illegally; everything I own is either bought on iTunes or watched on Netflix.</p>
<p>Same with games; all of the games I own are bought either on Steam or Origin.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be a safe browser; I only visit the same handful of sites on a daily basis, and I always have adblock turned on.</p>
<p>Both Kaspersky and Malwarebytes are scheduled to scan every day, and I never have any alerts from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are my laptop specs, I don't know if you need them...</p>

<p>If anyone could help me with this Unidentified Network issue (and the Malwarebytes one, if you happen to know what's wrong!) I would be extremely grateful. PLEASE bear in mind that I consider myself to be an intermediate user; whilst I'm comfortable gaming
 and browsing, when it comes to repairs and troubleshooting, I have a very, very limited knowledge, so if you could talk me through any fixes in a step-by-step fashion, I would appreciate that a lot! Thank you for your time!<br />

<p>Minha conta foi raqueada e consequentemente o meu xbox live gold perdeu efeito. Como faço para recuperar meu acesso ao xbox live? ainda falta mais de seis meses de conta. A própria empresa me informou o caso e já criei outra conta, porém o acesso ao live
 de 12 meses que adquiri não está sendo reconhecido.</p>
<p>Aguardo retorno</p>

    <title>Why does my taskbar keep changing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bhabrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my taskbar keep changing&#63; </h2>
                    I use&nbsp;my taskbar&nbsp;on the left side, have it set to auto-hide, the width set to about 20 characters, and locked. It has repeatedly reset to about 5-6 characters wide, and still shows as locked. Leave it alone!<br />
<br />
In a perfect world, I'd also be able to show text with the icons, but I still have XP at work to fall back on.

            i am trying to be patient with you people since it's a minor issue compared to my "IE8 closed unexpectedly" problem. From what i read in these forums, the problems bleed over into personal attacks rather quickly.<br />
<br />
i have been able to manage a taskbar for about as long as XP has been in use, and have customized it on more computers than I care to say.
<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to you to move beyond referring me to the basics "and see if your issue gets resolved".

            <p>Many laptops have dedicated hardware switch on the top panel or on the side of the device. For example my HP G60-447CL laptop has a button switch just above the keyboard. Others might have a function key you can use to enable/disable your wireless hardware.
 Check your users manual or download a copy from HP.</p>
<p><a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html</a></p>
<p>Its also possible the wireless hardware is disabled if you connected via&nbsp; wired Ethernet connection. Some HP laptops have a LAN_WLAN switching function that disables wireless when your plugged into an Ethernet network. Its configured in BIOS.</p>

</p><p>We understand the issue you are facing and will assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to some other program which is blocking Windows store from connecting to Windows update servers. I would suggest you to restart the

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would first suggest you to remove all external devices connected to the computer except essential devices like keyboard and mouse and then boot the computer.</span></span></span></p>

                    For the North America subscription that's $6.99 per month, if I make a call to mexico, will i be charged extra besides the $6.99 monthly cost? Like if I'm talking for a long period of time, or if I called mexico multiple times per month? Or is it really
 unlimited calls, with no extra fees/charges, for $6.99?

 PC but enter the laptop's product key? Both my machines are running Vista home premium. The recovery disc is for a Dell desk top and my laptop is a Sony. Is this even possible to interchange the recovery discs? Would I need to download various drivers for
 the laptop before erasing the hard drive? Any further advise would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time. Gary.&nbsp;</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Sorry, but you can not use a Dell Recovery Disk on a Sony.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That applies to all the different Brands.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you have problems with the Back up Disks that you made, , read this information toreinstall Vista:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>There are various methods to reinstall Vista</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no Windows Vista download available from Microsoft.</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>To reinstall Vista using their Recovery Disk/s, you Boot from the 1st Recovery&nbsp;Disk they supply&nbsp;and follow the Manufacturer's instructions to reinstall:</p>
<p>You will have to change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD Drive 1st in the Boot Order:</p>
<p>How to change the Boot Order in BIOS:</p>
<p><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm</font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall Vista back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

<h2>            Recording Devices Tab - all buttons greyed out</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>OS : Vista</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem : </strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Mic (built in for HP laptop) not working</span>.</p>
<p>The Speakers are working fine ! If I access the Vista "<strong>Sound recorder</strong>" application, I get a message "<strong>An audio recording device cannot be found</strong>".</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Further details :</span></strong></p>
<p>When I right click on the sound icon and go to the '<strong>Recording devices</strong>' tab,</p>
<p>1. The device I want to use has a green tick next to it (Working). Obviously not true !!</p>
<p>2. I can't click anywhere within the window to set default or show disabled devices etc.</p>
<p>3. The buttons below, i.e. '<strong>Set Default</strong>' etc. are greyed out and disabled.</p>
<p>4. The Sound window stops responding. It then has to be closed using the task manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;<span>I have already tried uninstalling the drivers repeatedly.&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Fix It</strong> didn't find anything wrong.</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Hey Karan,</span></p>
<p><span>Who is the manufacturer of the sound card?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Uninstall the microphone from devicemanager and restart the computer which will reinstall the generic drivers for the microphone. Then
 check if the device works properly.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, download &amp; install the previous version drivers for sound card and check if it solves it issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. In device manager, expand the sound drivers listed in the device list.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Right click on the sound driver &gt; click Uninstall.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Reboot the computer and install the downloaded software.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Additionally, if you are using any recording program,
</span><span>update or reinstall the recording program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.</span></p>

<h2>            Missing api-ms-win-core-timezone-i1-1-0.dll</h2>
                    I get an error message telling me that a program won't open because the api-ms-win-core-timezone-l1-1-0.dll is missing. &nbsp;The message says for me to reinstall the program to fix the issue. &nbsp;What does that mean and why is/what caused this dll file to go
 missing? &nbsp;

            <p>What happened when you followed the advice and reinstalled the program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What program you were attempting to open when you received this error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you downloaded the installer for this program (e.g., Apple's iTunes), temporarily disable your antivirus program, get a fresh download, and reinstall the program.&nbsp; Then turn your a/v back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have reported fixing this issue by installing the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145</a>),

            <p>I was told by the company that the error message was not on their end and that reinstalling the program would not resolve the issue. &nbsp;I was directed to research the issue to find a resolution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Avast internet security for anti virus but also was "told" by Windows when I checked for security updates that I needed to install some type of interface. &nbsp;That whole message seemed strange to me but because I was in the Windows update window
 did not think that it could be compromised. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Avast has not found anything wrong with my PC either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system restore but still get the missing .dll message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The name of the missing file is actually api-ms-win-core-timezone-l1-1-0.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are popular kinds of error messages when installing/launching third party programs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recreated the problem using Skype as an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fe88ce1-0f37-475b-bbc8-8374cc5916fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fe88ce1-0f37-475b-bbc8-8374cc5916fa" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That file is not included in any Windows installation, Service Pack or update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the developers have used some version of C++ to create their programs and the programs require some runtime files (Dynamic Linked Libraries) to be present in order to install/run and the developers do not include those files with their
 installation (why not?) and the websites for the programs often do not list the prerequisites and requirements of what you need to have installed for their programs to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They think that since the program installs and works fine on their system (because they have all the requirements) that the install will work fine on every other system in the world too.&nbsp; Short sighted thinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These files are not part of or included in a regular Windows installation so no amount of Safe Mode, Clean Boot or sfc /scannow is going to help you or make the missing file magically appear (sorry Microsoft engaged Support Engineer alleged "experts").</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is install the Visual C++ Runtime files and I would start with the 2015 version which you can download from this link (choose the right architecture/bitness for your system):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also install this KB Update if it is not already installed (you can't install it twice):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the installation you shouldn't have to restart your system but do it anyway then see how your install/program launch works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over time you may find that you may need several C++ runtimes installed as you can see here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9786d49-d6f2-409e-8740-2a9a4738cd1e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9786d49-d6f2-409e-8740-2a9a4738cd1e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Having several versions of C++ Redistributable is normal... depending on what third party programs you might have installed.<br />

<p>Hi, I had this same problem and I tried everything. It was very frustrating because I'm practically a dummy in all of this stuff. This is what I did just a few minutes ago and it worked for me. Hope it does for you too.</p>
<p>1. I disabled my anti-virus (I use Avast the free version)</p>
<p>2. Downloaded Microsoft Visual C ++ Redistributable&nbsp;<strong>2012</strong> (I already installed the 2015 version). Maybe your program requires another version of Visual C++</p>
<p>3. Repaired my Microsoft Visual C ++ Redistributable 2015</p>
<p>4. Deleted all setup files for the program that wouldn't open (for me it was iTunes), started a fresh download of it and reinstalled it.</p>
<p>I tried opening it, it worked. Then I turned my anti-virus back on, it's still working.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
