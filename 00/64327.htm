<h2>            Help&#33;  How do I just go to a blank page and type a letter with all the settings so I can indent, center, etc.</h2>
                    OK! &nbsp;I'm very "computer-unfriendly", so how can I just find a blank document/page to type a letter, that has settings for font, indentation, bold, centering, etc. and be able to make copies??? &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;

<h2>            Mousepad locked - Lenovo Z50 Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a Lenovo Z50 laptop about two weeks ago. I've used it three times so far since purchased &amp; opened out of box. Installed Windows 10 on it the day I got it. I went to use my laptop yesterday, and my mouse trackpad has stopped working.
 I've tried the Fn &amp; F6 key (that supposedly locks &amp; unlocks the mouse touchpad) but that does absolutely nothing. I've also tried the F6 key without using Fn and that did nothing as well. I've opened up the touchpad properties through the control panel &gt; devices
 section and tried to enable/disable the touchpad driver, however under the "ELAN" tab of the properties it shows no driver. I've tried re-downloading the driver off the Synaptics website but when I go to open the driver for set up it claims that the files
 are corrupt &amp; to re-download them. I've done this three times and each time the files are still corrupt. The only available/up to date ELAN driver for download is for Windows 8.1, not Windows 10. (Not sure if that has too much to do with it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to do &amp; am running out of ideas!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Emily</p>

    <title>Why is the new Skype OSX&#40;Skype 8&#41; app so bad&#63; Couldn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tt_224  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is the new Skype OSX&#40;Skype 8&#41; app so bad&#63; Couldn&#39;t be worse.</h2>
                    <p>&gt; You can't edit a contact's phone number, regardless whether it's set up on their end or not. So if I want to add a new phone number to a contact, I have to create a new contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; You can't edit your own profile information. If I want to edit my birthday, I have to log into the browser portal. If I don't have a birthday set, there's a "Add birthday" button, and it just opens my browser, only to redirect me to the portal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Same with email, and location. Can't be edited in the app. Indeed, not even clickable in the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All I can do in-app is change my display name, or theme color. Stupendous, if anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And all of this is actually possible if you're using the Windows app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question, why? Just why? It's extremely clear that the OSX app is borderline dysfunctional except sending messages and making calls. Even my grandma wants to know how to change her location and phone number in Skype, and I have to tell her she has
 to log in through the browser-based portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why guys? Have you got no product development team for OSX at all? Why don't you just withdraw the app from the OSX platform at all, or just eliminate the entire profile ****-jazz for Mac users? That's a real question, not a rhetorical one.</p>

<p><span><span>Unfortunately, the old version of Skype on iOS is no longer available.
</span><span>Skype is always making improvements, such as enhanced quality, better reliability, and improved security. Because Skype wants everyone to experience the best it has to offer, it's sometimes necessary
 to retire older versions of Skype, and Skype enabled devices.</span></span></p>

            You should be able to access your Virgin Media email account through its web access portal rather than using either Outlook Express or Windows Live Mail (I assume you mean Hotmail, although the name keeps changing). Go to
<a href="http://www.virginmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.virginmedia.com/ </a>and click on the
<a href="http://email.virginmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">email link</a> at the upper right.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 on a Win7&#47;Win8.1 factory-installed machine. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taurusindigo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 on a Win7&#47;Win8.1 factory-installed machine.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering how this upgrade would work due to the factory settings of my Dell desktop PC. Because of Microsoft's switch to pre-installing without adding on a label on the machine itself, I am worried about this activation. I do not have any sort of
 serial for the Win7 that is currently running on my machine which came pre-installed in 2012, and I have not done much to my machine to take it away from too many factory defaults. I am in the same situation with my Toshiba laptop that came pre-installed with
 Win8.1, and I can't activate some features or whatever without a serial/product code. As it is, I am worried about an upgrade to my OS completely mucking up my computer(s) and having to sink even more money into new copies of Windows in order to get my computer(s)
 back to their proper customized state.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering how this upgrade would work due to the factory settings of my Dell desktop PC. Because of Microsoft's switch to pre-installing without adding on a label on the machine itself, I am worried about this activation. I do not have any sort of
 serial for the Win7 that is currently running on my machine which came pre-installed in 2012, and I have not done much to my machine to take it away from too many factory defaults. I am in the same situation with my Toshiba laptop that came pre-installed with
 Win8.1, and I can't activate some features or whatever without a serial/product code. As it is, I am worried about an upgrade to my OS completely mucking up my computer(s) and having to sink even more money into new copies of Windows in order to get my computer(s)
 back to their proper customized state.</p>

 easier ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and

My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back to your previo

<h2>            Win 7 Search - not working on Mapped Network Drive</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I've seen that quite a few people have been having issues with W7 search on indexed locations but I'm having problems with search on a&nbsp;Mapped Network Drive.</p>
<p>I'm looking for a file with the word 'build' in the file name (an Excel file) and I can see it in Explorer but search doesn't seem to be able to find it. I haven't indexed the location and don't want to as it's a network drive and is rather large and I rarely
 search it so all I want Windows Search to do is trawl through the files in that location&nbsp;and tell me when it finds one that matches my search criteria. I don't care how long it takes, I just want it to work reliably otherwise I can't use it at all...</p>
<p>Any ideas as to why it can't find the file? Or alternatively can someone tell me what happened to the Search Companion? It was very good at doing this simple task...</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Thinqer.</p>

            Not sure if this would help but I had a user with this same issue and after awhile changing all the settings I could find, I found one that did the trick. Under the Folder options go to the Search tab and under how to search check the "Don't use the index
 when searching in file folders for system files" check box close windows explorer and then reopen and try your search again. This worked for me hopefully this will help someone else out there.&nbsp;

            I was having the same problem, but I found that when I was typing into the search box and I clicked on the "see more results" I could click on custom and define which drive I wanted it to search without having to index it. It took a while for it to run,
 but it did eventually locate the file I was looking for.

<br />
<br />Type sound in Start Search, open Sound Control Panel, click on Sounds tab, choose the box to Play WIndows Startup Sound and adjust any other sounds you want.
<br />
<br />Type Themes in Start Search to go to the Themes tab and browse some of the spectacular Windows 10 slideshow themes, including the free ones linked in the Store.  These have sound schemes accompanying some of the most expensive pictures ever taken.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> alingrizzlyking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second life like PSN Home on Xbox&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Back in 2007 I stared to find articles about Microsoft's Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Game Studios - Shane Kim and his meetings with Linden Lab the creators of second life. I was thinking and hoping that Xbox would create a smiler user interface to
 the PSN Home world. I'm still searching for more information on this. My better half has a PS3 and I recently spent time in home building a custom house and decorating it with hundreds of free items I found and items I earned playing free games in the many
 worlds created just for the PSN home experience. Despite how much I love Xbox 360 I am jealous of this feature! What is the likely hood we can look forward to something smiler or an adaptation of Second life its self being added to the Xbox 360 or the Xbox
 720?<br />

<p>I think this feature would be good and step in the right direction, I mean the current avatars do nothing much but provide a 'skin' for an in-game model that uses animation. Nothing else, also with the success of selling avatar items, they would do the same
 with extra 'world' items or themes</p>

What is the x-drive, anyway? &nbsp;Am I screwed, now? &nbsp;And... how do I undo the damage.

 find this drive in File Explorer. If it is still in the File Explorer, it is a system partition. If you don’t find this drive after removing the connected devices, then it probably belongs to that connected device. Since you have already formatted this drive,
 the data stored in this drive might be lost. </font></font></font></p>

<h2>            No Power Options, No Windows Features, and unable to connect to Wireless Printer after ending ExamSoft task from task manager.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: No Power Options, No Windows Features, Other Features Missing</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last week or two, I've noticed a number of features previously functioning/available on my laptop are no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;I used to shut down my laptop under Settings -&gt; Power -&gt; Shut Down, but now when I click Power it says "There are currently no power options available."</p>
<p>- &nbsp;I attempted to use one of the wireless printers at school (that I've used many times before without issue), and I continually received a printer error (though the printer worked fine from other machines).
</p>
<p>- When attempting to re-download the printer driver (since I assumed it had a problem somehow), I went to Control Panel -&gt; Programs -&gt; Programs and Features -&gt; Turn Windows features on and off but no features appeared at all.</p>
<p>- When I use Ctrl + Alt + Delete, the page it takes me to now only offers Switch Users as an option whereas before it used to give me a list including Task Manager (I now have to use Switch Users to get to the shut down button on that login page to shut
 down my laptop).</p>
<p>- If I close my laptop lid and open it again, I used to have to put in my password to sign back in; now it automatically opens back up to the same screen as when I shut it (no login page).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Dell Inspiron 15R that was only bought this past summer so it's not even a year old yet. I've never had any issues with this laptop before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice all these problems began after I used the Task Manager to end task on ExamSoft (exam taking software used by my school). ExamSoft shuts down the rest of the applications on your computer and I used end task while ExamSoft had been booting up,
 so could this have somehow been the cause of all of these problems? Regardless, how on earth do I get my laptop back to the way it was before?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Due to incorrect power settings.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Damaged System Files.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Incorrect Wireless Printer settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the steps listed here and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: <br />
</span></strong><span>Let’s run the power troubleshooter and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press ‘<strong>Windows + W</strong>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the search box, type ‘<strong>Troubleshooting’</strong>, and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on ‘<strong>System and Security’</strong> and click on ‘<strong>Power’</strong> click on next to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:<br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue persists, </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to run System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press “<strong>Windows Key + Q</strong>” to open
<strong>Charms Bar.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Type “<strong>cmd</strong>” without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. On the <strong>left pane</strong>,
<strong>right click </strong>on the “<strong>cmd</strong>” option and select “<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d. Type <span>“<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span>” without quotes and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted
 when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the following steps to change what happens when you close lid of the laptop.</span><span>
 Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Open Power Options </strong>by swiping in from the <strong>right edge of the screen</strong>, tapping
</span><span>Search</span><span> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
</span><span>Search</span><span>), entering </span><span><strong>Power options</strong></span><span> in the search box, and tapping or clicking
</span><span><strong>Power options</strong></span><span>.</span></li><li>Do one of the following:</li><li>If you’re using a desktop or tablet, tap or click <span><strong>Choose what the power button does</strong></span> and under
<strong>Power button settings</strong>, select <span><strong>Sleep</strong></span> and tap or click
<span><strong>Save changes</strong></span><strong>. </strong></li><li>If you’re using a laptop, tap or click <span><strong>Choose what closing the lid does</strong></span>. Then, next to
<span>When I close the lid</span>, choose what you want your laptop to do, when it's running on battery and when it's plugged in, and then tap or click
<span><strong>Save changes</strong></span><strong>. </strong></li><li>When you’re ready to make your PC sleep, just close your laptop's lid or press the power button on your desktop or tablet.</li></ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>Method 3 is already set to do what I want it to do (sleep when I close the lid/hit the power button). HOWEVER, I did notice that the setting for Password Protection on Wakeup IS in fact set to require a password (though I have not had to enter a password
 when coming out of sleep since this problem began). Those options however are greyed out and unable to be changed (though it's set properly anyway, though it isn't working).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4 wasn't an issue because my wireless printer is found and installed, I'm just having errors printing to it.</p>

<h3> scoobydu  say:</h3>
<h2>            install old program using windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am using win10 and have an older version program I would like to install from a disk. The program is Family Tree Maker 2012. In looking at the files on the disk included are the following:</p>
<p>Microsoft.net framework 4 (x64).7zip</p>
<p>Microsoft.net framework 4.7zip</p>
<p>Microsoft windows installer 3.1.7</p>
<p>Desktop.ini</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will loading this damage win10 in any way and if not, will it run on win10? It uses .ftm type files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FTM 2012 specs say it is compatible with older versions of windows including win7 (32 or 64 bit). This was released b4 win10 came out.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t sign in with child MSA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david and roxannekenison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in with child MSA</h2>
                    <p>I created a child account for my son via Windows 10 family safety. When I attempt to sign in to the computer with that account, it accepts the password, but instead of signing in, gives me a "Signed out" message. It is impossible to sign in with this account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an exasperating side note, it is still possible to sign in with the old (Windows 8.1) local account, which used to have parental controls on it, but which now has absolutely no restrictions, because Windows 10 doesn't support family safety on local accounts.
 Only MSA accounts, which forces minors to have email. And which is impossible to use as a sign-in for this computer anyway, so basically Windows 10 completely hosed family safety features. thanks, no thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Any idea why the sign-in does not work? Again, symptom is that the password on the Win10 sign-in is accepted. The spinner spins for a second, but then instead of being signed in, the "Signing Out" status displays, and the screen dumps out to the big photograph
 (lock screen).</p>

            Hi Daniel
<br />
<br />Did that new laptop not come with Windows 10 pre-installed?
<br />
<br />Do you mean you want to transfer a Windows 10 licence from another PC to that new laptop?
<br />
<br />If so, is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . ..

<p>No. The new laptop doesn't come with&nbsp;<span>Windows 10 pre-installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. I want to&nbsp;<span>transfer a Windows 10 license from my old laptop PC to the new laptop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I checked my&nbsp;license in Command Prompt with the command "slmgr -dli" and it said "VOLUME_MAK channel".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is that gonna give me the ability to transfer the Window 10 license??</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And also, I've read some articles said that If my Window is the kind of free upgrade from Window 7, 8.1 then when after successful install new Window10 all I need is just login the Mircosoft account - which attached with the old Window10 I have licensed&nbsp;
 - then it will automatically active&nbsp;</p>

            It depends on whether the 8.1-10 license was OEM or retail, if it was retail then yes it can be transferred to the new PC, if it was OEM then unfortunately the license died/has to remain with the old PC.
<br />If Retail then the license should automatically activate (skip entering a key on installing Windows), if not then you can either choose the ‘I’ve changed hardware’ setting within Windows once installed or call Microsoft &amp; have them activate the license.

<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>

            Unfortunately that means it is a volume license intended for organisations/corporate use &amp; not for home use as this is illegal.
<br />It will transfer but eventually it will be deactivated &amp; may even be deactivated on install. You’d have to purchase a new home license.

            Hi Daniel
<br />
<br />Yes, in an ideal world, just logging into your Microsoft Account will be enough to re-activate Windows, if the licence key is a Retail licence, this however, this rarely works . . ..
<br />
<br />You say your licence key is showing as a MAK key, was that device attached to a company volume licence at any point?

    <title>Presence Unknown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rossmcduff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Presence Unknown</h2>
                    I have read through a lot to try to help this situation. We have Skype for Business 2016 clients, 2013 Skype for Business server. It appears with a recent change in our Exchange server environment, many have presence unknown. Also, when the server was
 set up our domain was company.corporate.com but that has changed to corporate.com. When someone tries to connect to a 'Presence unknown' person it comes up with an error and refers to the most recent domain e.g. We couldn't reach&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;to
 send this message. Even though Bob Smith logged into Skype with 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it permitted it. Hope this makes sense to all. We use Office 2016 x86

<h2>            SD card keeps randomly disconecting and reconnecting - please HELP</h2>
                    <p>Hello knowledgeable people.<br />
</p>
<p>I have a persistent problem on my Lenovo Yoga 2 13, and any SD card will be randomly disconnected and reconnected again. Sometimes I manage to import some pictures, mostly not. It does it with any SD card (have about 20, various brands and sizes), and with
 any software (normally I use Nikon transfer 2, but it's the same if I try to copy files in Windows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the build in SD slot, I have reinstalled and updated all drivers and controllers. The problem is not caused by an update - I had this problem for a while, could not find any solution, so I was using the old PC to transfer pictures. There in no
 problem with other USB ports - I use several external drives and have no problem. I have no old PC now, so I need to fix it<br />
</p>
<p>I have searched extensively first, but did not find the solution.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.<br />
</p>
<p>Jiri</p>

            Does the problem occur if you use the built in Import pictures and videos wizard?
<br />
<br />Connect the SD card.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar
<br />Click This PC
<br />Right click the SD card
<br />Click Import Pictures and Videos
<br />
<br />Check to see if it disconnects or not.

<p>Yes, that is what I said in my question. It happens also if I do not do anything - put card in, it will disconnect and reconnect.</p>
