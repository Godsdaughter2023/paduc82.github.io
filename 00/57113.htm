<h2>            Lost USB for the Arc Touch Mouse</h2>
                    As the title states, I lost the USB connector for my mouse so I was wondering if there's any workaround or site to just buy a new usb, maybe a universal one?&nbsp;

            I had the same experience a few years ago, the Microsoft rep I spoke to told me the USB dongle is unique to each mouse and I cannot just purchase a replacement.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ctrl&#43;P is not working</h2>
                    Ctrl+P is not working. Other shortcuts are working fine, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+A. But Ctrl+P isn't working. It is not a particular application, it is not working in any application. Had the sticky keys off too, so no issue with the sticky keys. Tried uninstalling
 the drivers for keyboard and restarting and installing drivers again. But didn't work. Tried updating them too but it already had the latest drivers installed.

            Hi, Japinder 
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend you check these methods to repair any Windows problem.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<p>I too have the same problem. It suddenly started about 10 days to two weeks ago. Update related? I attempted to use your suggestion:</p>
<p>•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth <br />
•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth <br />
•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup <br />
•- sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran CMD as administrator, but after I type "•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth" and hit enter, it does not let me enter the next line (or anything else) at all. Any suggestions as to what I'm doing wrong?
</p>

            It worked for me. I had an old program that had captured this shortcut and wouldn't let other apps use the shortcut. I uninstalled the program and it started working fine for me.

    <title>Free Upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lallenhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free Upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7. I have signed up for the Windows 10 upgrade on July 29th using the "Get Windows 10" icon on the taskbar. I received an email from Microsoft &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;. Two days later I formatted my hard drive and reinstalled Windows
 7 due to a crash. Now I no longer see the GWX icon on the taskbar. I am using a legitimate copy of Windows 7 with the proper product code, so that is not the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that the C:\Windows\winsxs folder is still on my computer. &nbsp;My question is, "Am I still eligible for the Windows 10 download without having the GWX visible?" Please let me know what else I need to do to get my copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allen Hill</p>

            <p>I know that when I recently reinstalled windows 8.1, during the initial setup process, updates were downloaded and I then was asked if I wanted to reserve my copy of windows 10. Once the setup was complete the Get Windows 10 icon wasn't present in my taskbar
 but the reservation was active nonetheless. Maybe it's the same with windows 7 setup?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To asnswer your second question, even if you don't reserve, you will still be able to upgrade through windows update like the people who did reserve. The download page for the ISO's used for clean install haven't been published yet.</p>

<h2>            How Do You Remove A Network Shortcut That No Longer Exists&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I used to have a windows home server that hosted music and photos for my home network. A link to this network location appears in both my music and photo libraries. I now no longer have the windows home server but the network shortcuts in my Music and Photo
 libraries are still there. Is there any way to remove them? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask this question because I use Windows 7 backup and every time I back up, Windows Backup reports it was unable to back up some files. When I check the details of this message, I see that Windows Backup is still looking for my windows home server paths
 that exist in my Music and Photos libraries but I cannot just get rid of those shortcuts.</p>

            I'm getting the same code upon login.&nbsp; &nbsp;It only happens when I boot from being shut down.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tried turning off sleep mode and removing my pin and entering a new one as one article I read suggested.&nbsp; &nbsp;No luck, still the same annoying issue.

<h2>            surface book 2 base battery drain after detach and attach the clipboard</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have an battery issue with my SB2, when both battery get fully charged then I detach and after a sec attach the clipboard to the base, base battery shows 75% battery and i don't know what happen to the 15% of it!</p>
<p>I reinstall my windows last night and get all of drivers and updates, but this is still happen to me.</p>
<p>I think the problem is when both battery getting full and the system suspend the batteries, laptop use the base battery although its plugin and charging, but the percentage shows both battery are fully charged and when I detach and attach the clipboard the
 real percentage show up.</p>

<h2>            Will changing CPU deactivate Windows 10 OEM</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have built my PC and am running an OEM Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to upgrade my CPU from a PCI Express maximum of 28 lanes to one with 40 lanes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've search these forums and&nbsp;found information about upgrading the&nbsp;motherboard causing the OEM license&nbsp;to become invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about&nbsp;upgrading the CPU?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Would that result in&nbsp;having to&nbsp;purchase a new license,&nbsp;needing to contact Microsoft to reactivate, or have no effect at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks very much!</p>

<h2>            PDF extension not opening and it automatically changes the extension to .ext</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Mail app of windows 8.1 , I can open certain <strong>PDF</strong> files in the reader . But some of them get automatically converted to
<strong>.EXT</strong> and these cannot be opened as it give a message " <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
we can't open this file. do you want to save it and try opening it with another app
</span>" . 'Open with' option doesnt help as it never happens , also if saved then the file is saved to
<strong>.EXT</strong> , which I have to rename it to <strong>.PDF</strong> to open it which is combersome and time consuming.

            <p>Hi Ashish,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked for other files they open in their respective programs , and after applying the above suggestions I restarted the Laptop and checked for each and every attachement they open in their respective programs. But for those mails where the .PDF renamed
 to .EXT dont open . but will give it a thorough test as and when mails arrive with .PDF extension . Is it possible that only mail from certain mail box you get this issue , will update on those

<h2>            typing jumps around randomly- too sensitive to typing</h2>
                    I need help. I believe my touch pad is too sensitive, so when I type, it will jump around and start typing on different lines. It is very time consuming, and takes too much time to email, complete a word doc, and is very frustrating. I have tried to change
 the sensitivity to the touch pad, but that didn't make any difference. What can I do to make this stop. It makes my work triple in time and add way too much frustration, that I want to ditch the computer to another one. Can you help?

            I would disable the touch pad and use a wireless mouse instead. They cost very little.

            This used to happen to me all the time with my laptop. It took a while to realize that the heel of my palm was lightly brushing the touch pad as I was typing on the keyboard. My insertion point/cursor would jump around wildly, sometimes making sweeping
 selections of multiple lines of text that would be replaced by the next keystroke because it happened too fast for me to react in time and stop typing. It was hugely frustrating. I was already using a wireless mouse so the first thing I do now when I boot
 up my laptop is disable the touch pad. No more problems.<br />

            Yes, this has created me to hold my wrists up high when I type to point of uncomfortable typing. I will just disable the touchpad, so thanks for the idea.

<h2>            activation window is blank, what can i do&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Windows XP Pro activation problem after hardware replacement???</span><br />
<br />
I recently had a new motherboard replaced on my pc and the computer shop didnt tell me that it would affect my operating system.&nbsp; After I got my pc back it asked for XP to be reactivated, but I cant reactivate it as the activation window is a blank screen and
 I dont have the cd.&nbsp; The computer shop asked for the product key and its on the side of the computer with a genuine microsoft sticker, but later i was told that the product key isnt working as microsoft is blocking it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case then what options do I have left e.g. contact microsoft and get a new key and tell the computer shop he should be able to activate it since he was the cause of my OS being deactivated?&nbsp;&nbsp; I was being offered the windows xp cd pack to buy
 which I didnt want beofre my computer hardware was changed so feel as though he may have wanted this to happen?</p>
<p>Any ideas or help welcome!</p>

I cant download or run the above test because when i&nbsp;switch the computer on i am given the password screen for windows xp professional and after entering my password am asked to activate my copy of windows and when i click yes i am shown a blank activation
 window with no writing on.&nbsp; Now I have used the wga and windows updates and microsoft security software before and none have shown that my software is not genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After having my hardware replaced its only now that the IT shop claims that replacing the motherboard hasnt affected the OS but i have had verification from other IT specialists that it does and that my OS should have been put right as it was before.&nbsp; I
 was told by the IT shop were my comp was repaired that my product key is blocked but how can this be when its a genuine sticker and i have had no problems before???&nbsp; I have reported the IT shop in question to trading standards who are also suspicious.&nbsp; Also
 because of all this i can not test if the hardware that has been installed by the shop is working or not as it was faulty before.</p>
<p>What next?&nbsp; Can I ring/email microsoft to verify if my product key is ok or not?&nbsp; Oh and I would prefer a free contact number.</p>

I cant download or run the above test because when i&nbsp;switch the computer on i am given the password screen for windows xp professional and after entering my password am asked to activate my copy of windows and when i click yes i am shown a blank activation
 window with no writing on.&nbsp; Now I have used the wga and windows updates and microsoft security software before and none have shown that my software is not genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After having my hardware replaced its only now that the IT shop claims that replacing the motherboard hasnt affected the OS but i have had verification from other IT specialists that it does and that my OS should have been put right as it was before.&nbsp; I
 was told by the IT shop were my comp was repaired that my product key is blocked but how can this be when its a genuine sticker and i have had no problems before???&nbsp; I have reported the IT shop in question to trading standards who are also suspicious.&nbsp; Also
 because of all this i can not test if the hardware that has been installed by the shop is working or not as it was faulty before.</p>
<p>What next?&nbsp; Can I ring/email microsoft to verify if my product key is ok or not?&nbsp; Oh and I would prefer a free contact number.</p>

<div>You should still be able to access the internet either by using C-A-D and using Files.... New Task and entering IEXPLORE.exe (click OK/Run).</div>
<div>If that doesn't work, go into Safe Mode with Networking - you should be able to download the tool from there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suspect that the Sticker Operating System doesn't match the installed OS - what version does the sticker say, and what version does the banner in Safe mode say (or what does WINVER from the Run box say?)<br />
<div>If that is the case, the only way to get back to a legitimate OS is to reformat and reinstall using the correct disks - which your store should have done in the first place.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please try and run the MGADiag tool - and report the versions shown above</div>

            <p>So now what are you supposed to do?&nbsp; I see that the diagnostic tool gives me an ID&nbsp;and I will try to enter that and see what happens.</p>
<p>My problem occurs because I have replaced a hard drive in an old (but still working well) Compaq Presario 715us notebook.&nbsp; It can only use 512MB of memory and therefore won't run Win7 (I've tried and actually got it running,&nbsp;but not well at all).&nbsp; It is
 a 10??? year-old machine that has served us well.&nbsp; It is still running and we need to use it as we are now retired and not able to afford new bells and whistles that are not essential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so angry at Microsoft over these activation issues I could spit.&nbsp; We've owned this machine since it was new and paid for the upgrade to WinXP Pro.&nbsp; I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars with Microsoft over the years and to not be able to activate
 a valid license is shear stupidity on their part.&nbsp; Even worse, Microsoft's telephone activation system doesn't allow for errors such as this and there is no one to call.&nbsp; ET can't phone home.</p>
<p>In this case there was no product ID code displayed on the activation screen.&nbsp; It won't go through the on-line activation process, probably because of the product ID code problem and the automated telephone system can't respond when this error occurs.</p>
<p>I'm at least glad I found this link.&nbsp; I've been through this process many times over the years and I cannot believe that Microsoft&nbsp;can get away with this kind of treatment of good, legitimate customers.&nbsp; If there were competition in this space, I guarantee
 you that they would not have my business again.&nbsp; These kinds of frustration that customers have will eventually bring the demise of Microsoft and all of their good efforts in other areas will be for naught, all because of lousy customer service.</p>
<p>I was in Albuquerque when Bill and Paul first came to town and had an office on San Pedro Blvd. and I've used their products almost since day one, starting with TRS-80 Basic Level One.&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft has done some amazing things over the years, lots of good
 things and some bad, but I've generally supported them.&nbsp; But this activation system is counterproductive and a "real" customer turnoff.</p>
<p>Anyway, Noel Paton, thanks for your posts to help those of us so disgruntled with Microsoft's support on this issue.</p>

            <p>After running the MGADiag program in safe mode and trying to use that information to activate (it didn't work) I ended up getting through the automated telephone system and actually got to a support technician.&nbsp; I first of all asked if I could complete this
 through Windows in safe mode.&nbsp; She said no, that I needed to reboot.&nbsp; I did and the activation window came up again and this time responded correctly, so I was entering the data, and the on-line activation did work this time.&nbsp; Before the activation finished,
 however, the support tech hung up on me.&nbsp; I wish I had gotten a name or ticket number, becasue that was just plain rude of her.&nbsp; I've dealt with Microsoft Support many times over the years, but this is the first time that I've been hung up on and I was just
 following directions.&nbsp; I wasn't angry or out of line in any way.&nbsp; She went off a couple of times and when she came back she asked a question as though she hadn't heard what I had been saying.&nbsp; So I asked her if she had heard me and I repeated what I had said
 about this machine and the reason for the activation requirement.&nbsp; She seemed perturbed and irritated, and didn't respond.&nbsp; I kept telling her what was happening on the screen and that the activation process was proceeding differently than before.&nbsp; Then she
 hung up before the process was completed.</p>
<p>I will assume that the connection dropped, or else she just flat hung up on me without any response or comment.&nbsp; I suspect it was an overseas call center, probably India, but I don't know for sure.&nbsp; I've talked with various techs over the years from all
 over the world and had some great support and some not-so-great support.&nbsp; Some of the best support I've gotten has been from India, but not a good one this time.</p>
<p>But, the job got done, so I guess it doesn't matter much.</p>
<p>By the way, the automated telephone system has a problem with my voice (maybe because of VOIP), so this time I tried just hitting a 1 instead of saying yes, and it worked.&nbsp; That's how I ended up talking to a person.&nbsp; I once modified an input program to allow
 1s and 0s instead of Yes and No so the data entry person could stay on the numeric keypad to answer responses.&nbsp; That was almost thirty years ago, so it's interesting that some one else is using a similar system for telephone keypad although I don't have any
 idea what key to hit for a&nbsp;'No' response.</p>
<p>Thanks again Noel for the MGADiag info!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Noel, I have run into at least once where I could not get anything to run and I had to go to another machine.&nbsp; The activation lockout prevented any type of login and I couldn't run any software on that machine.&nbsp; The activation people seem to be located overseas
 and can't seem to work outside of their&nbsp;script and can't deal with the situation above&nbsp;or with a blank ID presented as part of the activation window. &nbsp;I actually had to call tech support through my TechNet account to get a call back and get that machine activated.&nbsp;
 In any case the tech shop that did the upgrade for J3nna did her a disservice by not fixing the activation problem before giving the machine back to her.&nbsp; They had access to the same information that she did with the sticker and should have had tools to boot
 to enable the activation or they shouldn't have charged her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a new instance and not the same machine as described on this forum. I had to circumvent the Microsoft activation system to get the support I needed and fix the problem and did finally get it to work by using (illegally) a Technet version of Windows
 XP. I was finally contacted by support and we exchanged a couple of emails and I have not really ever gotten a final reply to fix the problem. I want to not have to use the (illegal) Technet copy, but I've also not had any response about how to fix the problem.
 So I've kept the correspondence just in case we ever get challenged about misusing licenses. I have a legitimate OEM copy of Windows XP Pro to cover this instance, it is just not activated with that license. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Missing Hard drive space &#40;have read other threads, nothing works&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so here's the deal...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo ThinkPad Edge, that I just got this year. It has an i3 processor, 4gb RAM, 500GB hard drive space etc...</p>
<p>454GB is available for use. According to Windows Explorer, 213GB are free, and I am using 241GB... However, I can only account for 150-155GB.</p>
<p>If I open C: and I select all folders and clikc on properties, It tells me I've got 149GB of material. I used SpaceSniffer and it told me that C: had 155.3GB of material. That still leaves over 80GB unaccounted for.</p>
<p>Defrag helps nothing, Disk Cleanup also made no difference. I deleted restore points and that's set to use only 10GB anyway... I've done a number of other things that a more computer savvy friend has suggested and I've combed through forums and tried those
 things too.</p>
<p>My antivirus is MS Essentials, and I'm running a full scan right now. It's almost done and nothing has popped up yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!!</p>

Are you able to locate the folder which uses most space?<br />

<p>It's my understanding that SpaceSniffer does the same thing as TreeSizeFree. As I said earlier, I used SpaceSniffer and it came up with C:\ 155.3GB in total... if this is correct then why is there 241GB of space used? Also... I know windows explorer won't
 show every file, but even so 80+GB seems like a lot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the interest of doing what I'm told since I'm not a computer person, I downloaded TreeSizeFree anyway, ran it as administrator, and this was the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>157.7GB C:\</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 124.8GB Users</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.0 GB Windows</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.7 GB [Files]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.6 GB Program Files (x86)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.8 GB SWTOOLS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.0 GB Program Files</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.8 GB Program Data</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.6GB MSOCache</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.3 GB DRIVERS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.1 GB swshare</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0 GB PerfLogs</p>
<p>and 0.0GB for everything else after that, until I get to 0.0GB RRbackups [Access is denied] and 0.0GB System Volume Information [Access is denied]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very bottom of the screen it says "Free Space: 212GB (of 454 GB)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 174,193 Files&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4096Bytes per Cluster (NTFS)"</p>
<p>So... basically this is ALSO showing me that C:\ is taking up 158GB of space and yet somehow I only have 212GB free....&nbsp; So if the remaining 85GB isn't free... but I don't have anything stored on it... what's it doing?</p>

            We can't see the pictures. My guess is, that the 80GB are used by the System Restore Points.

            I thought so too, except that that before i posted this I had checked and deleted all system restore points. It freed a little less that 8GB of space. The remaining 85 is what i'm trying to figure out.

<p>I just discovered I have the same problem, when warned of lack of disk space on my OS partition while trying to install a new programme. I have Windows 7 Professional, a clean install in a new partition of 97.6 GB, on a 500 GB SATA disk. I also have a second
 500 GB SATA disk installed.</p>
<p>Both disks have been checked with no faults, and cleaned and defragmented.</p>
<p>On my system partition, all files and folders add up to 45.5 GB. The only unknown is the documents and settings folder, which does not report its size in Properties. But the used space of the partition is reported as 96.1 GB, both in Properties, and in Disk
 Management. Free space is reported as 1.51 GB, so no wonder it does not want any more size-able programmes.</p>
<p>In the count of files and folders, with hidden files and protected OS files visible, the following is the complete list:</p>
<p>Documents and Settings, MSO Cache, NVIDIA, PerfLogs,Program Files, Program Data, Recovery, System Volume Information, Users, Windows, autoexec.bat, config.sys, hiberfil.sys and pagefile.sys.</p>
<p>There are no other folders or files reported on this partition, so where has more than half of it vanished to?</p>
<p>I have obviously plenty of space on my other partitions at present, but I should not have to go to the considerable bother of re-arranging, re-loading my programmes when<strong>I</strong> have used less than half of my designated OS partition.</p>
<p>I have never come across this before, even when enthusiastically batting away with Beta versions of Vista and Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query&nbsp;on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to move your Windows 10 OS from 500 Gb HDD to 1TB SSHD (hybrid driver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to inform you that if you will move the OS from 500 Gb HDD to 1TB SSHD (hybrid driver) then there might be a chance that you will face activation issue. If you have the product key for Windows 10 then you may go ahead. Otherwise you might need to
 get in touch with the manufacturer for the confirmation of the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may follow the steps provided by Andre Da Costa in the thread mentioned below. Though the thread deals with Windows 8 but steps holds good for Windows 10 too.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation is that I did not manage restore the Win 7 &nbsp;package. Something went wrong I lost the "windows.old". Now I still have Windows 10 in the old hard disk and I don't know its product key. I have Windows 7 product key but from the seller side they
 say that they can't help me any more. Some how they don't have any more data including my product key information. Is there any possibilities to get this Windows 10 to work like it should after upgrade? Why I did not get any product key when I upgraded Win
 7 to Win 10 at the first place? Is it so that I have to buy a new Windows 10 package or is there still some other possibility?</p>

 my backup, 3TB hard-drive was listed, so I changed that 3TB hard-drive to Boot option 1, and CD-/DVD as boot option #2. I also tried to reinstall Win10 Home Version from a CD onto my HDD 3TB, but failed because but the disk was labeled GPT. I'm not sure what
 else I can do at this moment. Also, I would like to mention that my SSD that I had Win10 downloaded previously on, is not being recognized under boot options, it tried plugging, cables are fine, but it won't show. I accept the fact I may have to replace it
 but, I’m not so sure about my backup HDD 3TB.</span></p>

<p>FIXED got it working, I clicked on drive 0 partition 2, and clicked on the option (picture above) and select&nbsp;'delete'. Then I clicked on 'Next' to continue the windows 10 installation, even though it prompted a warning. Was about to give up too lol..</p>

<h2>            User OOBE Create Elevated Object Server</h2>
                    <p>In my quest to try to fix a winsxs corruption, that makes DISM fail and SFC can't fix it, I ran in to this issue that it pops up "User OOBE Create Elevated Object Server" every time I log in. I did fix this by installing the Windows 10 default apps again.
 I think this issue pops up if you somehow revert the state of your Windows 10 to where the default apps should still be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is going to fix this everyone but if you do run in to this issue and you did remove the default apps try with installing them again.</p>
<p>Once the issue is gone you can uninstall them if you don't need them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The easiest way is to follow this guide here:&nbsp;https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-reinstall-re-register-apps-windows-10-a.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the PoweShell command to install every app.</p>

    <title>No program Installation location choice&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awannabegeek  say:</h3>
<h2>            No program Installation location choice&#63;</h2>
                    (Running Win 7 64-bit Pro.) I have separate logical drives to put programs on that are not necessary to run Win7 or Microsoft based. I was able to choose the location of my programs when I ran XP. Yet, now that I am running Win 7 I am unable to do. I install
 the programs on an admin account running as an admin and give permission etc. 99% of my programs I've been able to install on my other drives. Webshots, Electronic Arts Download Manager and Wizard101 don't give me the option to change location in Win7. I've
 been told it's an issue with Win7 exclusively because of admin rights etc. Is that true or is there a way I can finagle them to install where I want them to?
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any time you offer me.<br />

<p><span>Hi AWannaBeGeek,
</span></p>
<p><span>By default Windows installs all the programs in C:\Program Files directory, you might want to change the location of installation to D drive
 and some of the program installation would not give you the choice to change the location to install.
</span></p>
<p><span>While installing the programs, some of them&nbsp;provides you the option to change the location and some do not. This is by design from the program
 manufacturer. <br />
<br />
However, you may try the steps below with your own risk and check if it installs in a different partition or location.
</span></p>
<p><span>To change your default installation directory as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Type “regedit” in Vista start menu search box or in Run dialog box (for XP) and hit enter to continue.<br />
</span><span>2. Navigate to the following registry key in the Registry Editor:<br />
</span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion<br />
</span><span>3. Locate the value named “ProgramFilesDir” and change the default value “C:\Program Files” to your new directory path(address).<br />
</span><span>4. Close the registry editor and reboot your system to apply the change.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Registry Disclaimer:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes this problem is caused by two Windows registry entries that have become corrupted. To fix the problem, you have to use Registry Editor
 to delete the corrupted Registry entries. </span></p>
<p><span>However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update won&#39;t install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jatinmehrotra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently got the automatic update for Windows 10 Anniversary Update Notification. After the updates have been downloaded, the Windows update settings opens up and says the update cannot be installed as there is not enough space on C:\. Now I know there
 is only 4GB space there, but when I select my alternate (E:\, where I install most of my software) to install the update, it gives an error&nbsp;Error 0x8024601c msg that the updates were not installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help to install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jatin</p>

            <p>This problem is plauging all of the Win 10 micro-PCs and tablets that I know of with 32GB of space or less on them with virtually any sizable application already installed - Microsoft Office, for instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update is simply too large for these PCs, and it refuses to allow a MicroSD card to shoulder the load - requiring at least 7GB of space on the C: drive to perform the install.&nbsp; I have managed get mine to 4.9GB of free space, but no further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, uninstalling Office is a non-starter because of the hassle required to re-activate it after the fact.&nbsp; Never mind that it's simply ridiculous to require customers to unload their machines in order to install an O/S update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody just didn't think this through... the anniversary update needs to be retracted and re-issued in smaller chunks.</p>

            <p>Hi...thanks...so the 320 gig drive is partitioned?....you should be able to 'Expand' that 30 gig partition...I have done it a lot of times in 'Disk management' or by using
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mini Tool Partition Wizard 9 free</a>.</p>
<p>On a clean install Windows takes approx 12 gig space....it's later on with all the upgrades and programs that it gets cluttered....sometimes I cannot figure out why I am 10 gig short or more...even though I check all the<em> properties</em> of the 'User'
 files and programs and the Windows folder...there is software out there that can find these files.</p>

    <title>Surface pro 4 touch screen not registering touches instantly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tharok2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro 4 touch screen not registering touches instantly</h2>
                    <p>i have to touch my screen multiple times to get a response. Example, when trying to type with onscreen keyboard I have to touch each letter multiple times and some are missed because it doesn't register touches right away. When I swipe in from the edges
 I have do it 3-4 times before the action registers. It's a total pain to do anything with touch. In contrast, my surface 2 and surface pro respond immediately to touch and my typing speed is fast on those devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a regedit I found online for the surface rt to improve touch responsiveness but that made no difference so I changed it back to original settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a screen protector on it that I though was the issue, but I removed it and the problem remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this, or is this something that requires another replacement?</p>

            I have already tried all the things you've suggested before I made the original post. This is my second SP4. I was hoping not to have to replace another one. It seems that touch is occasionally good. But it is not reliable. As soon as I think the problem
 is gone it returns. Is returning the device really the only option?
