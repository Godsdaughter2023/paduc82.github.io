<h2>            windows photo viewer in windows 10 - the executable files have been deleted</h2>
                    <p>Whilst windows photo viewer is still available as a default application, the actual files that had used to be in PROGRAM FILES/WINDOWS PHOTOVIEWER have gone.</p>
<p>I have run SFC and that has not reinstated them.</p>
<p>Does anyone know where I can download and re-install Windows Photo Viewer from please?</p>

<p>The Protoviewer app is still in Windows it does not need downloading . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Photoviewer app is run through C:\WindowSystem32\dllhost.exe, so cannot be accedssed directly . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mk339up4k1uwi9w/Restore_Windows_Photo_Viewer.reg?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click HERE</a> to download a reg file from my DropBox account, right click the file and choose 'Merge', then confirm the merge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will put Photoviewer back on your right click 'Open With' menu </p>
<p>
</p><p>It will also be added to the list in choose another app, so you can set it as your default Phoho App</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT: </strong><em>ConeyGreen, just a thought, the reg file will add Photo Viewer to the right click 'Open with' menu, for Windows 10 to add it to the list of default apps above, you might have to choose Photo Viewer once on the &nbsp;'Open with' menu
 first . . .</em></p>

            <div>Hello,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the information you have provided&nbsp;laptop battery settings may cause trouble. If&nbsp;some settings have been changed, it's easy to suspect a power malfunction even though there's no physical problem with charging cable but can be issues with laptop
 battery. However in order for us troubleshoot better we need some more information.</div>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer? </li><li>Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to issue?</li></ol>
<p>You may refer to&nbsp;following steps and check if that helps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn the machine off, if it isn't already.<br />
Remove the battery, for a minute, reinsert the battery and check.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click <strong>Start</strong> and type<strong> device </strong>
in the search field, then select<strong>&nbsp;Device Manager</strong> .<br />
&nbsp;2.Expand the<strong> Batteries </strong>category.<br />
&nbsp;3.Under the Batteries category, right-click the<strong> Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery
</strong>listing, and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> . <br />
<strong>WARNING</strong> : Do not remove the Microsoft AC Adapter driver or any other ACPI compliant driver.<br />
&nbsp;4.On the Device Manager taskbar, click<strong> Scan for hardware changes . <br />
</strong>Alternately, select Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes .</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>You may refer to following articles and check if&nbsp;helps:</p>

I would be a little suspicious that there may be other corruption. &nbsp;In your place I would run SFC /scannow and chkdsk and probably a malware scan or two just to be sure.

<p><span>Hi Danielbikes,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are some limitations when it comes to MIDI in Windows 7. The ability to choose a different hardware or software MIDI synthesizer other than
 the default Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth has been removed from the user interface for audio configuration in Windows 7. In short, Windows 7 doesn't have the Midi mapper like the previous versions of Windows but it is still included.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might need to download third party software for synthesizing. You may use your favorite search engine and look for compatible synthesizer
 for Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Using Third Party Software, including
 hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            You do not need to struggle trying to install Version 1703 any longer.  You can wait until Oct 17th when the new Fall Creators Update Version 1709 is released, install Media Creation tool to Upgrade Now which is the most stable method to change to the new version which you need anyway. Since it reinstalls Windows chances are it will repair the problem. If it doesn't you'll know that a program or setting conflict is the likely cause, since these are retained..

Media Creation Tool here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install

If problems arise during Upgrade go over these steps which overcome most hurdles in Upgrades if you complete them all:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc

If problem persists after upgrade to new Version then I would go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any nee

<h2>            Lost Command Toolbar</h2>
                    I have rather stupidly clicked on "settings"..then clicked on "manage toolbars", then clicked "do not show command toolbar" .. not realizing that the toolbar I deleted had my home icon, work offline command and other handy stuff..but more importantly,
 it had the "settings" button that I originally clicked on, that I now need to undo what I have done! I'm on windows vista and I can't find a solution anywhere on the net, if anyone can help, i would be very grateful :)

<br />
Thank you for Posting on Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
Do you have the Menu Toolbar still?&nbsp; If so, click on View, Toolbars, then Command Bar<br />
<br />
If not, right click on the top of IE until you can see a menu that shows you menu bar, command bar, etc and simply click on Command Bar<br />
<br />
If you still cannot find it, on the very far left of the Tabs, right click on that area and you should see the menu and I referring to.<br />
<br />
Please Post back and let us know if this helped you to&nbsp;resolve your issue.<br />

    <title>Wifi Fix for those facing driver issues - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wifi Fix for those facing driver issues - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Recently I had purchased a Lenovo G40-70 which came preloaded with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has a Qualcomm Atheros AR956x network adapter and Relatek GBE Family Controller&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I upgraded to Windows 10 when I was notified that my PC was ready to upgrade than when Windows 10 started functioning the automatic updates started updating the network adapters which caused the Wifi,Ethernet and all options to disappear from the laptop.So
 I tried all possible ways to trouble shoot the problem but at no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I downloaded Microsoft official Windows Tool for Hiding Updates&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Than I restored back to Windows 8.1 and than again my laptop download the update and I updated to Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>this time when my account sign in came,I click on the Wifi icon (it works initially) and put it off.Than I go to Windows 10 Advanced Option in Windows Update section and put Defer Update feature on.Than I opened the tool and hid the network adapter update.Than
 installed the other updates and everything is working perfectly and smooth</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo uploaded latest software for the Windows 10 driver for WLAN &nbsp;but those don't work.I tried those but none worked.The WLAN is working perfectly if you hid the update for it :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wanted to know why new drivers by Windows Update is disabling the network adapter but hiding the update &nbsp;fixed the issue?</p>

            <p>Hi Valerio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your efforts. I would like to inform you that the description suggests there could be some issues with drivers compatibility. Although if the manufacturer has released the updated drivers for Windows 10, then it should not cause any error but
 sometimes due to any third party conflict or incompatible hardware and software alignment can cause the error and that is why when you had hided the update, then as drivers are not getting updated, therefore it works as expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may wait or contact the manufacturer to get more information about compatible drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Write to us for more information and we'll be glad to assist.</p>

<div>I had the same issue initially, and the compatibility mode suggestion did help me to some extent however, the device was blind to touches in the bottom right of the screen - frequently frustrating in win8 because the application bar was nearly useless
 for many purposes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway after much stuffing around with calibration and other drivers and so forth, I discovered that there was some dust along this area in the bezel... After using air to blow the dust out the device began operating perfectly with out further intervention!</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is presumably something to do with the way this device functions... Perhaps it's got touch that is different from touch screens and is an array of ir beams or something...</div>

    <title>How to add &#34;HTML Signature&#34; to Mail App&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to add &#34;HTML Signature&#34; to Mail App&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Origina title: Email problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a business email address with a signature which includes a logo. I had been using Outlook on my previous computer but I have bought a new laptop with Windows 8 and Windows Mail on it. I want to use my normal business email signature and have looked
 at how to do it but the answers don't seem to apply to what I am actually seeing on my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get to the signature I have to go to accounts and then there is just a box in which text can be added. There doesn't seem to be a way of adding the html file I have saved on my computer with my signature in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I am frustrated as well that my signature block in my emails using Windows 8 is simple, boring text with the inability to add my website link.&nbsp; Does anyone know if this was fixed with 8.1 upgrade?&nbsp; Or will there be a fix?&nbsp; I am starting&nbsp;to regret buying

            But does Windows Live Mail integrate with the Live Tiles from the start page? On my lock screen, it tells me if I have unread emails. Do I have to setup both Live Mail and the Mail App to my IMAP email, just to get dual functionality?

<h2>            How to get Star Wars&#58; Knights of the Old Republic to work on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a laptop with the following configuration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Pentium Dual CPU T2390 @ 1.86 GHz</p>
<p>Installed Memory (RAM): 2.00 GB</p>
<p>System type: 32-bit Operating System</p>
<p>Display Adapter: Intel 965 Express Chipset Family</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I previously had Windows Vista Ultimate on this laptop and very recently have upgraded it to Windows 7 Ultimate. I had a copy of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic which I had run on my PC with Windows XP (Service Pack 2) and I decided to install the
 same on my current laptop which now has Windows 7. However, upon successfully installing it in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2), I run the application too in the same compatibility mode. But it gives me the following message:</p>
<p>"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic has stopped working</p>

<p>I have referred to your replies on the similar issue. However, in my case I don't even reach the main menu of the game.</p>

<p>Hello syb1987,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Meghmala stated previously, the game is listed as being completely compatible, however:</p>
<p>1) You can try running the game in different compatibility modes to determine is they work.</p>
<p>2) Have you installed XP Mode? Maybe try installing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
XP Mode</a> and installing the game in the virtual environment.</p>
<p>3) You may find some others at the <a href="http://swforums.bioware.com/viewforum.html?forum=27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums for that particular game</a> that have had better luck in getting the game to install properly and run.</p>
<p>Hope this heps</p>

    <title>Restoration Incomplete Windows XP SP3 IE8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> klteo88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoration Incomplete Windows XP SP3 IE8</h2>
                    My System Restore always say 'Restoration Incomplete. Your computer cannot be restored to .....'<br />
<br />
The System Restore is working on all drives with 4999MG for each. I am on power (not battery). I can see all the Restore Points that are being created.<br />
<br />
I have checked System, the System Restore is set on 'Automatic'.<br />
<br />
I have tried to do System Restore in Safe Mode, but no luck. I still get the message&nbsp; 'Restoration Incomplete. Your computer cannot be restored to .....'.<br />
<br />
Can anybody even from Microsoft let me know how to resolve this? Is there a FixIt tool to check and see what the problem is? If we can find the error we can fix it but if I do not know what is wrong, why it won't Restore, I am stuck. Is there something blocking?
 Is a file missing? What ?<br />
<br />
Help please.<br />

            What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
What is the issue you are having that you think System Restore will remedy (or are you just practicing)?&nbsp; Remember that System Restore is not a time machine.<br />
<br />
Have you ever used System Restore to successfully restore your system in the past?<br />
<br />
Some Anti Virus tools will "protect" your system so much that they will not allow a System Restore to work properly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
For example, if you are running any Norton/Symantec products, you may see a message like this:<br />
<br />
Restoration Incomplete. Your computer cannot be restored...<br />
<br />
It is such a popular Symantec problem (well, I'll be polite and call it an "undocumented feature"...), they wrote an article about it:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v51118464_EndUserProfile_en_us?product=home&amp;version=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v51118464_EndUserProfile_en_us?product=home&amp;version=1</a><br />
<br />
Depending on what you are using for malware protection, you may have to disable the product(s) temporarily, do the System Restore and then turn the products back on again when the System Restore is complete.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you will need to boot your system in Safe Mode (you say you already tried this) and while your protection programs are not running, then do the System Restore.&nbsp; Microsoft hints in some of their articles that if System Restore fails to restore your
 computer, boot into Safe Mode and then execute the System Restore.&nbsp; That works for some configurations.<br />
<br />
Note that if you perform a System Restore in Safe Mode, you will not be able to undo it and there will be no option on the System Restore screen to "Undo my last restoration" like you would have if you were to restore your system from a normal boot.<br />
<br />
Give those ideas some consideration if they apply to you. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sometimes malicious software will afflict your System Restore to prevent you from finding and removing the malicious software.&nbsp; It would much rather fool you into thinking that you have to repair or reinstall your XP when that is not necessary.<br />
<br />
No matter what you are using for malware protection, I would do this and only then begin to troubleshoot any remaining issues:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs then resolve any remaining issues:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
SAS may install a startup item and launch every time your system reboots so if it is your desire to disable that, from the SAS splash screen, choose Preferences and uncheck the box "Start SUPERAntiSpyware when Windows starts" and the startup item will be removed
 from your configuration. <br />
<br />
SAS may also create a Scheduled Task to run every day which can also be disabled or deleted if that is your desire.&nbsp; To do that, choose Preferences, Scanning Control tab, Configure Scheduled Scanning and it may remind you to upgrade after 14 days. You don't
 have to do anything to keep SAS installed to continue using it with updates and run on demand actions.<br />
<br />
Do a full scan once in a while when you have more time (perhaps hours).<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
When the scans run clean, reboot and then troubleshoot any remaining issues.<br />
<br />
Sometimes System Restore is just so afflicted or the Restore Points are suspicious, the best option is to just reinstall your System Restore.&nbsp; Doing so will delete any old Restore Points, but sometimes this is the only way to fix a broken System Restore.&nbsp; You
 don't have to reinstall XP, just the System Restore part.<br />
<br />
That may leave you with your original unspecified problem that you hope System Restore will correct (using a System Restore is usually not equivalent to fixing the problem though).<br />

The System Restore is working on all drives with 4999MG for each. I am on power (not battery). I can see all the Restore Points that are being created.<br />

I have checked System, the System Restore is set on 'Automatic'.<br />

Can anybody even from Microsoft let me know how to resolve this? Is there a FixIt tool to check and see what the problem is? If we can find the error we can fix it but if I do not know what is wrong, why it won't Restore, I am stuck. Is there something blocking?

            I use: Windows XP Home Edition SP3. IE8.<br />
I use: Microsoft Security Essential and at one time Avast. (Nothing else).<br />
<br />
I have used System Restore successfully in the past but for the past 3-4 months it went haywire. I can't figure out why. I am not that tech savvy and when I had some problems recently and my pc got frozen, slow and non-responding, I thought System Restore just
 might fix it to a time when everything was running smoothly - but no it just won't work any more.<br />
<br />
I used CC Cleaner, Defraggler, Malwarebytes, Superspyware and Wise Care, to clean out stuff regularly but had no problems then. Only recently. Could it be that some file or other was innocently cleaned out? I have done everything that you recommended above
 (at start up, scan, clean, turn off, keep start-up to just a few items etc etc, even clean out everything in System Restore) but still no effect.<br />
<br />
Everything seems clean after all the above and then after a week or two I try System Restore and the problem is still there - I can't System Restore even though the points are all there. Is there anything else I can do? Anything to specifically check the System
 Restore program process?<br />

            It sounds like it is sort of functioning... - you can look in your System Restore calendar for recent RPs.<br />
<br />
Since you have Microsoft Security Essentials installed, you should see just about every day and sometimes twice a day a RP called:<br />
<br />
<b>Software Distribution Service 3.0</b><br />
<br />
Those RPs get created automatically when MSE updates (which is just about every day).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
MSE downloads the updates, makes a new RP called <b>Software Distribution Service 3.0,
</b>then installs the updates.&nbsp; That is so you can undo the update later if there is a problem.<b>&nbsp;
</b>So if you are seeing those, your SR is at least <i>creating </i>RPs.<b><br />
<br />
</b>Another test would be to manually create a RP, reboot then see if you can restore to the one you just created.<b><br />
<br />
</b>If it still won't work, like I mentioned before sometimes SR is just so afflicted it will not work and you may need to reinstall System Restore (not XP - just the System Restore part).<b>&nbsp;
</b>This is not hard to do and is sometimes the only thing that seems to work to get it going again.<br />
<br />
Having had to reinstall SR too many times, I have instructions for that so I will never have to type all that stuff in again.<br />
<br />
You can also wait and see what other ideas people have.<b><br />
<br />
</b>If you want to reinstall your SR, here's how:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes System Restore is so afflicted and none of your Restore Points will work or maybe you don't trust any of them (if your AV software reports they contain infections) it is sometimes best to just start all over and reinstall System Restore.&nbsp; That will
 get you a fresh start.<br />
<br />
When you reinstall System Restore, all of your current Restore Points will be removed and you must restart your computer when the installation is complete.&nbsp; After the restart, one new Restore Point will automatically be created as a new System Checkpoint in
 your SR calendar.<br />
<br />
If your system had a malicious software infection, it could be that some of the files in your old Restore Points are also infected so wiping out the old ones and starting fresh is often a good idea so you don't wonder if the old Restore Points are infected
 or not.<br />
<br />
As you go through the reinstallation of SR, the reinstallation will ask you for some files as you go along and ask for your XP installation CD.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (most people don't) , you can change the path of where the installer looks for files one at a time as they are needed.&nbsp; More on that later.<br />
<br />
Assuming your XP is installed in the Windows folder on the C drive of your machine:<br />
<br />
Browse to c:\windows\inf and right click the following file:<br />
<br />
sr.inf<br />
<br />
Choose Install<br />
<br />
If you cannot see c:\windows\inf folder or the sr.inf file therein, configure your system to show hidden files and to show file extensions.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
In Windows Explorer, click Tools, Folder Options, View and enable "Show hidden files and folders" and uncheck "Hide file extensions for known file types" then you should be able to see the c:\windows\inf\sr.inf file.&nbsp; You can undo these adjustments later if
 it is your desire.<br />
<br />
The installation may ask for files from the c:\windows\inf\386 folder.&nbsp; That would be your genuine bootable XP installation CD if you have one and the Service Pack installed on your system needs to be the same as the CD you are going to use.&nbsp; If you don't have
 that (most people don't), not a problem.<br />
<br />
You do not absolutely need a genuine bootable XP installation CD to reinstall SR since the files must already be on your system some place if SR was ever working before.<br />
<br />
If you are asked for a file and you can't find it where I suggest in my example below (it works on my system), you will have to search your hard disk and find where the files are on your system.<br />
<br />
If asked for a file and you don't know where it is, leave the installation waiting and click Start, Search and search for the requested file and find it on your system.&nbsp; If SR ever worked before, the file is already on your system somewhere.<br />
<br />
When Search finds the requested file, switch back to the installation and enter the path to where you found the requested file and click OK.&nbsp; The installation may ask for several files along the way, but you can find them all.<br />
<br />
If you still can't find the files, let us know what the file is you need and some nice person can upload it to their SkyDrive and you can download it.<br />
<br />
Here is how my system works when I reinstall SR when I pretend I do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD:<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
sr.sys<br />
<br />
Point the install to&nbsp; c:\windows\system32\drivers<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
srclient.dll<br />
<br />
Point the install to&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
filelist.xml<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\restore (or c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386)<br />
<br />
If asked for:<br />
<br />
rstrui.exe<br />
<br />
Point the install to&nbsp; c:\windows\system32\restore<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
srframe.mmf<br />
<br />
Point the install to&nbsp; c:\windows\system32\dllcache (or c:\windows\system32\restore)<br />
<br />
When the installation completes, you will get a message that you need to restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and look at your SR calendar.&nbsp; You should have one new System Checkpoint in your calendar.<br />
<br />
Now is a good time to test your System Restore process from end to end.<br />
<br />
The day you think you need System Restore is not the day to find out it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system and with nothing running (no browser, no Outlook, etc. - just the basics), manually create a new Restore Point, reboot your system and see if you are able to successfully restore your system to the Restore Point you just created.<b><br />

            Sorry for this late reply. As I am not that tech savvy, I wanted to perform your instructions over the weekend where I have more time to go through the procedures very, very slowly and carefully with fingers crossed and a prayer, to avoid further problems.<br />
<br />
Initially I had some problems with the steps and I had to read and re-read your instructions to fully understand them. The system did not ask me for one file so I was also confused that I had done something wrong.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am glad to report that my problem is fixed now and all the previous RPs have been deleted and new ones created. I tested the SR over the past two days a few times and it is working fine now. Now that I have gone through this process, I am sort of
 more knowledgeable as to how to fix it with all the instructions (codings?) you gave me. Otherwise as many have suggested, I would have re-installed the whole Windows XP and that would have been very difficult (maybe even costly).
<br />
<br />
I am not tech savvy so I don't meddle with all the technical things. What puzzled me is how the SR got corrupted, erased and malfunctioned - what was the cause. Was it some spyware, malware, registry cleaner, defraggler, AV etc - I only used the common ones
 that have been used (downloaded) by millions of others and so are stable and reliable. I would like to avoid a repetition if I know the exact cause.<br />
<br />
I do have another question for you if you know about it and can advise. Is there an-inbuilt program that can 'flush' the computer system to ensure that everything is working properly and the system is at optimal operation? Is Resetting a good idea or should
 I avoid it if possible so that I don't unintentionally create more problems for myself? Looking at my recent problems, I would prefer not to use the many external softwares that says they can do the job. I have had enough problems recently and I certainly
 don't want any more new ones.&nbsp; It would appear that these external software changes some settings (maybe even erase some things) without my knowledge and it create problems.<br />
<br />
Before I sign off, I would really like to thank you for your assistance - your detailed and step by step approach (with the instruction codes) was really, really helpful. Many thanks once again.<br />
<br />

            That's good that it is working now and now you are also more tech savvy!<br />
<br />
If you can recall what parts of the instructions were not clear, did not work as described or gave you trouble and let me know, I can update them to be more clear.&nbsp; Those instructions are really just a copy/paste from my notes that usually work just fine but
 there may be some cases that I have not seen where they could use adjustment.&nbsp; I like to have things work on all systems all of the time under all conditions and not just on some systems some of the time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I don't know what all the things that cause SR to malfunction - could have been some malware that was removed already, could have been some antivirus/antimalware application that is overly "protecting" your system from changes, could have been some one of the
 many third party fixer/cleaner type programs available for download, maybe a registry cleaner.&nbsp; There are many variables and we don't always know the entire history of problems - I just want to know how to fix them (and without Repairing or reinstalling XP).&nbsp;
 Those options are just unsavory and/or impossible options for many people.<br />
<br />
I think most regular contributors here will tell you not to use registry cleaners (even the one in CCleaner), and I think I have used just about all of them at one time or another and they don't bother me one bit, but before I do I always have a plan for what
 I am going to do if my system doesn't work when I get done - how am I going to undo it or fix a system if it doesn't boot?&nbsp;&nbsp; So I don't suggest or contribute to discussions about using too many of those things (especially registry cleaners) because I am usually
 outnumbered and my experience may be different.&nbsp; I've have never had a problem, but I think my system is afraid of me.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I sometimes have a good idea what people might have done to their system when certain built in Windows functions seem to stop working properly and sometimes include this question to get some background:<br />
<br />
<i>Do you now or have you ever had installed any third party applications where the product description includes one or more of the following descriptive words:<br />
<br />
cleaner, mechanic, pit stop, detective, doctor, cure, optimize, inspector, clean up, tune up, speed up, fix up, compact, compress, faster, power, boost, booster, eraser, muncher. one click fix, instant fix, new, intuitive, mistakes, stops freezes, stops crashing,
 stops crashes, stops errors, improves, saves you money, risk free, guaranteed or any third party program that has an icon resembling a gear, cog, tool belt, wrench, spanner, screwdriver or swooping arrows?</i><br />
<br />
So I can't really recommend anything for third party applications other than some common sense with a good dose of skepticism for good measure and a plan for how to get yourself out of a jam if things go wrong.<br />
<br />
Things like CCleaner are popular for maintenance and I have it installed too (along with other things) but I am always looking for new ways to break my system on purpose to recreate problems other people might be having so I can actually see it and then I can
 figure out how to fix it.&nbsp; And there are lots of things you can download that promise free and instant fixes for just about any problem but I don't think those things are going to really help you too much.&nbsp; I don't even try them to see if they work or not.<br />
<br />

            I have continued to monitor the SR process to ensure it works efficiently and properly and I encountered another problem. The 'Undo last SR' don't work.&nbsp; It is like this:<br />
<br />
I have SR points say on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6th December (today).<br />
<br />
I do a SR to 1st December from today 6th December. No problems. Everything goes smoothly and I am SR back to 1 December. Now I do an 'Undo the last SR' to get back to 6th December. This fails as it is 'Incomplete and cannot be undone'. No changes (Undo) is
 made and I am still at SR Point 1st December.<br />
<br />
To solve this, I do a SR (from Dec 1) to December 5 (yesterday, the previous SR listed). This SR to December 5 is successful - BUT I cannot do an Undo my last SR activity in this case back to 1st December. So now, the 'Undo' seems to have malfunctioned.<br />
<br />
So now I don't 'Undo' but if I if I have to 'Undo' to the present time, I will create a new SR so that the current SR point will be the second latest one and then SR to this second latest SR.
<br />
<br />
So I guess I just have to do this from now on unless you know what the problem is and have a solution. Maybe some box or other needs to be checked or unchecked, some file remains corrupted / missing, I don't know. I just know how to get around this as explained
 above. I don't want to mess around with this too much in case something else goes haywire.<br />
<br />
With regards to the your instructions part, I guess it is generally OK. I just have to make sure I follow it line by line very carefully. I just got confused by the point that I had to sidestep a bit to locate some files before filling in the location where
 the files are located / found and get back to the main installation part. But if I can get it right I suppose others reading the instructions should have no problems as well.<br />
<br />
Many thanks once again. Cheers.<br />

            I don't know what that problem is and Googling around didn't give me any ideas except for things to try that might work sometimes maybe or ones that just don't make sense to me.<br />
<br />
Not being a big fan of SR for problem solving in the first place (how would you fix problems if there was no such thing as System Restore?) I don't know what to suggest, but somebody else might.<br />
<br />
If everybody running XP with Service Pack 3 had a genuine bootable XP installation CD with SP3 on it, instructions would be much easier.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that most people on the planet called Earth do not have such a thing or some systems don't even
 have a CD/DVD drive at all so it is better in the long run to figure out how to fix things with that in mind.&nbsp; Instructions like that should work for all people all of the time instead of just for very few people some of the time.<br />
<br />
I don't think I will ever suggest or refer to any troubleshooting method that includes the phrase '...insert your XP CD ROM...'.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is just going to be a waste of time.<br />

            Hello ElderL<br />
<br />
I am attempting to use your method to fix my restore feature on my XP Home SP3.&nbsp; I have run into problems.<br />
<br />
The reinstall is asking for 7 files instead of the 5 you list.&nbsp; I have the files on my computer but I get an error called Can Not Copy.&nbsp; The reinstall wants the XP Home SP3 CD which I do not have.<br />
<br />
Your instructions refer to C:\windows\&nbsp;&nbsp; etc etc etc,&nbsp; but I do not have "windows".<br />
<br />
I have C:\WINNT.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the difference?&nbsp; I have a Gateway computer.<br />
<br />
Also, could I use a MS Windows XP Pro SP3 CD, rather than the Home edition, to find the needed install files?<br />
<br />
Your fix for my "Restoration Incomplete"&nbsp; issue seems so reasonable.<br />
<br />
Can you make any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Hank<br />
<br />
<br />

            WINNT was the default installation folder for older versions for MS Windows operating systems, or it could be that your system came that way from Gateway, or maybe it was upgraded to XP, or maybe somebody reinstalled XP and used that folder instead.<br />
<br />
I have a really old Gateway here (probably 15+ years) where everything has been replaced inside the system except the floppy drive - ah the good old Gateway cow days...&nbsp; but I still look upon it favorably.<br />
<br />
Restoration incomplete...&nbsp; could be because your antivirus/antimalware application (especially Norton/Symantec products) is "protecting" your system from changes, so sometimes booting into Safe Mode so they are not running will allow SR to work but you will
 not be able to undo a System Restore done in Safe Mode.&nbsp; Have you seen if that will work?<br />
<br />
Let's be sure what you have running...&nbsp; You can press the Windows key and Pause to display the General System Properties to see the XP version and Service Pack but please also do this so we can be really sure:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>msinfo32</b><br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
Then answer these questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Have you ever used System Restore successfully in the past?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
What is the problem you are having that you think System Restore will resolve?&nbsp; SR is not a time machine, but it certainly should work and if it is broken, you should fix it.&nbsp; The day you need your SR to work is not the day to find out it is broken.<br />
<br />
You <i>should </i>be able to use a genuine bootable XP Home SP3 installation CD but are you sure that is what you have or is it just a Service Pack 3 installation CD?&nbsp; Most genuine XP installation CDs do not already have SP3 already on them.<br />
<br />
If you tell me the 2 files you need I can put them on my SkyDrive and you can download them, copy them into some folder on your system and when the installation asks for them, point it to the new files (they may already be out there).<br />
<br />
When you tell me the files I will be sure they are on my SkyDrive and give you instructions how to download them.<br />

            <p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for using Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to your computer?<br />
2. Are you facing the same issue on Internet explorer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to play videos in Internet explorer and check if you are getting sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue occurs in Internet Explorer, then you may use following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Internet Explorer. Go to Tools then Internet Options.<br />
2. Switch to the "Advanced" Tab.<br />
3. Scroll down to the "Multimedia" sub-heading.<br />
4. Make sure the box next to "Play sounds in web pages" is checked. <br />
5. Click OK and Restart Internet Explorer. Test to see if sounds will now play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For issue with Chrome, I would suggest you to contact Google chrome.</p>

    <title>How do I reinstall WMI&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjack99  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reinstall WMI&#63;</h2>
                    Windows system information does not work, error "Can't Collect Information &lt;next line&gt; Cannot access the Windows Management Instrumentation Software. Windows Management files may be moved or missing"<br />
<br />
So - I check services and all components of same appear to be running, but of course, NO PLACE ACTUALLY TELLS YOU WHAT SHOULD BE RUNNING.<br />
<br />
I then ran "sfc / scannow" based on information found here and it completed with 100% and stated "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."<br />
<br />
I then printed the results file "sfcdetails.txt" and it did not report any missing or unable to fix files.<br />
<br />
Now - at a loss of ideas, began reading various items in regards to the subject and I stumbled into "WMI Control Properties", I think from compture management, but I honestly don't recall exactly.&nbsp; (I'm 65, cut me some slack)&nbsp; In the "General" tab it states
 categorically "Failed to connect to &lt;local computer&gt; because "Interface: Class not registered"&nbsp; Oh Boy, I'm really getting sensitive to this "class not registered" hocus pocus, let me tell you!<br />
<br />
I'm a simple guy, I just want this "expletive deleted" computer and this "expletive deleted" over hyped and under performing Windows 7 operating system to work, that's all, how can this be so hard?<br />
<br />
BTW, the ONLY reason I even give a "expletive deleted" about&nbsp; system information in the first place is because I've been trying to get this blasted thing to allow a simple thing like VIDEO CAPTURE via Firewire to work, which USED to work just fine, until WINDOWS
 7 "IMPROVED" EVERYTHING!!!!<br />
<br />
Frustrated?&nbsp; Oh yeah, I'm frustrated all right!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Anybody have any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks for your time.<br />

            I love you guys, how you ALWAYS begin by assuming everything but windows is the source of the problem, and second, ALWAYS giving half an answer.&nbsp; For instance, in your answer you detail very carefully how to boot with no services except windows (step 1)
 and then you take the happy path with "if the issue does not occur....." (step 2),,, but OF COURSE there is no step 3, which would be, if the issue still occurs, then......"<br />
<br />
Well, who ever you are, the issue still occurs, and I need the step 3 part.<br />
<br />
bottom line, no, the information was not helpful, just another turn around the same old tree.<br />
<br />

            Sorry forgot your first question.&nbsp; No there were no changes made to the computer that I am aware of, other than trying to get video capture to work, which I have been flogging for a week.&nbsp; At some point in time the problem began, I don't know when, this
 is the first time I've tried to use system information in quite a while, probably more than 6 months ago.&nbsp; It did work that time.<br />

            I have an interim fix, I say "interim" because I don't yet know if it will hold up through the endless string of windows updates I am forced to accept.<br />
<br />
Interim fix, after everything I tried failed, and "microsoft answers" apparently cannot answer, was to perform an "in-place" repair.&nbsp; (I suspect this is the missing "step 3" from the previous incomplete answer.)<br />
<br />
After the 10 hours it took for windows setup to complete, the PC is now at win7 home premium edition basic load, something akin to v1.00.0. something.&nbsp; No SP1, no updates.&nbsp; Result, windows system information works, and PC successfully captures video via firewire,
 which of course is what started this mess, 9 days ago.<br />
<br />
Now the question is, does SP1 or any of the 125 updates currently being installed break it?&nbsp; IF it does, THEN the fault is clearly on the back of microsoft windows and their developers.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can install all the 125 updates and Service Pack 1; it won’t break WMP by installing Windows updates and SP1 is the combination of Windows updates.<br />
