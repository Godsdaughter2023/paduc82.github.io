<h2>            Resize container using a touch screen device</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">I use OneNote a lot for many different purposes on five different devices. Four of those devices have touch screen capability. I frequently find that the size of the container is insufficient on different devices.</p>

</p><p class="contentHeader2">Is there something that I'm missing that would allow me to resize using a touchscreen? I really don't want to have to haul out a different device for that purpose alone! I choose the device that I use at any given time for a reason!

<h2>            Widows 10 Phone - not an option for anyone who needs a smart phone ........</h2>
                    <p>This week I was presented with a serious question by one of our in-house users&nbsp;. Can I evaluate&nbsp;a Lumia Windows 10 phone&nbsp;for both work and pleasure use ?</p>
<p>After using the phone for the last 72 hours&nbsp; I have come to the conclusion that this type of phone is neither a viable contender to either Iphone or Android phones , infact it is a step back a very un-smart phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No basics - to install google etc you have to go round various side routes. no chromecast&nbsp;support for Netflix etc .</p>
<p>No bank apps like Lloyds Amex are supported</p>
<p>
</p><p>Infact I could go on and on about apps nearly every App my user has on her other phone (Iphone or Samsung Pad) couldn't be downloaded or found for this phone. I searched the net for ways to bypass or hash together ways to get some of the basic must have
 apps to work with mediocre success, some started and latter crashed some just refused to even install let alone start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion a Windows 10 phone is only good for taking calls and working with MS Office , if you want to run your Life from your phone then forget it .....................</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really very disappointed with these phones , 72 hours of wasted time&nbsp; its about time Microsoft woke up and take a LOOK at what people use thier phones for on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>

            <p>you don't seem to understand how these devices work. </p>
<p>apps on phones are made by whatever company makes them. not by the provider of the app store. example: if a bank app doesn't exist for windows, it's because the bank hasn't made a windows version of the app. it has nothing to do with the capability of the
 phone.</p>
<p>I don't really know what you mean by "to install google", as there is no such thing for windows phones. google is anti competitive and does not make apps for windows.</p>
<p>chromecast is a closed platform (made by google!) so don't expect it to work on windows apps because google does as much as it can to make you want an android phone instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you're trying to "bypass" something to install android or iOS apps? that's not how things work. apps don't magically work across operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft provides the OS and the marketplace. Apps are made by other companies. Microsoft can't force anyone to make an app for windows.</p>

    <title>E72 - Honeymoon to Divorce. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E72 - Honeymoon to Divorce.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many of you here, I've had quite a few mobile phones through the years and it's always a source of great excitement when a brand new phone lands on your desk. The new OS to explore, the Apps, the form factor. The downside of playing around with so many
 phones through the years is that there is no perfect device, no form factor that's perfect in every situation and no OS that can retain your interest beyond a few months before it's time to convince yourself that you need to try a new 'thing' which will solve
 everything for you (and make you more productive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As long as you know this up front and understand your interest is going to stray, you can get a fairly balanced view of what makes a great, as opposed to a good phone. Here are my thoughts on the E72.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a background to my adventure, I recently had an iPhone and although it's far from perfect I was fed up with the lack of a physical keyboard. It's not that I failed to bang an email out but I found it tedious when I made a typo and then had to spend 10
 seconds trying to edit the message by tap'n'hold to move cursor, delete (x10), tap'n'hold to continue typing etc. It just got 'old' so I started to look for a device with a keyboard - remembering with fondness the keyboard on the old E61, &nbsp;Treo680 and even
 the Blackberry 8700 (love those clicky keys!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last October I bought an E63 because it was 'cheap' and to see if I could get back into using S60 + keyboard after such a long period in iPhone land.&nbsp; To my surprise, the E63 whilst creaky and a little too 'red' for me, was good, it, I even took it to Hong
 Kong on a trip and left the laptop behind as an experiment (it worked.. but only just) although it obviously had some shortcomings. Toy like Email client, browser standards, ram, camera etc.overall it was a positive experience that made me want to explore
 further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had bought a Nexus One in January the day it was released and although it's a super phone, it still had no keyboard and the Droid keyboard is awful so having had a half decent experience of the E63, I decided the E72 was the next best thing and decided
 to snap one up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Honeymoon / First impressions.</strong></p>
<p>First impressions of the E72 is that it's a 'handsome' phone - not a good looking phone or a kiddy toy but a good, solid, classy looking phone for business. The keyboard was as good as the E63, the form factor was obviously near identical other than the
 materials being of higher grade and obviously it's slimmer and easier in the pocket. &nbsp;First impressions were very good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen was a step back from most new phones, especially the Nexus One's gorgeous High-res effort but it's certainly clear and as it needs to be judged as a utility, not a spec-sheet competition so it fitted the job of a phone with a keyboard. &nbsp;The screen
 was clear and bright and easy to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software seemed to be not much of a step up from the E63, I was expecting a higher grade of Application to be included and to my surprise (not disappointment) there was little on the surface to distinguish the E72 from the E63. I disliked the new transition
 effects as they felt like Nokia had iPhone envy rather than functional enhancements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camera quality was very good for a phone although I don't like the viewer application with its spinning wheel of pictures - iPhone envy again? what's wrong with a 5x5 thumb view that would work well with the D-Pad? Once again, it works but it's not designed
 to optimise the experience of the form-factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The touch-pad, I quite liked it, although I rely on the D-Pad more as it's just too small a surface to be useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Email client. At first it felt like a step back from the E63, the E72 client seemed 'bare' for some reason and I also wanted to make the font smaller so I could see more email headers on the screen at once (cant do it), I put all of this down to the
 email client being prosumer rather than consumer</p>
<p>Overall, first impressions were good with the caveat of some changes to what I was used to, no bad thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Married life / day to day:</strong></p>
<p>Day to day, as a Phone, the E72 is fantastic. Calling people by typing their name is so much easier than 'flicking' through lists, call quality is absolutely top notch, signal strength and 3G connectivity is years ahead of my old iPhone/Nexus/Blackberry/Treo
 and really shows that Nokia know how to make connectivity work from a technical perspective, something that almost every other company from HTC to Apple trail considerably behind on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Short-cuts to communication 'tasks' are as good as it gets. Series60 is a superb, intuitive and &nbsp;well polished hierarchy of menus to get your calls and messages answered, read and replied to in record time. I can't praise the work that's been done over the
 years any higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up email was easy enough as standard manual entries although after a week or so I decided to setup mail through OviMail - this was painful.</p>
<p>I'm pretty experienced in these things and technically very able (I'm into heavy &nbsp;tech for a few decades) but this was a challenge for me.&nbsp;Passwords, logins, usernames etc.. it all becomes one mixed up frustrating jumble that I think would&nbsp; have any mere
 mortal turned off or turn to their I.T. department in haste. It took me a couple of days to get it set up properly and even then it felt like it was hanging by its fingernails. Blackberry by contrast feels military strength compared to OviMail and BB's are
 far from a walk in the park when it comes to ease of setup. &nbsp;Once I did get OviMail setup, it did work but I always had the feeling that it might break at any minute if I touched the wrong option. To its credit, it never actually did break, but it just left
 a bad taste that I never quite got rid of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia are obviously moving heavily into services such as cloud infrastructure with Ovi services, Music etc. This push into services is being implemented the same way as Microsoft did a while back where none of the teams talk to one another other, it's all
 through a technical specification sheet. The E72 software works as silo-applications with each requiring the same login information being entered independently rather than simply log into Ovi services once, per device, and everything else flows. This constant
 entering of information per application is what makes S60 feel dated, it's unforgivable for a product manager of an integrated device like the E72 to let this pass. It either shows weak leadership within the product team or it shows a lack of cohesion between
 the teams within Nokia - again, a failure in leadership although higher up the chain of command. Yes, it's a big company but to let this happen shows the company has too many toothpaste managers and not enough tech savy people that love their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second level of confusion is the PC software that's bundled and are encouraged to install. Nokia's PC suite is solid, but why am I encouraged to install Ovi software and map loaders which seem to replicate the same job? It's not a problem with the device
 itself, but it significantly dilutes the user experience to bemused confusion. Obviously this is not the E72 but companies can no longer separate user-experience from device experience, especially when they're intertwined to the degree that they are these
 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up through a Mac was a lot simpler as you dont get all the Nokia apps, you just use iSync after manually searching for a plugin online. You loose some features but you do that with Macs anyway (yes.. I use one every day so stay away mac fanboys).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Calendar and contacts apps are adequate but feel dated and slow and could do with some new views and features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Internet Radio feature as was in the E63.. I needed to scour the web to add this manually for some odd reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OviStore is an average implementation with some average applications. As the E72 is a prosumer phone, not having games and apps, whilst good to pass time on a 747 are far from needed and using the stock built in applications was fair enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music player is 'functional' and did its duty without a hitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that worked particularly well was Skype. I do a lot of international calls and I think the Nokia implementation is the best around, hopefully they can make more of this feature as times goes by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi/Nokia Maps. Where do I start with this? It's absolutely wonderful. I went a few trips to California, installed the map data on the device for California and Nevada and it worked perfectly. I bought a little car stand for $10 in Fry's electronics which
 worked for the trip and this just blew me away. Even with it's small screen, this has made me give away my Tom-Tom which I took with me on trips and never turned on once. Full marks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Battery life is incredible, for a device in this day and age to last 4 days on a single charge is simply stunning. I'll put up with the lack of a decent movie player any day if it means I get 4 days out of a single charge. Once again, Nokia should shout
 about how awesome this is to anyone that will listen. iPhone users get trained into worrying about battery life and turning things off where possible, not having to worry about battery life is an absolute blessing. Well done Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To give an example, I drove from San Francisco to San Diego which takes 9 hours. I had the GPS running giving me directions, I had the Phone wired into AUX in the Car playing some Audio books for the entire duration and the battery life still had a good
 2 days before needing a charge. The E72 battery life will forever go down in Legend as an 'I remember when' story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not that this piece is about comparisons with other Phones, but coming from the UK it means heavy roaming charges if I use data. I took a similar business trip with a Nexus One and it was pretty much useless as their GPS mapping software is US only in features
 and, it can't work with offline maps and would have cost me a pretty penny to use on a roaming contract with all the Data it would download. The Nexus one is arrogantly setup to be of use to US consumers, overseas users get a half-glass feature set (no turn
 by turn / street-view etc..).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Divorce:</strong></p>
<p>There is a time in the daily life of using a Phone where the 'unique characteristics' of the Phone start to become tedious. This happens with all phones and gadgets, if it didn't we'd all still be using Videostar VHS recorders (does that give my age away?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After travelling up and down California, replying to a hundred or so emails over the course of a week, I noticed that I had just sent a handful of emails without being connected to Wifi. After examining a little further I worked out to my horror that the
 email client does not connect over Wifi - ever. It fails to work with Profiles, connection orders or anything remotely standard on almost any other Nokia/other device. Profiles for the uneducated should remain an unknown, it's a black art from a previous era
 that has no place in a modern day smartphone. Devices should simply connect over Wifi if connected, otherwise prompt the user if it's roaming - simple as that, no 'profile' needed. This is how all smartphones work, even the senile Blackberry OS does this out
 the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I foolishly presumed that as the old mule E63 has worked over Wifi, the E72 being an 'evolved' device would also have this feature as standard. Nokia took it out.. what the $£%$£?</p>
<p>I can only imagine at this point in time, Nokia deliberately engineered this deficiency to keep carriers happy. The E63 being 'consumer' can be used over wifi with a standard phone tariff, the E72 being a 'prosumer' device needs the user to buy a more expensive
 Smartphone tariff. I can't for the life of me work out why Nokia would remove a standard feature that was in all of their older phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This little oversight of the Email client not connecting or alerting me that it was using a non-wifi connection actually cost me over 100 euros in data charges. This is simply not acceptable, no excuses, no patch-it at some point please. It's simply stupid.
 Yes, I've used Profimail etc.. but should I need to on a messaging device? I bought the phone for this feature, paying to replace it is simply counter-intuitive when so many other options exist without wrestling with work-arounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than creating a hole in my wallet, I also through sheer paranoia removed all my Email accounts from Ovi and set them up as 'pull' accounts where I manually check my email. I need to do this simply as I travel so much and the roaming feature sometimes
 works - it's back to the holding on by your fingernails thing with this device, it should work but you're not quite sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running the much loved Maps application brings up a notice asking to connect to download data - even after saying NO, I still fail to have faith in the profiles working which removes the confidence you have in the device, It removed the feeling that you're
 in control and that really gets to you after a while. If Email has been engineered to ignore profiles, what else if going on under the surface, I should not have to read forums to gain confidence and if I was a typical consumer I wouldn't know where to start
 to find this out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other problems starting to appear are that the E72 is starting to crash a few times every week, the dreaded space-bar problem has appeared, I can't upgrade the firmware for some reason even though I'm a few revisions behind (I bought it unlocked from Nokia),
 the back cover feels like it's starting to work loose and has fallen off a few times and the transition effects needed to be turned off (only half of them disappear). All of these things are in the forums here to some degree. Sometimes they annoy, sometimes
 not, but overall when you're having a tough day they all get to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>There's a scene in the Film "Flash Gordon" where a poor chap puts his hand in a tree trunk as a drunken game to see if the creature that lurks will bite him, he puts his hand in, smiles then slowly starts to pull his hand out before getting bitten just before
 he pulls his hand to safety - for some odd reason the E72 reminds me of that this. You approach with trepidation, become comfortable with the device then you get bitten just when you think all is well and you're about to make off with the cash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E72 is the end of an era. You can tell by Nokia's responses to the problems on the E72 that their corporate focus is no longer on developing S60 but maintaining it with minimal effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their focus is now on Maemo and 300 other pressing priorities, their software engineers are stretched way too thin working on OviCloud services, Maemo and a multitude of new devices and holes/low quality are starting to become standard. This is starting
 to reflect on devices like the E72 which should be a flagship device but instead is not much more evolved than an 'old' E63 at half the price - which incidentally has an email client from the same codebase that can download over wifi. In many ways, plastic
 aside, I thought the E63 was better, more stable (for me) especially for the price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia will obviously keep churning out yearly revisions to the S60 line (C6, E5 etc). But you know for a fact that they're pretty much the same devices with a cavalier attitude to improvements and the least engineering time to fix bugs/features as they can
 get away with. Arrogant yes, damage to the Nokia Brand by doing this? Absolutely. It will take me 5 years before I return to a new Nokia device after seeing the speed of progress and responses despite some great promise. Look how quickly Google turned around
 a Nexus One update with multi-touch after an outcry - it can be counted in days after launch, not 'devices' as seems to be the case here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E72 device feels great, I love the form factor, the Keyboard is not the absolute best as that remains with Blackberry but it's certainly one of the very best. The phone functions are second to none.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi-Maps is just brilliant and the Battery life is as covered above is the stuff of legend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many ways the E72 is the device I'm least able to move on from as there is so much to like and so much potential, but the amateur email implementation and creeping software problems makes this device seriously handicapped for anyone that travels or cares
 about the significant roaming fees that this device is designed to incur which is a genuine shame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully these things will get fixed in firmware upgrades, I'm sure some of them will but why should I wait? this is not the 1990's - this is mature technology and a (very) mature Operating system which should be solid as a rock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like many on this forum would like to see Nokia do well but they've simply not stepped upto the plate by fixing basic feature holes nor have they communicated to the community that they're listening and will fix any of the problems. Instead they've announced
 new devices to replace the handsets that still have serious flaws. This is not the actions of a company that listens but a company that simply churns like a machine on a pre-set course with nobody at the wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite much to like about the E72, I for the single reason that Nokia seem to have no ears to hear and no fingers to type, am out until further notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very interesting post, perhaps the review I wish I had read when I first started looking at the E72.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've waited several months for mine and bought it as soon as the first units were available. I have to say that the first firmware turned out to be pretty decent for what I was expecting (all my previous Nokias had terrible Symbian firmware at the time of
 release).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not bad, not bad at all. But I can see how the solidity when it comes to corporate email usage (and overall heavy email use) is still lacking. Perhaps Nokia will deal with that in future firmware upgrades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curiously you did not mention one aspect that to me is the fatal mistake that kills the E72 as a good product... a bad design decision. The amount of RAM.</p>
<p>The thing boots with a lot less RAM than other Symbian models... at boot I get about 35 MB free after loading a couple of small apps. This detail alone totally cripples a phone that would otherwise be a great multitasker. (The 6220 Classic I also have boots
 with over twice that much RAM and I don't get apps closing and crashing all the time)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia probably noticed it and now the E5 will have more memory. But I still feel ripped off... I love the E72 but it is fatally flawed. Not sure if I will keep it or not but I don't feel like spending more to get the E5 only because of the RAM issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets hope Nokia coders can improve E72&nbsp;memory management a bit... right now it is a disaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Strangely I have no other complaints. Unlike you I never had spacebar issues (23.007) and the battery door is very solid (especially if you pull that O ring out a bit so it closes tighter). The phone has been great and well built.... it's only the low
 RAM... *sigh*</p>

<p>I agree with you.&nbsp; I had an E71 and, despite E72's fatal flaws, I will not going back with E71.&nbsp; Mainly because I like: compass, accelerometer, WebDAV-based remote drives (amazing! I throw out BT hahaha! just kidding), CPU with frequency scaling (that's
 the reason why the battery last longer than E71), and another enhancements I forgot now, but I hate the low free RAM memory.&nbsp; I still have mi old E71, I reset, and I'm surprised: 70MB free!</p>

<p>A few comments to serioussam</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Setting up emails using Ovi Mail. Instead of actually going through the process manually, there is an Ovi Mail automatic setup app which just prompts you to enter your account and password, then automatically sets up your Ovi Mail in 10 seconds by itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The bareness of the E72's client may be for some reason. Some countries have the E72 and E63 bundled with Nokia Email, some not. And with the prolific under the table deals by suppliers, sometimes phones intended for China are sold in the US, phones intended
 for Malaysia are in China, etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Ovi Suite vs PC Suite - It does the same jobs because somewhere down the line, they will phase out PC Suite and replace it with Ovi Suite. They're just taking they're time about it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Email default client not working through wifi is false. However this could be stated as a proof of its dated interface. You have to manually set it in settings to connect to wifi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. As the E72 is still pretty young, and the number of software updates released are too few from average, there will be a lot of updates yet to come. However, certain problems do occur over time through usage, just like in laptops. And there are times when
 we are forced to reformat our computers, there will be times when we are forced to reformat our phones. Many of us here have seen that it is quite advisable to make resets of the phones before and after an update if there are problems before the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. It may please you to know that Symbian^3 and Symbian^4 phones will be in the market by next year. Symbian^3 will be the final iteration of the current Symbian OS, with Symbian^4 being an entirely new beast. You may want to wait for reviews of these upcoming
 phone OS once they are released if they suit your tastes.</p>

<p>Dear Serious Sam, there are heaps of sites on the web aiming at reviewing various popular products, most of which are dry, tasteless. You would be a boon for many of those sites with your wonderful style which would be to the interest of producers and consumers
 alike. Why don't you contact some of those sites and offer your services as reviewer?</p>

<p>E72 can be set to use wifi to receive emails, but the fact that it is not automatic is indeed annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slow OS is another problem for me, I also uses a BB 9700 (plus iPhone) and the 9700 is so much faster. Both phones uses CPU running around 600Mhz but the E72 just isn't inthe same league.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the next firmware can improve this aspect, as I hate to wait 2 or 3 seconds everytime I want to reply email.</p>

<p>Excellent post&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few little points, although these are in no way excuses:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the email client does do wifi. The problem is it doesn't support Destinations (except in MfE), which means it can't do the automatic switch between access points as needed and you have to manually configure the access point whenever you move
 about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However even with Destinations it's not "smart" as you would expect. It doesn't just find a new hotspot and ask if you want to add it, you have to do that manually. It doesn't assume or provide the option that wifi access points should automatically take
 priority over costly packet data, you have to manually configure the priorities. In fact if you stick a new sim in or swap sims, it will auto configure the access points for the sim, and put them as priority 1 !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Destinations is a half baked implementation. Nice idea to solve the problem, but it's missing features, and worst of all it requires applications to support it. Why on earth they let the E72 out of the door without all the bundled applications supporting
 Destinations is beyond me though!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>PC Suite being bundled I think was just a timing issue. Ovi Suite came out after they started on the E72. They should have started shipping with Ovi Suite later though. It's not made clear that Ovi Suite actually replaces PC Suite either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Ovi services on the phone do now have a 'single sign on'. I had to go to the Software Update menu to get this feature though. It may be there by default in newer firmware. It works well, although it also forces you to sign on again if you change access point!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Internet Radio is finally included the 031.023 firmware, and about the only welcome feature in it.</p>

<p>Great Post Serious Sam - thank you.</p>
<p>I was a long time user of the Treo 680 - which did just about everything I needed, but I did get an N95 as it was the last thing when it came out. I also got an iphone, but just can't love it - too much missing for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be given an E72 recently and have just spent a day setting it all up - email over wifi - my business only give non data-enabled sim cards to keep costs down, and I have to say it is a good successor to the treo, with much more capability
 to it. Thin, light, long battery, good screen - I have an AVI player on there, Quickoffice etc, so got to be good to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you won't be back on Nokia for a while - but I can understand - I bought a 6700 in Novemember and the Bluetooth doesn't work at all. Nokia are in danger of doing a Toyota and sacrificing quality for growth speed to 'keep up' with Apple- when
 they don't need to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they do need to start listening to the forums, and publicly acknowledging that they do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you give the E72 a second chance down the line</p>

<p>Thank you ( to the OP )&nbsp; for a very entertaining and informative read. I'm still very much in the honeymoon period, having just bought the E72 a dew days ago - making the swtich from the ill-fated N97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sold the N97 and went back to using my old N95 - which I just love, but wanted a simialr phone, just with an added keyboard. Most of the fancy hoity toity touchscreen phones out there ony have virtual keyboards, so the E72 seemed to fit the bill nicely,
 nicely priced too, as I was buying a handset only, and not a monthly contract phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to working with a very paranoid IT Dept, I haven't even attempted to configure the phone to my work email address, so only use it for my personal email - gemai - which I find works very well, and very quickly. Can get 3G most of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it's still pretty much at the novelty factor, I'm still finding my way with it, but thanks for the heads up as to potential longer term issues.</p>

    <title>Chart statistics for linear trend are not updating with workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom-con  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chart statistics for linear trend are not updating with workbook recalc</h2>
                    <p>I have a chart with a trendline, and the slope, intercept, and r-squared are displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daily, the underlying data for the chart updates. The displayed data points on the chart correctly update when data in the chart range changes. &nbsp;But, the equation and r-squared are not updating. In order to cross verify, i put a formula on the sheet for
 SLOPE, INTERCEPT, and CORR (and square it). &nbsp;I see that those formula values correctly update, but the displayed equation on the chart does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a daily basis, i can fix this by selecting the trendline statistics box, deleting it, and re-inserting it. When i re-insert, the correct values that match those in the formulas on the sheet display. &nbsp;But, the next time the value change, again the equation
 on the chart does not update (while both the formulas on the sheet do update, and the displayed points in the chart do update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On thing to note -- this does not happen with every chart in this workbook. &nbsp;Only some. &nbsp;For some the trendline statistics correctly update and for others they do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this seems like a "pure bug" to me. &nbsp;And a serious one, one where you are getting incorrect numeric results. If you don't happen to notice, you might believe the WRONG NUMBER. &nbsp;If there is anything one can do about this, let me know. &nbsp;Otherwise, however,
 HOW SOON CAN IT BE FIXED? I would assume that calculation bugs take a high priority in the Excel group.</p>

            <p>Since the Microsoft product group do not routinely monitor this forum the problem will need to be reported to them via another route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a quick experiment I was unable to reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing&nbsp;they will need is as simple an example as possible that demonstrates the problem and can reproduce the problem on other computers.&nbsp; They will also need to know the version number of Excel that you are running (File &gt; Account &gt; About Excel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to post such an example to a file sharing website I would be happy to check the reproducibility.&nbsp; I could then report it to the product group on your behalf.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could send it direct to Microsoft as a "support incident".&nbsp; Since it would appear to be a bug you should not be charged for this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>(A) Office 365 is a subscription plan, so I suggest you do a "manual" update to ensure you are using the current version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my system (Office Pro Plus 2016), I choose File &gt; Account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update Now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version is 16.0.7167.2040, and I suggest you report your version in future posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(B) I am using the XY Scatter chart type, and I suggest you report your specific chart type in future posts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note that if I do not edit or format the trendline equation and r-squared, then when I change the input data, the equation and r-squared update correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I only move the trendline label box, the contents also update correctly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I edit or format inside the label box, then the contents do not update in response to changes in the XY data on the worksheet.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the replies. &nbsp;I am using Office 365, and it is up to date. &nbsp;Also, the plot is X-Y scatterplot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT i noticed one possibly interesting thing mentioned in a reply by Mike Middleton. Mike said that if the equation text is formatted, then the equation does not update in response to change on the sheet. &nbsp;I will experiment with this. &nbsp;I often selected that
 text and simply increased its size, as by default it is pretty small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would never have guessed that this could "disconnect it from calculation". If so, Microsoft has laid a dangerous trap for users. &nbsp;However, i will do some experimentation to see if that is the root of my issue. For me, now, if it solves it, i can leave
 the text small. &nbsp;If thats it...well, all i can do it say it is not the best design, with no warning of this side-effect behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have reproduced this in 2013 with a line chart.</p>
<p>Putting a border on&nbsp;the box, increasing the font size, changing the font colour or making it all italic does not disconnect it, but applying character formatting within the text does.</p>

            <p>I agree, Stephane - I can see why it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I have a textbox linked to a cell I can't change the formatting of the characters without first removing the link so it is clear that I am breaking the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
In this case there is no explicit link; the textbox is normally updated automatically by Excel on a recalc that affects the chart.&nbsp; It seems to me that one of the following should happen:<br />
- character formatting in this box should be prohibited</p>
<p>- character formatting in this box should be forgotten when a recalc results in a change to the expression or R-squared value for the trendline<br />
- a warning should be given if the user tries to apply character formatting that the box will no longer update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you not agree?</p>

</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, if I have a textbox linked to a cell I can't change the formatting of the characters without first removing the link so it is clear that I am breaking the link." ==&gt; to be
 entirely accurate, you can format the text of a formula-governed text box as long as there is a single formatting run (combination of font name, size, bold, italic, ...). As soon as there is a second formatting run, Excel replaces the label and associated
 formula in the text box with a static richly formatted label. And the formula is lost without a warning from Excel.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>From an end user point of view, it's hard to understand the difference between a single formatting run label and a two formatting run label. Perhaps that's why the Excel team chose to avoid explicit messages, feeling that the product would have been too
 hard to use. But my opinion is that warnings should be on by default since the integrity of the spreadsheet can be destroyed in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>I had the same problem. </p>
<p>My version of Excel is 1711 (build 8730.2122). I noticed that formatting the R squared it no longer is updated. However, if I remove R squared, close the format trend line area, reopen it and check the R squared box, I get my formatting back and R squared
 is now updated normally.</p>

            <p>Hi, tommypkoch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an available computer, you may visit Windows Store and check for an app that can convert a video to a mp3 file. Once the file is converted you may follow these steps on how you can transfer the sound file from your PC to your phone:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Add a ringtone using a Windows PC </strong></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>1. Connect your phone to your PC, then do one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<ul>
<li>On a Windows 10 PC, click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>File explorer</strong>, and then click
<strong>This PC</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On a Windows 8.1 PC, click <strong>Desktop</strong>, click <strong>File explorer</strong> on the taskbar, and then click
<strong>This PC</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On a Windows 8 PC, click <strong>Desktop</strong>, click <strong>File explorer</strong> on the taskbar, and then click
<strong>Computer</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On a Windows 7 PC, click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Computer</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></ol>
<p>2. Under <strong>Devices and drives</strong> (<strong>Portable Devices</strong> on Windows 7),&nbsp;select your phone,&nbsp;select the
<strong>Phone</strong> folder, and then&nbsp;select the <strong>Ringtones</strong> folder.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p>3. Find the sound file that you created, and then drag the file into the <strong>
Ringtones</strong> folder.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p>4. On your phone, in the App list, go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Ringtones + sounds</strong>, and then tap
<strong>Ringtone</strong> to see a list of your available ringtones. Your new ringtone will appear under
<strong>Custom</strong> in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<br />
I also have a Dell laptop -- albeit it an old one.&nbsp; It has a Num Lk key, and the "numeric keypad" is blue-Fn functions overlaying the QWERTY keys 7 through 0, U through O, J through L, and M.&nbsp; (Some additional "numeric keypad" functions are also provided.&nbsp;
 Mine keyboard is so worn that I can no longer read them.)<br />
<br />
As for ctrl+shift+F....&nbsp; As I noted, that it is for XL2007 and later.&nbsp; It does not open a Format Cells menu in XL2003, which you indicated you use in the "applies to" information in your original posting.<br />
<br />
For XL2003, follow my instructions as I wrote them, to wit:&nbsp; type "m2", highlight 2 in the Formula Bar and for XL2003, click on Format, then Cells and select Superscript, then press Enter.

<p>
</p><p>In order to check, open Outlook &gt; Click on File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; click on ‘Trust Center Settings’ button &gt; Click on ‘E-mail Security’ and check the box ‘Read all standard mail in plain text’ under ‘Read as Plain Text’.</p>

            Yes, problem with any message containing HTML, not only Russian.<br />
One more thing. It's all works via Communigate Pro MAPI connector (latest version)<br />
Problem solved by removing connector and accessing mail via IMAP. Now all HTML rendered correctly, codepage works fine.<br />
Now I have another issue: this IMAP mailbox pretty huge. Over 60Gb (with subfolders).<br />
Outlook stores all mail in 1 file (why? any workaround?), so it will grow and stop syncing with "overflow" error.

<p>You can choose not to sync all folders by unsubscribing from them or you can set the sync slider to only sync emails from the last 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 months.</p>

<p>Here is one way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold down the Ctrl key and select the text boxes that you want to change transparency. Optionally group them together by Home tab &gt; Arrange group &gt; Group or Ctrl+Shift+G.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then <em>immediately</em> go to Drawing Tools format tab &gt; click the down arrow below the Shape Fill, Shape Outline and Shape Change commands which will open the Format Object dialog which offer the same options as under the Format Text box dialog. There
 under the Color and Lines tab you can change the transparency settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would then ungroup the text boxes.</p>

<p>Here is one way:</p>

<p>

<p>

<p>Sadly this does not work with me on Publisher 2007 or Publisher 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only changes the transparency on the last selected box in the group even if all selected and grouped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying - I tried that first but rep3eated it to make sure....</p>

<p>Occasionally it didn't work for me either. If you have the text boxes grouped to any other design element to begin with, that might be the problem. Also in testing it again today I noticed a couple things that may help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, confirm that the text boxes you want to adjust are not grouped with anything else on the page. Then while holding down the Ctrl key, left click each text box that you want to adjust. Notice that after selecting the text boxes the
<strong>Text box/format</strong> tab and the <strong>Drawing Tools/format </strong>
tab will appear on the Ribbon. This time <strong>don't</strong> try to group those text boxes.&nbsp;
<em><strong>Immediately</strong></em> after selecting the text boxes go to the <strong>
Drawing Tools/format</strong> tab &gt; click the down arrow below the Shape Fill, Shape Outline and Shape Change commands which will open a
<strong>Format</strong> <strong>Text</strong> box dialog. I noticed this morning that if you group the multiple text boxes that you selected then you will get a
<strong>Format</strong> <strong>Object</strong> dialog instead. This is because by grouping multiple text boxes you have created an Object. Either way go to Color and Lines tab &gt; Fill &gt; adjust the transparency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to use the right click context menu a lot, but noticed that if I try to right click the selected text boxes (grouped or ungrouped) &gt; Format Text box and try to adjust the transparency that then only the last text box is affected. Be sure to go to
 the the context tabs that appear on the ribbon menu after selecting text boxes to bring up the
<strong>Format</strong> <strong>Text</strong> box dialog and then adjust the transparency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also works with Pub 2007 though the details are a bit different (and easier IMHO).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Pub 2007 here are the steps I took. First I opened an old flyer publication I had made with Pub 2007 that has multiple text boxes on the page that are not grouped with any other text boxes or design elements. While holding down the Ctrl key I left
 clicked on and selected multiple text boxes...again they are not grouped with any other design elements on the page. Do not try to group them. Instead
<strong>immediately</strong> after selecting the text boxes go to the menu at the top of the page Format &gt; Text box which brings up a Format Text Box dialog &gt; Color and Lines tab &gt; Fill &gt; adjust the transparency. Again, do not use the right click context menu...it
 will result in only the last text box selected being adjusted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line is that by the time you get this worked out you could have adjusted the transparency on all the text boxes one at a time and been done with it. Personally, though it is possible, I would not waste my time with trying to do them all at once. Just
 sayn'...</p>

<p><span>Which Internet Explorer version are you referring to, which is installed from yahoo?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you have Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3 you can download and install Internet Explorer 8. Download Internet Explorer 8 for Windows XP from the following
 Microsoft Downloads link and install it and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Windows Internet Explorer 8 for Windows XP:</b></p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Make sure that you uninstall the Internet Explorer from Yahoo and then install this version.</p>

            <p>I am assuming that the code is in the Workbook Open event; is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really need to see a full copy of the code&nbsp;where the problem occurs and if there is any code in the&nbsp;worksheet module for the worksheet being selected then need to see that also because it is also likely that the cause of the error is in an event sub in that
 module. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be even better if you can upload a copy of the workbook to OneDrive. Guidelines to upload a workbook on OneDrive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Zip your workbooks. Do not just save to OneDrive because the workbooks open with On-Line Excel and the limited functionality with the On-Line version causes problems.
</li><li>To Zip a file: In Windows Explorer Right click on the selected file and select Send to -&gt; Compressed (zipped) folder.)
</li><li>Do not use 3rd party compression applications because I cannot unzip them. I do not clog up my computer with 3rd party apps when there are perfectly good apps supplied with windows.</li><li>Go to this link.&nbsp; https://onedrive.live.com</li><li>Use the same login Id and Password that you use for this forum.</li><li>Select Upload in the blue bar across the top and browse to the zipped folder to be uploaded.</li><li>Select Open (or just double click). (Be patient and give it time to display the file after initially seeing the popup indicating it is done.)</li><li>Right click the file on OneDrive and select Share.</li><li>Do NOT fill in the form; Select "Get a Link" on the left side.</li><li>Click the button "Create a Link"</li></ol>
<p>I won't be able to look at this again for a few hours so if anyone else wants to try and answer then feel free to do so to provide an early answer for the OP.</p>

            <p>After running a couple of times the problem appears to disappear. I am not sure but I think that&nbsp;it might be due to&nbsp;the file being a template and after opening it creates a normal macro enabled workbook and the code is then attempting to change the template

<p>
</p><p>I am not sure why you are using a Template type workbook or why you think that you need it. Why not simply use an xlsm workbook and the problem goes away.</p>

 their macro setting to "Disable all macros with notification".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change it to a workbook, left click opens it in the online version of Excel, which doesn't support macros.&nbsp; If you right click and select "Open in Excel" you then get all the nag ware; "Do you want to allow this website to open a program on your computer?",
 followed by "Some files can harm your computer.....", followed by a requirement to enter your id and password, AGAIN.&nbsp; Not very user friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally I will get a user who reports&nbsp;the program is broke.&nbsp; More than once&nbsp;it turned out to be trust setting set to "Enable all macros", which&nbsp;should work.&nbsp; I was hoping someone could figure it out.</p>

<h3> bill cohagan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail&#47;outlook.com blocking email from acm.org&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Outlook/Hotmail is (as of yesterday) blocking incoming mail from the acm.org domain (or from a block of their IP addresses). Since I use the ACM's email forwarding service this means that all my incoming email is now bouncing.&nbsp; I have contacted ACM and they
 are aware of the problem and have"opened a ticket"; however it is Microsoft that is responsible for the blocking and they have no idea if/when Microsoft will act to cure the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is of course very frustrating, particularly because there is no direct way for a Hotmail user to contact anyone; thus my post here. Hopefully someone from MS will respond and/or act on this message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that acm.org is a "respectable" organization: THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY, the professional organization that most of us in the computing community are members of!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>&nbsp; I just tested and acm.org forwarding to Hotmail seems to be working again. Apparently they worked it out.&nbsp; I can't imagine what motivated the original IP blocking.&nbsp; I would assume ACM is pretty careful about protecting their servers against being used
 for spam, but I guess nobody is safe these days!</p>

<p>&nbsp; I just called member services at ACM and they were aware of the problem. <strong>
<em>Sadly, the problem has returned and my ACM forwarding is once again not working.</em></strong>&nbsp; Same message: IP range is blocked by Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Doubt anyone will be around today at ACM to help and it's apparently not possible for mere mortals to get a live person to support Hotmail. Perhaps tomorrow...</p>

            ask acm.org for their snds server reports.<br />
<br />
they can obtain them here:<br />
<br />
https://postmaster.live.com/snds/<br />
<br />
it allows them to monitor the 'reputation' of their mail servers so they are not blocked or marked for spam.<br />
<br />
yes, it's stupid... but don't complain to me, spam microsoft... i have a similar issue.<br />
<br />
also, you can use this form as a consumer, to check why it is blocked: https://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl2&amp;ct=eformts<br />
<br />
input your email, you get a report, although no 'reputation' report, just why it is/isnt blocked.<br />

<p>&nbsp; Thanks for your response; however I'm going to guess that you didn't entirely read this thread as it has to do with Hotmail blocking an IP range, obviously not a browser issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; In any case, the problem appears to be solved as I am now able to forward mail to my Hotmail account via my acm.org email address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently Microsoft and the ACM were able to resolve whatever issue caused the walls to be raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks again,</p>

<h2>            How to install additional language packs in Office RT &#63;</h2>
                    I'm running Office on Surface RT in English. Is it possible to download spelling and grammar language packs for other languages ? I can add a language and then Word will tell me to go to the settings to download the language but nothing happens when I
 click the "not installed" link. Is it even possible ?

            Thanks for your answer. I have installed Dutch as an extra language on Windows RT (English US is the primary language), but when I'm in Word, the language settings indicate that the proofing tools for dutch are not installed. How can I get those as well
 ?

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would need to check if it’s an issue with Office RT installation files. So in order to re-install Office RT we need to refresh the PC which in turns re-installs Office RT.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Warning: Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link below for more information about Windows RT 8.1: </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the Windows RT 8.1 refresh is done, Windows updates will install automatically and Office RT will get installed. Then check if the language issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result to assist you further.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

            <p>Before re-installing windows and office, I'd just like to know if this is a supported scenario, namely having MULTIPLE companion language packs in addition to the primary language. I frequently need to write documents in English (primary), French and Dutch.</p>

    <title>Copy Rows from Worksheet A to Worksheet B if a condition is met in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenrabbers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy Rows from Worksheet A to Worksheet B if a condition is met in Cell X</h2>
                    <p>I hope I can explain what it is that I'm trying to do. It's quite possible that there is a simple solution that would accomplish the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet that tracks sales of certain items. I would like to be able to copy all of the rows from the primary worksheet to other worksheets based on the "Date" in one of the columns in the primary worksheet. I will have a worksheet for 2017,
 2018 and others moving forward. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for every instance in Column 'D' of the primary worksheet that has a date between Jan 1, 2017 and Dec 31, 2017; the entire row would be copied to worksheet "2017".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems simple but I just can't get anything to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can just copy all the cells in the primary and then sort and do other things to but am looking for something a bit more automated.</p>

<h2>            Unable to FORWARD attachments from Mac outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I ran in to the following issue today. I am not sure if this is an existing one but couldn’t find any solution after googling for few hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem. </p>
<p>Outlook 2016 (Win) won’t receive attachments FORWARDED from Mac outlook (ver 15.23).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Testing. </p>
<ul>
<li>Attachment is a simple JPED and a PNG file</li><li>Mac outlook sends email as HTML by default</li><li>Email receives to the Win client but not the attachment </li><li>If I open the same email from a Mac outlook the attachment is there</li><li>No errors in exchange log or spam filter</li><li>Can SEND (new emails) email attachment as normal</li><li>If I FORWARD the message as RICH TEXT the attachment appears in Win client</li></ul>
<p>Emails are set to send as HTML by default due to the signature and disclaimer. Any response is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
                </div>

</p><p>I am using office 365 for MAC. In Word 16.11, in the ribbon, the name of the font appears next to the font size.&nbsp;

            I think that's burned into the code of the ribbon and can't be changed. However, you can increase the size of the display of everything.&nbsp;By adjusting the screen size in the system&nbsp;→ Preferences&nbsp;→ Displays.&nbsp;Change from Default to a larger size.&nbsp;

</p><p>Skype connects to many endpoints on skype.com and microsoft.com / live.com. Whitelisting all sub-domains of these urls would be the most likely way to make Skype work correctly. We do not support using Skype in a highly restricted network enviroment and
 so anything less than this is likely to cause you issues. </p>
