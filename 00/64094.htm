    <title>Xbox gift card fraud - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathydilallo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox gift card fraud</h2>
                    purchased two Xbox gift cards one in July for $25 from a Dollar General store, and one most recently for $50, from a local super market. &nbsp;These cards were purchased for my Grandson the latter one for $50 was for his birthday. Last night when he entered
 in the numbers it stated the card was already used. His disappointment again was nearly heartbreaking. &nbsp;I contacted the stores and they said they could not assist me, I tried all the methods reaching out to Xbox to no avail. &nbsp;Could someone please help

<br />
If he logs into his account at account.microsoft.com does it show that the $50 was applied to his account?&nbsp; Sometimes it gets submitted twice and the second time it comes back as "already redeemed" because it already got applied to the account.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't say what diagnostics you used that came up with the hard drive test fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do it with the correct tools:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test the Hard Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; look for your Computer's specifications &gt; find out brand of Hard Drive &gt; go to Hard Drive Manufacturer's website &gt; find and download Hard Drive Diagnostic software and make a Bootable disk from it&nbsp;following their
 instructions &gt; test your Hard Drive to see if it&nbsp;is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can also use this Method to test your Hard Drive:</p>

<h2>            Do I Need Python Installed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I understand that Python is a programming language, but If I'm not a programmer why do I need it or is it necessary for other programs to work?</p>
<p>I have Python 2.6: 2.6.1 and 3.3.0 installed. Can I safely delete all or some of the versions?</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit using Internet Explorer 10.</p>

            Python is used by various graphics programs, and if you uninstall it the software that requires<br />
Python will not function.<br />
Whether you need three versions or not I can't say. It would depend on the version of the
<br />
software that requires it.<br />
If you have updated a software that uses Python and only have that one program using it<br />
then you should be able to uninstall the older version/s. <br />
All I can suggest is you either live&nbsp; dangerously and uninstall, or leave it. If you uninstall and your software does not function then it's only a matter of reinstalling that version - if you have a copy or
<br />
have verified you can still download a new copy of that version.<br />
<br />
The Gimp photo editing software is one example a software that needs Python. I believe<br />
(just going on my crusty memory) that at least one of my 3D rendering programs uses it too.<br />
I have two versions of Python -2.5.2 , and&nbsp; 2.6.6 (64bit) , but the total between them is
<br />
only about 87MB, so they don't take up much space.<br />
<br />
btw - Just to sort out the terminology. Programs get uninstalled. If you delete them it can lead<br />
to problems. Nothing major, but always uninstall.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device manager usually shows an error message if the device is not working properly or the driver for that device is corrupted or missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would suggest that you visit the hardware manufacturer website download and install the latest drivers for the device and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If updating the drivers does not fix the issue you may try uninstalling the device from the computer and later try reinstalling it and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information refer the below mentioned article:</p>
<p><b>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error code along with this error message?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Was it working fine before?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which Hot-fix are you referring to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, I would suggest you to check for any error message associated with Bluetooth Adapter, do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>Device Manager</b> in the Start search box and hit <b>ENTER</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>View</b> on the Menu bar and select
<b>Show hidden devices</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate <b>Bluetooth Adapter</b> and expand the same.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click <b>Bluetooth Adapter</b> and select
<b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What’s the exact error, if any, under
<b>Device Status</b>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps provided in the following article and check if the same issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth devices do not work correctly on a computer that is running Windows 7</b></p>

            I sure hope not. To end a working client on the benefit of a non mature beta version is completely stupid. First make sure the 5.x branche works like it should, then and only then think of ending the &nbsp; 4.3 support

<p>The beta is no where near ready: </p>
<p>screen shares requested again and again on the forum, </p>
<p>auto answer, </p>
<p>separate chat message window, </p>
<p>Skype volume control as Mac Skype has for example, </p>
<p>plus still many complaints that Skype is not functioning yet...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you click on "start new conversation", you have lost the video call... &nbsp;see either the call, or the chat messages, not both which is a real pain as most of my calls are in another account where there will be 2 or 3 chat conversations with other Skype
 contacts, simultaneously with the video call...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst understanding that older versions need to be retired at the end of their lives, everyone else ensures that the replacement version offers more than the retiring version for a better user experience, however, here the move will be a &nbsp;retrograde step,
 functions I use all the time will be unavailable on the Linux Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this does indicate Microsoft's bullying nature, with little consideration for it's users, a complaint widely shared, and possibly one of the main reasons there are many Linux users, certainly this action will redouble my efforts to move my few remaining
 friends on Windows away to Linux or Mac. &nbsp;Certainly when Microsoft retired the ,last version, there were many who were left without a service, with some having strong grounds of litigation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On weak connections there are two very different responses in Linux Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><p>v 4.3 with separate chat window allows continued contact by chat messages, until there is enough bandwidth for a video call, then the call is pixelated in very weak connection calls (spend hours in Skype accounts for different contact groups making
 calls to computers on weak wifi connections every day). &nbsp;The separate chat window also enables chat conversations with other Skype accounts without disrupting the video call, something I do for sustained periods every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beta v 5.3 on a weak connection shows the spinning trying to connect sign, this does not permit video call or contact by chat message, hence v 5.3 does not permit any form of contact at all with computers on a very weak connection, effectively useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major bug as there are significant parts of the world, most of South East Asia for example, where there is no landline infrastructure, but many many cellphone users with weak 2g / 3g connections on Facebook &amp; Facebook Messenger (calls
 run by Skype), that would love to make Skype calls (pretty well all of the friends I have in that region for example). &nbsp;This is not an economically strong region so Linux's light cpu loads offering acceptable computing on elderly computers long long after
 they were able to run a supported version of Windows OS is very helpful to those millions of people. &nbsp;Skype v 5.3's response to weak connection is therefore a major bug</p>

            This decision constitutes abuse of paying customers. I will find it extremely difficult to switch my Xubuntu 17.04 installation to the AMD 64 version, I am running the generic X86 version on an AMD64 machine. My phone, which I cannot afford to replace
 at the moment, runs Android 6.0.1; my tablet, which is also not going to be replaced right now, runs Android 5.0.2.<br />
Skype essentially wants to force me to upgrade all my hardware. <br />
I want my Skype credit of $6.94 US to be refunded. Goodbye Skype, go to heck Microsoft.

<span>And about the closure of the old version on the new beta status will be removed, although who knows, many developers first write about the closure, and then postpone the deadline!</span></span>

<p>Lets hope you are right about deadline postponement... &nbsp;v 5.3 still has a very long way to go... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One big problem is that v 5.3 only occasionally connects video on a weak wifi call at the other end, it occasionally connects but does not sustain the call whereas v 4.3 sustains the video call on the same connection. &nbsp;So the video call failing is not a
 cloud issue, but an incomplete software installation, in keeping with the Microsoft habit of pushing out incomplete software and then waiting for the user community to highlight the bugs that need fixing</p>
<p>
</p><p>*******************</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit as unable to add new posts to this thread, does not bode well that Microsoft is unable to keep a forum, one of the most widely used user participation webspace online, billions &amp; billions of forum thread pages working well all over the web... &nbsp;Or is
 this Microsoft pretending to listen to users? &nbsp;The post wanted to add:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still unable to reply in some threads, this I strongly believe is a really important point that shows clearly it is far far too early to retire the stable Linux Skype version 4.3:</p>
<p>Beta 5.3 is a very long way from ready to take over from the stable version 4.3. &nbsp;One example that makes it not possible for me to use Beta 5.3 (have tried quite a bit), whereas stable version 4.3 is working fine, is that on weak connections the
 two very different responses in Linux Skype show how far Beta 5.3 has to go before ready for general use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>v 4.3 with separate chat window allows continued contact by chat messages, until there is enough bandwidth for a call, then the video call is pixelated in very weak connection calls (spend hours in Skype accounts for different contact groups making
 calls to computers on weak wifi connections every day). &nbsp;The separate chat window also enables chat conversations with other Skype accounts without disrupting the video call, something I do for sustained periods every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beta v 5.3 on a weak connection shows the spinning trying to connect sign, this does not permit:&nbsp;</p>
<p>any audio or video call,&nbsp;</p>
<p>terminating the call,</p>
<p>or contact by chat message,&nbsp;</p>
<p>hence v 5.3 does not permit any form of contact at all with computers on a very weak connection, effectively useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty sure that almost every Skype user would prefer a pixelated video call &amp; chat messaging to a spinning logo trying to connect that does not enable any communication at all! &nbsp;This is a major bug as there are significant parts of the world, most
 of South East Asia for example, where there is no landline infrastructure, but many many cellphone users with weak 2g / 3g connections on Facebook &amp; Facebook Messenger (calls run by Skype), that would love to make Skype calls (pretty well all of the friends
 I have in that region for example), many of those people have friends &amp; family working in distant parts of the world where traditional telecoms is prohibitively expensive. &nbsp;This is not an economically strong region so Linux's light cpu loads offering acceptable
 computing on elderly computers long long after they were unable to run a supported version of Windows OS is very helpful to those millions of people. &nbsp;Skype v 5.3's response to weak connection is therefore a major bug</p>

            <p>Hello Ned</p>
<p>I had problems with adobe reader 11 standard. There is a Troubleshoot compatibility option. You have to go to the exe file in c:/programs right click to get to the option. There you could run in win 7 or 8 compatibility. I had no luck with&nbsp;standard 11. Uninstalled
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That Adobe Acrobat Reader DC ran with no problems that I remember. I didn't need all Cloud storage, and editing features. Uninstalled that. Now just open pdf with Edge. Good Luck!&nbsp;</p>

            I too have a compatibility problem with acrobat XI Pro since updating to Windows 10.&nbsp; The acrobat updater cannot update C:\Config.msi\<span>PT3BD6.tmp file.&nbsp; Also win10 chooses
 the internet explorer icon for acrobat on the lower menu rather than the acrobat icon and every attempt I make to correct it is blocked by windows.&nbsp; Clearly some kind of incompatibility between windows and the application program.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</span>

            Yes, Windows 10 and Adobe XI Pro are compatible!&nbsp; I installed, Adobe XI Pro almost a year ago while running Windows 8.1, then in November, 2015, upgraded my PC to Windows 10.&nbsp; The only problems I've had is&nbsp;"all" updates fail, due to the fact I did not
 purchased from Adobe! &nbsp;I went through another Tech company instead and paid less than half the price, it was worth it!&nbsp; Good Luck!

            Subsequent upgrades to Adobe Standard XI will also trigger a loss in functionality. Use Windows Troubleshoot Compatibility and then if the functions are restored, "save the settings for this program".&nbsp; I don't recommend accepting Adobe's security patches
 and upgrades as they will trigger problems and their help numbers are buried under many irrelevant layers of sales promotions on their website.<br />

            <p>I had Adobe Acrobat XI Standard installed with the latest update 11.01.16. I upgraded to Windows 10 and when I tried to open Acrobat, nothing happened. &nbsp;I tried to uninstall and reinstall through control panel, but it did not work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I used AcroCleaner to uninstall Adobe Acrobat XI Standard and rebooted. &nbsp;Next I reinstalled Adobe Acrobat XI Standard. &nbsp;Next I went to Adobe's webpage for updates and downloaded the latest Acrobat update 11.0.16 and ran that. &nbsp;Now it works fine Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a different system I tried uninstalling Acrobat XI Std first before running the Windows 10 update, but it had the same outcome as leaving it on there. &nbsp;When I tried to run it, it did nothing. &nbsp;It did not open, it did not give an error message...nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, Adobe Acrobat XI Std. is compatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;Not sure about Pro version, but I would imagine it should be.</p>

            <p>Although I use many Adobe Products I no longer recommend them as a retired IT Professional I still work with and assist many Non-Profit and Charity operations that battle for Funding of Software and Support. They find it impossible to use software on a subscription
 basis or update software that is not used a lot as well as the cost of a learning curve and loss of productivity learning new or major changes the interface of applications. I recently assisted one operation to purchase windows 7 and some new machines with
 windows 7 pre-installed at quite a cost despite the assistance from some sponsors and myself. They did not want Windows 8 machines as to most Business users that is a Cell Phone operating system to which I agree. Fortunately they could get a free upgrade to
 windows 10 and were prepared to wait a year or so, but now their full investment and operation has come to a halt, as some of the support work I do for people at no cost. I use Adobe Acrobat 10 to support a sporting operation and other such organizations,
 now they can no longer afford to continue functioning as most of their software would cost too much to replace or upgrade, and sponsors are not prepared to help with products that have a life expectancy of less that 8 to 10 years especially on software that
 is used only about 4 times per Year to create special PDF documents or like myself and some others that use Adobe Premier one or twice a year to make a video for personal use. I purchase Adobe Suit 6 for myself some time ago at huge expense and have only used
 it about 15 to 20 times to create holiday movies and some sport related archives. I believe software Vendors can not be expected to update features in an application free forever but need to fix simple problems that do not require rewrite of the application
 for at least 10 years, like motor manufacturers are required to carry stock of spares for that period. I admire Microsoft for their attempts to try their best to maintain compatibility for as long as possible without being detrimental to progress and functionality.</p>
<p>I will just have to follow some others and no longer support or recommend ADOBE Products.</p>
<p>Over many years as an IT professional I and many of my colleagues often were asked to block access on their firewalls and routers to prevent users any access to Adobe update servers or for that matter any adobe servers or services of any type . All updates
 must be downloaded on a single machine and tested before updating on the rest of their machines manually. I have done support at many companies that do not allow any of their Graphical or engineering PC connection to the internet for obvious privacy reasons.
 This is also nowadays causing many problems as several applications need to divulge unknown private data to their developers that is often leaked to opposition companies. Some companies are also concerned by the access to the configurations and types of systems
 used for their design work or the other software they use for this. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows 10 has finally driven the final nail in my casket. I started with DOS 2.0 many years back. Paid for, coded around, and&nbsp;Digested every advance MS ever tossed our way. Remember the lead balloons? Windows ME, and get a load of "Vista" and the aftermath.
 Still, I remained to be able to some how eventually justify the costs and jumbling of the GUI. Nothing changed, just the wrappers.

<p>
</p><p>The Win 10 MS Cloud and respective consequences, for the first time in my soft sweet life, have focused me on Apple IOS or Linux in that order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is not advancing anything but scuttling the "Personal" in Computing.</p>
<p>It is now the "RC", or&nbsp;"Rented Computer" with a "Parking Meter" and even Traffic Camera Ticket concepts all in one so called "Update".</p>

<h2>            __MS Speech Recognition will not allow dictation...but will allow Commands</h2>
                    MS Speech Recognition will not allow dictation... it will only allow me to use commands like, File, New, Open Wordpad etc.&nbsp; But once Wordpad is opened, and I have the cursor in the text box, and start a letter, the Speech Control keeps responding with
 What was that?<br />
<br />
I see a user Myra2001 who hashad the same problem but with her it was Commands didn't work.&nbsp; It seems we have both have the same problem but with different aspects of the software.&nbsp; I wonder if this is a registry issue??<br />
<br />
I have tried all the suggestions given to Myra2001 by MS technical support and to no avail. I have created new profiles, and trained them, and with the fact I have no problem with Commands and the SR software understands me, so not an issue with mic or diction.
 My mic works fine with Skype on calls and have clear speech audio.<br />
<br />
I would like to get the SR working if that's possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

Hi 
Mouneshwar R<br />
<br />
My answers in response to your questions:<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Were you able to dictate successfully before it stopped working?&nbsp; </li></ul>
I rebuilt my machine last Aug 09 from the Vendor's restore partition due to a Vista error. (Gateway MT6707 Laptop) Since that time I had not attempted to use the SR application until the last few day.&nbsp; So this is the first time I attempted to use the SR application.
 Therefore I can not verify that it 'worked' prior to my first attempt in recent days.
<ul>
<li>Check in the Options if you’ve selected <strong>Enable Dictation Everywhere</strong> from the
<strong>Speech context menu</strong> ? </li></ul>
Yes have tried this option both checked and unchecked and the result is the same, Commands work, but ditation doesn't, I can't even get incorrect words to appear in dictation, and non Command words return the error What was that?.&nbsp; Any Command uttered by me
 are clearly responded such as File, Open, OK, Show Numbers, Open Wordpad, but no dictation whatsoever.
<ul>
<li>Does it occur only on Notepad or it occurs even in Microsoft Word? </li></ul>
It is occurs in all apps such as Notepad, also in MS Word 2007, in Yahoo messenger text box.
<br />
You suggested that I follow the troubleshooting SR page, here are the answers to those questions.

<div>The computer hears me as it can follow the Command prompts. This tells me that the SR 'engine' can hear and understand me clearly so mic controls are not an issue. It seems a portion of the SR app isn't functioning mainly the dictation portion. However
 in reading this forum with other similar problems where some people can dictate ( which I cannot) but they cannot issue Commands ( which I can).&nbsp; This tells me there is something wrong as in a registry setting, tripping one of these functions to be disable
 or enable. How this would have gotten changed is beyond me as I have stated that I haven't used the application since the rebuild from vendor's recovery partition.<br />

<p>It is obvious from the history in this forum to me, that those proposed solutions ( which I have all tried ) have not successfully resolved this issue.&nbsp; The fact that multiple people experience the same symptom, whether it be Commands or Dictation, tells
 me it is more than an option issue.&nbsp; The answer won't be within the options as there really isn't that many to be tried and tested.&nbsp; For this reason, I would seriously request that you escalate the issue to the pertinent engineers, simply for the reason that
 no resolution has been provided in the past and even in the present for me.</p>
<p>Since the application isn't a regular app whereby I can uninstall and reinstall to ensure registry entries are correct.&nbsp; If there is such a 'repair' utility or download link to allow me to reinstall the application, I would be most grateful if you could
 provide me with such information/link if available to test and resolve the situation.&nbsp; If not, then escalation would the prudent action.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Some additional pertinent information.<br />
<br />
I recently purchased a laptop for my wife. It is the same identical model that I mention above.&nbsp; I had to rebuild the hard drive on it, and thus cloned my hard drive to hers.&nbsp; Once it was operational, I then restored to factory settings and had a new copy of
 Vista on it.&nbsp; No Service packs.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I just started Speech Recognition on her laptop and it works just fine. Both Command and Dication are working!!!!<br />
<br />
In view or Myra2001 problem which is very similar to mine and others, she indicates that she had a new laptop with Vista SP1 on it.&nbsp; Well my own laptop has SP2.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that the Service Packs have broken the Speech Recognition.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Please escalate as I fear and had supected that it isn't an option issue, but an introduced bug with the SPs.<br />
<br />
If a solution is fothcoming, please update this thread.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
PS. Is it possible to remove the Service Pack for the laptop?&nbsp; What would be the detriment&nbsp;in doing this?

            More information:<br />
<br />
I decided to remove SP2 and roll back to SP1&nbsp; and test the SR functionality, again the problem remained.<br />
<br />
So I decided to roll back even further and removed SP1, and I confirmd SP1 was gone by check System, in the Control Panel and it was indeed gone.&nbsp; I tested the SR application and the problem still remained.&nbsp; Perhaps it is some other Vista update that's causing
 the problem.<br />
<br />
Again, I look forward to your reply.

            Hmmm,&nbsp; I am passively keeping an eye on this thread. As for my problems,&nbsp;which were never resolved,<br />
I thought maybe they had to do with my installing Japanese IME. However, on another computer&nbsp; with Japanese IME, speech recognition did work&nbsp;for dictation and commands. But this free SR seemed to be still in its infancy and inconsistent and timeconsuming over
 just typing. On one of my new computers I have gone back to XP, happily.&nbsp;

            This matter is not resolved and likely never will be.&nbsp; I am disabled in the upper parts of my body and I have a roommate who is a technical author and networking expert, so between us, I use it, and he understands it.&nbsp; What he has come up with is that
 it is a matter of, (from my understanding), which program is commandeering which type of sound, or something like that, or the opposite.&nbsp; Perhaps an example would be more clear.&nbsp; When I am having an instant message chat with a colleague in another location,
 if they send something while I'm dictating, even if I have the sound to the computer turned off, it sends my Windows Speech Recognition into this mode that you are describing.&nbsp; I suddenly cannot type even one single word, but commands live and breathe.&nbsp; In
 other words, the hardware that listens to you do commands is somehow not listening to dictation properly, internal to the computer itself.&nbsp; If you try with Microsoft, they just give you those answers like "I

<p>If anyone is still looking for an answer to this problem, please try this: it works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using: Windows 7 SP1 64 bit, Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms: Windows Speech Recognition will operate commands such as open, switch to, click etc.</p>
<p>You can manually open a Notepad or Word and if you try to dictate, you will just get What was that? in the black window on the WSR widget.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also find that if you say 'Press T' for example, or say Type 1234 etc that you can type these letters. Some other commands like 'backspace' work as well; however, no amount of talking will give any dictated text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix:</p>
<p>Close all open windows.</p>
<p>Start speech recognition and click the button to turn it on.</p>
<p>Check that your microphone is showing level in the indicator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say 'Open Word'</p>
<p>When Word has opened, say 'Blank Document'. A blank doc will open with the cursor flashing top left.</p>
<p>Now try dictating text- hopefully it will work. Not just in this word doc but in Notepad, Outlook, or anywhere else that you try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem was, at least in my case, a combination of open windows and WSR not knowing which was the active one to dictate into. It seems that if WSR explicitly opens a program itself, it appears to 'reset' that behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you find this helpful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does anyone else own this 3rd party device that attaches to the left side of the console? If so, how has it been working for you thus far? I just attached mine today. Have to admit, I am bit worried that this 3rd party device may
 cause my console to overheat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't answer your question since I don't have one myself, but the device looks like it has ventilation, so that's good. I would recommend checking it every few days to make sure it doesn't overheat. If you feel any heat at all, take it off,
 since the XB1 is designed to not give off any noticeable heat.</p>

<p>I have an external 2 TB hard drive and it works flawlessly. I wouldn't be worried about any usb powered device running down the power demands of this huge beast of a console. It's got a huge power supply and large fan so no worries, might just be low quality

<p>I did an experiment. I felt the temperature of the console after hours of Forza Horizons 2 game play with the media hub attached. The next day I removed the media hub, and did an all-day-gaming session on Forza Horizons 2. Felt the console's temperature,
 and it felt the same. Conclusion: the collective minds media hub works as it should and will not cause your Xbox One to overheat.

<h3> benie76  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using monitor for PS4, can&#39;t hear sound</h2>
                    <p>Ok. I don't really know how to explain this. So I have a PS4, and have linked my old DVI monitor to it and it works, yet I'm hearing no sound. The monitor has an analog audio port in the back. Thought I could just plug my speakers in. Didn't work.</p>
<p>I tried to configure it, and all the listed audio output ports show "Not plugged in". I see 'NVIDIA HDMI Output (four of these)". All say Not plugged in, including my Speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that the speakers or something have to be plugged into my computer. I also cannot configure my monitor through Windows (as it's not attached to my computer).</p>
<p>The brand, all I know is it says "Hyundai" on the front of it. I don't know the brand. I got this and another monitor way, way back in 2000, before HDMI even existed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I forced to buy an HDMI-compatible monitor, just to hear sound? I don't have $300+ I can just throw away. Or is there another, free way to do this? I was hoping for an analog cable I could attach from my monitor to my computer, to get my speakers to recognize

            <p>Hi Benie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the monitor is not connected to the computer and there is no operating system involved , I would suggest you&nbsp;to please contact the monitor manufacturer and check if they can help you fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be a hardware issue with the monitors or a compatibility issue while pairing your monitor and the speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the thought "I was hoping for an analog cable I could attach from my monitor to my computer" , again , you need to contact the computer manufacturer and check if there is such a possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us if&nbsp;you face&nbsp;any Windows related issue.</p>

<h2>            Automated way to copy and paste messages to notepad</h2>
                    <p>Basically, I receive poker hand histories for each hand by email and I have to manually copy and paste them to notepad where I can then read them into a software program. Is there any way you can do this automatically? I currently have the emails sent to
 hotmail but I can get them sent to outlook if that's more flexible. </p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>In Outlook you could program a VBA macro module to export the email contents into a spreadsheet or text file (perhaps comma separated), but that is very advanced programming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Microsoft Office 2013, you could use Microsoft Access to "pull" the data out of Outlook.&nbsp; Here's what you'd want to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure all the emails you want to extract are in the same email folder (you might setup a rule for this to organize incoming messages).<br />
</li><li>Open Access, then choose More &gt; From Outlook Folder in the External Data tab</li><li>It will pull in the contents of all the emails in that folder.</li></ol>
<p>What's great about this is that you can link it to the Outlook folder, so that next time you need not do any of these steps.&nbsp; You simply open Access again and choose "Refresh".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once the data is in Access, you can export it to a text file for use in the other software program.</p>

            Hi MargaretPark1 ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hello MargaretPark1,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try booting into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />5. In Startup Settings screen, you need to click Restart.
<br />
<br />6. After restart, press F4 or 4 to boot into Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />This will allow you to login as built-in administrator, then you can manage your system.
<br />

<p>Hi ItxasoGil,</p>
<p>I notice that the SR is closed. As you discussed with the SR manager, licenses activated via a product key, that is, bought from distributor or internal use for MS Partners, do not take supplements. However, it is possible to add the supplement through a
 direct license to Microsoft E1 or E3 as explained in this <a href="https://support.office.com/es-es/article/Informaci%C3%B3n-general-acerca-de-las-licencias-de-Skype-Empresarial-Online-3ed752b1-5983-43f9-bcfd-760619ab40a7?omkt=es-ES&amp;ui=es-ES&amp;rs=es-ES&amp;ad=ES" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.&nbsp;So, we recommend you add the supplement through a direct license to&nbsp;Office 365 Enterprise&nbsp;E1 or E3.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Mandy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many factors that can result to your Facebook page going too big. One of these is due to the browser and device's screen resolution. For us to properly figure out the appropriate resolution for your concern, we'd like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which browser are you using to access Facebook?</li><li>Have you checked if you encounter the same difficulty using another browser?</li><li>Are you running into the same issue with another web page aside from Facebook?</li><li>What steps have you taken so far to resolve the concern?</li></ul>

            With Insider builds these issues are common.
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first time that link removed old files and&nbsp; started to download and install updates again, but&nbsp; not any more , the pending restart command is still there after restarting. I have tried several times to run that command script which you posted to me.</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; BSOD - IRQL_GT_ZERO_AT_SYSTEM_SERVICE</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello everybody!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a notebook running Windows 10 Home, installed 4 weeks ago, updated from a Windows 7 Home Basic after receiving the notification. However, since then, I'm facing the famous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), informing the error&nbsp;"IRQL_GT_ZERO_AT_SYSTEM_SERVICE".
 The message says that the system will restart but nothing happens and I have to force shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched a lot about the issue, reading a lot of tech support forums, and I believe it's a problem with drivers, but I might be wrong because I know nothing about it and never faced this problem, not even with Windows 7. The error shows up ramdomly,
 in shorter or longer time intervals between the incidents. The last time, I was browsing the internet, using Google Chrome, and a wild BSOD appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already installed all the updates and ran the commands&nbsp;"<em>sfc /scannow</em>"; "<em>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</em>" e "<em>chkdsk /f /r</em>" (which didn't work because the verification after restart freezes and don't finish). None of them
 worked to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following link has an compressed file with the Minidump folder files (.dmp) generated after the issues: https://goo.gl/AbjDqP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody can help me? I use my notebook a lot and just lost some important unsaved files because of the problem. Thanks already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p><em><strong>Bruno Ciaciare</strong></em></p>

<p>Hello ZigZag!<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tryed to set-up the Driver Verifier as you told me to, following the tutorial you gave, but when I reboot by computer, nothing happens, it just crashes on Windows logo, as you can see in the picture (link below, sorry for the poor quality):&nbsp;<br />
<br />
http://imgur.com/1F33H5X<br />
<br />
By the way, I wasn't able to perform the memory test yet, but I'll do it asap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, how what I'm supposed to do since I faced the above problem with the Driver Verifier?</p>

<h2>            iTunes will not install correctly for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I installed iTunes from the Microsoft Store. I clicked to open but the app will not pop up. I ran as administrator and got the iTunes Restrictions box. I clicked 'OK' but it will not open the iTunes Library. Can someone please help me find a solution to
 this problem? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Carlo Fer - please see my answers below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which build and version of Windows 10 are you running? You can find this information by clicking the Start button, type winver, and then press Enter. -
<strong>Version 1803 OS Build 17134.165</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you notice any changes on your PC prior to the issue? <strong>Yes, a few months ago after a Windows update I was not able to open iTunes normally. I had to open it by Running as Administrator.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to install the <strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1615?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">desktop version of iTunes for Windows 10</span></a></strong>?
<strong>Yes I did, I was not able to launch the normal way so I had to Run as Administrator. When I did I got the following message -&gt; The file "iTunes Library.itl" cannot be read because it was created a newer version of iTunes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you download and run the <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows app troubleshooter</span></a></strong>. - I ran the Windows app troubleshooter. It said
 the Windows Store cache may be damaged, Problem Found. I installed iTunes from the Microsoft store but I keep getting the same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other ideas? I really appreciate you helping me out.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we perform a recovery, let's try to perform an In-Place Upgrade with Windows 10. This will repair the installation of Windows 10 system files. Please refer to this forum article created by PaulSey:

<p>I have tried to research about the error message you're getting about <strong>
iTunes Library.itl</strong>. It looks like it has something to do with corrupted residual library files from iTunes. Some suggests to downgrade iTunes and also delete the residual files from iTunes. At this rate, I would suggest that you contact Apple for further
 assistance. </p>
