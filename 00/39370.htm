<h2>            Microphone isn&#39;t working after update</h2>
                    I updated my computer yesterday and now my microphone will not work for Discord, OBS, and Skype. I've had this insignia Microphone for a year now and this is the first time after an update that it has screwed up. The scheduled update was on 5/15/18.&nbsp;

<p>I don't think you can add "desktop programs".</p>
<p>Whatever "apps" are in the list may be there because they requested access.</p>
<p>Maybe, for everything else the "Microphone access to this device" is what matter.</p>

            I forgot to say that for me this problem just happened in the last few days (Oct. '18) so I suspect some windows update went too far changing privacy options that (i see now, but didn't know) existed before now.

<p><strong><span>Hello everyone</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Im having trouble with xbox live at the moment, well in fact I have had this problem for a while now and I cant seem to fix it. Me and my younger brother both connect to xbox live and for some reason when ever one of
 us wants to connect when the other one&nbsp;is already playing&nbsp;on it, we have to turn off the modem for us to both connect at the same time. Its becoming a real pain now as one of us will be in the middle of talking to our friends or in a match and we will have
 to dissconnect for the other one to go on it. Its beggining to cause conflict between us both XD</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>When we test the connection it always says that it can connect to the internet and to the network but not xbox live?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>My question is this, Is there a way we can both connect to xbox live at the same time with out having to turn of the modem?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thanks for reading</span></strong></p>

<p>When will the ONE get some decent games?<br />
<br />
Totally board with everything offered on the ONE, only some of the 360 games that work on the ONE have gotten me re-attention. Total lack of any offroad racing, car, trucks, bikes... On top of the free games are a joke lately, the 360 has gotten better games,
 2 months straight.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503-backwards-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
vote</a> to see which 360 games can make it onto One. Of course, please take into account that Microsoft needs the permission of the developers and publishers to bring the games over on One.</p>

<p>The Xbox One does already have decent games. Maybe not a lot in comparison to the 360, but then it hasn't been out as long as the 360 either. On my list to play/finish playing are Halo 5, Titanfall, Ryse, Thief, Shadow of Mordor, The Crew, and that's not
 even counting the backwards compatible 360 games. Sooner or later I'm going to get GTA 5 again, and Sunset Overdrive too.
</p>
<p>Out of interest, what games do you have that you are bored with? I could happily play Titanfall forever and I was until I got distracted by Halo 5, and then I got distracted by Elite Dangerous, which is now my current focus. I'm just playing it until it
 gets tedious and too grindy, and then I'll get back into one of the other games I have.</p>
<p>I should probably point out that not only have I not had the One for very long (only since October or something), I also work full time, standard 9-5. I try to play every evening/night, but I have plenty of other commitments that make it so I don't get burned
 out on any one game. If you're getting bored with videogames do something else for a while, either on the console or otherwise. It's got Youtube, Netflix, All4, BBC iPlayer, and so on like that</p>

<p>I agree with Brand. There are tons of good games on Xbox One. I've dumped thousands of hours into them.</p>
<p>But I can see how you might feel otherwise since demos and trials are very thin on the ground with the system. If you could try a few out you might get a taste for something outside of your usual genres. But eh... I guess demos hurt sales, or something,
 so they're missing this gen.</p>
<p>A few of my personal faves are Fallout 4, Shadow of Mordor, Dead Rising 3, AC Unity, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Alien Isolation...</p>
<p>... I know I'll like Sunset Overdrive and Ryse. I just haven't got round to them yet.</p>

<p>I want Forza Horizon 3, with a whole new map. I want the same amount of great indie games the PS4 is getting. I want Microsoft to spend money on new franchises, instead of renting old ones (Rise of the Tomb Raider). Sony got From Software to make Bloodborne
 exclusively for the PS4. Microsoft should ask them to make an exclusive Souls game for the Xbox One too (NOT Dark Souls. I mean a NEW franchise, like Bloodborne).</p>
<p>It seems like Microsoft is sleeping, and we are kind of abandoned here. We got Halo 5, and then we'll get Quantum Break and Gears 4 soon... will we only get shooters? Come on, please...</p>
<p>I want Hotline Miami, Machinarium, Eitr, Crossing Souls, Ghost Song, Soma, Dungeonof the Endless, Stanley Parable... These games aren't expensive, right?</p>
<p>Please, Microsoft! Read my message!</p>

<p>Op has played about 7 xbox one games &amp; looks like they've spent about 5 minutes on each one &amp; stopped playing.</p>
<p>There's plenty of great games on the xbox one but if you only stick to one type of game you will get bored.</p>
<p>They mention offroad racing,The Crew now has off road racing,ok,it's not a brilliant game but is a lot of fun with some friends.</p>
<p>There,s WRC,Seb Loeb Rally &amp; Dirt Rally coming in April.Ok,they are all rally games but it's offroad.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 2 has some offroad in it &amp; will keep you playing for many hours.</p>
<p>Pretty much all the games mentioned by the other's are all great games as well.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about a game then youtube or Twitch will show you some gameplay so you can make your mind up.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Games and WildTangent Games. Will not load or open.</h2>
                    
<p>These games worked fine about a month or so ago.&nbsp; The problem seems to be with the GAME CONSOLE itself.&nbsp; I get no screen, only a rectangle black line.&nbsp; The error code I get for Bejeweled anbd Wheel of Fortune is:&nbsp; "Config File Error" - Failed to open file
 (row, 0, Column 0)</p>
<p>I've tried everything I know to do and can't figure out why these two games worked fine before and a couple of weeks ago when I tried to play, Bejeweled, that's when the problem began.&nbsp; Also, it's not just this PC, but the same problem on my Office (desktop)
 PC.&nbsp; WEIRD!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP!!&nbsp; PLEASE!!</p>

<p>Hi lindagshe,</p>
<p>• What changes were made to the computer before you encounter the issue?<br />
• What all steps did you try to fix the issue?<br />
• Is it an online or installed game on the computer?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below and check if it helps to fix the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the “fixit” from the provided link:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety/en-us</a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Update to the latest flash player from the link:&nbsp;<a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</a></p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> If it is an online game, temporarily disable the security software.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

    <title>Skyrim Dragonborn sound bug. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ourtowndrunkss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skyrim Dragonborn sound bug.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guy. Okay so i just recently got the Skyrim Dragonborn DLC for the Xbox 360. I downloaded it from the Skyrim home page marketplace and i re-downloaded dawnguard and Hearthfire afterwards. When i loaded it up nothing change and i restarted my console
 and tried again and i was approached by the cultists but after when people talked to me i couldn't hear what they were saying and it sometimes bugged out where i got stuck looking at there face with nothing else to do but leave. I forgot about that as its
 not that big of a deal to me. But when i got to the island and met with Crescius (the crazy old man in the raven rock mine) he started talking funny. It was like a crackling noise that wouldn't stop and actually hurt my ears after awhile. This stooped after
 awhile but when ever i read a black book and travel to the&nbsp;realm of apocrypha the sound does the same thing but 10 times worse. Its almost like taking to mics and putting them up to each other. It lags my game so much and then kills me or send me out of that
 realm. I need help figuring out how to fix this. If you know anything please let me know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good advice Auswolf7, I have a similar issue in another game.</p>
<p>Assured, are you using any sound equipment other than your TV speakers?</p>
<p>I noticed yesterday playing Forza Horizon that my Vizio <a href="http://store.vizio.com/vsb210ws.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soundbar</a> does not like the screen that comes up after I win an event, there is some low frequency that kills it. However, my symptoms are different than yours, mine is muffled and I cannot hear anything but that muffling and no issues with Skyrim. I have
 to turn it off, and back on to get it to function again.</p>
<p>My game sound is fine just playing through the TV, but lacks the subwoofer's deep bass obviously, so it isn't the game per se. BTW, for anyone interested, that soundbar sucks at surround sound and the remote only functions if you point it at the exact square
 millimeter on the soundbar, where the IR sensor is located, which isn't fun when it's across the room. In other words...POS.</p>
<p>Good luck Assured!</p>

<p>Assured, yours sounds like a major problem and if the clear, delete, re-download doesn't work I think a call to Microsoft might be in order.</p>
<p>I have my Skyrim set to run through the HDMI cable to the soundbar. Mine is a Sony and it does a pretty good job with surround sound to the point that in the spring, if the doors are open, I have sometimes looked to see if it was raining outside too. lol</p>

<p>Thanks guys. But in the last few hours I came into more problems. I tried to start a new game and on the carriage no one would talk to me. I tried again and the carriage was flying around skyrim and then froze. Idk if this is caused by the same thing but
 I'll try your suggestions thanks again.</p>

<p>Glitches on new games can happen but usually deleting it and trying again works. I had a new game where Alduin wouldn't land so I was stuck. When I tried again everything was good. Your problems though sound like a major mess and wiping the slate clean might
 be the only thing to work. </p>
<p>Do other games work okay? Are you sure it isn't the hard drive in your 360 that is going belly-up?</p>

<p>LadyB, can you msg me a link to your soundbar? I like the "sound" of it. ::grin::</p>
<p>Assured are you telling us the cart you are in with Ulfric is actually airborne? That is definitely not a peripheral issue, from your description I'm imagining the scene from "The Wizard of Oz" when the tornado whisks Dorothy and Toto off to Oz. Sounds like
 hardware now. Did your current console ever RRoD? </p>
<p>Since you seem willing to start anew in Skyrim, I would delete EVERYTHING on your console related to Skyrim, DLC, patches, the lot, and reinstall game, then patches, then DLC one at a time and see if your game breaks after each DLC, before D/L the next one.
 The order of release was Dawnguard/Hearthfire/Dragonborn.... again, good luck sir!</p>

<h2>            Switch out of S mode &#34;Something happened and we couldn&#39;t start the upgrade.&#34;</h2>
                    I have a brand new Surface Go (8gb model) with Windows 10 Home in S mode (version 1803) OS build 17134.228. I have followed the well-documented&nbsp;instructions to "Switch out of S mode" in the Windows store. I was first prompted to update Microsoft Store.
 When I get to the point to click "Install," I get a message "Something happened and we couldn't start the upgrade" with a "Try again" button. Trying again over and over doesn't work. I made sure I have all updates installed. I have reset the machine 3 times.
 It is still getting stuck at the same point. How can I get S mode turned off? I will not be keeping this machine if I can't get past this point.

<h2>            Invalid Disk or Unallocated Disk Space when converted from dynamic disk to basic disk in windows 7 </h2>
                    Hi, I am kishore from India. New to windows 7. I have a laptop installed with windows 7 ultimate edition. I have a 1TB harddisk (SATA) with me. I connected that hard disk to the laptop with sata to usb cable. in disk management it showed me invalid disk.
 Unfortunately i click on the option convert to basic disk on that hard disk. Now it is showing the entire 1TB hard disk as unallocated single partition. there is lots of data in that hard disk. Please help me in retrieving all my data.<br />
please guide me with a best procedure.<br />
thanks in advance.

            Remove the external hard drive and do nothing further on it. You will need to send it to a professional data recovery company. I use
<a href="http://www.drivesavers.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Drive Savers</a> for my clients and they do work internationally. Drive Savers isn't inexpensive, with charges running anywhere from 500-3700USD, but perhaps your insurance company will cover data recovery costs. Many do.<br />
<br />
If that expense is impossible for you, then you can try using off-the-shelf data recovery software. R-Studio is particularly good and has a downloadable demo which will show you if it can retrieve anything before you buy.<br />

            Thanks for giving me an answer. I have a doubt here., Previously i faced a similar problem. That time i used windows xp and i used partition table doctor software to fix it. now also i tried in windows 7 but not working. i want to use any such softwares
 which can simply undo my operation (dynamic to basic harddisk convertion). I also tried your suggestion r-Studio but it is taking toomuch time and it also requires another harddisk to recover the data. but previously when i used partition table doctor it just
 showed me the partitions and i then click restore and with in 5 seconds i got all my data back including the partitions in the same hard disk as it was before. so could you suggest me any other opetations also..<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

            Do some Googling for partition editors then or do your rescue work on a computer which supports the software you like to use.

            It seems that you tripped over a couple of issues:<br />
- When you converted the partition from dynamic to basic, you overlooked the warning that this would erase all data.<br />
- You do not seem to keep an independent backup of your important files.<br />
<br />
As you guessed, your data is still on the disk. The conversion from dynamic to basic only destroyed the partition tables but left the data intact. As Malke recommended, you need to check Google for a partition recovery tool that can handle dynamic partitions.

<p>I again stand corrected. I think Google is not my friend today. As noted below by nass1. the file is valid and the instructions he provided are those which most users with your issue found to be the fix.</p>

<strong>BCMLogon.dll </strong>is for Broadcom Corporation wireless Network Utility. You may configured the setting to manage your wireless networks on Start Up, hence changed the welcome screen and the Fast user switching.<br />

            i was able to manually type my correct logon name and password at the goofy old style logon screen but again i could not get the fast user switching to work..<br />
in my instance just unchecking the box was sufficient as ginadll did not exist in that location of the registry or anyplace else after running a search for it..<br />
i do now remember turning that goofy thing on before i shut it down too.. imagine that one folks..
<br />
thanks much nass1<br />

            In a default (normal) XP configuration, there is no reference in the registry to the Microsoft msgina.dll file - and when there is no reference in the registry to load a specific GINA, XP automatically loads the msgina.dll.<br />
<br />
When some third party program modifies the registry to load their custom GINA, that is when you might start to have some problems - especially if you update or uninstall the third party program.<br />
<br />
You might start to see stuff like this:<br />
<br />
User Interface Failure<br />
The Logon User Interface DLL csgina.dll failed to load.&nbsp; <br />
Contact your system administrator to replace the DLL, or restore the original DLL.<br />
<br />
User Interface Failure<br />
The Logon User Interface DLL xtgina.dll failed to load.<br />
Contact your system administrator to replace the DLL, or restore the original DLL.<br />
<br />
User Interface Failure<br />
The Logon User Interface DLL OSDgina.dll failed to load.<br />
Contact your system administrator to replace the DLL, or restore the original DLL.<br />
<br />
(but these things are easy to fix).<br />

            You need to tell us more about your system and how it got this way - then you can fix it.<br />
<br />
What does this mean?<br />
<br />
<i>I went through the process up to : Winlogon</i><br />
<br />
What process?<br />
<br />
You don't want to delete any msgina.dll file.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The msgina.cll is the default <b>M</b>icro<b>S</b>oft <b>G</b>raphical <b>I</b>dentification and
<b>A</b>uthentication DLL.&nbsp; You have to have that in order to boot.<br />
<br />
Unless your system has been afflicted and we don't know the whole story, there should not be any reference to any GINA dll in the registry.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
That means, XP will load the default GINA which is msgina.dll.&nbsp; That is what it does - normally.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you have this problem, something you installed or uninstalled is telling XP to load something different.<br />
<br />
What sometimes happns is some third party software installs it's own GINA and tells the registry to load that instead - then if you uninstall or remove that software later, it does not properly clean up after itself and the registry is still trying to load
 the third party GINA (and that file could now be missing).<br />
<br />
You might see messages like this:<br />
<br />
User Interface Failure<br />
The Logon User Interface DLL csgina.dll failed to load.&nbsp; <br />
Contact your system administrator to replace the DLL, or restore the original DLL.<br />
<br />
User Interface Failure<br />
The Logon User Interface DLL xtgina.dll failed to load.<br />
Contact your system administrator to replace the DLL, or restore the original DLL.<br />
<br />
User Interface Failure<br />
The Logon User Interface DLL OSDgina.dll failed to load.<br />
Contact your system administrator to replace the DLL, or restore the original DLL.<br />
<br />
In your case, if you are seeing something about BCMLogon.dll, that belong to your Broadcom network adatpter and I
<i>think </i>they install their own GINA DLL called - segina.dll.<br />
<br />
You will never get logged in and no trying things, Steps or Processes will help you (sorry Microsoft engage Support Engineer "experts").<br />
<br />
The solution is to determine what GINA dll XP is being told to load and then and "fool" XP into loading the regular XP GINA file instead.<br />
<br />
Then your system will boot.<br />
<br />
Then you can fix it.<br />
<br />
One again, not enough information - so answer these questions.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Prior to this incident, have you recently installed any network or wireless software and tell us about that.<br />

            It is too bad the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please answer the following questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
Since we don't know anything about your system or what happened between the time the system was working to the time it was not working - like was any Broadcom software installed, reinstalled, updated or uninstalled I think I can tell you how to get running
 again (is that the exact error message?)<br />
<br />
The default GINA DLL for XP is <b>msgina.dll</b> and there is no reference in the registry for it and there is not supposed to be - it loads by default if there is no reference in the registry for a GINA DLL to load.<br />
<br />
Some software you install wants to load it's own GINA DLL and when that software installs, it adds an entry in the registry to point to their GINA DLL so theirs loads instead of the default msgina.dll.<br />
<br />
If their DLL comes up missing somehow - perhaps from a reinstall, update or uninstall of their software - or maybe it was quarantined (effectively deleted) by your unspecified antivirus/antimalware on your system of unspecified make and model with unspecified
 XP version or Service Pack, the registry is trying to load the file that has come up missing hence the error message.<br />
<br />
The registry entry is still there, but the file it is being told to load is not.<br />
<br />
To "fool" it, you can copy the Microsoft msgina.dll and call the copy <b>BCMlogon.dll</b> so that when XP tries to load the BCMlogon.dll referenced in the registry, it will
<i>really </i>be loading the msgina.dll and hopefully that will get you running so the you can fix it the "right" way.<br />
<br />
But you are going to have to boot on something in order to do that - either the XP Recovery Console from a genuine bootable XP installation CD or from something like a Hiren's boot CD.<br />
<br />
Assuming XP is installed on your C drive in the C:\Windows folder, you would need to do something like this from the C:\Windows\system32 folder:<br />
<br />
copy&nbsp; msgina.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; BCMlogon.dll<br />
<br />
Then reboot.<br />
<br />
So does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive, so you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that you can use to get into the XP Recovery Console?<br />
<br />
If you are not sure, make a Hiren's Boot CD (always handy to have) and from their Mini XP mode you can just navigate to the c::\windows\system32 folder and copy the msgina.dll file and call the copy BCMlogon.dll.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
Then open My Computer and navigate to the c:\windows\system32 folder and copy the msgina.dll file and call the copy BCMlogon.dll, remove the CD and reboot.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you will still want to figure out what happened and fix things the "right" way but you need to get running first.<br />

<h2>            Error loading plugins</h2>
                    
<p>I removed the Intel PROSet/Wireless application, since I was having difficulties getting my home wireless to work on my tablet after installing it, and I saw it say somewhere that Windows was managing my wireless connection. But suddenly now, when I boot
 up and log in, I get an error box titled Intel PROSet/Wireless saying <strong>Error loading plug-ins. Application will exit.</strong></p>
<p>How can I fix this so it will stop giving me this error?</p>

<p><span>The plugins that it relates to can only be other programmes that are associated with the network for example windows zero configuration.<br />
<br />
I would suggest going to my computer, right click&gt;properties&gt;hardware tab&gt;device manager and look in the list for network adapters and on the '+' sign right click on your wireless network card and select uninstal.<br />
<br />
Restart pc and it should be installed automatically, but keep your eye on the taskbar when it says found new hardware and ensure that it says it has found the intel pro wireless( if thats the model) and try again.<br />
<br />
Also re install the drivers from your notebooks web site incase there are updated ones.</span></p>

            Option 1:
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:

    <title>Windows 10 BSOD endless loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pinkzombie 22mauer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD endless loop</h2>
                    <p>I left my computer on over night to render a video for a client. When I woke up the next morning it was frozen &amp; upon reboot I started getting the following errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>kmode exception not handled (netio.sys)</p>
<p>driver irql not less or equal</p>
<p>(netio.sys &amp; usbport.sys)</p>
<p>inaccessible boot device</p>
<p>kernel security check failure</p>
<p>page fault in non paged area ntfs</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the SSD still works as well as my Windows 10 that i'm currently trying to access as I'm writing this post with the SSD in my wife's computer. I've checked the voltages &amp; everything seems to be normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be a driver issue, i've unplugged my memory card reader from the mother board as well as quite a few other devices but i'm still getting the BSOD. I can't access safe mode nor can I use a bootable windows 10 ISO as it freezes after it loads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

 that microsoft is doing the same thing as before in the past with windows [95] Using 2 [FAT], one is 16 bit, the other is 32 bit which causes all kinds of issues.&nbsp; Now microsoft is still doing the same thing. The only difference is the one is 32 bit and the
 other is 64 bit.</strong>

<h3> apyy  say:</h3>
<h2>            exact word search</h2>
                    <p>I need help with finding EXACT word search (windows 10, windows explorer) in my documents. I have spent many hours to no avail.</p>
<p>I have selected&nbsp;in search options&nbsp;"search file name and content", tried rebuild indexing and other different options without success. when I do a search it brings up tens of pdf files in result, when I open the pdf files and do a search within the pdf file
 for the same word it can not find it. Extremely frustrating.</p>

            <p>If you are just typing a single word, you're pretty much done. Only documents that contain that word will be shown. &nbsp;If you type more than one word, only files that contain both words are listed. &nbsp;But of course those two words could be pages separate from
 each other, so you can get better results by using quotes. &nbsp;It's still an exact match, but instead of files that just contain all the words, it's an exact match for that phrase specifically, verbatim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you use quotes, multiple words are always considered to be "AND'ed" together. So
<em>nsight teresa</em> (without quotes) gives the same results as if you had typed
<em>nsight AND teresa</em> to find files that absolutely have both words. &nbsp;But you can also do exclusions,
<em>nsight NOT teresa</em>, or <em>teresa NOT nsight</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also consider that perhaps that word is being found in some other meta-data, filename path/directory, or something other than the body of the document. So, try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>contents:"keyword"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only files that contain the given keyword inside the file's contents (not meta data) will be listed in the results.</p>
