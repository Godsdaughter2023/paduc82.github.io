<h2>            Ongoing intermittent issue with IMAP emails issue</h2>
                    <div>
<p>We have an ongoing widespread issue with IMAP emails. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Our domain and IMAP emails are all supplied through Fasthosts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been using Outlook 2013 and 2016 to view emails. All email accounts added as per Fasthosts instructions.
</p>
<p>All systems run Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All staff who view only one mailbox have no issues. Any staff who view more than one mailbox are having regular intermittent issues. These issues include:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Not receiving emails in all or some mailboxes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Send and Receive hanging.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Having to close and reopen Outlook for emails to come through. Work Offline and then Online again sometimes does the same.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Outlook crashing while staff are writing emails and said email being lost.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Emails getting stuck in the Outbox. Close and reopen of Outlook sometimes rectifies this.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Different numbers of email showing on Outlook on desktop compared to Outlook online mailbox.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We have persued this through Support Tickets numerous times, however Fasthosts Support say there is no issue because they cannot replicate it. Leaving us stuck with these issues on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fasthosts Support suggested it was our Outlook 2013 so we purchased 2016 for two mailboxes through them and the same thing happens. Because Outlook is not a Fasthosts product they will not provide any support, they will happily take your money for using
 it however. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fasthosts seem to keep suggesting the issue is with the software and not them so have to us to persue support from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been running our own in house tests to ensure nothing else is causing the issue. However, up to now we are no futher forward. Regardless of Operating System, Outlook version, email account, computer, user or user privilages, the issues still happen.
</p>

            Ok... different causes and issues. Exchange doesn't use the send and receive settings... it is basically a constant sync. 
<br />
<br />Are the problem accounts added to the profiles as separate accounts or as shared mailboxes? If you aren't sure, go to File, Account Settings and open the account settings dialog. Are they listed on the email page? 
<br />
<br />If not, they are opened as shared. Double click on the user's account and choose More Settings - on the Advanced tab, untick the option to cache shared mailboxes. Does this help?  Not caching shared mailboxes means the mailbox needs to sync every time the user opens a folder from that mailbox - Outlook may appear to hang for a few seconds if there is a lot of mail in the folder. 
<br />
<br />You can try this on one computer and see if it helps: right click on the folder, choose Properties then click Clear offline items. Wait a minute then go to Send/Receive menu and click Update folder to resync it (or switch to another folder, wait a few minutes then return).

<h2>            Windows Insider Preview 17046 won&#39;t wake from screen saver</h2>
                    I have sent feedback about this but after having to press the reset button thrice today, I am sick of the feedback form for resets. How do I turn it off? Does Microsoft like repeated feedback.

<p>Hi Dhdevine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First, please make sure that the related settings are correct as the following article Show separate inboxes for each account in Outlook for Mac shows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/show-separate-inboxes-for-each-account-in-outlook-for-mac-08c2cdcd-ca01-4438-84f7-696eb27d8cb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/show-separate-inboxes-for-each-account-in-outlook-for-mac-08c2cdcd-ca01-4438-84f7-696eb27d8cb0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the settings are correct, please help confirm which kind of account you use. For POP accounts, they all shown under On my computer, this is by design, and we are unable to change it as far as I know. However, if you are using IMAP
 or Exchange account, please download the tool <span>OutlookResetPreferences&nbsp;(<a href="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/12/OutlookResetPreferences.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Download Here</strong></a>) and run it on your Mac to see if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For Outlook for Mac issues, we have a dedicated support channel build-in Outlook for Mac 2016. I suggest request further assistance
 in Outlook for Mac </span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac-mso_mac2016/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517"><span>build-in

<p>Hi Kunal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue appears to be related to connection, I'd like to ask you to start troubleshooting with tests with different connections. Also, please reconfirm me whether you have tested this with the firewall and antivirus off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, if it is possible, try to sign in to your Teams desktop client with different user credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the further troubleshooting, please send me the OS version (32, or 64-bit too) and Office 365 version (Outlook&gt; File&gt; Office account&gt; About Outlook (in form (16.0.4738.1000) 32-bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Nemanja</p>

<p>Try using Mouse Keys. &nbsp; If you don't have it already set up press and hold LeftAlt+LeftShift+NumLock.&nbsp; After it is set up you can use just NumLock to toggle it Off or On.&nbsp; Then to make your mouse pointer appear just use one of its "pointer movement" commands
 (using a real Numeric keypad).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, details will help.&nbsp; E.g. the most common cause of a symptom description like this is a user not realizing that their laptop's touchpad has some touch screen emulation features and a touch screen makes the mouse pointer disappear until it can be
 moved by a real mouse.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur if the Explorer.exe process uses an excessive number of CPU cycles when Windows is idle, and as a result, Windows performance is degraded.</p>
<p>Have you installed all the latest updates for Windows and Office applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, perform all updates and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on the error, you may refer to the following article:</p>

<p><strong>My boss had a virus last week. After we removed it, things seemed to be working ok. He said that he installed a Vista update yesterday, and after he did, he began to have issues. An "Error 0" comes up in a little dialog box when you open Word, and
 then it opens a new document. When you select "Save" or "Save As", nothing happens. After reviewing numerous forums, it seems that it is an Adobe issue and/or an add-in issue. I can not disable all add-ins. We run programs that work with Microsoft Office,
 so the add-in feature is necessary. We also use Adobe with it as well. Help!</strong></p>

<p><span>Have you tried disabling the add-ins one at a time to determine which one is causing the issue? The "Error 0" indicates the error handler is being triggered
 even though an error isn’t actually occurring which indicated macros are running when Word starts and can also be intercepting the Save and Save As commands.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To view your active add-ins, click the Office Button, click Word Options, and then click Add-ins. Take a look at the add-ins under Active Application Add-ins and the add-in type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COM add-ins can be disabled using the Manage option at the bottom. For global templates you can also use the Manage option at the bottom, however if you unload a global template it will be a&nbsp;temporary action. Which is good for
 troubleshooting, but if you find a global template to be the cause you'll need to exit Word, locate the template, and move it to another folder to prevent if from loading when Word starts. The location of the global template can be found by selecting it in
 the Add-ins list and then viewing the location property below the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, do you actually need Adobe integration with Office? If what you need to do is create a PDF file and you're not adding any additional options available for Adobe then you can use the built-in PDF format, found by clicking
 the Office Button, pointing at Save As, and then clicking Save as PDF or XPS.</p>

                    <p>Prior to updating to 1511 version of W10, I discovered the Start Menu, Action Center, APPS and Microsoft Edge are no longer working.&nbsp; Tried the SFC/scannow, numerous restarts and poring over the Replies on the internet regarding this issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on an my in-laws HP pavilion, which was working fine 4 days ago.&nbsp; There are blank spaces on the Taskbar, where Edge and another program are supposed to be.&nbsp; The computer has slowed down a bit, even after installing the 1511 upgrade.</p>

<h2>            How to change Mail app settings on a Surface beyond the obvious ones.</h2>
                    <p>I use two different devices to retrieve e-mail from a server.&nbsp; The main use is MS Office Outlook on a PC but a secondary use is to use the Mail app on a Surface.&nbsp; When mail is deleted on the Surface, it appears to also be deleted on the server as it is never
 received by Outlook.&nbsp; I want to turn this off to insure that all e-mails that are received make it to the PC (for example if an e-mail is deleted by mistake).&nbsp; I do not see any way to affect this setting from the Mail app settings.&nbsp; How do I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be a Surface and Mail app issue.</p>

            What you seem to be telling me is that the Mail app does not support what I want to do.&nbsp; I have already given up on Outlook on the Surface as it only seems to work for a few days before it needs to be re-installed. &nbsp; I find this less than helpful.&nbsp; All
 I want the Mail app to do is not delete e-mails on the server when they are deleted on the Surface in Mail.<br />

            <p>The mail app mail account would usually be outlook.com and if you delete any mail it will be removed from the server, as a result it will not be seen on any other device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a mail account is configured as IMAP, Exchange, or EAS (outlook.com) and you delete on one device it will not be available for any other device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A pop mail account, provided you set the option to keep a copy on the server, in all devices, would be available to other devices if deleted on one, but you wont have sync of sent mail on all devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Outlook functions happily on the various devices I have and having used it since Office 97 I've never had call to reinstall</p>

            <p>The Mail app is accessing a mail server which our business contracts for, not outlook.com.&nbsp; I use MS Outlook on a laptop PC for mail and want to have a complete set of e-mails there.&nbsp; I use a Surface and the Mail app when traveling to access e-mail while
 not having to carry the laptop.&nbsp; Aside from the fact that the Mail app does not filter out spam (which Outlook does on the laptop), it also deletes e-mails if they are inadvertently deleted (given the number of spam to delete, this is a likely occurrence).&nbsp;
 All I want to do is stop the Mail app from deleting the e-mails on the&nbsp; server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try Outlook again (where I can configure it to use the server as a POP server as it does on the laptop), but have not had a lot of success with it on the Surface.&nbsp; Both times I set it up, it stopped working after a few days and was told to reinstall
 it after the first failure.&nbsp; I moved to the Mail app after the second failure, but am having the referenced issue.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t log in to myphone.microsoft.com on my desktop</h2>
                    OK, I've been bumped around to a couple of different support people and they have sent me here to ask this.<br />
<br />
When I go to myphone.microsoft.com on my desktop anc click the Sign In button the page refreshes multiple times like it is trying to access different sites then I end up getting an error that says:
<br />
The Windows Live Network is unavailable from this site for one of the following reasons: 
 This site may be experiencing a problem
The site may not be a member of the Windows Live Network
You can:

You can sign in or sign up at other sites on the Windows Live Network, or try again later at this site. <br />
I can log into all the other Live sites I want to (such as MSDN, XBOX, this forum, etc...) I just cannot log into myphone from my desktop. However, I can still sync to myphone from my cell phone just fine.<br />
<br />
Please see if you can help and please try not to transferr me to yet another person or group (this is getting ridiculous!).<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

            The fact the InPrivate resolves the issue means this is almost certainly due to cookies.&nbsp; I have seen reported occassions where the cookies aren't removed via the IE menu for some reason.<br />
<br />
Could you please use the section titled "To verify that the cookie files are deleted, follow these steps" under "<strong>How to manually delete cookie files in Internet Explorer 8</strong>" in the support article at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/278835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/278835</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;
 If you still see any cookie files in this folder (*.txt) files, delete these, then open IE and try the site again (Disclaimer: Obviously any deletion involves data loss.&nbsp; Please be sure you are in the correct location and only delete files you are sure you
 no longer need.&nbsp; It may be safer to move files to a alternate folder rather than delete initially if unsure).<br />
<br />
Note this article opens the History dialog by running "<span>inetcpl.cpl</span>", not from the browser menu.&nbsp; It may be more effective to manipulate cookies this way as the browser is closed and no sessions&nbsp;could be&nbsp;open.&nbsp; I'd also recommend
 closing as many applications as possible to ensure nothing is using the IE rendering engine during these operations.<br />
<br />
You should also check the folder at "%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\" (and the subfolder "Low" if you have it on XP).&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain types of&nbsp;cookies are stored here also. (You may need to enable viewing of hidden and system files to see
 this folder in Explorer).<br />
<br />
Let me know if there were remaining cookies in the folder, and if so, if manually removing the files resolves the issue.&nbsp; If you can actually provide the domains for any Microsoft/Live cookies that did remain this would be helpful also (the part between "&lt;username&gt;@"
 and "[2].txt" in the cookie file name).<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />

<h2>            how do you remove songs from groove music</h2>
                    I have a bunch of sound effects on my computer and groove music added them to my music but i cant remove them without deleting them from my computer. How do you remove certain songs from groove music? I already tried removing the file they are in from
 the files groove music looks in but it still adds them anyway so what can I do? It is kinda annoying when you are listening to music then it starts playing random sound effects.

                    The subject line says it all: KB2687493 installation failed.
<div>This is an update for MS Office 2007. I have Autoupdate turned on for both Windows and MS apps (it informs me when there's an update and asks if I want to update)<br />
<div>The automatic update failed. I then downloaded the update and tried to manually install it. Failed also.</div>
<div>I ran Office Diagnostics and everything checks out OK</div>
<div>I'm running Office 2007 on Win 7 Pro 64-bit. I've been keeping up with Windows and Office updates and patches.</div>
<div>The computer has been scanned for viruses, malware, etc, and comes up clean.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Feeling helpless since the error box doesn't give me any indication why the update failed.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas how to fix?</div>
                </div>

            <p>I operate a closed area and do not have access to the Internet, so I rely on similarly-configured systems that DO have access to the Internet to "tell" me what standalone updates to obtain for purposes of patching my systems in the closed area....&nbsp; One such
 patch for the month of March was KB2687493.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded the standalone patch and attempted to install it, but during the portion of the execution which checks for applicability, I receive the following error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<strong>The expected version of the product was not found on this system</strong>."</p>
<p><br />
Execution ends once I acknowledge the error.&nbsp; No error log is created (that I can find) that sheds any additional information on this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This behaviour is consistent with all applicable systems in my closed area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the month of February, I had the same thing occur for 2 other Office 2007 patches:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>KB2767848 </li><li>KB2767916</li></ul>
<p>Presumably, March's patch is related to MS12-060, whereby mscomctl.ocx had an issue.&nbsp; I had no problem installing
<u>that</u> associated patch back in August 2012 for MS12-060.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is not clear to me in this reported error is whether Microsoft is trying to tell us we don't have the (bad) version of mscomctl.ocx installed, and therefore, there is no need to install this patch, or whether there some other problem at work here.&nbsp;
 The error message and the lack of error logging is frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have observed the version of mscomctl.ocx presently installed is 6.1.98.34, which, I believe is the correct version....&nbsp; If this is just Microsoft's strange way of telling us we don't need the patch, I wish they'd find a better mechanism to say it....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Searching the Internet using the error message I did receive led me to this forum, but all the other hits I observed appeared to be related to something else....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least I can take some solace in observing I am not the only one seeing this problem.</p>

            Not only won't it install, every time I log in Windows Update tells me it's out there and that it's a very important update. If I can't install it, can I at least get WU to stop informing me of it?

            <p>You should be able to tell WU to Hide this patch.&nbsp; In WU, and on the list of patches&nbsp;presented you, if you right-click this particular patch, it should offer you a choice.&nbsp; "Copy details" and,&nbsp;"Hide update".&nbsp; The "Hide update" choice should make Update ignore
 this patch, and will act as though it doesn't exist (or was already applied--depending on your perspective).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can re-display this in the future by selecting the "Restore hidden updates" option located on the left-hand side of the frame within the Windows Update client window.&nbsp; Any items that you previously told Windows/Microsoft Update to hide, will be re-presented
 to you.&nbsp; You can re-hide and restore ad nauseum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it would be better if the patch would install....&nbsp; Hiding the notification just masks a real problem in our respective cases.&nbsp; Wish someone from Microsoft would weigh-in on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I saw this happen for 2 out of 4 patches in February--as well as this one in March, I think there is a real problem.&nbsp; The underlying matter is probably common to patch failures for both months.</p>

            Thanks - will follow your instructions on hiding the update.
<div><br />
<div>On a related note, I just re-installed Win 7 Home 64 bit on my laptop. Why I 'm doing the re-install is a long story, but I figured that was the way to go in this situation. Re-install went fine, then came the updating ... I forgot how many updates &amp; patches
 had come out since I'd originally installed Win 7 (&gt;140). Not only did it take a looong time (which I was willing to live with), but most of the updates failed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The interesting thing, tho, I wasn't informed they failed. When I opened WU it said my OS was up to date and no updates/patches were left for my computer. But when I checked the update history, it showed that most had failed. I manually had WU check for
 updates and it found all those which had failed to install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems that update installation is generally more successful the fewer you do at a time, especially if reboots are involved. In my re-installation situation, there were a lot of updates so I updated at 5-10 at a time. I'm not done updating my computer
 yet and I'm still getting failed installations, but it seems like there's fewer of them. It takes lots longer, but I have a better idea of what's going on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Of course, update failures shouldn't be happening in the <i>first</i> place.</div>

            Without sp2 windows 7 will more and more be a mess. Sp1 was mainly intended to fix the utilities that came along with the OS itself. A sp2 was then scheduled, but since then Microsoft policies are changed, no more sp2 for windows 7, or none is announced
 till now, and it's by large time to have a service pack to rearrange an OS who was a mess by itself and was utterly messed by too many security patches scheduled on episodic discovered vulnerability reasons. Not to speak of the bioses that came along with
 the machines that were intended to support UEFI. They had a lot of upgrades too. The mix of UEFI, BIOS itself and OS (seven) was almost lethal compared to windows 8 nowadays, and many problems were not solved by some vendor until now in win seven or even in
 eight machines. So I prefer not to use UEFI and i'm staying with windows 7, UEFI is mandatory for windows 8 only not for seven. These are things that noone speaks gladly of, but I'm a most unpleasant people, and not always but often I frankly speak what I
 think of. I'm a long time user of Microsoft Oses, and I'm not glad of the vintage policy that Microsoft adopted. I'm a supporter of consolidated OS releases, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer too I think, but not the investors. What we need now is a sp2 for windows
 7, and I don't espect that windows seven will be supported the long time XP was. Times are changing, things are no more the same as they used to be then, but it should be still possible to have a reasonable support, not only vintage OSes as Apple's are.<br />

            <p>I find myself frequently building systems based on a military "version" of Windows 7 (via the Army Gold Disk Master, or AGM for short).&nbsp; What I've seen after building such a system and activating Windows, the first time it goes to connect for updates is
 Windows Update (not Microsoft Update) usually fails (at least once) with one of those hexadecimal failure codes.&nbsp; And it takes a
<strong><u>long time</u></strong> for it to fail, too.&nbsp; Around this point, I usually try to change the system from the default&nbsp;Windows Update "model" to the Microsoft Update model--which requires it to download some update software first, but this usually fails
 (with another hex error code, too).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, I seem to recall there being two back-to-back failures of Microsoft Update before it would finally show me a list of available updates.&nbsp; It's consistent in this vein.&nbsp; Once I
<strong><u>finally</u></strong> receive the list (and it's a long list, like you said), I generally have no further problem installing said updates....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would first cycle through the long list of updates and Hide some that we know we weren't interested in--like the multi-language pack (that saves 30+ updates right there), and, originally, IE9 (which is offered) wasn't something we could, initially support,
 so I would hide that.&nbsp; That's changing for us, now.&nbsp; Additionally, there were usually some optional "hardware" items I'd hide, too, as I am generally less conducive to letting Microsoft update my hardware drivers.&nbsp; I'm ok with Microsoft telling me there may
 be an item that needs a driver update, but I would rather find that driver from the vendor instead of getting it from Microsoft.&nbsp; Sometimes, in desparation, I'll break down and let Microsoft do those, but I hold my nose when I do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After paring down the list some, I let Microsoft Update do its thing--which can take a while as you've said, but I've not had to artifically "sneak up on it" as you've described.&nbsp; You should not have to do that with an out-of-the-box installation of Windows.&nbsp;
 At least, in my opinion.&nbsp; If you're encountering such, I suppose it's possible Microsoft's update servers might be getting slammed by you and, perhaps, countless&nbsp;others downloading stuff at the same time.&nbsp; Microsoft ought to be load balancing their update
 servers in some fashion.&nbsp; I'm sure they are....&nbsp; Maybe there's just a limit to how much load they can balance in any given moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, I've seen other Automatic Updates fail....&nbsp; For example, there was a situation once-upon-a-time, whereby Automatic Updates used to rely on something called (in security circles) the File System Object (or FSO), and because of security issues
 that existed by having the file that represents the FSO as being a registered dll in the system, certain (especially certain .NET Framework patches) would be known to fail if one had taken the recommended security precaution of unregistering the FSO dll.&nbsp;
 But the manual patch would install with no problem (because it didn't rely on the FSO for installation)....&nbsp; I suspected this might have been the case, and contacted an expert in the area of .NET Framework, (Aaron Stebner--look him up on the Internet.&nbsp; He's
 great), and he used his MVP channels to remove the FSO requirement with Automatic Updates.&nbsp; That solved the .NET Framework patches that used to fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot help but wonder, sometimes, when other patches start failing (like these Office 2007 patches), whether there's something similar at work, here.&nbsp; Maybe Microsoft assigns some junior software developer the task of rolling out some patches, and they
 try to rely on something that "used to be present, or used to reflect a certain way of doing things"--not knowing that "something" is not approved any longer, and voila, suddenly, patches start failing....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if the failure you're seeing and the ones I've seen for the last 2 months (especially since Office 2007 seems to be a common denominator) if the root cause were something akin to what I described....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know who from Micosoft trolls this forum, though....&nbsp; They only way we'll likely get the matter resolved is if enough people start getting the same failures you and I are, and make it bubble to the top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you get your machine current.&nbsp; I know it can be problematic.&nbsp; I have seen some threads that talk about other Windows Update problems--and perhaps one like you describe.&nbsp; The solution in that case involves the stopping of some services, the deletion
 of files in the Software Distribution folder, the re-registering of a slew of dll files, then the restarting of the services previously stopped....&nbsp; I've done this procedure myself.&nbsp; It's a nice exercise.&nbsp; I think it did help solve one particular problem I
 had a long time ago.&nbsp; Might be worth looking into....&nbsp; I found this thread (one item sounds like he has your exact problem (i.e., fresh out-of-the-box installation with lots of failed updates)):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserverwsus/thread/f5744a18-d4ca-4631-8324-878b9225251d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserverwsus/thread/f5744a18-d4ca-4631-8324-878b9225251d/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was looking for the nice thread I saw that detailed all of the dlls that need to be re-registered for Windows 7 (there's way more of them than in Windows XP).&nbsp; I could not find that, but this one may be useful.&nbsp; If you search for Clearing Software Distribution
 Folder or fixing Automatic Updates you'll probably stumble across it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Might be useful to you....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            Thanks for the reply and information. I appreciate your sharing your experiences and am sure many of us will benefit from it. Considering all the headaches you have to deal with, it makes my problem seem small....
<div><br />
<div>I've been updating my re-installation all morning. My latest attempt to install IE 10 tells me I need to have at least SP1 installed for Win 7. What, more than 140 updates and
<i>none</i> of them are SP1?&nbsp;How much can I trust an OS which doesn't update itself correctly? And doesn't always inform me of the fact?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>MS' Knowledgebase doesn't provide any useful information about this issue. I'm not an anomaly, this is happening with many users. MS needs to step up to the plate.<br />

            <p>I agree with you....&nbsp; Windows Update should have made SP1 first and foremost amongst your 140+ other updates--presumably, some of which might have been taken care of by SP1 to begin with.&nbsp; Not sure why this wasn't one of the 140 items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannot really comment on the why's and wherefore's of that, but I did want to introduce something that could be of value to you in case you find yourself
<strong><u>ever</u></strong> in need of building/rebuilding another Windows 7 system such that SP1 will already be part of the mix, so-to-speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was going to first send you to&nbsp;Paul Thurrott's Super Site for Windows (which, you may want to still visit, as he&nbsp;has a
<strong><u>wealth</u></strong> of&nbsp;information&nbsp;on&nbsp;his site--it's called "super" for a reason).&nbsp; It was there, many years ago, that I became acquainted with the procedure called Slipstreaming.&nbsp; I was intrigued (and adventurious), and tried it out.&nbsp; It looks like
 he has revamped his site and I couldn't immediately find the article(s) I was looking for (in a hurry to share this with you), but I know he probably&nbsp;has it somewhere.&nbsp; Instead, I found a different site:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/145343-slipstream-windows-7-sp1-into-installation-dvd-iso-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/145343-slipstream-windows-7-sp1-into-installation-dvd-iso-file.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to give you the 80,000 foot level description in case you weren't familiar, Slipstreaming, is the process someone coined that describes the shoehorning&nbsp;(my terminology) a&nbsp;legal copy of (say Windows 7, 64-bit) on DVD, with a major software release (say
 SP1), and porting the important aspects of <strong><u>both</u></strong> entities onto a new, separate DVD, that has all of&nbsp;the updates (accumulated to that point) on&nbsp;the new DVD (of
<strong><u>your</u></strong> creation) for the purpose of building a system (i.e., you use the newly created disc rather than the original boxed disc).&nbsp; You still use the original Product Activation key found on the original media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You still have to abide by one disc, one license, one system aspect....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a bit more to it than that (you have to create iso files and capture things from the original disc&nbsp;in order to make said iso be Windows bootable, etc.), but all of those steps were explained (at one time) on Paul Thurrott's site.&nbsp; At one time, this
 involved the dowloading of some 3rd party software tools (but free) to aid in the creation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the link I provided does a fair job of detailing the process as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first discovered Paul's site back in XP's heyday, and used Paul's instructions to create--first&nbsp;a slipstreamed disc with SP2, and then the same thing again, when SP3 came out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, it affords you the means of installing (from the disc you create) a bona fide, and legal means of building a new system that already has the latest Service Pack integrated on it, without having to go through the Windows Update process (after the
 build or rebuild) like you would by using just the original disc (and subsequent updates).&nbsp; Obviously, such an&nbsp;"event" (i.e., disc creation)&nbsp;represents only a snapshot in time and eventually, as more time passes, there will be more and more updates not on
 the disc, but it's nice to start somewhere closer to the finish-line than the very beginning....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google (or for any 'Bing' fanatics out there, use that if that makes one feel better) "Slipstreaming", and you'll likely find something that meets your needs and spells out how to do it (if you did not already know--I didn't wish to be presumptious).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought it was kinda cool, and it showed me how to do something I hadn't done before, which is generally a good thing.&nbsp; If rebuilding this or any other system is something you think you might do again, using a slipstreamed OS disc can be a time saver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just thought I'd share this last little nugget with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Office suite of Programmes update - screen resize - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveygold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office suite of Programmes update - screen resize</h2>
                    <p>I just got the latest Office update and my documents (ALL OF THEM) now open at a quarter of the screen size</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who do we contact at Microsoft to sort this out? As I've tried ALL the suggested variations of saving a new document so the programme opens at the required size but nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the number to call Microsoft and get this sorted? Or do I get the programme for free until its working??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got a new way of getting the programme to resize?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps Is it possible to propose to someone that we can select an 'office topic' as 'office' itself? Since many problems relate to the suite of Office programmes not just one</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Subform Flow &#38; Updating Calculations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mj_nwe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subform Flow &#38; Updating Calculations</h2>
                    <p>We have built a form with a subform to allow our team to enter &amp; track cash transactions associated with a ticket number.&nbsp; On the subform, we have been able to setup several sub-total calculations on Form Footer which work correctly in providing desired
 sums of data as it is entered.&nbsp; Our problem is how &amp; when these calculations happen in the flow of entering the data:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main form</p>
<p>&gt; Has several unbound text boxes displaying the values of calculated data from sub-form</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; All but one of these display correctly without needing to "refresh" form (e.g. hitting "F5" button), if F5'd that field shows correct value</p>
<p>&gt; No fields displayed on main form are being directly entered by User</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subform</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Datasheet format, three (3) fields for collection</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; [Description]&nbsp; Field01:&nbsp; Combo text box</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; [Trans_Cash]&nbsp; Field02:&nbsp; Currency, 2 decimal</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; [Batch_System]&nbsp; Field03:&nbsp; Text field for entering system info, as needed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp; For every record in subform User enters, MINIMUM fields entered will be 01 &amp; 02, 03 is optional</p>
<p>-&nbsp; When User selects Field01, first thing we notice is that any uncalculated data is updated, but we would prefer that calculations are updated when Field02 is entered/updated, or at minimum when User tabs from Field03 to next record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure exactly how to get desired results effectively, have tried a number of things (Refresh, Repaint, Recalc, &amp; Requery) with mixed results.&nbsp; Let me explain "mixed results", requery gives us the correct display of values but moves focus to 1st field
 in 1st record.&nbsp; Prefer to have update happen as User tabs from Rcd <em><strong>x</strong></em>, Field03&nbsp; to &nbsp;Rcd
<em><strong>x+1</strong></em>, Field01...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a good way to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time &amp; assistance in advance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Calculated controls are scheduled for recalculation and display when one of the expression's dependent controls' value is changed.&nbsp; That does not mean the calculation and display are done immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;A task to do those things is scheduled, but at a low
 and lower priority.&nbsp; Retrieving data from tables, executing VBA code,&nbsp;loading form/report objects, and many other things are tasks that run at a higher priority (not to mention other processes and tasks for other application running on your system).&nbsp;&nbsp;In other
 words, you have absolutely no control over when&nbsp;control expressions are evaluated and or when they are displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burried in that long winded explanation is a clue to solving your dilemma. &nbsp;VBA code runs at a very high priority, so the solution to your problem lies there.&nbsp; Instead of using&nbsp;control source expressions to calculate values and display them in main form
 text boxes, use VBA code to calculate and set the main form text box's value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That may or may not be a bit tricky depending on your VBA experience and the calculations you need, so, if you need help doing that, post back with details about the calculations you are using now.</p>

            <p>Marshall,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your "long winded explanation" and trust me I didn't take it as such.&nbsp; While I am no expert in VBA coding, I am okay with it as well.&nbsp; So, if you don't mind, lets see if we can tackle it .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the current calculations there are 2 relatively simple base calculations: (1) Count and (2) Sum based on variables from main form (BatchNum (an ID field)&nbsp;and Date_Rcvd) and subform (Description and Trans_Cash) ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>COUNT:</strong></p>
<p>=DCount("Trans_Cash","tblBCT","((BatchNum='" &amp; [Forms]![MyForm]![BatchNum] &amp; "') AND (Date_Rcvd=#" &amp; [Forms]![MyForm]![Date_Rcvd] &amp; "#) AND (Description Like 'Cond1*'))")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUM:</strong></p>
<p>=IIf([txtCount_Pmt_CE]=0,0,(DSum("Trans_Cash","tblBCT","((BatchNum='" &amp; [Forms]![MyForm]![BatchNum] &amp; "') AND (Date_Rcvd=#" &amp; [Forms]![MyForm]![Date_Rcvd] &amp; "#) AND (Description Like 'Cond1*'))")))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently there are several subsets/groups within Field01: Description, so for each of those subsets these formulas are modified slightly for each subset.&nbsp; In addition to these subsets, we have two sub-total (groups) and one grand total.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate any assistance you can give, Marshall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MJ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just&nbsp;a&nbsp;thought, would it make sense to&nbsp;do calculations as part of an AfterUpdate; On Dirty; or other&nbsp;event(s)?&nbsp; Or, should we approach it differently?</p>
        </p>

            <p>I guess those expressions at least prartially explain why Access lost track of one of of the calvulation/display tasks.&nbsp; The D... agregate functions have to create and execute an aggregate&nbsp;query to, which is yet another task to throw into the mix and with
 several of those going on nearly simutaneously it's not much of a stretch for something to get lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those expressions can be used in VBA code nearly as they are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>lngCount = DCount("Trans_Cash","tblBCT","((BatchNum='" &amp; Forms!MyForm!BatchNum &amp; "') AND (Date_Rcvd=" &amp; Format(Forms!MyForm!Date_Rcvd, "\#yyyy-m-d\#")) AND (Description Like 'Cond1*'))")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Forms!MyForm is the main form, you could replace the references with Me.BatchNum or Parent.BatchNum depending on if the VBA code resides in the main or sub form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also note that I changed your # sign usage to use the Format function.&nbsp; This is a reliable way to make sure that the Windows date style settings do not produce a date that Access can misintrepret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those&nbsp;may be the only calculations you need to change, so try that and see if setting just those&nbsp; two values on the main form simplifies things enough to get the other calculations to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>_________________________</p>
<p>Possible tangental issue is whether you need to use the D... aggregate functions at all.&nbsp; I initially had the impression that all the records to be counted/summed were in the subform's record source.&nbsp; In that case, your original expressions could have used
 Count and Sum and that might not have had the problem that prompted this thread.</p>

            <p>Your take on where the records to be counted &amp; summed are is&nbsp;correct, they are all in subform's records source (tblBCT).&nbsp; I had wondered about using Count &amp; Sum because of that, but had opted for D... since it was what I had seen used in an example to get
 to the summation values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that sample (mentioned above), they did the summation in the subform footer and called those values to the main form.&nbsp; Would it&nbsp;be simpler to call for those values directly from MyForm rather than MySubForm?&nbsp; Is it possible to do via VBA such that they
 update regularly with the User's data entry?</p>

            <p>The Count/Sum aggregations must be done in the form object with the records to be aggregated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forget the example, it doesn't work for you.&nbsp; You now have a couple of alternatives to try, my VBA replacement for the expressions and the Count/Sum functions instead of the D... functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also a third choice of using VBA to loop through the form's recordsetclone and count/add the totals in code.&nbsp; This choice will be a little more code, but way faster than using the D... functions and will also avoid the low priority&nbsp;tasks generated
 by using expressions.</p>

            <p>Please don't take my 1st paragraph in last reply to mean I was discounting your suggestion, far from the case, in fact I like it.&nbsp; Just wanted to clear up any confusion on why I chose to do it that way.&nbsp; You 100% right, it did not work so I need to do something
 different and I am all ears!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How should I use your expression variations on MyForm instead of the D...?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I&nbsp; place your expression in the Control Source on Property Sheet, Data tab... or is it better to do it in VBA behind MyForm?&nbsp; If later, how best to do it with a set of text boxes like below...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cond01</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtCount_Cond01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtSum_Cond01</p>
<p><strong>Cond02</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtCount_Cond02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtSum_Cond02</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>Cond<em>xx</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; txtCount_Cond<em>xx</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;txtSum_Cond<em>xx</em></p>

            <p>Too many variables such as speed, amount of code and even your comfort level with the different approaches to say what's the "best way" to do it.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the first thing I would try is to use Count/Sum instead of the D... functions. I don't know if that's really feasible in your case because it appears the you are not filtering the subfom to make it display only records that match the
 main form values for BatchNum and Date_Rcvd. If you are not doing that (via LinkMaster/Child properties), the first thing I suggest is to rethink why you not doing it. If you can do it, the subform text box expressions would simply be:</p>
<p>=Count(IIf(Description Like 'Cond1*', Trans_Cash, Null))<br />
and<br />
=Sum(IIf(Description Like 'Cond1*', txtCount_Pmt_CE, Null))</p>
<p>or maybe some variation of that theme.</p>

<h2>            Check to see if text string is found in a column</h2>
                    <p>Ok great Guru's of the Web....I have another challenge for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two columns of item numbers like below. &nbsp;The first column (A) are the current items available. &nbsp;The second column (B) has everything in my system. &nbsp;What I am trying to do is discontinue everything in my system that is not in column A &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column A runs from row 1 to row 654, &nbsp;column B runs from Row 1 to Row 1863. &nbsp;So I need a formula to put in column C that will look at the entire range of A1 to A654 and check to see if the item numbers in column B are contained anywhere in column A. &nbsp;if
<strong>not</strong> put an "x" in that row, in Column C if it is in the range of column A put nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<h2>            VLOOKUP to see multiple results and then sum them up</h2>
                    <p>On my data sheet I have the following unformatted data:</p>
<p>name of persons, # of calls, length of calls:</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>One, Person</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>163.3846</td>

<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two, Person</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>11</td>

</table>
<p>The result I am trying to accomplish is, on the first sheet in my workbook I have the list of persons. I am trying to use the VLOOKUP to this page, and return the sum of all the calls. Unfortunately it stops on the first cell and returns that.</p>
<p>The data is raw data that I copy and paste directly into this sheet, I would like to avoid having to format or hide columns and such as this is an ongoing process that I will be pasting more data below it as each day goes by,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what my formula looks like:</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP($A$33,Atlantic!$A$6:$ZZ$500,2,FALSE)</p>
<p>Cell A33 contained the name One, Person and returned my a value of 13</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize if it seems like a basic question, I have used this function many times but not to sum items up.</p>
