<h2>            &#91;ANSWERED&#93; Windows Movie Maker slows down my videos even if i don&#39;t have an effect.</h2>
                    <p>Welcome, today, i recorded a video and edited it using Windows Movie Maker 2.6.</p>
<p>When i was editing the video, i noticed that some parts of the video (seperate cut out parts) which were slown down. They didn't have the blue star, and when i opened the menu to see what effects that video had, it had none. The original video didn't have
 these slowdowns.</p>

<p>First, you are using a much older version of Movie Maker. Windows Movie Maker 2.6 is based off of the 2.1 version from Windows XP. Both those versions just use the CPU for rendering previews. They aim to give a 15 fps "real time" preview, but there can be
 slowdowns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would first try saving your project as an actual movie and then see if you see any actual slow downs. I suspect what you are seeing is just the CPU having problems keeping up with a real time preview, but that the actual movie won't have these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still having problems, then I would suspect the actual format of the video files. Can you provide further details on the format of your clips?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If you still want to use the "classic" version of Movie Maker with the timeline view, you could upgrade to
<a href="https://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a> which has both a 64-bit version and GPU rendering.</p>

At the next window, scroll ALL OF THE WAY DOWN and fill int the words exactly as shown<br />

At the next window, click on the Windows bar which appears telling you that the file has been blocked..
<br />
<br />
When the OPEN/SAVE window appears, SAVE the file to your hard disk beforeyou run it. Will save you having to go through this every time.. :-)<br />

            <p>There is no place it copy the file as you suggested.&nbsp; All that I can find is how to get a free driver scanner, that scans for free, but you have to register by paying for the software before it helps find a driver for me.&nbsp; Scan for free, yes, solve problem
 for free?, no, have to pay first.&nbsp; This is somewhat missleading, but not an outright lie.</p>
<p>Thanks, but no thanks, I already have a driver updater paid for.</p>

<h2>            Friends avatars greyed out</h2>
                    
<p>Managed to get my problem with the xbox sorted on the phone when I called them xbox.</p>
<p>I found when I lost the internet one day it somehow affected the last download/ patch from xbox, and I found I could not load up multiplayer in Back ops and only Black ops was affected.</p>
<p>Thankfully thats sorted and I can play again.</p>
<p>However no matter how much the xbox guy had me play with the machine we could not cure the problem of friends avatars, and the fact that when I press the X button and go to friends I am unable to see their avatars, unless I click on a particular friend which
 then brings up their avatar.</p>
<p>It does not affect the game and must be a software problem.</p>
<p>If you know of something that might help me sort this, do tell.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Installation Fails at 91&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinstrausbaugh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Installation Fails at 91&#37;</h2>
                    <p>So I'm getting pretty aggravated here. I've been trying to upgrade to Windows 10 since around 1PM yesterday. Using the Microsoft Updater, everything would prepare and then just... not do anything after my PC rebooted when prompted. After a whole frustrating
 afternoon of trying that method, I downloaded the ISO and burned to a DVD (I also tried USB). I definitely got further through this method, but once I got to the screen telling me my PC would reboot multiple times as well as installation progress, it always
 fails at 91%, telling me "Windows 10 Installation has failed" with no explanation why. The error window is labeled "Something Happened." I've scoured the internet for a solution, but can't find anything that works for me. This is pretty much my last resort
 before I just say screw it. :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Tried installing through the Updater again, and though it's never given me an error message, I managed to navigate to an update records page and found all the instances in which the WIndows 10 update failed, yielding a consistent 80070004 error code.&nbsp;</p>

            I've been trying everything under the sun to fix this issue and still have had no luck. I've run through everything on the Windows 10 upgrade troubleshooting page, and even tried obscure things like disabling various services and removing multiboot options
 from startup thinking they could cause an issue. It's been three days since I've posted this topic and I haven't gotten a single response, and Microsoft phone and chat support are still backed up to the ends of the earth. I'd like to think of myself as a fairly
 patient person, but this is nothing short of ridiculous.

            An update on my current situation: I am at a total loss, and very angry at this point. I bit the bullet, backed up all my important files, and reinstalled Windows 7 on my PC. After an entire afternoon of reinstalling updates (I installed absolutely nothing
 else), I ran the Windows 10 installation CD I had made using the media creation tool... and was greeted by my favorite, most unhelpful error message ever. "Something happened. Windows 10 installation has failed." Somebody at Microsoft needs to step up their
 game and figure out what causes this error, because I'm about ready to completely replace Windows with Ubuntu and never consider any future endeavors with Microsoft products if this sort of nonsense is considered an official release of an operating system.
 I have DAYS worth of reinstalling to do at this point,

            I had the same issue, failing at 91%. I got it to install by taking the option just to retain my personal documents. The install then ran in a different manner, rebooting the PC at 83% and installing the remainder outside of Windows 8.1. I also unplugged
 the network during the process and said don't look for updates, however I don't know if this has any relevance.

            <p>Got an email asking if I was still having this issue, so I figured I'd bump this thread with a resounding "DUH."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have no idea what the problem with my upgrade could be. After a week of trying other peoples' solutions with no luck, I assumed that the distributor of my Win 7 CD (Dell) could have been to blame. I actually went out of my way and bought a new copy
 of Win 7 Pro not associated with Dell because I was so sure of myself that this was the issue... and after a clean install, was greeted with my favorite, most unhelpful error message in the world when I tried to upgrade through the media creation tool once
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's now been two weeks, and I am at a complete loss as to what the issue could be. When do people getting this error just get shipped a free physical copy of Win 10 and serial code for a clean install?</p>

Did you lose all of your installed applications, e.g. Virus protector, Windows Office, games?

            I completely uninstalled Norton Security Suite. I then was able to install Windows 10 without losing any of my apps. I reinstalled Norton and It's behaving better than under Windows 7. My son tried the same on his laptop but it didn't work.

            <p>Let's give this thread one last bump, shall we?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea if an official fix for this error has been released, but let me tell you, I am incredibly disappointed in Microsoft to see this error persisting ten whole months after the OS was launched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap, I have been getting this same error since JULY OF LAST YEAR. Microsoft's tech support was no help then, and every oddball fix I tried on the internet failed to help me. So I'm asking one last time before I stop actively trying to get Windows 10
 on this computer (Windows Update will still passively, unhelpfully try to run the update with no success until the offer expires, I'm sure.). Is there any actual fix for the "Something happened: Windows 10 installation has failed." error?</p>

<h2>            Windows image Backup</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 on 12/12/15. I think I performed an image backup after the installation, however the file that</p>
<p>is stored says "Date modified 8/17/15". </p>
<p>In August of 2015 I was using Windows 7 not 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if this is when I performed the image backup, I'm not sure anymore, shouldn't I delete the 8/17/15 file and do an image backup in Windows 10?</p>
<p>If the existing image backup was performed on the "modified date" which is prior to Windows 10 and I used it to "restore" my system which version of windows would be restored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I don't have enough free space to create a new image backup so I would have to delete the old one.</p>

            <p>Hi Loren,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used Backup and Restore to back up files or create system image backups in previous versions of Windows, your old backups are still available in Windows 10. To get to it, right-click the Start button, then select
<span>Control Panel &gt; Backup and Restore (Windows 7). </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you perform an image backup on the existing one you will get the latest version of Windows which is currently there in your system. You can also take a system image backup to an external hard disk and can restore it without loosing the existing one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think to clear up any confusion about my original "image backup" I will just delete iy and create a new one.</p>
<p>I know I could return to Windows 7 for a couple of weeks but I don't want to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of my confusion about "image backup" is that most of the online information on how to do things</p>
<p>in Windows 10 is telling you how to do it Windows 8 &amp; 8.1. Believe me Windows 10 operates somewhat</p>
<p>differently than the earlier versions. Things they tell you can do don't really apply to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume Microsoft will eventually update some steps for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. They say you can perform backups without creating another "image backup". But I can't find anything
</p>
<p>in the backup procedure where it actually says to not do the image backup. </p>
<p>The size of an image backup can wipe out the free space in the storage drive. The size of my present</p>
<p>image backup is 81 GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've deleted a lot of things since I installed Windows 10 and I know another image backup would not be
</p>
<p>that large. The "data" backups are not big compared to a full image backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>blah, blah, blah!</p>

            <p>Call it System Image instead of backup. It is not a true backup because it is an "all or nothing" image that must be installed intact with no single file available to be chosen. It is only used after major changes and never updated regularly like backups.
 It is for disaster recovery like installing a new hard drive or reverting to a previous windows installation&nbsp;and requires a bootable recovery disk to access it if you cannot boot to the repair menu. A System Image&nbsp;should be stored on an external hard drive,
 not on your hard drive and not on dvds or thumb drives. Setup a system image from the File History page, not your backup program which might have a similar image name but is not the same thing. Each system image will replace the previous one unless you use
 a workaround. And the date on the file is misleading. Mine has the wrong date too.

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>This "backup" system in Windows 10 is very, very confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus the size of these backups and File History eats up storage space like crazy. That's why I had to add another larger external drive just to be able to store the backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what I have done, and if it isn't kosher with Windows 10 so be it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my backup destination drive to the new larger drive.</p>
<p>I created a new Windows Image Backup on the new drive. ( at the end of this new</p>
<p>image backup the system followed with a full Data backup).</p>
<p>I then completely deleted the backups from the original backup destination drive</p>
<p>i.e. Username-PC backup, Image Backup and File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now all the "backup" files are on the new drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm done with backups!</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s./ This new Windows 10 does so many things automatically and HIDDEN that I'm beginning to</p>
<p>pine for my old Windows XP or 7 where I knew what it was doing and could confirm the results</p>
<p>or stop it if I didn't like what was happening.</p>

            This isn't a reply, but I have question and I can't find the answer. &nbsp;This is my daughter's computer. &nbsp;We did a windows image backup "in case". &nbsp;Windows 10 has not been working right every since it was installed. &nbsp;This computer came preinstalled with Win8
 so we don't have an install disk, but we do have the image backup. &nbsp;I cannot get it to restore to computer in Win10. &nbsp;Can anyone please help me. &nbsp;It is driving me crazy. &nbsp;I am almost tempted to use my Windows 8 key for my computer to put it on hers, BUT I
 don't want the Win10 to beat me. &nbsp;I want to know how I can do it. &nbsp;After numerous attempts to restore, I realized that the backup set is the image file and not the zip files that is in a backup, which is WHY it tells me there is no backup set. &nbsp;Also, I have
 had problems finding the stupid cloud drive in our house that has it stored. &nbsp;We have 2, but the computer seems to only find the other on the network. &nbsp;I can see it in file e

<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Repair upgrade is not Reset or Reinstall. You won't lose any program or file. 
<br />
<br />You can try restore also as per that wiki. If that doesn't work, then perform repair upgrade.

<br />Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine

            <p>i guess,as my tab has no keyboard and mouse </p>
<p>attached so the power management option in not being displayed in the respective drivers of keyboard,mouse in device manager</p>
<p>I already did the power managemnet trouble shooting but it didnt helped</p>
<p>I guess many users of win 10 are facing inablity to wake up from sleep problem,so to save my time as of now i think its better to leave the problem as it be,so as to keep it away from annoying me
</p>
<p>just wanna ask,is it going to damage my tab in any way..</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What did you upgrade on your computer?<br />
2. Do you have any third party CD DVD burning software like Roxio or Nero?<br />
3. Which version of Windows Media Player is installed on your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.<br />
</strong>
<div>To fix the problem, do one or more of the following:<br />
a. Clean the disc and verify that it is not damaged.<br />
b. Select a slower recording (write) speed for the CD burner (recorder).<br />
c. Try a different brand of blank discs.<br />
d. Quit other programs – if you have too many applications open burning can fail.<br />
e. Click start and type cmd.exe in the run.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; type <strong>regsvr32 wmp.dll </strong>in command prompt and Press Enter.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>if&nbsp; the issue persists try the methods listed in the articles below and check.</div>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try to check the status of the issue in Safe Mode.<strong> Safe mode</strong></span><span> starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services.
 If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the link below for steps to boot in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></strong></p>

<h2>            Hardware-reserved memory is just too much&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey Microsoft.</p>
<p>I've got an HP Compaq 6005 Pro Microtower PC with 8GB of RAM installed. Previously it used to show that 7.50 GB memory was usable. Now, however, it displays only 3.50 GB usable, which means that more than half of the memory is being wasted. Kindly give suggestions
 to solve this, if any! Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the RAM is DDR3.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi,
<br />two possible source of this: maximum memory is set in msconfig or by other program or bad contact somewere in PC. Did you change something inside a case? Please check the contacts of memory modules, reinsert them.

<p>Installing Windows 10 32bit would explain only using 4GB instead of the full 8GB. 32bit can only address up to 4GB, you need to clean install 64bit to use all the memory.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 restart problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Pavilion X2 10-n100na tablet/laptop running Windows 10 Home (v1709). If i do a restart, either following an update for example or using the on-screen 'power' button the PC shuts down but doesn't restart. I've looked at various forums including
 on here, some of which blame newer drivers for Intel Management Engine Interface. However, when I checked, I don't have Intel MEI on my computer. I do have Intel Trusted Execution Engine Interface which has a yellow triangle showing next to it in Device Manager

I suppose my questions are:<br />
<br />
1 - should I have Intel MEI installed (and if so, how)?<br />
<br />
2 - what does Intel TXT do and is it likely to be linked to my restart problems?<br />
<br />
If neither of the above are relevant, does anyone have any ideas for resolving this, beyond completely reinstalling/repairing Windows - I've already done those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help anyone can give.</p>

            There is a BIOS update from December 2017. You might want to apply that to see if it helps:

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11</h2>
                    For some unknown (to me) reason media player 11 now is being selective (on its own) on what it adds to the library and what it doesn't. I recently had to do a complete reformat of the hard drive, experience has taught me not to transfer from (in my case)
 a external hard drive back onto the main hard drive on my PC the whole amount...about 130GB so I took 5 - 12GB increments so as to not be taxing on the system. The problem is although I was successful into transfering all my music files, there are many that
 are missing in the library. I have tried to "force" the issue as indicated in windows help both internal and online. I played the fileswith no luck, the library does not acknowledge them. I've tried to create a file, add the missing items and then set it to
 have that file "Monitored". That didn't work either. I then spent 2 - 3 hours thumbing through everything I could in search of.....I dare say it?&nbsp; A fresh copy of Windows "Media Player 11" with the reasonable expectation that a fresh install would solve whatever
 quirk is there. Of course I couldn't find a downloadable copy anywhere, because if I had, I wouldn't be writing this "REQUEST FOR HELP" As much as I dislike Apple I must admit one feature they possess in iTunes that I and millions of others would love to see,
 that is a very simple way to "Add To Library". That said; Would someone kindly provide me with some suggestions/answers to solve my dilemma, I would greatly appreciate the help.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I know this is an OLD thread but with no answer I wanted to put something here in case others have the same issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had similar issues in the past. What all appeared to be a WMP problem turned out to be a collection of minor file problems. I probably don't have THE answer for you and most people probably don't because it's not a&nbsp;single problem. Instead, I'll give
 you some information I've learned (some of which my actually be wrong but is my assumption) to work with so you can hopefully sort it out.<br />
<br />
WMP works from a database and not from the files themselves. It scans your files and adds information to the database. The database has rules as to how the information should fit into it. I don't have those details but for instance, if only certain characters
 are allowed in a specific field, then if your file has disallowed characters in that matched field, it can bypass and ignore the file entirely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likewise, there are certain expectations of file formats. So if you have a wma file that's really an mp3 or similar, it could (but won't always) overlook it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WMP is only "OK" at overlooking file errors. And over time, files can accumulate errors. Over the last several years, for security reasons, software has become less and less tolerant of errors in data because it could possibly be real attempts at doing bad
 things. VLC for instance seems to just not care. A file that is corrupted totally unplayable in WMP can often be played in VLC without a problem and maybe with a slight hiccup or two. Likewise, the database in WMP my simply ignore a file with corrupted header
 information and not add it to the database, but when manually played, may go ahead and give it a try and it&nbsp; may play fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As time has passed, WMP itself seems to have become more selective as to how many and what kinds of errors it will allow in the database. So it's possible to upgrade and then upon scanning of the database, lose files that previously showed up, not because
 WMP is doing something wrong, but because there are file problems that were ignored before. Or because file corruption happened after it was added to the previous database but since it was already there it was never removed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice would be to create a folder on your hard drive and then copy all files that are missing from the database to this new folder. If you have a LOT, you might want to either take note of the locations or copy entire folder structures.</p>
<p>If you have whole folders being missed, copy the contents to a brand new folder and delete the old folder as there may be properties in the folder itself causing the problem such as the length of the path.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, go through each file and folder and check it out in detail. Look at the properties. Eliminate any long file names. I once had a mystery file that would never show up and after weeks of troubleshooting found out that the problem is that the file was
 located at:</p>
<p>L:\Family_Share\Drive\Users\Kevin\Media\Music\The_Presidents_of_the_United_states_of_America\The_Presidents_of_the_United_states_of_America_Ten_Year_Super_Bonus_Special_Anniversary_Edition_bonus_tracks\Naked_and_Famous_(New_York_Demo)"_(New_York_ 1987)–-2:08.mp3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this was a problem. I couldn't even delete the damned file. lol </p>
<p>
</p><p>Other issues I've found were files and folders marked as hidden and/or archived since I always show hidden files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue can be bad information in the ID3 tags. I've had issues where the ID3 information of a song matched another song even though it was a totally different song and artist. I have no idea how the ID3 info got mixed up. I fixed it and the song showed
 right up. I use a program called ID3AudioShell for that. I can right click and select "properties" on a file and in addition to normal properties, I can see and edit all of the ID3 info, Great little program, almost no overhead.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next is the possibility of problems with the codecs. Many different codecs could have been used to code the file in question and if that codec isn't on your machine, it won't play and it won't be imported. Or it may be close enough to play, but not good
 enough to get imported into the database. So I would download the windows media center codec pack&nbsp; that's available free out on the internet. I would give you a link but there are some bad ones out there that are fake and/or infested and I don't have time
 to run down the good one and I don't want to link you to a bad one. So do a search for "Windows Media Player Codec Pack" and use your best judgement finding a good clean one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By now, most of your file issues should be solved. Anything remaining, convert to a different format. I use dbpoweramp for it since I can multi-select, right click, and then convert to anything I want. If they are wma, convert to mp3, or mp3 to wma. stay
 away from anything odd like wma variable bit rate, wma lossless, OGG, FLAC,etc. These are good formats but they are more complex and what you want to do is simplify the file. A good re-encoding should solve the last of the problems but be sure to rename the
 files as well so that the database doesn't just overlook them. Put them in new folders and re-scan. You should be good to go.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then of course, if all else fails, then go re-rip or "re-obtain" the files and replace them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. I've given up on expecting things to work right. lol</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit usb. Where can I get it&#63;</h2>
                    I am planning on building a new pc for gaming. I would like to have windows 7 ultimate, 64 bit. I don't really want to buy a DVD driver, so I am going with a USB method. I've looked around. and plenty of people have found a good one. I, however cannot
 find a single Windows 7 Ultimate, 64 bit. I've looked on Amazon, Newegg, google. I can't find it anywhere. If you know where I can get it. Please reply with the link. Thank you!

            <p><em>What do you mean by single Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit? &nbsp;As far as I know Microsoft only provides a copy with both 32 bit and 64 bit copy of Windows 7 discs of a specific edition or iso. Microsoft stopped selling copies of Windows 7 in Microsoft Store
 so, you should buy and download iso file from any other store or website. You can either buy Retail or OEM license. OEM license includes single disc with a single architecture. To know the difference between Retail and OEM copies check this post :&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/whats-the-difference-between-windows-7-retail-and/4737adfe-8a76-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5">What's
