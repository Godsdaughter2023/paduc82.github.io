<h2>            Surface Pro randomly shuts off and will not power on</h2>
                    <p>My unit randomly powers off and will not power back on for some period of time... usually 5-10 minutes.&nbsp; The battery will be fully charged, but it will just die and not turn back on.&nbsp; Other times, I will leave the unit on the charger, but it will just randomly
 not charge at all (plugged in and light will be turned on on the power cable) so I have no idea what is going on here.&nbsp; VERY frustrating!!!</p>

            I see...&nbsp; See how it wants to fool you?!&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you can outsmart it...<br />
<br />
Here is what I would do:<br />
<br />
Create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD and boot on that (instructions below).<br />
<br />
Enter these commands:<br />
<br />
cd&nbsp; \&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (back up/return to the root directory on the C drive)<br />
attrib&nbsp; -shr&nbsp; boot.ini&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (remove system, hidden and read only attributes)<br />
ren boot.ini&nbsp; boot.ini.bak&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (rename the afflicted boot.ini file)<br />
<br />
Remove the CD and reboot on your HDD and XP will complain about the missing boot.ini, but should still boot.<br />
<br />
In Explorer, navigate to your C:\ folder, and rename the boot.ini.bak file to boot.ini (this is so msconfig will be able to find it).<br />
<br />
Run msconfig again and remove the afflictions like /SAFEBOOT and save the changes, etc.&nbsp; (you don't have to reboot if you don't want to).<br />
<br />
If you want, you can just edit the boot.ini by hand, but not everybody is comfortable doing that.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you are free of the virus/malware or not but that should bet you at least booted again.<br />
<br />
If your EXE files will not launch, see if this will help:<br />
<br />
It sounds like your Windows file associations have come undone. This means that XP no
<br />
longer knows what to do with files by looking at the file extension (like .exe for executables,
<br />
.doc for MS documents, etc.).<br />
<br />
If you did not do it yourself, something did it for you - most likely malicious software.<br />
<br />
Go to this WWW site by Doug Knox:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.dougknox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dougknox.com/</a><br />
<br />
On the left, click the Win XP Fixes, File Association Fixes, and read the directions at the top of the page.<br />
<br />
Download the EXE File Association Fix to your desktop, unzip the file and apply it using the instructions from the top of the page, then reboot and test.<br />

How to create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required):<br />
<br />
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure (no XP media required).<br />
</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>

</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know if you receive any error message when you give the print command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Canon's website, the printer is not compatible with Windows 10. This could be the reason why you are unable to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>

<p>1. Press Windows key + R to open the run command.</p>
<p>2. Type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>3. Uninstall the printer driver and restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Install driver in compatibility mode</strong></p>
<p>Download the latest available driver from Canon's website and install in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span><span>After you have downloaded the driver:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select "<strong>Properties</strong>".&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Select "<strong>Compatibility</strong>" Tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Place a
<strong>check mark</strong> next to "<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>" and select Windows 8
<span>&nbsp;</span>from the drop&nbsp; down list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span><span>4. Let the driver install and then check the functionality&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
<br />
Let us know the result. </span>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
That is NOT how you go to Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer &gt; immediately and repeatedly TAPPING ( not pressing firmly&nbsp;) F8 key untill you see a black and white window. That is your safe mode.</p>
<p>*** Do NOT use F12 key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unsuccessful uninstalling in safe mode, suggest that you go back to normal mode and install a 3rd party uninstaller program called Revo.<br />
<br />
It is widely used when users have trouble uninstalling in " traditional " way.<br />
<br />
Revo uninstaller download link :</p>

<p>Have you checked out our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One Disc Troubleshooter</a>? Give the steps on that page a go and let us know what the results are. Also, could you try an Xbox One game disc to see if you get an error as well? That will help us a bunch.</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! This error is a disc error. You will need to try the troubleshooter that Mister Beep linked to above. If that doesn't help you out, you will want to try a DVD in your Xbox One (not a Bluray). If DVDs don't work, too, then your disc drive is failing and you will need to get your console repaired. Let us know how it works after trying the DVDs!</p>

<p>Is this a joke? Every game works fine. Except of the bachward Compatible games.</p>
<p>And you say your Console could be having problems.</p>
<p>What a Nice Support Microsoft, it remebers me a little bit of the DayZ Standalone Publishers.</p>
<p>Because everytime you criticise them you get banned or blocked.</p>
<p>Fix your Problems Microsoft, with all Backward Games, because it sucks hard that i cant play reall nice old games</p>

<h2>            Upgrade key not compatible with anytime upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have just purchased an upgrade from windows starter to windows home premium. The instructions in the pack say to use anytime upgrade but when I do it is unsuccessful because my key is not compatible with anytime!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 32 bit notebook - acer aspire one happy 2 - and have bought a genuine version from amazon. I have checked that I have SP1 installed. I use McAfee internet security.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me! This is getting very frustrating.</p>

            <p>Please note, if you purchase a product card, you need to retrieve the 25 character product key using the 27 alpha-numeric code.
</p>
<b>
<p>What is a PIN and why is it required?</p>
</b>
<p>A PIN is a unique 27 alpha-numeric code used to verify Windows Anytime Upgrade was purchased at a participating retailer. Customers will go to www.windows7.com/getkey to exchange their PIN for an Upgrade Key. A PIN can only be used once to obtain a Product
 Key.</p>
<p>Where do I find my PIN?</p>
<p>The PIN is printed inside the package that you purchased. To find your PIN, open the packaging and pull the tear away tab to expose the 27 character alpha-numeric code.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Sample PIN format: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XX</p>
<b>
<p>Is a PIN the same thing as a Product Key?</p>
</b>
<p>No. A PIN is used to verify Windows Anytime Upgrade was purchased at a participating retailer and is used to obtain a Product Key. The Product Key is used to add features to Windows 7. You cannot use a PIN to upgrade.</p>
<b>
<p>My PIN is not working, what should I do?</p>
</b>
<p>If your PIN is not working, try the following:</p>
<p>1. Verify the PIN was entered correctly. PIN is not case sensitive and is alpha-numeric.</p>
<p>2. Make sure the PIN has not already been used to obtain a Product Key. A PIN can only be used once to obtain a Product Key. If the PIN has already been used, you can log into your account with your Windows Live ID (if you established it when the PIN was
 first entered) to access your Product Key or you can check your email for the confirmation email you received when the PIN was first consumed to access your Product Key.</p>
<p>3. Contact support if you are still having issues: www.windows7.com/getkeysupport.</p>
<p>What is a Product Key?</p>
<p>A Product Key is a unique 25 character alpha-numeric code that is used to unlock additional features and upgrade Windows 7. It is used to verify that your software is legitimate.</p>
<b>
<p>Why do I need a Product Key?</p>
</b>
<p>Product Keys are used to unlock functionality and add additional features to Windows 7. It is important to keep your Product Key in a safe place.</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us, Andrew. Regarding the error "Unauthorized changes blocked, Controlled folder access blocked C:\Windows\explorer.exe from making changes", you can follow the steps provided by Andre Da Costa on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-10-home-unauthorized-changes-blocked/1feba668-4273-4a1b-8cd3-ac6485cb4280">
thread</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you give yourself full permission to access the folder content by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch <strong>File Explorer</strong> &gt; right-click the folder where the files are stored &gt; select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Security </strong>&gt; click on <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Next to the owner label, click on <strong>Change</strong> &gt; in the new window, click on
<strong>Advanced</strong>. If you already know which username you want to add, simply type it in the field
<strong>“Enter the object name to select“</strong>.</li><li>If you click on <strong>Advanced</strong>, a new window will open &gt; click on <strong>
Find now</strong> to see all the groups and users from your computer.</li><li>Select the name or the group from the list &gt; click <strong>OK</strong>. Save changes.</li><li>Set full access to the file folder for your account. To do that, right-click on the folder &gt;
<strong>Properties &gt; Security &gt; Edit</strong>.</li><li>Set permissions to <strong>Full control</strong> in<em> Allow</em> column for your account and click
<strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong> to save changes. If your account isn’t on the list, click on
<strong>Add</strong> button to add it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists, we recommend that you launch folder Windows in a separate process. Follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>control </strong>in the search box from <strong>Start. </strong>
Then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the result.</li><li>Enter <strong>file</strong> in the search box on the top right of the Control Panel window. Then click<strong> File Explorer Options</strong> from the result.</li><li>Tap on the <strong>View</strong> pane. Tick on <strong>Launch folder windows in a separate process</strong> in
<strong>Advanced settings</strong>. <strong>Click Apply &gt; OK.</strong></li><li>Press the<strong> Windows logo key</strong> and <strong>E</strong> at the same time to open your File Explorer and check to see if it works fine.</li></ol>

                    I have the same problem in Windows 7 &nbsp;in&nbsp; Office 2010. None of the suggestions are working. Everytime I create a new folder it sets it to read only. I can not change it from any level and I get the same thing every week when I try to do timesheets and
 invoices. It's a black hole of not having authorization to save to a folder, then the file is read only, do you want to save to my documents, to which I also do not seem to have the autority to save to. And I am the administrator. I have opened up all rights
 for all profiles on this machine and still can't save a simple file or save changes to a simple file. I have had about a million (sorry for the exageration) problems with Windows 7 and Office 2010.&nbsp; Does anyone have a solution that will help me create a new
 folder that isn't eternally read only? Does anyone have a solution that will allow me to change a folder from read only and make it actually take effect? The option to make the change to just the folder I'm changing i

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Fails to Install Feature Update to Windows 10 version 1703</h2>
                    <p>I migrated my Lenovo T410 Laptop PC&nbsp; to Windows 10 PRO 32 bit from Windows 7 PRO 32 bit a year ago just prior to the deadline for obtaining the free upgrade. Had no problem except for have to run update over and over again to get a clean install and has
 run fine for the last 10 months, automatically downloading and installing security fixes and version updates as they are released. I started having problems in September when I saw errors in the update history that version 1703 update failed to install over
 and over again. It is installing single fixes OK and has just installed, 2017-11 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x86-based Systems (KB4048953) Successfully Installed on 11/15/2017.</p>
<p>Any know issues with installing Version 1703? In the meantime how can I stop auto update from trying to install 1703 as it is bogging down my network and system while I try to find out what is causing the install to fail?</p>
<p>Thanks for the help/</p>

<p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the usual causes why the updates fail to install is due to corrupted system files. If you've encountered any error messages while trying to update, we recommend sending us a screenshot of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting, we suggest running the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows update troubleshooter</a></strong> as it helps identify
 and provide the appropriate fix for the issue.Regarding your question about stopping the auto update, we don't recommend it as it might cause some errors/issues on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you can manually install the <strong>Windows 10 version 1709</strong> which is the latest version of Windows as it provide improvements and fixes for issues encountered on the previous versions. To install it, kindly check this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Click on
<strong>Update now </strong>and proceed to the steps that will follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.</p>

<p>When my system tries to update to version 1703 it fails 4 -5 times a day as long as power is up it continues to try to update. About 10% of the time I get a failure code of 0x80070020. It is the only error code that I ever see.&nbsp; That is why my PC and rural(slow)
 DSL network bog down and why I asked you if I could block my system from trying to download and install Version 1703. This has been going on since September. When single security updates are available for MS version 1607 or Windows products that I have installed,
 they download and install OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the update to 1703 failed I tried to keep going by clicking on Recovery and came up</p>
<p>Under Update Status the following Msg was posted: "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703 - Error 0x80070020."</p>
<p>I then ran Troubleshooter and it came up with a long list of errors I never hesard of. After Trouble shooter ran for a while it came up with a repoortr that showed that it fixed all of the problems that hasd been detected. The last entry in the Troubleshooter
 log Was a Bold Entry called Windows Update. Under that it said - Resolve problems that prevent you from updating Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Package Version: 1.1.0.20170421 Publisher: Microsoft Corporation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then attempted to update to version 1703 again and it failed and has been failing ever since.</p>
<p>A large Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 was released on 11/15/2017. That cumulative update downloaded and updated OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took your advice and went to the link to download and install Feature Update 1709. Prior to the download, Windows checked my system to make sure it could install 1709 and everything was checked OK. It ran for hours and it was at 90% when we finally went
 to bed. This morning it was at 99% and just sitting there doing nothing, no messages to restart, no error messages, no status messages, no nothing. Did a restart. Restart options did not show that a restart was necessary to complete installation of any fixes.
 System came up. Checked update history. No fixes installed, no feature 1709 installed, only messages were that feature update to version 1703 failed to install 3 times today, 11/18/2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to keepo this PC goping as it does everything we need it to do./ This is the configuration as it is today. I hav an SSD to replace The HDD with. I wopuld also like to gfet it to Windows 64 bit as the processor is 64 bit capable and I can't use
 1 MB of memory because somehow when we did the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 last year it got 32 bit installed instead of 64.
</p>
<p>This is the config:</p>
<p>LENOVO ThinkPad: Specs:&nbsp; Intel Core i5 CPU M 520 2.4GHz, 4.00GB RAM <strong>2.99</strong><strong> Usable</strong> 32 bit operating system

<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you can get the Windows 10 64 bit by performing a <em>clean install</em>. In doing so, you need to back up your files as it will delete all your files, and applications. To do it, we suggest checking this article:

<p>This is infuriating. I have work to do, not babysit my computer for Windows updates! My computer has tried to install Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709 17 times now. No joy at all here.
</p>
<p>1. I tried the troubleshooting tool for Updates. Nope!</p>
<p>2. I tried the troubleshooting download and install update. Nope!</p>
<p>3. I tried manual install of the update. This is really special: have a look!So now what! I contacted my administrator (me). The reply was to by a Mac!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you guys really serious out there in Redmond. My notebook has no issues. I have owned and operated this desktop, with this version of Windows 10 for almost two years. Windows 10 IS RUNNING ON THIS COMPUTER, JUST NOT THE UPDATES!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that your computer is having issues connecting to the Windows Update server that is why the installation keeps on failing. To resolve this issue, you may try installing the update by using the ISO file. Kindly follow the steps in this

<p>My Laptop has been trying to update to Feature update 1703approx 3 times a day since September, reaching various percentages of installation progress before experiencing errors&nbsp; and retrying. After spending hours with MS Support and other Windows 10 Support
 groups I ended up doing a download of an ISO file for Windows 10 PRO that just happened to be updated to Feature update 1709 on 9-29-2017 and did a clean install of Windows 10. I have a few more small apps to install and I should be back in business. I didn't
 want to have to do this but the time I was spending and not getting anywhere gave me no choice, besides I was also fighting another intermittent boot up ids-sue that came on after one of the automatic Windows 10 Feature upgrades. Hopefully, I will be back
 to running in a stable environment once again.</p>

<p>I have a desktop PC that is on the same network that has no problem downloading and installing Feature updates so I don't believe that this is a server connectivity issue. As I stated earlier I gave up on MS support and just ended up doing a clean install&nbsp;
 of Windows 10 at Feature Update Version level 1709 on the laptop PC that would not update to Feature update to 1703. We will see how this goes on from here.</p>

<p>My clean install of Windows 10 PRO 64 bit OS is complete. I have reinstalled all Programs and all of my data files. The system appears to be running very well and stable. The ISO file that I downloaded to do the clean install had been updated to Feature
 level 1709. Another note. When I did the clean install I replaced the HDD with an SSD and the speed of my laptop to boot up and run various applications has increased tremendously and installing to the SSD was well worth the cost, time and effort.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player - Many Issues</h2>
                    
<p>1.Once I got an issue that had a blank item showing up in windows media player, clearing the library to have it re-build fixed this.</p>
<p>2.I am still getting an issue of not being able to rate files correctly in windows media player, some items(not all) when I mouse-over them do nothing at all or may start to appear after going like 3 and a half stars over or whatever, it seems inconsistant
 &amp; seems to be affected like in pixels &amp; not number of stars affected since if I mouse over a star on left or right it lets me click on one side &amp; not the other for example when im affected at all.</p>
<p>By what I can see here is&nbsp;if the words go onto a new line in WMP the stars won't like to be clicked correctly.</p>
<p>3.Also, this is a bit minor but when you rate something in WMP it seems to take a minute to update the file to show so, I have a big library of a few hundred items so maybe this is slowing it down, although if I change the files rating, it shows to WMP instantly,
 it only updates slow when rating from WMP the file doesn't update it's star rating right away.</p>
<p>4.Also, when I rate items from their respective folders inside WMP the ratings seem to change, but when I have it sorted by rating where it is placed in that sorting will not change unless I rate the file from WMP to what I set it to from the file itself,
 or until I restart the WMP program then the sort option will place it correctly.</p>
<p>5.Advanced tag editor doesn't show for items under Recorded TV.&nbsp; This might be because the files show as protected but they don't show correctly in Windows Media Player.&nbsp; I am wanting to change album name/title is all, not really advanced stuff but it won't
 let me change the stuff from properties&gt;&gt;details pane like usual maybe cause it's protected.&nbsp; I just want the series name to show up when i'm under recorded TV, then the episode name to show up when you click on a series to bring up all the episodes.&nbsp; I use
 Library&gt;&gt;Series type view &amp; sort by rating so all my stuff shows up as a big blob of stuff because I don't like the other sort types given.</p>
<p>6.Sort types are messed up in Windows Media Player for Recorded TV(Library&gt;&gt;Series View), it gives 3 options, Name, Count, Rating.&nbsp; Although it sorts by name the first sort option shows blank so i'm just assuming it's sort by name, the text is missing under
 the customize sort options mode as well as in the view itself, plus, in this view only 3 sort options are available which is not much of a sort option as compared to how many I get for music &amp; such.</p>
<p>---If you are unable to find an issue, I downloaded the files from zune &amp; they show under recorded TV &amp; I have set by Series &amp; am trying to rate those files &amp; I also categorize them by star rating that way they are show together as a big blob of items, since
 I don't really care for the other sort types.</p>
<p>---Hopefully someone can take note of these issues &amp; point me to possible fixes, except #1 which has already been fixed, the other 5 are still happening.&nbsp; Anyways, if no fix is available hopefully these bugs can be pointed over to microsoft so they can create
 fixes, if they are issues all computers are currently plagued with hopefully an update will be pushed through windows updates to fix the issue, otherwise i'd like links to the hotfixes for these issues if not everyone has these issues &amp; only some people.</p>
<p>---Anyways, i'm running Windows Vista Home Premium SP2 64-bit &amp; Windows Media Player 11.</p>

<p>Well, I use this tiny and effective program called foobar2000. It's been lovely so far. Does its work just great. No complains whatsoever. You may wanna consider installing an alternative to WMP (to play your music that is)</p>
<p>If you're open to suggestions, try these:</p>
<p>VideoLAN VLC Player<br />
KMPlayer</p>
<p>Both the programs are universal and versatile audio &amp; video players. They play (almost) anything thrown at them with aplomb.</p>
<p>I use Foobar2000 for music and VLC for videos (any type) and I am one content Foobar &amp; VLC user. Foobar is customizable, too.</p>
<p>P.S. I AM in <strong>no way </strong>forcing my opinion on you or others. It's just an opinion - my 0.02 $!</p>
<p>Coming to WMP questions:</p>
<p>I am no expert in WMP. To me, these issues seem pretty miniscule (no offense). Other casual WMP users like me wouldn't *really* notice these issues unless someone points out. Let's wait for the experts for an answer.</p>
<p>Anyway, you may want to leave your feedback in the following so that MS acknowledges (if it isn't restricted to your PC alone) and fixes it:</p>

<p>2. What's the file type of the affected files (MP3, WMA, WAV...)? I suggest that you try to rebuild the media library once more, by following the instructions for WMP 11 on Vista at&nbsp;<a href="http://zachd.com/pss/pss.html#medialibrary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://zachd.com/pss/pss.html#medialibrary</a>
 . Note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. If that doesn't help, please post a screenshot of the problem.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <strong>Tools</strong> -&nbsp; <strong>Apply media information changes</strong> should make WMP update the file immediately (press Ctrl+M if you don't see the Tools menu).</p>
<p>4. Try navigating to a different view and then returning to the previous one, maybe that will refresh the rating? You can also press F3 and click OK, to force WMP to refresh all metadata.</p>
<p>5. As far as I know, the Advanced Tag Editor isn't available for Recorded TV items, only for Music. However, you should still be able to edit the information in the library itself, by right-clicking the field you want to edit, and selecting&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>
 .</p>
<p>6. Good question - I can see the weird, empty first column too. I'm not really familiar with&nbsp;<strong>Recorded TV</strong> , but why don't you simply use another view, such as&nbsp;<strong>All TV</strong> ?</p>

<p>The file types do differ but usually just WMV, these are video files i'm trying to edit the information for, I am just guessing Album is what I need to change for them to show the name of the show correctly &amp; then title for episode, currently title is set
 to the name of the series &amp; the show name is not there at all.&nbsp; I am not using a TV tuner but downloading from other services to play in Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>I am using the view because All TV is not sorting like all of one show to one thing and shows up each episode individually &amp; I have a lot of shows not to mention episodes for a given show&nbsp;too, so I want to be able to choose a good show to watch, click into
 it, see all the episodes then pick a good episode or the earliest one that's on there since I like to watch them in order or earliest to newest.</p>
<p>I don't want to make it update the media information itself or especially for my music, I want to do custom, but would rather not download a program, I will look into a few programs possibly but hopefully people can list options that might work &amp; me see
 if any are installed or work before I go try &amp; download other programs to change the info.</p>
<p>As for rating I must close the program &amp; come back in, your way of going in &amp; out doesn't work, the rating will appear but if sorted by rating just doesn't update the rating number it's sorted under until the program is reloaded or the file is rated manually,
 the rating does show up but it's just when sorted by rating where the new rating doesn't get taken into account, even though the program is aware of this new rating.</p>
<p>---If I missed answering anything you two said then please make me aware of it &amp; I will post again with the missing information, just letting you guys know what i'm trying to do &amp; why, hopefully now you guys can understand better &amp; maybe someone can find
 a good solution for any one of my issues or just post another way to go about doing it, since how people would like things to work is usually different from others, I would like people to take into account how I want things to work or look when giving me information
 about how to get arround or fix the issues.&nbsp; If I didn't answer well why I did something or why I want to do it, or missed a question completely though then please post again &amp; I will try &amp; answer you more clearly, the less things there are, the more likely
 I will be able to answer each one better, of course the more info you give the more likely I will try something different or understand what exactly you are asking or wanting me to do.</p>

Did you try F3, as I suggested in my previous post? And what about clicking on another column to use for sorting, and then clicking back on the Rating column?<br />

<p>Neither F3 worked nor clicking a different column nor did going to a new category such as from music to recorded tv &amp; back again or stuff like that.&nbsp; Also rating only one file in the album didn't make it work either, it will have taken only into account
 that one change even though the rating updated it only changed as much as that 1 file in the album worth of difference.</p>

            Hi shahulhameed,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
My understanding of your post is that you are wanting to SHRINK your current Partition to make a new partition out of it's space?&nbsp; I want to get complete clarification before providing you specific instructions, of what you are trying to do, so I won't give
 you instructions on something different then exactly what you are expecting.<br />
If that is correct;<br />
<br />
Here are the steps on how to go about shrinking your current partition and then creating a new partition out of the space that has become available after shrinking that partition.<br />
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Make a good backup of your system on an external device.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>(Click Windows Key E - Right Click on the drive you want backed up and select Properties, from the Tool tab select BACKUP now - follow the backup wizard to backup your files to an external
 device.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Make a good
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/959063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>restore</span></a><span> point of your system in case you need to refer back to it at anytime after this process.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have the backup/restore point in place, we can begin work on the shrinking of the volume, and then if desired new partition creation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Start
 area of the bottom of the Window.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Right click</span> on the partition and select
 the partition by.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In example,
Enter the amount to shrink in MB</span> ______mb.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have entered the amount you want to shrink the volume by, select
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will take a while for it to shrink that partition, and when it does it will leave<span style="font-weight: bold"> UNALLOCATED SPACE</span> that you can make a new partition out of
 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the new partition out of the UNALLOCATED SPACE, right click on that Space and select
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if this information was helpful or if additional assistance is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the effort made towards trying to fix the issue. I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow

<p>The game is not compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; You've already tried compatibility mode and it didn't work, so that's the end of the line.&nbsp;

            <p>False, don't tell lies if you even don't know the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, found the issue: the free update to Windows 10 from Windows Updates makes some mess with drivers. So all we can do in order to run Thief: Deadly Shadows properly on Windows 10 is downloading the iso image&nbsp;from the Microsoft page and installing the
 operating system from scratch with a memory stick or a DVD,&nbsp;instead of just updating it from&nbsp;7 - 8 - 8.1 , even though there's an issue on the brightness setting on the game (not able to modify it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can consider this question solved now.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">retail disk</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> version</span> of Thief 3 Deadly Shadows (and Thief 2 ) is victim of the MS malware DRM Blocking.</p>
<p>The games uses SecuROM copy protection. Any old disk based game with the file titled&nbsp; -

<p>on the disk will be blocked by this MS malware. I have full details of DRM Blocking in my rant &nbsp;

</p><p>DX12 does not enter into the equation. Win10 has <em>all </em>DirectX versions from DX9 on, and the game selects</p>

</p><p>Uh! This is interesting! But please take in mind that Thief: Deadly Shadows is NOT Thief 2: the first one works on a hacked version of the Unreal engine, while the second one has its own Dark engine: in other terms they are two completely different games.
 For the sake of common knowledge you could instal TDS trying the solution you propose and telling the result. I don't have much time, otherwise I'd do it.</p>

            <p>You can solve it by following the following steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Set the compatibility to windows XP or Service Pack 1</p>
<p>2. Run the app. When the intro window appears minimize the app by clicking the windows key on the keyboard or alt tab</p>
<p>3. Press ctrl+alt+delete to bring up the task manager</p>
<p>4. Go to the application Thief and right click it and click "Go to details" this will take you to the process</p>
<p>5. Right click on the process Thief and click affinity</p>
<p>6. set the affinity to just one core. By default all cores are selected. You can choose any core you like. I start with core 0 and change it to different cores everytime i start the game. Click ok and exit task bar,.</p>
<p>7. click the minimized game icon in the task bar. Play Thats it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: after maximizing the app again the graphics may come all screwed up like pinkish or some other color. Just continue and start your game. It'll start fine. Only thing when you use the map or you get notifications on the top of the screen they'll be
 barely readable and split into two. That's the only problem but you'll be able to play the game. This happens only because we have to minimize the app and then set core affinity. If there was a way to permanently set the affinity that would solve all problems.
 But i've been searching everything and it seems all the ways to do that on windows doens't work on windows 10. Sheesh.... what can you do? If you find a way to set core affinity permanently on "Windows 10" let me know. I did this with Thief2.</p>

<p>Not a help for sure, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything I've found the solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows 10&nbsp;Build 15063 distribution (Avril, 11 2017) the programmers got rid of this issue (maybe they've read this thread, thank God!), just install this last distribution and you'll have not problems at all, even with the original unpatched game!
 And the brightness settings is working too!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Locking files and folders from being modified</h2>
                    I am running Windows Vista SP2 and at some point upgrading to 7 or 8 soon.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just ripped all off my music into FLAC files and have them in a folder (not Music) in my User account. &nbsp;I use a few Music programs to listen and am doing some batch converting. &nbsp;I know some of these programs (iTunes) sometimes makes changes because it
 "thinks it knows better". &nbsp;:)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way I can lock the folder so that nothing in it can be modified or deleted?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have everything backed up but I'd rather make sure the whole music library is Read only in case I screw up something.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi Pedro,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you would like a way to lock the folders so that it cannot be modified in any way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no specific locking mechanism for folders however if you configure your user account to control what other users may or may not do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go through the steps from the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a> and check if it helps.</p>

    <title>Reloading Photoshop 6 in Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reloading Photoshop 6 in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a sporadic user of bits of Photoshop and find the old Photoshop 6 more than enough for my needs. &nbsp;I loaded it on my PC with Win 8.1 and then upgraded to Win 10 and the application worked just fine. &nbsp;But recently copying something from the internet I
 got an annoying logo that interfered with my use of Photoshop So I uninstalled Photoshop 6 and tried to reinstall. &nbsp;It will not install under Win10 at all. &nbsp;The install interface comes up and when I ask to install Photoshop 6, &nbsp;Win10 asks if I will allow the
 software to install and does nothing except to repeat that message. It seems to be on some sort of loop. &nbsp;Trying several times and gong directly to the run application on the original program disk and trying various other permutations I still wind up with
 no response once agreeing to allow installation. &nbsp;Any suggested workarounds?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for this link to a very comprehensive description of how to use the Compatibility App. &nbsp;I tried various approaches but each time the problem persisted despite the App saying that the compatibility issues had been fixed. &nbsp;I tried taking back Win 10
 to a previous checkpoint and redo the compatibility test but still no joy. &nbsp;Win some and lose some I guess I will have to learnt to use another image manipulation app.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Desktop Experience problem in Windows Server 2008 R2 with SP2</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was uninstalling Desktop Experience. Some how the server got re-booted before the uninstall could be finished. Now I am trying to re-install Desktop Experience but the error code is 0x8000FFFF, Catastropic failure (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8000FFFF (E_UNEXPECTED)).
 I have tried several times but still the same error is coming. Used Microsoft Fifit. But still the same error is coming. I have HP Storageworks 1600 server. Can you please let me know how I can again install Desktop Experience.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>RDP connection to one remote computer with two different accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul in london uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            RDP connection to one remote computer with two different accounts</h2>
                    <p>I use RDP to connect to a remote server. &nbsp;On Windows 7, I was able to save my usernames and passwords for the remote server in the RDP file itself, rather than via the credential manager. &nbsp;This was necessary, because the credential manager only allowed one
 username+password to be saved for each remote computer, and I need to use several different login credentials for different aspects of the remote server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have three computers running windows 10. &nbsp;On the ones which I upgraded from windows 7, the RDP files from windows 7 files still work. &nbsp;When I open them for editing, it still says "The credentials in the RDP file currently in use will be used to connect
 ...", see image.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a53aa61-02e8-4cbf-b397-5d2a9b4e4fb9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a53aa61-02e8-4cbf-b397-5d2a9b4e4fb9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have is that on my new Windows 10 computer, I can't get this behaviour. &nbsp;The credentials stored in an RDP file only work on the computer where the credentials were originally saved, so I can't just copy the RDP files from one computer to another.
 &nbsp;When I open the RDP file for editing on the new Windows 10 computer, I can configure it to save credentials, but is always uses the Credentials Manager which still only allows one username+password for each remote server. &nbsp;Having saved credentials, on reopening
 the RDP file for editing it says "Saved credentials will be used ...", see image, but all RDP files show the same username.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c6be5e4-3bf6-4aa3-89f5-4390a1c6fef1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c6be5e4-3bf6-4aa3-89f5-4390a1c6fef1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I either:</p>
<p>(1) Save credentials in the RDP file using the new Windows 10 computer, so that I can save more than a single username+password? Or</p>
<p>(2) Configure the credentials manager to work with RDP in such a way that it can remember more than one username+password for a remote computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Paul</p>

    <title>Unknown USB driver popup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexanderpatishi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown USB driver popup</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate on Dell OptiPlex 745.</p>
<p>Recently (about 2 months ago) after&nbsp;installing Windows update this a/m/ problem started.</p>
<p>I could not find a cure on the forum and these that I tried eith3er wanted to sell me something I don't need or gave no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, checking the details of this unknown driver (USB Serial...) I found a string which start with {36fc9e60-c466..}.</p>
<p>I run Regedit, and I found exactly the same string but with&nbsp;a minor&nbsp; difference:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; {36fc9260-c465..}.</p>
<p>All the rest of the string is exactly the same and it is also a USB Serial Bus&nbsp;Controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a programmer but I believe that this may be the problem that quite a few users are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find the solution or let me know which update I should remove.</p>

<p>Dear Michelle,</p>
<p>The Pop up does not come as a small window but there is a bip sound every few seconds and a small icon of a USB&nbsp;connection, appears on the bottom (right side) of my&nbsp;display. It appears whether there is a USB item connected or not. When I click on this icon
 a windows opens and display a message "....USB unknown....". Checking Device Manager" it appears among the other USB connections as "Unknown". I tried to look for a driver for this Unknown USB but I could not find one in the internet and not on my computer.</p>
<p>After playing with Windows "notification settings" I managed to stop the icon but the bip sound still continues. I believe that the wrong string in registry is part of the problem. However, re-installing Windows 7 did not cure the problem. When I have more
 time I shall continue to look for a solution.</p>
<p>Thank you for your efforts to help.</p>

            <p>Dear LemP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help but this issue is not so simple.</p>
<p>I did what you instructed (few times also before).</p>
<p>Hardware Ids gives: "USB\UNKNOWN" and not what you expected me to find. Maybe it is under another detail.</p>
<p>Driverkey gives: "{36fc9e60-465-11cf-8056-444553540000}\0006" The&nbsp;same key (except 1 figure) appears when I&nbsp;check my registry with "regedit". and it is for USB serial ..&nbsp; The difference is 455 and not 465 as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Physical Device Object Name: "\Device\USBPD0-4</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I play a little, I get the information under the driver tab:</p>
<p>"Windows has stopped this device as it has reported a problem. (Code 43)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some times I can do uninstall as I did few minutes ago, and it disappear but it will come back later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that this problem started after one of the many updates Microsoft is sending.</p>

<h2>            Gift Card Redeemed from Amazon not working.</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a virtual&nbsp;Xbox gift card on Amazon and redeemed it using Amazon's "redeem on Xbox.com" option. After redeeming the code, I checked my Microsoft account, and the $25 is showing up on my account (I checked through the Xbox One settings), but when I tried to purchase Sonic Adventure 2 (listed as $9.99 plus tax on the store), my Xbox keeps telling me that I have "No valid payment options on file. Microsoft Account Balances cannot be used in this purchase channel.", which leads me to believe that the Xbox&nbsp;gift card that I purchased and redeemed doesn't work on Xbox game purchases? I'm confused and want to know whether I just lost $25 because I redeemed it into my Microsoft Account.</p>

            <p>In order to use currency on your account to purchase 360 or original Xbox one games, you would have to make the purchase on a 360 console. The store on the One does not see the Microsoft account balance as a valid payment option for those types of purchases. Otherwise, it should work fine if you try to buy any One content.</p>

<h2>            Laptop freezes and goes back to normal when I unplug &#47; plug it.</h2>
                    <p>So yeah, my laptop often freezes even when I'm not using heavy programs and the only way to fix it is to either unplug it or plug it in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop's a Dell G3 and it's still pretty new, 3-5 months old if I'm not mistaken, so idk why it does that.</p>

            Hi, Renimy
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk  with chkdsk.
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Diagnose memory problems
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option. (The tool also offers an option to schedule a test in the next reboot, if you can't afford to close your applications and restart immediately.)
<br />Once your computer reboots, it will start in the Windows Memory Diagnostics environment, and the tests will kick in the Standard mode right away. In this mode, the tool will run all the scans available in the Basic mode, in addition to LRAND, Stride6 (cache enabled), CHCKR3, WMATS+, and WINVC tests.
<br />You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.       
        </p>

            Hello Renimy,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:
<br />
<br />1. Search for 'command prompt' using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type sfc /scannow command and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine. 
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, perform clean boot:
