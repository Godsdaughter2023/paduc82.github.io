    <title>Partial word search Outlook Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james1207  say:</h3>
<h2>            Partial word search Outlook Online</h2>
                    <p>In the company I work, we do a lot with email in Outlook. We want to make use of our computers more flexible, so everyone can log in&nbsp;everywhere. But with very large OST files (over 25 Gb), it is not possible to cache the e-mail for every user, the SSD's
 are not big enough. So we are now using Outlook connected online with the Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem:</p>
<p>In Outlook with cached e-mail, we can do a partial word search, for example,&nbsp;a partial order number, so all orders within a range will&nbsp;be found. This search makes use&nbsp;of the local Windows search index.</p>
<p>In Outlook&nbsp;without the cached e-mail, we can only search on whole words. Partial words or numbers do not give any results. This search uses the FAST Exchange&nbsp;index for searching. And I know advanced, search with wildcards does work but this is a nuisance,
 not friendly to&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is, that if you are using Outlook Web Access, partial word search works while this search is using the same FAST Exchange index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't Outlook 2016 give search result&nbsp;with a partial word search?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partial word search is a very important part of us working with Outlook and it now more or less blocking the transformation to flexible workspaces.</p>

            They are working on improving Outlook's search - but i have no idea when it will be implemented in the desktop version. (Not soon enough for many people.) 
<br />
<br />Outlook desktop uses windows search and are limited to first characters - a partial search should work, as long as its the first part - search for mar will find mary and march but not remark. 
<br />
<br />I thought outlook in online mode did the partial search too - I don't know why it doesn't... but will test it here.

<br />
Then that's a TRIAL version unless it specifically states otherwise on your invoice, and you paid extra for it.

I tried severel times to update my phone.<br />
But everytime I get the same messege after entering in test mode and it stays in test mode until removal of Battery.<br />
<br />
I don't understand what is the problem.<br />
Can anyone help me?

            i experienced the same problem while updating my 6233, however i got the "lost connection please reconnect phone" somewehere at the beginning...<br />
<br />
so, to solve your problem, at least it worked for me, download and install the latest nokia connectivity cable drivers, in my case, its Nokia_Connectivity_Cable_Driver_rel_6_84_4_0_eng, so, then the problem with the lost connection should disappear.<br />
<br />
dont forget to uninstall the old driver first!!!!!<br />
heres the link to the driver<br />

            <p>What steps have you taken to try to install Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory, you should be able to activate the free factory trial with your product key. But if it won't work, you can uninstall the trial, then log in to the MyAccount site and submit the product key there to activate your license. You can then install from
 there also.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Effectively all Office licenses allow you to re-install on the same computer, even after limited system changes like “upgrading” the OS or installing a new HD. Some, not all Office licenses allow you to “transfer”
 the installation to a new computer. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To re-install Office in general you need 2 things. Your unique product key and the matching generic installation file for the appropriate year and bundle.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>These two elements can be found in a number of places, depending on your specific Year of Office and the bundle. For Office 2010 and earlier you need the key and install file, but with 2013 and later things
 have been changing </span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have Office 2016/365 then you can log in to the MyAccount page to re-install Office.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Office 2016 allows users to do all sorts of license management through the MyAccount page. Office 2016 forces you to associate your license to an email account so the original product key becomes effectively one-time use.

<h2>            EOP Reports</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thus far I have been unable to find where I can get outbound count statistics for&nbsp;outgoing email domains. We have 10 domains and I need to find out what&nbsp;the traffic rates are for each domain. Is this possible in EOP/365? If so where can I do this within
 EOP/365?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi TJ,</p>
<p>The short answer is no. Currently, it’s not feasible to retrieve the outbound email statistics report for each specific domain directly in Office 365. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I can fully understand your concern and the inconvenience caused in this case. Also, this kind of reports may benefit other Office 365 administrators with similar requirements, so we welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through

<p>Hi Pavel,<br />
<br />
This issue occurred when you sent emails from your server to an Outlook.com account. So firstly I’d like to confirm whether your server is Office 365 Exchange Online.
<br />
If so, could you try the steps below to see if the issue can be resolved:<br />
1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online with PowerShell</a> using an admin account.<br />
2. Run the following commands.<br />
<i>&nbsp; Set-AcceptedDomain domain.com -OutboundOnly $true<br />
</i><i>&nbsp; Set-AcceptedDomain domain.com -OutboundOnly $false<br />
</i>If you are not an admin of your Office 365 tenant, please contact an admin to help.<br />
<br />
If your server means on-promises Exchange server instead of Office 365 Exchange Online, could provide us with the detailed server environment information in your organization, pure on-promises servers or hybrid environment with both Exchange Online and on-promises
 servers?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<p>Hi Pavel,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your clarification.<br />
I understand that this issue occurred when you send emails from your Linux server to Office 365 email service or Outlook.com email service. To further investigate the issue, I would like to collect the following details:<br />
1. Could you send us the entire NDR (Non-delivery report) which is the response from our Office 365 Exchange Online for further analyzing?<br />
2. Since you got NDRs from Office 365 side, you may need to help involve the admin of the recipient Office 365 side to help check whether the emails sent from your server have entered Office 365 Exchange Online. Please contact an admin of the recipient’s Office
 365 tenant to help check the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
message trace</a> report to see if there are records of the emails sent from your server.<br />
<br />
To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the entire NDR. Here is the link to access it.<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations<br />

Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<h2>            E72 - select&#47;copy text on internet pages</h2>
                    I know you can use the Shift function to highlight text in messages but is there any way to highlight text on internet pages so that you can copy and paste it into messages? I was trying to post a phone number from a website into a message but had no joy.

<p>I don't know about the default browser, but I recommend using Opera 10 Beta anyway, as it's so much better in every way. &nbsp;It's incredibly fast to get around web pages once you get used to using the numeric keys to go up and down, and the 5 key to zoom in
 and out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and you can press the select button (the middle of the directional pad) and hold it in, and then you can select text to copy and paste. &nbsp;:)&nbsp;</p>

            I did it. It crashed. I'm sure the Nokia browser must have some sort of functionality built-in for this? I've found Opera to be slightly less user-friendly and I don't really have the time to commit to getting used to a new browser. It has given me a few
 "cannot access this page" errors too.

    <title>Internet Explorer &#38; Random Acts Of Sabotage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> writergirlmz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer &#38; Random Acts Of Sabotage</h2>
                    <p>I have several issues with internet Explorer. I avoid it in general because it's honestly the worst browsing experience I've ever had, but since Windows RT forces you to use it whether you want to or no, I'm stuck.
<br />
<br />
<u>My problems/questions are:</u> </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Random Closing tabs:</strong> This sucks being a blogger, I cannot tell you how many words I've lost because of IE's random tab-closing act. I can't understand why this happens. The open tab just disappears.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Random Floating Tabs:</strong> Tabs tend to just float off into their own window for no reason what so ever. Most times, If i drag it back to my open window, it pops back in. Several times it refuses to and just keeps popping back out again and again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;If I zoom in on one window, I Zoom In On All windows ever:</strong> Why can't IE do like chrome and remember preferences for specific sites?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>I can't right click on an image and grab a direct URL for it.</strong> Seems elementary, really, but apparently not.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Websites don't like it. </strong>Two of my most regularly used websites (Interfolio, and Livejournal (the editing interface) do not work with IE at all. What? Is this 1998?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any solutions to these problems, or am I just doomed with this inefficiency forever.<br />
<br />
<em>eta: And apparently if you format this entry to be readable, IE just smooshes it into an unreadable paragraph, and you have to redo the whole thing. Thanks, IE!!</em>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This issue might occur due to corrupt add-ons installed on the computer. Other third party application running at the background might also cause such issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What exactly are you referring to when you say that the websites don’t work? Is it an issue with the contents on the websites?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if the same issue occurs after turning off the add-ons. Follow the methods:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Turn off/disable add-ons and then check for the status of this issue. If the issue isn’t there, manually enable each add-on to find out which is causing the issue;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10</a></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></p>
<p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Check if resetting the Internet Explorer settings fixes the issue. Refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<b>To reset Internet Explorer settings</b>”</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-10</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend
 that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. You would also have to re-enable the add-ons as the add-ons would be disabled once you reset Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For reference, you can refer to the link to view the websites in compatibility view:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10</a>

 use their html editor, everything is fine, once I switch to rich text editors (like the one on this site, ironically) everything just goes crazy.&nbsp; It works perfectly fine on other browsers on my pc, but if I try to use IE, all sorts of crazy things happen

Some of your problems with the websites (Interfolio.com for example) may be caused by the requirement to allow "cookies".&nbsp; These are small programs that the website puts onto your computer so the two can better communicate.&nbsp; (Note the disclaimer at the bottom
 of that webpage)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to "allow" cookies for that particular website, because your security software is purposely blocking it......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>Internet Options</p>
<p>Privacy (tab on top)</p>
<p>Sites (button)</p>
<p>enter your website (interfolio.com) and click ALLOW</p>
<p>Click OK</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you may need to add&nbsp;your sites to&nbsp;the Compatibility View List.&nbsp; Compatibility View permits older websites that are not yet compatible with the newer IE 10 to function properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>Compatibility View Settings</p>
<p>enter the site address and click ADD</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>Whenever you see the "broken page" icon on the Address Bar,&nbsp;click it and that webpage should function correctly.</p>

<h2>            Making skype call to US, UK, Canada</h2>
                    <p>Hi, there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have couple of questions in regards to skype number and making phone calls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I currently have couple of skype numbers in other account(ID:giantinvitations) and unlimited call plans, Can I relocate some of these service to other new skype account?</p>
<p>2. I am currently based in Australia. If I wish to make a phone call to US or UK customer and showing their local landline number, should I create local skype landline number service first to show their local landline number on their mobile device? otherwise,
 no caller ID number is showing on their device?</p>
<p>3. If I have three different skype numbers per each country (US, UK, AU), when I call to US or UK or AU, what the caller ID number showing on our customer's mobile device? Skype automatically select and showing our local skype landline number by itself then?</p>
<p>Don't want to show our US skype number to AU or UK customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>our US number need to show to us customer, and our UK number to UK customer, AU number to AU customer.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Doyoung
<br />
<br />1
<br />I am sorry, you cannot re-locate Skype services to another Skype Account
<br />
<br />2 and 3
<br />If you have a Skype number set up as your Caller ID, that is what the other person will see. If you do not set up a Caller ID, they they will just see 'Unknown Number'
<br />
<br />However, you cannot set up 2 Skype numbers as your caller ID, you can only set up either the US or UK number as your caller ID.
<br />
<br />Those 3 Skype numbers will allow your customers to call you at a local rate on a local landline number, that will be the only advantage of having those 3 Skype numbers . . .

<h2>            Excel 2011 for Mac. Sheet tabs missing.</h2>
                    When I have several workbooks open, when I switch between workbooks the sheet tabs are missing (most, but not all of the time - it's somewhat random and each worksheet will sometimes show the tabs, but usually not). I also can't get the screen to scroll
 when selecting a range that goes off the bottom of the screen. I can only show the tabs and fix the problem by twice clicking on the green circle at top left of the screen. I have show sheet tabs set in Preferences, and none of the sheets are set to be hidden.

            <p>I had a similar problem in an excel file with three sheets. When I activated one of the sheets the tabs would disappear and I couldn't get back to the other sheets.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how I fixed it. I saved the file to the cloud and then opened it on a PC using Office 2013, checked to see if the problem was still there, and yes it was. &nbsp;In the tab-less sheet I clicked on VIEW and noticed that the SPLIT option was turned on. I
 turned it off and the tabs reappeared. I saved the document and that seems to have worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone. If anyone know the Mac-equivalent commands in Excel please let us know.</p>

<h2>            I agree.  a Microsoft window also keeps popping up asking me to share my new log in password.  Confirm this is fake. I use only Office on my 2019 built i9 i9900X</h2>
                    <p>I agree.&nbsp; Lately over 2 months or so, a Microsoft window also keeps popping up at log in asking me to share my new log in password.&nbsp; Please confirm this is fake. Or am I supposed to click on the shared window and type in my new password.&nbsp; I suspect not.&nbsp;
 MS window says my Microsoft account needs correcting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of Feb 2019, I use only Office on my 2019 specially built i9 i9900X.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT I was forced to to use Office 365 for my 2013 and older docs on my discarded Surface Pro 3.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That lap top was NOT a positive experience and forced me to get a safe powerful desk top where my MS Office docs are easy to find and very protected and I get performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nice to hear that Windows 10 is going to give back control over updates.&nbsp; I also had to un check maintenance to prevent an out of the blue attempted update in May 2019.&nbsp; I just got this smooth running computer in Feb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also nice to hear that search is back but sometimes I shockingly see a search window that resembles what I had on the old SP computer. I am concerned that windows 10 may be confused.&nbsp; Should I be concerned?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The computer says windows is better when all files and settings automatically sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was in the room with my senior programmer who built my I9 xxxxX&nbsp;</p>
<p>I entered once my MSFT account name and password.&nbsp; Then he said I should not have to log into my MSFT account again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We chose not to sync.&nbsp; So I am doing everything manually. by choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I believe we used a local account as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i changed my log in password as Windows tried to lock me out about 2 months ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will talk to my programmer as to how to get around this.&nbsp; But I am not supposed to be entering my MSFT account log in again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I did click on the warning window about my account settings and logged in but Windows then hid my large black/white mouse pointer and turned my 4 monitors black.&nbsp; &nbsp;I eventually had to shut down my computer.&nbsp; I am back in now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi, 
<br />you try to Reset credentials
<br />
<br />Open OneNote, tap the &lt; icon in the upper-left corner of the screen, and tap the gear icon next to the account name and email address.
<br />
<br />On the Settings screen, under Account, tap the account name.
<br />
<br />Tap the account name again and then choose Remove Account.
<br />
<br />Accept the notification that appears to confirm signing out.
<br />
<br />Double tap the device's home button, and swipe up on the OneNote app to close it .
<br />
<br />Start OneNote and sign in to your account.
<br />
<br />Force Sync
<br />
<br />There are no options to force sync a notebook in OneNote for iPad or iPhone.
<br />
<br />

            <p>No, that is just to try and track down the cause! What it tells us is that one of your startup files is causing the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, restart Excel normally, and check if you have any add-ins loaded. If so, disable them all and see if the problem goes away. If it does, re-enable one at a time and see if the problem recurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have any add-ins, or if disabling them all doesn't help, the most likely issue is a corrupt .xlb file. On Win7 you'd find this at C:\users\your user name\appdata\roaming\microsoft\excel and it will be named based on your Office version (eg Excel14.xlb
 for Office 2010, Excel15.xlb for 2013). You need to have hidden folders visible to locate it. Once you find it, close Excel, and either rename the .xlb file (eg Excel14.xlb.old) or move it somewhere else temporarily, and then restart Excel and see if the problem
 has gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on.</p>

    <title>adding notes to files icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hasan bin shahid  say:</h3>
<h2>            adding notes to files icons</h2>
                    
<p>due to the nature of my work, i have to work extensively on excel files. many of them get updated on daily basis, some of them are updated or changes&nbsp;even on hourly basis. it is very important for me to&nbsp;keep the older files aswell. now if i keep changing
 the&nbsp;names of the files after every amendment, it is very difficult to manage&nbsp;since number of files increases with every update.</p>
<p>What I would like to have as an option is that:&nbsp;there&nbsp;must be an&nbsp;option of adding NOTE to the icons of the files. so that&nbsp;i have to make very minor change in the name&nbsp;of the file, and to see the difference between two files, i&nbsp;do not have to open the files.
 i would just move my cursor to the icon of the file, and the NOTE that i have added to it would pop up or appear alongside the icon with the&nbsp;little details&nbsp;or description of that file. &nbsp;just like the way name of author and date etc. appears in a yellow box!</p>
<p>in this way, i do not have to open many files. i will just point an icon and a summary of description will blink and tell!</p>

<p>Relative to Explorer showing Excel 2007 workbooks&nbsp;running under Windows 7 (may work for other combinations).</p>
<p>If you are running Windows 7 as your operating system, open the folder with your stored Excel workbooks. A single click on any one file will present a 'legend' of information displayed at the bottom of the window. You can add/edit your own information into
 the <strong>Author</strong>, <strong>Title</strong>, <strong>Category</strong>, <strong>
Tags</strong> and/or <strong>Content Status</strong> labels. Remember to click the&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong> button when you are done rather than simply clicking on something else as you might do with a file rename.</p>
<p>Note: only the <strong>Authors:</strong> information is displayed on the 'hot text' hover balloon, but all of the other is available within the file&nbsp;properties ribbon&nbsp;displayed at the bottom when that workbook is selected. By right clicking on the
<strong>File Properties</strong> ribbon, then <strong>Size</strong>, you can expand the number of&nbsp;file details&nbsp;displayed to include
<strong>Comments</strong>, <strong>Subject</strong>, <strong>Content Type</strong>, etc. As you highlight (e.g. select or single click) each file, you will be presented with that workbook`s individual file details.</p>

<p>Hi Krishna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your original purpose or requirement for "using Office 365 on my WordPress website"? Which service do you want to use with that public web site? By "Office 365", do you mean Office 365 for Business services or the Office 365 suite (Office 365 desktop
 applications)? </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, you already have Office 365 for Business tenant and a domain related to that web site. Now you want to add that domain to Office 365 for Business and keep using the web site. For this requirement, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update-dns-records-to-keep-your-website-with-your-current-hosting-provider-2c4cf347-b897-45c1-a71f-210bdc8f1061?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            DPC watchdog violation and using window defender offline beta</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new laptop using windows 8.1. &nbsp;It crashed somehow and I got a message saying there was a DPC_watchdog_violation and it was going to have to restart which it did. &nbsp;I followed the link to the MS page about this issue and it seemed to be advising me
 to download and scan with windows defender offline beta. &nbsp;So I have created a usb of this program (I can see the files on it so presumably it worked). &nbsp;I eventually worked out how to restart using the usb by changing the order in the BIOS (or whatever the
 technical phrase is - sorry, I really don't understand what I'm doing). &nbsp;It did restart but I don't think it can have used the usb programme as it didn't then automatically open defender or anything. &nbsp;I have looked at the useful 'sevenforums.com' link which
 I found in answer to another question on this forum and don't think I did anything wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two questions really</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) do I need to be doing this at all anyway &nbsp;just because I once got this violation?</p>
<p>2) If so, any suggestions as to what I need to do to get it to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps I am using McAfee security which I think I have turned off properly (though even that doesn't seem as easy with windows 8.1 as it was on windows 7. &nbsp;I have also put the laptop into aircraft mode to (presumably) prevent any viruses whilst my security
 is off.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the given description, I understand that your Windows 8.1 computer crashed and restarted with a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) error: DPC_Watchdog_Violation. After the restart, you were taken to
 a Microsoft help article where you were advised to download and scan the computer with Windows Defender Offline Beta. So, you have created the Windows Defender Offline Beta USB drive and tried booting the computer from this drive after changing the boot priority
 from the BIOS Settings. But, the computer did not boot from the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The reason why you were advised to perform a scan using the Windows Defender Offline Beta may be because the computer is infected with some rootkit viruses. These viruses are very hard to find malicious
 and potentially unwanted programs. So, a normal scan may not be able to detect them. The Windows Defender Offline Beta can help remove such hard to find viruses and malicious software from the computer using definitions that recognize the threats.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know - From which computer did you create the Windows Defender Offline Beta USB drive? Is it from the computer with which had this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, then I recommend that you download Windows Defender Offline Beta and create the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive on a PC that isn't infected with malware—the malware can interfere with the media
 creation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have followed the correct steps to create the Windows Defender Offline Beta USB drive and still if the computer does not boot from it, then there could be some issues with the USB drive or the
 USB port in which you have inserted the drive. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try a different USB port and boot the computer from the USB drive. If that doesn’t help, then try using the same USB drive on another computer and check if it is working on the other
 computer. If the issue still persists, then the issue could be with the USB drive that you have created.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, in this case, you may reformat the USB drive and then follow the instructions from the Microsoft Help article given below to create the bootable USB drive and then perform a security scan on the
 computer using the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your help Rajesh, although unfortunately I still have a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I did download from a different computer which I believe is free from problems. &nbsp;I also used a new USB stick. &nbsp;I have tried all three of the USB ports on the infected laptop. &nbsp;I have now tried downloading the program onto a different (never used) USB
 stick and tried that in all three ports too. &nbsp;Each time the same thing happens. &nbsp;It has the 'loading files' screen with the white rectangle at the bottom and seems to do that ok. &nbsp;Then the 'starting windows' screen comes up, the 4 coloured squares fly in,
 but when they are in a line close together the whole thing freezes and nothing more happens. &nbsp;I have to switch off the machine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately (well fortunately actually as I don't like W8) I don't have another machine with windows 8 (or rather 8.1) on it so I can't test the pen drives on another machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you, or anyone else out there have any other suggestions of what I could try please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is only 3 - 4 weeks old so well within warranty so I don't want to do anything which might violate my warranty though please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            If it is still under warranty, then restore it to the factory default settings. That what I did with my new computer which was infected by that dirty-scary virus from a USB drive that I used to restore my docs.

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you so much for getting back to us with the updates. I apologize for the delay in responding to you on this thread.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since, your computer is new and is within the Warranty period, as suggested by the community member, "<strong><em>kitchgoan</em></strong>", the best option here would be to check with the computer manufacturer’s technical support. They should be able
 to restore the computer to the factory defaults settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before doing this, please take the backup of all your important data on the computer and you can restore the data once after restoring it to the factory default settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this is helpful. If you need any further assistance with Windows Operating System, please post your query on Microsoft Community Forums and we’ll be glad to assist you with it.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and insiders</h2>
                    Hi, I wanted to start this discussion in order to express my disappointment on Microsoft due to the insider program and the final license. I understand that Microsoft doesn't want to give something for free, but that is not true. Nearly we have not given
 them money we have given them something much far better, we give them value. The money is just a representation of value. I do understand that you don’t wont to give it for free but they could make a time system (you must stay 3 moth in the fast ring 6 on
 the slow ring for example) it may help to keep a healthy amount of insiders. In my personal opinion I wanted to stay in the slow ring but as I feel that the effort that I give them doesn't mean nothing at all I pretend to get back to my older system.

            If you have Windows 7 or 8.1 you DO get it for free. So what's you issue? If you have something older than time to upgrade that thing anyway. I&nbsp;can get a $250 PC at wal-mart that is better than any PC that came with XP.

            Hi. The computer with W7/8 will be upgraded when I consider it right but this computer was personal made and have good Hardware (xp old license used), it no needed to change it. The reasons that I don’t want to buy a license are easy, country restrictions
 (is hard to buy it on my country and if you find it is much far expensive, almost only come with already made computers), price (cost benefit relation), free alternatives (what I have been using until now), time and work given already (not truly appreciated),
 upset and fury for hypocrisy (they give us thinks for our effort but then they come with this kind of things), it does not represent an increase that deserve an upgrade. (engineering point of view).

</p><p>It's VERY simple. Do you have windows 7 or windows 8.1? If so then yes you get a free upgrade starting July 29th. No you do NOT have to upgrade July 29th. You have until July 29th 2016 to upgrade to get windows 10 for free. So if you're worried about it
 being buggy you have plenty of time to wait until all the bugs are worked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have Windows 7 or or 8.1 and you are using the tech preview you can keep using the tech preview as long as you log in with a MS account and you continue to be a part of the Insider program. Yes you'll get&nbsp;the newest updates which means it'll
 be buggier but at least it's free and isn't main part of being an Insider&nbsp;is to use new software and&nbsp;to find bugs and report them? Otherwise why are you even a part of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to be part of the insider program and you do not want buggy beta software and you don't have Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 then yes you'll have to pay for it. Or you can just upgrade your decade old hardware for something newer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please do not mix hardware and software, You can buy hardware without buying the software, old software do not mean old hardware and the latest software doesn't mean latest hardware. And a new computer doesn't mean that it will be better than the older one,
 actually my old computer is far better than the computers that are selling today (fa#~"g government restriction).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I start to discuss is the lack of consideration to insider's work or at least what they are making me feel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PD: they are not giving the windows for free, they are giving it in consideration of the insider work (far valuable than the licence) read the first post.</p>

</p><p>It's VERY simple. Do you have windows 7 or windows 8.1? If so then yes you get a free upgrade starting July 29th. No you do NOT have to upgrade July 29th. You have until July 29th 2016 to upgrade to get windows 10 for free. So if you're worried about it
 being buggy you have plenty of time to wait until all the bugs are worked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have Windows 7 or or 8.1 and you are using the tech preview you can keep using the tech preview as long as you log in with a MS account and you continue to be a part of the Insider program. Yes you'll get&nbsp;the newest updates which means it'll
 be buggier but at least it's free and isn't main part of being an Insider&nbsp;is to use new software and&nbsp;to find bugs and report them? Otherwise why are you even a part of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to be part of the insider program and you do not want buggy beta software and you don't have Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 then yes you'll have to pay for it. Or you can just upgrade your decade old hardware for something newer.</p>

<p>I think you dear sir need to calm down and take a pill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a very good understanding of the english language, considering I'm from the country that invented it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you have had even bothered to consider the possibility that MS are giving the software away, from some accounts in the media the software will be free for the first year, then a statement saying the software will be free for the life of the computer where
 upon you may need a new licence for any new hardware, then statements on how it would have been free for insider preview users, and now a statement saying that the insider preview members will permanently be beta testers if they so wish, but they can change
 to a normal user if they wish but they may need to purchase a licence if they don't have a licenced copy of windows 7/8/8.1????</p>
<p>
</p><p>microsofts head is so far up its own back side it has no idea what it is doing and the continued flood of statements and retractions is causing so much confusion across the user base, even you dear sir have no way of knowing what Microsoft will or will not
 promise then retract within the coming month.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Please do not mix hardware and software, You can buy hardware without buying the software, old software do not mean old hardware and the latest software doesn't mean latest hardware. And a new computer doesn't mean that it will be better than the older one,
 actually my old computer is far better than the computers that are selling today (fa#~"g government restriction).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I start to discuss is the lack of consideration to insider's work or at least what they are making me feel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PD: they are not giving the windows for free, they are giving it in consideration of the insider work (far valuable than the licence) read the first post.</p>

<p>I'm not worried as the vast vast majority of home users have Windows 7 or 8 and thus will get the free upgrade. No one is going to feel sorry for a Windows XP or Vista users not getting an upgrade or someone without an OS looking to get something for nothing.
 You overestimate the public's rage. Yeah there was going to be rage last April when MS ended support for XP. Ok where was the rioting then? The reaction was " Meh, sucks for them I guess? "</p>

I know it long ago that why I said in the first post that I will get out of the system and get back to the original one (linux). but it doesn't mean that i feel disappointed and upset, reason that why i started the discussion.

Microsoft is worry about it. the licence is just an small amount of money that come with the os, the auxiliary services like windows store and bing represent the real income, so more user more money. 30% of users use xp, is a massive amount, of course that
 windows want them and have try too hard to get them but they have fail by now. And at last remember about piracy, they don't buy the licence but they want them with windows 10 so they use the auxiliary services that bring them money.<br />
And at last windows use to have 90% of personal sistem now they have less then 20%. they sleep hard.

            Listen your beef is "I don't have Windows 7 or 8.1 but since I'm an Insider I want a free copy of Windows 10 anyway" and the answer to that&nbsp;is&nbsp;that you won't get one. What else is left to discuss? You want to whine here for another 36 days? You think MS
 is going to give in and give you a free copy because you complained on a messageboard incessantly for weeks?
