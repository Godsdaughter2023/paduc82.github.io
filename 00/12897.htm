            I didnt get any help on here or on the Nokia support email but managed to fix it myself. However to do it I had to reset it via the PC suite so it wiped off all of my information and settings. Thankfully I backed it all up first and its all now working
 however im not impressed that this happened and there is no easier fix.

<p>Hi I'm having this problem now and can't find any support. I've installed the PC Suite, and now when I've tried to install updates it's refusing to communicate with my E71.</p>
<p>Can you tell me how I reset the calendar from the PC Suite - I can't see any obvious prompts.</p>
<p>I'd be eternally grateful!!</p>
<p>One very frustrated E71 user!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>I've been trying for some months to get CALENDAR om the Nokia E71 to accept memos,Meetings, etc without getting SYSTEM ERROR message. I've tried backing up data, re-setting phone, re-loading some adat, re-loading all data, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've now worked out the solution.</p>
<p>Get a new phone, <strong>but not a Nokia.</strong></p>
<p>The customer service is lamentable. This error is a basic progrmming error. The fix should take any reputable software programmer 10 minutes to sort out. BUT, it seems that Nokia, having had the punter's money, have moved on to the next release.</p>
<p>On checking the www, it seems that this problem has been around for years, with no known resolution.</p>
<p>This is my first and last posting on this forum.</p>

    <title>SCAMSOFT aka Microsoft Suspending Accounts for no reason or for BS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmpawnz  say:</h3>
<h2>            SCAMSOFT aka Microsoft Suspending Accounts for no reason or for BS Reasons</h2>
                    <p>i am one who has had the terrible news of out of the blue, for no reason, or petty reason , after having an account for over a year that all of a sudden my account is suspended, Reason being is my name was also on one of my kids accounts,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;we all live in the same house hold, we all have reasons to have microsoft accounts, xbox, email , etc and i must have helped my 14yr old with an account or gave them one of my old accounts i no longer used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; So we all did the Microsoft aka Bing rewards , they were great , search online and get perks , so we used strictly microsoft, we even advertised to everyone we knew how great this was.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We used the rewards for over a year with 1 little problem, the 1st time we redeemed a reward they looked into our accounts and everything was released back to us . So as time went on it was more benificial to save our points up , and we really didnt need
 anything , so i believe my account held over 22,000 points and mind you this was when each search was only worth 1 point not 10 like it is now, they changed a few months back. so todays rewards i would have had 220,000 points . my daughter had 20.000 now 200,000
 and my son had 27,000 now 270,000 points,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;well &nbsp;we all got a FREE CONTEST REWARD so we used them and my daughter went to redeem some of her points along with the FREE CONTEST and they declined her order, NOTHING MORE &lt; just declined her order</p>
<p>&nbsp;so the next they SUSPEND HER ACCOUNT ONLY - then i get a email that my FREE CONTEST WAS DECLINED-LOL getting Funny now, and then same with my sons, IM OUTRAGED , We have been loyal and have advertised this company and perk to everyone we knew and they are
 doing this , so i contact them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; With a return email stating they can not tell us why , they dont have to tell us why but now also all of our ACCOUNTS IN OUR HOUSEHOLD ARE SUSPENDED / Then over 60,000 points, which is now 600.000 Points, thats MONTHS OF USING ONLY MICROSOFT PRODUCTS to
 be told GO SCREW OURSELVES ,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i sent email after email, i posted on their facebook with no reply , finally i got a email from LEE that my name was also on my daughters account and that its a EASY FIX. Take my name off my daughters account and add only her name . GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 So i promptly do as he told me to and i emailed back that i did as he asked and how long until our accounts are back on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I GET A EMAIL FROM A Different member of support, i believe Anne , and her reply was WE HAVE DECIDED TO STICK BY OUR DECISION AND LEAVE YOUR ACCOUNTS SUPSENDED- BUT ---- BUT &nbsp;IF YOU WANT TO YOU CAN OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT !</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BLHA HA HA HA , We can Open New accounts?????? Months of Saving UP and we can Open new accounts ! Go to HE*L.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It gets better, my son decides to bite the bullet and open a new account, he saves up $3 and redeems his points, see dad he says , so his next points he saves up $10 in credit and goes to redeem his points and SUSPENDED without REASON .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft now known as SCAMSOFT is using their loyal customers to gain greedy profit and not hold their end of the deal, read their FINE PRINT, THEY CAN SUSPEND YOU FOR ANY REASON AND NOT NEED TO GIVE YOU A REASON ! Now why is that? Only someone or a
 company pulling shady business would do something like this .</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BEWARE SCAMSOFT USERS BEWARE,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;IS THERE ANY OF YOU OUT THERE THAT WERE TREATED SIMILAR ? There are tons of Ads reporting this same abuse&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Active X Control not installing on IE - also getting Enhanced - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluechrism  say:</h3>
<h2>            Active X Control not installing on IE - also getting Enhanced protection Mode message erroneously.</h2>
                    <p>HI all,&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'm a developer on a team creating an internal company intranet site that uses an ActiveX control (Edraw Word Viewer) to work with MS Word Documents in the browser. Most folks have this working just fine (including one user on Surface Pro 3 so Win 8.1 and
 IE11), but me, and someone else who has now left the company have had issues and we are worried about these issues showing up on users compuiters when we launch the site. The ActiveX control installer is hosted with the intranet site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Internet Explorer Version: IE 11.0.9600</p>
<p>Domain: Either dev environment&nbsp;local IIS instance&nbsp;or internally hosted server</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the page:</p>
<p>1. I am prompted to install the Edraw ActiveX control. I choose OK. This only happens when I run the&nbsp;(default) 64bit IE as a normal user. Running&nbsp;as administrator, or I running 32bit IE skips this step. I believe this is a 32bit control.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;I then get a message saying:"This webpage wants to run "Edraw viewer component for word" which is not compatible with Internet Explorer's enhanced security features.&nbsp; If you trust this website, you can disable Enhanced Protection Mode for this site and
 allow the control to run." I click "Run"</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>ActiveX errors can happen to any user. They prevent ActiveX controls from adding animation, interactivity and other features to websites. Most of these problems can be solved through troubleshooting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>The most common problems with ActiveX controls are:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">â€¢Internet Security level set too high.<br />
â€¢Website you want to install ActiveX from is on a restricted list.<br />
â€¢Internet Explorer is preventing signed ActiveX controls from being downloaded.<br />
â€¢ActiveX controls are being filtered.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Excel 365 VBA Cannot communicate with Powerpoint.Application, early or late binding</h2>
                    <div>
<p>(I'm reposting this in the Office 365 Excel forum, it got no answers in the Powerpoint forum.)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>An app is working fine on my PCs and used to work on a client site until Feb 18.</div>
<div>Now the line createobject("Powerpoint.Application") is giving err 429 activex component can't create object<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have reinstalled (Online Repair) Office 365 on their PC and it still fails.</div>
<div>I notice there are two icons each for Excel and PP in their Start menu.<br />
</div>
<div>Version Excel: 1901&nbsp; 11231.20124 click-to-run</div>
<div>Powerpoint launches OK from its own icon, just not from COM.</div>
<div><br />

<div>I have checked</div>
<div>support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/828550/you-receive-run-time-error-429-when-you-automate-office-applications</div>
<div>and note there is no LocalServer32 under Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{91493443-5A91-11CF-8700-00AA0060263B}</div>
<div>only Inprocserver32</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried&nbsp; setting a reference to MS Powerpoint 16.0 object model</div>
<div>dim pp as powerpoint.application</div>
<div>set pp = new&nbsp; powerpoint.application</div>
<div>and now get Automation Error Element not found.</div>

<div>I completely uninstalled Office - but icons Access, Excel, etc are STILL there in the Start menu and there seems to be no way to get rid of them!</div>

            Hi Patrick,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. This is a very complex problem. You have already done uninstall/reinstall.
<br />
<br />I would suggest that you should post simultaneously (i.e. cross-post) to Technet forum also as this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.
<br />
<br />Technet Excel forum - <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=excel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/off...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            This is not a common problem. I doubt you can get telephonic support on this issue to your satisfaction. Since, your problem is on 3 forums - Microsoft Answers - Powerpoint and Excel as well as on Technet Excel, you should receive some response from somebody who may have some insight.

    <title>Applying multiple criteria to multiple columns - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oaklandmike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Applying multiple criteria to multiple columns</h2>
                    <p>I have one table with an employee identifier (numeric), then six columns of values (text). In another table, I have those same six columns of values plus a category identifier (text), but without the employee identifier. The only possible joins would be
 all six columns of values, which creates a mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to compare the first table to the second and find where all the six columns match in both tables in order to find the category identifier for each employee identifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I want to do is ask Access to find which complete row of values in the first table matches the complete row of values in the second table, without having any possible join field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table1:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d03a33f-48f0-4193-822c-9f807cc5b9ff" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Table 2:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/596d9e47-e5c5-4f68-a824-c32f1a6ef51b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>See? I need to apply the criteria in Table 2 to the employees in Table 1 to find their Area. I need to check a row in one table for the row in another table that is an exact match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple solution that I'm missing?</p>

            <p>If you want to join Mgr_1 to Mgr_1, Mgr_2 to Mgr_2 and so on, I don't see why that would be "a mess" - you can join by up to ten fields. NULL values can be an annoyance but a manageable one. Karl's expression should work too, but the query will probably
 not be updateable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, however, you want to match Bob as Mgr_1 in Table1 to Bob as Mgr_3 in Table2 - i.e. if you want an exact match irrespective of the order of names in the record - you have a real problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the root of the problem is your table structure: the Mgr fields are a "repeating group". If you have a Many to Many relationship (each Employee may have one or more Managers, and each Manager may supervise one or more Employees), you should really have
 three tables: a table of Employees, a table of Managers (which very likely would actually be just another instance of the Employee table selecting those people who are in fact managers), and a "resolver" table Management:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Management</p>
<p>&nbsp; ManagementID (autonumber primary key)</p>
<p>&nbsp; MgrID (fk to Managers)</p>
<p>&nbsp; EmpID (fk to Employees)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;other fields, such as MgrNo with values 1 to 5, date they became manager, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this structure a self join query would allow you to find employees with the same set of managers, regardless of the sequential order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the real-life meaning of the Mgr fields? I may be misinterpreting; and how are you determining the desired value of Area? It's not obvious from your sample!</p>

            <p>It's actually hierarchical. So the rows have to match to the first field, then the second, until their is a blank in the criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with connecting all the fields with joins was that it only captured the small set that matched all the way to 5 fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way I tried it, with IIF statements, gave me multiple matches for individual employee ids, depending on how many fields they matched. So, if they matched in one, then two, then three, the results would include one line of for each of the three possibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the simple logic of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start with row one in the employees file.</p>
<p>Compare it to all the rows in the criteria file.</p>
<p>When it matches a row exactly, it captures a value from that matching line in the criteria file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not at the office now, so I can't try Karl's suggestion. But it does look promising.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>It's actually hierarchical. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>As John has pointed out the fundamental problem is in the faulty table designs, neither being normalized.&nbsp; A simple tree structured hierarchy, in which there is only one possible path between any two nodes, is easily modelled by a single table, Employees
 say, in which a foreign key ManagerID references the primary key EmployeeID of the same table.&nbsp; A more complex hierarchical structure, the classic example being a bill of materials, in which there can be multiple paths between nodes, is modelled by an 'adjacency
 list' table with foreign keys EmployeeID and ManagerID, each referencing the primary key of Employees.<br />
<br />
In each case it is a simple task to generate the hierarchical 'chains' to a fixed number of levels by means of a fixed number of outer joins.&nbsp; In the case of an arbitrary number of levels recursive querying is necessary, and while JET/ACE SQL as used by Access
 does not support this, it is possible to simulate it.&nbsp; You'll find an example as BoM.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
As well as illustrating the generation of a bill of materials to an arbitrary number of levels, the demo also includes a file which illustrates the simpler means of doing so to a fixed number of levels.&nbsp; Either approach could be applied to a management hierarchy,
 but the latter, simpler, method would probably suit your requirements.<br />

    <title>Retrieve primary key based on combination of combo box selection&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rollingupsleeves  say:</h3>
<h2>            Retrieve primary key based on combination of combo box selection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>New to Access and know zero code, but am&nbsp;building a database that includes an order form for products defined by multiple variants.&nbsp; I've been stuck on this issue for a week: I want to set up&nbsp;the order form so that the user does not enter a product based
 on its ProductID, but&nbsp;instead the user arrives at the ProductID indirectly after choosing from a menu of combo boxes that each list a variant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in the Order form, within an OrderDetail subform,&nbsp;the user does not enter&nbsp;"100" as a ProductID, but rather chooses "Shirt" from&nbsp;a first combo box, then "Blue" from a second combo box, then&nbsp;"Large" from a third combo box. Then I'd like the subform&nbsp;automatically
 to&nbsp;retrieve "100" as the ProductID to record in the OrderDetail table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our products actually aren't clothing items, but the relationship as described above (item type/size/color) is the same. We have about 75 products and the variant names are long, so&nbsp;a multiple-column combo box on the order form that lists the&nbsp;ProductID/ProductName
 would be more cumbersome for the user than the multiple combo boxes. (We also&nbsp;refer to the products frequently based on their&nbsp;individual variants, rather than the&nbsp;complete ProductID.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tables include</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Orders</strong></p>
<p>OrderID (PK, autonumber)<br />
OrderDate</p>
<p>CustomerID (FK)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OrderDetail</strong></p>
<p>OrderDetailID (PK, autonumber)</p>
<p>OrderID (FK)</p>
<p>ProductID (FK)</p>
<p>Quantity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Product</strong></p>
<p>ProductID (PK, autonumber)</p>
<p>ProductTypeProductColorID&nbsp;(FK) *index set on this field plus following field&nbsp;to not allow duplicate values on this combination</p>
<p>ProductTypeProductSizeID (FK)</p>
<p>ProductTypeID&nbsp; (FK) (I think I pulled this one in just for sorting purposes--it is not indexed)</p>
<p>ProductName (text)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ProductType</strong></p>
<p>ProductTypeID (PK, autonumber)&nbsp; </p>
<p>ProductTypeName (text, e.g. "Shirt")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ProductColor</strong></p>
<p>ProductColorID (PK, autonumber)</p>
<p>ProductColor (text)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ProductTypeProductColorJunction</strong></p>
<p>ProductTypeProductColorID (PK, autonumber)</p>
<p>ProductTypeID (FK) *index set on this field plus following field&nbsp;to not allow duplicate values on this combination</p>
<p>ProductColorID (FK)*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ProductSize</strong></p>
<p>ProductSizeID (PK, autonumber)</p>
<p>ProductSize (text)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ProductTypeProductSizeJunction</strong></p>
<p>ProductTypeProductSizeID (PK, autonumber)</p>
<p>ProductTypeID (FK) * *index set on this field plus following field&nbsp;to not allow duplicate values on this combination</p>
<p>ProductSizeID (FK)*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This is what works on the OrderDetail form:</em></p>
<p>cboProductTypeID (so user&nbsp;can select the broad category "Shirt")</p>
<p>cboProductTypeProductColorID (user can select from available Shirt/Color combinations, e.g. "Blue")</p>
<p>cboProductTypeProductSizeID (user&nbsp;can select from available Shirt/Size combinations for the relevant Shirt/Color combination, e.g. "Large")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This is what doesn't work:</em></p>
<p>cboProductID</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want this fourth combo box to automatically show the ProductID that corresponds to&nbsp;Shirt -&nbsp;Blue - Large and store the ProductID in the OrderDetail table.&nbsp;&nbsp; I created a query that filters ProductID based on the OrderDetail form's combo box&nbsp;values in&nbsp;ProductTypeProductColorID&nbsp;and
 ProductTypeProductSizeID, and I can get the correct ProductID to show up in the fourth combo box, but with glitches. First, when I attempt a new record, a nonexistent ProductID shows up&nbsp;in the fourth combo box...then after the three initial combo boxes (type,
 color, size) are filled in, the ProductID combo box does show the correct ProductID value in a drop down. However,&nbsp;after selecting the corrected&nbsp;ProductID, I&nbsp;receive an error message (a "current field must match the join key '?' in the table that serves as
 the 'one' side of one-to-many relationship") that won't allow the&nbsp;record to be entered in the OrderDetail table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure I have erred in my approach to&nbsp;the OrderDetail form...I know it's not traditional to fill out an order form by the individual variants instead of the final productID, but this will work best in our circumstances. I just can't figure out how to
 implement it. Thanks so much for any help.</p>

            <p>What you are referring to is a standard process called cascading or synchronized comboboxes. There are plenty of resources that show how to do it.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not clear how you are doing this, but all but the final combobox where the ProductID is the bound column should be bound. The others should be unbound and just used to filter each subsequent combo.</p>

<p>Hi Jessen</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem was that none of the programs workedâ€¦ just start and get stuck. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was not able to connect to One Drive. &nbsp;Can't use Feedback App?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reverted back to 10041 build and will wait for sometime to get more stable update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>

            I can confirm no programs load, but fortunately the settings app along with updates still works so at least&nbsp;when they release the next build it should be able to install properly and hopefully fix everything.

            <p>Luckily this build 10049 has been going good for me on my HP laptop with AMD processor. But for the last 10 days, the One Drive folder / Camera Role is not updated on this system even though my phone (a Samsung Note 4 with Android 4.4.x) says all pictures
 have been uploaded and I can see that they have been using the link&nbsp;https://onedrive.live.com**********.</p>
<p>My question is is any change taking place with onedrive on Win 10 TP? I do not see the application anymore on my system, I keep reading that it has been integrated into Win and the search brings up onenote business which I cannot figure out what. If anyone
 can add any light (or more confusion!), I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should check it on other computers with Win 8.1.</p>

<p>I think both are same now. (Except the phone color, theme and car charger)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both phones has the same hardware and software.</p>
<p>Nokia announced that maps and lifetime navigation is free and you can get any voice you want and maps for all around the world for free. (if you get the latest phone software update)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Navigation edition was different because it provided free lifetime navigation, car charger and car holder in contrast to 5800 XpressMusic. However new purchases of XpressMusic also gets the same except the car charger. (I'm not sure).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, except the car charger, phone's color and theme, both phones are same. Oh yeah, XpressMusic is a little cheaper in some countries.</p>

    <title>status bar settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lavrans  say:</h3>
<h2>            status bar settings</h2>
                    OK- I hate that the infinite jesters at MS decided to animate the status bar so it will disappear.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to change the setting so the damn thing doesn't disappear?&nbsp; I would prefer seeing it whenever the phone is on, rather than the stupid disappearing act.<br />
<br />
That, and, in true Microsoft Form, the "help topics" are a joke.<br />
"Getting Started"?&nbsp; Idiots.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to change the setting so the damn thing doesn't disappear?</p>

<p>Answer - No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to change the settings to keep the status icons permanently in view?<br />
I want to be able to monitor the status of the phone.<br />
I want to know when I have service, and what sort of service I have (4G, 2G, etc.).</p>

<p>Answer - Again No. Your only options are the alternatives as mentioned by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c1590d0d-e145-e011-9577-d485645a8348">

<p>in "Manage Bluetooth Devices" it says phone is connected; also, it shows up in: "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Devices and Printers" ...phone has wi-fi turned off, bluetooth is turned on, I have "internet connection sharing" allowed for my pc's internet
 connection and PC is connected to the internet....<br />
And my phone lists my pc as a paired device...my pc says, under "Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections" under the 'Bluetooth Network Connection' it says Not Connected. What could the problem be?</p>

    <title>No longer able to import .avi files into Powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronkahnrak  say:</h3>
<h2>            No longer able to import .avi files into Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>I am presently using Office 365 for mac running High Sierra.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a huge number of short medical .avi files that I have been able to successfully incorporate into Powerpoint presentations.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of these avi files used the microsoft video codec&nbsp; for
 compression&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently&nbsp; I am no longer able to import these short short clips.&nbsp; I am receiving the error "Powerpoint cannot insert a video from the selected file.&nbsp; Verify that the path and file format are correct, and then try again".&nbsp; As a diagnostic measure,
 I retried inserting files that I was able to import a few months ago into the same presentation, but without success.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am able to play videos using an outside program, so I know the file is not corrupted.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I transfer the video file to my PC desktop,
 I am able to open the windows version of powerpoint, insert the video, save the file as a powerpoint presentation, sneakernet the windows-created powerpoint file to my mac, open the new powerpoint file and play the video within powerpoint for mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, any suggestions to enable me to insert these files directly using Powerpoint mac???</p>
<p>

<p>There are AVIs and there are AVIs. AVI is a container format that can use several different CODECs, and if you don't have the right CODEC on your computer, the video won't play. Here's an article that explains the issues:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/avidivx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AVIs

<p>Understood.&nbsp; &nbsp;The avi that I have been using have been utilizing the microsoft video 1 codec.&nbsp; Some of the newer files use the Apple cinepak code.&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand that not all codecs are supported; however, these are videos that I have been able to import
 into Office 365 Powerpoint just a couple of months ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the <strong>change</strong>&nbsp;in the behavior of these files that are confusing.&nbsp; &nbsp;They can be played by quicktime, so the file is not corrupted and it was possible to import these
<strong>same</strong> files just recently.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am trying to figure out what may have changed to prevent my ability to import these videos that I have previously been able to import.</p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you install every update that comes along? Do you know if this is a change from the 16.21 update to the 16.22 update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many possibilities here. If you had the 16.21 update, you could test by reverting to it using Time Machine to restore it (set AutoUpdate to Manual first).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you could force an update to 16.23 and test that build by joining Insider Fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe my assumption that your installation is up to date is wrong. Please go to the PowerPoint menu and choose About PowerPoint to ensure you have the current general release build 16.22</p>
<p>

    <title>Why do Outlook emails and other applications open in backgrond - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roberts_65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do Outlook emails and other applications open in backgrond</h2>
                    <p>I am running Outlook 2010 on Windows 7 64bit and sometimes the emails or other applications (like Word, Excel, Remote Desktop etc) all start opening in the background behind Outlook.&nbsp; This stops when I restart the computer, but then at some point it seems
 to randomly starts again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I&nbsp;have tracked a repeatable example to when I open a PST file in Outlook (e.g. archived mail), after that everything starts opening in the background rather than the foreground and all I can do is restart the computer until it happens again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate any&nbsp;ideas and help, as it is extremely time wasting and annoying..</p>

                    <p>640 plays music for a random time, then stops playing music. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a PROBLEM with the phone or the OS/phone combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 521 that is playing music right now and will pay it forever. I never have a problem with it. However, the 640 WILL AUTOMATICALLY and at RANDOM time intervals stop playing music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Music played using the internal speaker--no head phones or BT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soft reset. No difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tested with music locally and streaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Affects ALL apps that have used to play play music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course when you buy&nbsp; a phone from MS, you never hope to get a fix for any problem they have because they NEVER admit they have any problems. Tons of people having this problem.</p>

<h2>            Cannot turn on Logitech webcam in Skype</h2>
                    <p>In the last month my webcam has stopped working with Skype. It is a Logitech C922 Pro. Skype recognizes the device - shows it as the current webcam in the Settings page - but will not turn it on for Video Test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The camera works with Logitech software, which turns it on and it works fine. With that software. Just not with Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've re-installed the Windows driver, rebooted, restarted Skype. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running the latest Windows 10 and the latest Skype.</p>

<p>OK, problem resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of desperation I uninstalled Skype, deleted all the Appdata files, rebooted, then reinstalled Skype and now the webcam works fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, although skype.com offers a download for Windows, you can't install it. The downloaded app insists that you download it from the app store. Nothing like making life harder for your customers.
</p>
<p>

    <title>Cortana- the new bing - Wouldn&#39;t that be the best way to market - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shanneykar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana- the new bing - Wouldn&#39;t that be the best way to market bing&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>All these buzz recently about CORTANA and how everyone got excited when cortana is announced in the build just sparked this thought -</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'M CORTANA - Your new Bing</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my thought :</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you need to search something if you say `let me google it` - It is normal and you're cool&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whereas if you say `let me bing it` - It sounds Odd and you will be the weirdo</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm big fan of bing but everyone if honest will agree it is not easy to break the google brand as they started search. This brand thing is what holding people from even trying bing eventhough it has come a long way and in some/lot of aspects it is better
 than google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Said that - what would be the best way to market and expand the reach of bing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>CORTANA&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This halo character which has its unique personality and is very intelligent is the key. It should be the new bing. It should replace bing with a massive ad campaign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how it will go :</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to search you can say ''let me ask cortana" instead of "let me bing/google it"--------- Isn't that so cool and trendy</p>
<p>
</p><p>After she becomes so popular - it will be "ask cortana" or "ask her" or "she will help you"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so excited just thinking about this - "google it" will be replaced with "ask cortana" ; "bing it" is very unlikely. I wish Bing marketing team does this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The build announcement about cortana and the way she is built - she will be very powerful. search will be replaced/bonused with task completion. Especially the circle icon like a heart beat if on bing web page it feels more personal and seems someone waiting
 to help you. she is there listening to you always.</p>
<p>your own personal assistant everywhere and for everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search page will be more personal and will have things and alerts you are interested-in/related-to you</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you all think?? I wish I am in bing marketing team. I wish they evolve even faster to beat google down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: May be I'm wrong as bing can be a verb like google but Cortana can't. But why should it be similar to google. Let me ask cortana on what she thinks [ ;) ]</p>

<p>All these buzz recently about CORTANA and how everyone got excited when cortana is announced in the build just sparked this thought -</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'M CORTANA - Your new Bing</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my thought :</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you need to search something if you say `let me google it` - It is normal and you're cool&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whereas if you say `let me bing it` - It sounds Odd and you will be the weirdo</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm big fan of bing but everyone if honest will agree it is not easy to break the google brand as they started search. This brand thing is what holding people from even trying bing eventhough it has come a long way and in some/lot of aspects it is better
 than google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Said that - what would be the best way to market and expand the reach of bing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>CORTANA&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This halo character which has its unique personality and is very intelligent is the key. It should be the new bing. It should replace bing with a massive ad campaign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how it will go :</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to search you can say ''let me ask cortana" instead of "let me bing/google it"--------- Isn't that so cool and trendy</p>
<p>
</p><p>After she becomes so popular - it will be "ask cortana" or "ask her" or "she will help you"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so excited just thinking about this - "google it" will be replaced with "ask cortana" ; "bing it" is very unlikely. I wish Bing marketing team does this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The build announcement about cortana and the way she is built - she will be very powerful. search will be replaced/bonused with task completion. Especially the circle icon like a heart beat if on bing web page it feels more personal and seems someone waiting
 to help you. she is there listening to you always.</p>
<p>your own personal assistant everywhere and for everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search page will be more personal and will have things and alerts you are interested-in/related-to you</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you all think?? I wish I am in bing marketing team. I wish they evolve even faster to beat google down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: May be I'm wrong as bing can be a verb like google but Cortana can't. But why should it be similar to google. Let me ask cortana on what she thinks [ ;) ]</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
Cortana can&nbsp;if she won it&nbsp;the&nbsp;big Google&nbsp;....BUT why should don t do it &nbsp;

            <p>I have tried Bing and I still don't like it. Sorry. The fact is, Google has its claws in too deep. My phone, tablet, calendar, Facebook, search history, music, pictures.....etc. all are already on Google. I do not like nor want to search with Cortana then
 have to copy and paste to google so that I can bookmark or get the results that I want! I simply am used to and want to keep using Google until I decide to stop! There really should be an option to use whatever search engine you desire within reason of course.
 Some like Bing, Google, or even Yahoo!</p>

<h2>            MICROSOFT LUMIA 650 ISSUES.</h2>
                    I have a brand new Microsoft Lumia 650 and my carrier is Virgin Australia.&nbsp; I am unable to send or receive MMS. My SMS texts are very slow. Battery Power is limited even when I use battery saver. I previously had a 640 LTE and it was fantastic. The Virgin
 team have reset the settings on my 650 repeatedly but it still has issues. I have also googled the settings and set them exactly as they are listed but still no success. I am now very close to binning my 650 :(

<p>OK, so I have "Factory Reset" my 650. Bit of a pain. It's like having to learn to use a new phone all over again. It appears to be working OK now :)&nbsp; Let's wait &amp; see... If it gives me as much joy as my 640 LTE I will be one happy little "vegemitie". Go
 Microsoft... just try a bit harder when you supply me a new phone next time !!!</p>

            <p>Hi Georgia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft Community. As I understand you are receiving multiple notification failure emails in Outlook. Donâ€™t worry I shall help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, I have a quick question you.</p>
<p>What is the account type configured in Outlook? (POP/IMAP/Exchange)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is a POP account, then Login to the webmail and check if the same emails appear in there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try the below steps and check if it helps:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Close Outlook and then login to the webmail.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Create a new folder under the inbox and then move all the emails to that folder.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the emails are moved try to send a test mail to your self and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above steps helps. If you need any further assistance reply and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
