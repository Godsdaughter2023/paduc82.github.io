</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>My Window 7 worked perfect when connected to my Vizio Di500 Smart TV. So I purchased a Toshiba C55D - Windows 10 laptop expecting same results. Donâ€™t know what I was thinking but connecting a laptop to a television using an

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing issues with connecting your laptop to a TV, I suggest&nbsp;you to refer the link below for more information:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/connect-computer-tv#1TC=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/connect-computer-tv#1TC=windows-10</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, after you have the right cable (HDMI Cable), follow these steps to connect your computer to your TV.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Turn off your computer and position it within easy reach of your TV. Disconnect the monitor, but leave the mouse and keyboard connected.</span></li><li><span>Connect the appropriate video cable from your computer's output to your TV.</span></li><li><span>Turn on your TV and set it to the input that matches the output on your computer. You might need to refer to the user's guide included with your TV for instructions on how to do this.</span></li><li><span>Turn on your computer.</span></li><li><span>You should see Windows displayed on your TV. If the screen looks stretched, or part of the screen seems cut off, you probably need to adjust the screen resolution in Windows.
</span></li><li><span>If you can't see Windows on your TV, you might need to reconnect the computer to your monitor and adjust the screen resolution before you connect to your TV.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>To adjust screen resolution refer this step:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Right click on the desktop, select <strong>Display settings</strong>; in the right pane, click on
<strong>Advanced display settings</strong>, check if the resolution is set to 1</span><span>024x768. If it is not set to
</span><span>1</span><span>024x768, change it to </span><span>1</span><span>024x768. Check with the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            The Terrible, Horrible, No-Good Controversy About The Free Upgrade to Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>So we've heard a lot of sound and fury surrounding this offer from Microsoft. </p>
<p>Some, like myself, are thrilled by this offer.</p>
<p>Some are less so.</p>
<p>Some are FURIOUS that Microsoft isn't giving them MORE. They want KEYS, they want Discs, they want CLEAN INSTALLS....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've lost track of all that they want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way I was raised if someone offers you&nbsp;a gift you can either accept it or reject it. You don't get to dictate terms on how MUCH they should be giving you or under what conditions the gift should be given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, the way I have reacted to this subject is informed by my upbringing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone offers you a gift and (for whatever reason) you don't WANT it you say "Thank you for thinking of me but I really cannot accept this" and get on with your life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you DO want it (and I do) you say "Hey, THANKS, Man! This looks like FUN! I can't WAIT!"<br />
<br />
************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, it's really that simple. You save a copy of the new O/S to an external hard drive or whatever (in case you need to do a reformat) but I am thinking that with all the new and improved Security Features that Windows 10 is coming with (including the
 all-new browser) it is JUST possible that reformats may become almost a thing of the past...like floppies, you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They won't entirely disappear because (as I have been reminded) hardware can fail.<br />
<br />
But I think they'll be few and far between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have become so NOW if one takes the proper precautions against Malware using the tools that Microsoft has ALREADY provided us with in Windows 7 SP 1 and Windows 8.1 and Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, a lot of people DON'T use all the tools they have available for one reason or another but that is their choice.<br />
<br />
As for me...I am done with quarreling about Windows 10...now I am going to wait and see how it is when they finally release it.<br />
<br />
I am expecting something wonderful!</p>

            <p>Good grief, shadowcass! Insulting people ("Thus, the way I have reacted to this subject is informed by my upbringing.") is not a way to win or convince people that they may be wrong by not wanting to accept the upgrade!&nbsp; Anyway, I don't quite understand
 what being "informed by your upbringing" means??&nbsp; Is 'informed' the correct word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you want this upgrade and are very happy that they are giving it to you for free..... Great! Like so many people in this day and age that love freebies, I guess I can understand that.... However, don't ridicule those that don't want it! I am sure that
 you have no idea how many reasons there are, out there, that cause people to feel this way and you should not judge them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I want this free upgrade? No.&nbsp; Will I take the upgrade? No. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">Offer</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">A promise that, according to its terms, is contingent upon a particular act, forbearance, or promise given in exchange
 for the original promise or the performance thereof; a demonstration of the willingness of a party to enter into a bargain, made in such a way that another individual is justified in understanding that his or her assent to the bargain is invited and that such
 assent will conclude the bargain.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">The making of an offer is the first of three steps in the traditional process of forming a valid contract: an offer,
 an acceptance of the offer, and an exchange of consideration. (Consideration is the act of doing something or promising to do something that a person is not legally required to do, or the forbearance or the promise to forbear from doing something that he or
 she has the legal right to do.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">An offer is a communication that gives the listener the power to conclude a contract. The question of whether a party
 in fact made an offer is a common question in a contract case. The general rule is that it must be reasonable under the circumstances for the recipient to believe that the communication is an offer. The more definite the communication, the more likely it is
 to constitute an offer. If an offer spells out such terms as quantity, quality, price, and time and place of delivery, a court may find that an offer was made. For example, if a merchant says to a customer, "I will sell you a dozen high-grade widgets for $100
 each to be delivered to your shop on December 31",a court would likely find such a communication sufficiently definite to constitute an offer. On the other hand, a statement such as "I am thinking of selling some widgets" would probably not be labeled an offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">The question of whether a communication constitutes an offer can be significant. An offer may bind the offerer to the
 terms of the offer if the recipient of the offer responds by accepting the offer and giving the offerer a partial payment. If the offerer accepts the payment, a deal has been struck, and the offerer is legally obligated to follow through on the agreement.
 If the offerer fails to fulfill the terms of the offer, the offeree may seek a remedy in court.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">There are many notable caveats to the general rules on offers. Generally, a simple price quote is not an offer. Advertisements
 are considered invitations for offers, not actual offers. However, an advertisement promising to pay an award may constitute an offer because only one person, or very few persons, will have the opportunity to accept the offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">An oral offer cannot be enforced against the offerer for agreements concerning real estate, contracts for the sale of
 goods priced at $500 or more, and transactions that cannot be completed within one year. Such agreements must be in writing to be enforceable. These restrictions on oral offers are derived from the
<a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Statute+of+Frauds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(36, 132, 198, 1)">Statute of Frauds</span></strong></a>, 29 Car. II, ch. 3, a law passed by the British Parliament in 1677 and designed in part to prevent false claims
 that an offer was tendered.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">If a person rejects an offer, it is considered terminated. Likewise, if the recipient of an offer changes its terms,
 the original offer is terminated and a new offer is created. This new offer is called a counteroffer, and the original offerer may accept it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">In offers between merchants, a counteroffer may constitute acceptance of the original offer. Courts often hold that a
 contract is created when the facts show that two merchants agreed to make a sale but the recipient of the offer added terms to the agreement. In many such cases, a contract will be created as to the original offer, and the additional terms may be enforced.
 For example, assume that a wholesaler writes to a retailer, "Will sell 750 Grade A Fancy Pears immediately. Also have Grade A Fancy Cherries." If the retailer writes back, "Will take 750 Grade A Fancy Pears and 10 bushels of Grade A Fancy Cherries", a court
 may find that a contract had been created for the sale of pears and cherries.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">Courts find offer and acceptance more readily in communications between merchants because merchants are more sophisticated
 than non-merchants in the practice of making agreements. Nevertheless, a counteroffer between merchants that adds new terms will not be enforced if the offer expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer, if the additional terms materially alter the
 intent of the parties, or if notification of rejection of the counteroffer was given to the recipient of the offer by the original offerer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">If an offer indicates that it will terminate within a certain period of time, it cannot be accepted after the time has
 expired. The passage of a reasonable length of time may automatically terminate an offer. The determination of a reasonable length of time depends on the circumstances surrounding the offer. For example, if a wholesaler contacts a retailer offering to sell
 perishable produce, the retailer cannot wait six weeks and then accept the offer. Even if an item is nonperishable, an unusually lengthy response time may terminate an offer. For example, if the usual practice in the lumber business is a response time of less
 than two weeks, the offerer may refuse to honor the offer if the recipient of the offer does not respond within that time period.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">Some offers may be made irrevocable. An irrevocable offer is one that cannot be revoked by the offerer and terminates
 only upon the passage of time or rejection by the recipient. There are three types of irrevocable offers: (1) where the recipient of the offer pays the offerer for the promise to keep the offer open; (2) where the recipient of the offer partly or fully performs
 his or her obligations under the offer; and (3) firm offers under section 2-205 of the
<a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Uniform+Commercial+Code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(36, 132, 198, 1)">Uniform Commercial Code</span></strong></a>. A firm offer is an assurance by a merchant to buy or sell goods. The assurance must be in writing.
 No consideration is necessary to support the promise that the offer will remain open. A firm offer created under section 2-205 remains open no more than ninety days.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>GIFT</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">Acceptance</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">
 The final requirement for a valid gift is acceptance, which means that the donee unconditionally agrees to take the gift. It is necessary for the donee to agree at the same time the delivery is made. The gift can, however, be revoked at any time prior to acceptance.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">A court ordinarily makes the assumption that a gift has been accepted if the gift is beneficial, or unless some event
 has occurred to indicate that it is not.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>For your perusal. Nothing rude about asking questions.</span>

<p>The problem is that there is no "obvious" way to map an entry in the Add/Remove Programs list to an actual program. Each entry in the list, for those who care about such things,<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />

<h2>            Magic Jigsaw App Stopped Working</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Microsoft Surface RT, that this past weekend updated upon shutdown.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Windows update, my Magic Jigsaw Puzzle app stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've sent an email to the App Developer, no response as of yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled the app, and reinstalled, and still will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app will start in a slide show (I never instructed it to do that before), when I click on "My Account" the app immediately closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like this app, and the timing of this app not working seems to coincide with the Surface updating upon shutdown over the weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On a related note, how do I stop any further Windows Updates from taking place on my Surface automatically?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I operate under the premise, that if it works don't fix it.&nbsp; My Surface was working fine before the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Deleted Microsoft account but gamertag is still viewable</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After asking for help about deleting my Xbox account a couple of years ago, I was told the only way to do so would be to delete the Microsoft account it was attached to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this at the time, but logging into my other Xbox account the other day, my old account can still be viewed in my friends list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So was it deleted? Or have I just screwed up my means of deleting it proper by deleting the associated Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi Stuarts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting the message this email is not recognized tan the account is gone. However a gamer tag can stay active without an account. What happens is Microsoft will release gamer tags that have been used and no longer attached to accounts, this is
 maybe why you still see on your friend list. It is also entirely possible someone created a gamer tag with same as you had. In any case you can just unfriend it as the account is gone. If you want to be 100% sure, you can request a call back give the support
 agent the gamer tag ask them if it is still tied to your email.</p>
<p>When you go to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/contact-us">
Contact Us</a> to get it to request a callback follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</li><li>Step 2 ----select see more options then subscription changes</li><li>Step 3-----select show contact options<br />
</li><li>Step 4 ----select request a call from support</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once they call explain the issue and they will be able to help you. Note that these options regularly change so just keep selecting something that gives request a call from support as a contact option.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Free gamertag change</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a email on my other email account regarding a free gamertag change also with new of Madden 13 ect. I was wondering on my main account if I could get the free gamertag change, I did not get the email for that account because I didnt sign up
 for the xbox emails (but I am now) so I was wondering if I could change my gamertag for free. I also have been a loyal xbl member for 4 year and counting, changed my gamertag multiple times and am wondering if I could get a freebee this one time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you</p>

<p>Hello Agile Poizon,<br />
<br />
This was an XBOX Live Newsletter you received. It just had a little blurb to check if you had a free gamertag change with this little graphic below:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fgyazo.com%2f186d110bf09389b41ba457f8274c704c.png%3f1346537814" /><br />
<br />
It did not state that it will give you a free gamertag change. It was mostly for people that got a randomly generated gamertag when they first signed up for XBOX Live on their consoles or on XBOX.com. All newly made accounts get a free name change once within
 the first 30 days of their creation. After that they are also charged 800 Microsoft Points to change their name.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you cannot get a free gamertag change. You will need to pay 800 Microsoft Points if you wish to change your name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Agile Poizon,</p>
<p>&nbsp; As the others said, I do not believe Microsoft gives free gamertag changes. In order to change your gamertag it will cost 800 Microsoft points. Recently, a newsletter was sent with a tab that stated that one may have a free gamertag change, but after looking
 into that web page it seems just to show profile stats.</p>

<p>You get one free gamertag change, but you have a limited time to take that option. The email is a generic shout out for the people who still have that chance, but were unaware of it.</p>

    <title>Com Surrogate problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iszyz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Com Surrogate problem</h2>
                    <p>Com surrogate strikes again... however this time I'm in a situation that I haven't seen posted anywhere else.</p>
<p>The exact message reads (as shown below) "COM Surrogate is not responding, If you close the program, you might lose information." I am then presented with two options, "Close the program" and "Wait for the program to respond".</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Close the program" closes the program</p>
<p>"Wait for the program to respond" does nothing no matter how long I wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing the problem under: Network sharing center &gt; Ethernet &gt; Ethernet properties (under the sharing tab) I'll check a the box labeled "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection" Then select "Local Area Connection*
 12 (I do this to create a Wi-Fi Hotspot that I can connect to... for some reason activating mobile hotspot from settings alone doesn't do the trick.) Then I click "OK"</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I do this I receive this message:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f92e62c-96bb-4c16-8102-80b6043a1129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f92e62c-96bb-4c16-8102-80b6043a1129" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This leaves me with no way to create a mobile hotspot with my computer.... even if I try creating a separate hotspot using command prompt I still need to access the Ethernet properties, which means I will still get the com surrogate problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things to consider:</p>
<p>1. I've tried<span style="color: rgba(0, 48, 0, 1)"> to Add Com Surrogate to Data Execution Prevention exclusion list at C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ (nothing changed)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 48, 0, 1)">2. I've Re-registered dll files using Command Prompt&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>3. Uninstalled new drivers</p>
<p>4. This problem occurred after the creators update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are a series of pictures that shows how I get to the problem;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/764cb602-89b4-4fd7-94f9-21dcd564d45c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/764cb602-89b4-4fd7-94f9-21dcd564d45c" /></a></p>
<p>First I go to Network Sharing Center, click on Ethernet, and that take me here..... Ethernet Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/718d6b7c-353f-473f-bfa5-af32e9a0f030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/718d6b7c-353f-473f-bfa5-af32e9a0f030" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then under the Sharing Tab I'll Select Local Area connection* 12 &gt; Click "ok" and then it freezes and give me the COM Surrogate error.</p>
<p>Any information on how to stop this error from appearing will help.</p>

<h2>            Error when attempting to buy Sir Lora DLC &#40;Divinity&#58; Original Sin 2&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there! I've been trying to purchase this DLC for days now, but a "Try that again" error pops up every time I do so. Is this DLC discontinued or just broken in the store? I don't know if this is also relevant/it affects anything, but the game itself
 was bought on the account I gameshare with so my account doesn't actually own it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe I have the DLC already as I looked up videos online of when the DLC character appears and he doesn't show for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help!</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to Xbox forums support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're having an issue trying to purchase DLC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, you can purchase DLC even though you do not own the game license (when game sharing). You would not be able to
</p>
<p>
</p><p>use the DLC if the account that owns the game license also owned the DLC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to purchase the DLC from the Xbox console and online from the Microsoft Store (off of a PC)?

<p>Yes you, please note, you will need to have separate product key (licenses) for each installation.</p>
<p>If you have Windows 7 32 or 64 bit installed first on a single drive partition, you will need to make a logical partition with enough disk space to hold the other installation. 20 GBs (64 bit), 16 GBs (32 bit), you should consider more if you plan to create,
 store files (especially photos and videos) and install programs.</p>
<p><strong>The following references dual booting Windows 7 and Vista, but the same principles apply to create a dual boot installation for Windows 7 32 and 64 bit (even if they are the same architectures).</strong></p>
<p><strong>CREDIT: Yaaser - Microsoft Support Engineer</strong></p>
<p>You have to create a new partition for Windows 7 from the unused space, for complete information about how to create a separate partition for dual booting Windows Vista and Windows 7, follow the instructions below.<br />
<br />
Assuming that Windows Vista is installed first in Partition 1 and Windows 7 is installed at a later time on a separate partition, (Partition 2). Partition 1, containing Windows Vista is marked Active and is the system partition. During installation of Windows
 7, the Windows 7 boot files are copied to the System partition which also has the earlier version of Windows.<br />
<br />
Logon to an Administrator account in Windows 7 and use the following steps to create a new System partition containing only the files required to boot Windows 7 and Windows Vista. In this article, when logged on to Windows 7, the partition containing Windows
 7 (Partition 2) is assigned drive letter D:, and the partition containing Windows Vista (Partition 1) is assigned drive letter C:.<br />
<br />
Review the current boot configuration (BCD) before changing the system partition.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the bcdedit command with no arguments to view the current boot configuration.<br />
<br />
Use Disk Management console to create a new primary disk partition from unused disk space for the new System partition.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use 200MB of free space on an existing partition and shrink the partition.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create the new primary partition, and format using NTFS.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assign the drive letter, S:.<br />
<br />
Mark the new partition as Active.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on partition S:, and select Mark partition as Active.<br />
<br />
Use bcdboot.exe to copy the Windows 7 boot files to the new System partition.<br />
<br />
Execute the following command: Bcdboot D:\Windows /s S:. Bcdboot copies the required boot environment files for Windows 7 to the S: partition, and creates a new BCD store to boot Windows 7 from the D: partition. The new BCD store does not have a boot entry
 for Windows Vista after this step.<br />
<br />
Reboot to Windows 7 to establish the new system partition.<br />
<br />
A reboot is required for the BIOS to recognize the new Active partition. When the system reboots, there will be no boot menu as the boot configuration only has a single entry and automatically starts Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Update the boot configuration to include Windows Vista by importing the previous boot configuration data (BCD).<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous boot configuration reviewed in Step 1 has boot entries for both Windows Vista and Windows 7. Use the bcdedit command to import the previous BCD store located on C: to the new System partition, S: as follows: Bcdedit /import C:\Boot\BCD.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the updated boot configuration using bcdedit, as in Step 1).<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windows Vista boot entry is back and the Windows 7 entry is the same as earlier. However, after importing, the device for the Windows Boot Manager entry refers to the old System partition C: and needs to be changed to refer to the new System partition.<br />
<br />
Update the Windows Boot Manager device to the new System partition.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute the following command: Bcdedit /set {bootmgr} device partition=S:.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify the boot configuration again to verify the Windows Boot Manager device is the new System partition, and the Windows Boot Loader entry for each version of Windows refers to the correct volume.<br />
<br />
Reboot the system and verify both Windows Vista and Windows 7 can boot using the new System partition.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirm the Windows Boot Manager shows a boot menu that includes entries for both Windows Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />

    <title>Files and Folders disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> te-shaho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files and Folders disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I updated my laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and initially, all files and folders on my desktop disappeared. I lost a project I was working on and quite a bit of completed past work. I was upset for 2 whole days, looking high and low through my laptop
 hoping to recover it. but just decided to suck it up and redo it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there was a recent random update when I was shutting down my laptop. I cannot remember how long ago this was. I was using my laptop as normal. checked that all my files and folders on my NEW desktop did not disappear, it didn't. today, however, I decided
 to do a bit of cleaning up in my Pictures folder. lo and behold, all my photos are gone. this is some 6 months worth of photos since I last backed-up&nbsp; that have disappeared. Now, this really upset me because I can't "re-do" my photographs. holidays, events,
 all disappeared!</p>
<p>
</p><p>please, help! </p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you,</p>
<p>a really disappointed Windows user :(</p>

<p>I did back it up 6 months ago, but I don't expect to have to back it up all the time. because I'm careful enough not to download anything faulty, I take care of my laptop and I am constantly with it if I were to ever bring it out of the house. I never thought

</p><p>frankly, yes yes, I know I should be backing up all my work. but in no instance was I warned that I am not meant to put files on my desktop? or that all my photos would disappear? so you are saying that the disappearance of my photos and files are expected?
 why should I expect that all my stuff would disappear? fair enough, if I lose my laptop or I drop a bucket of water on my laptop and I lose all my files, but I am not supposed to be losing files on an update. at least, I would've thought that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your work is important then you need to backup once a WEEK at least.</p>

<p>If this was a recent Windows 10 Upgrade, and the Windows.old file is still in the C:\ Directory, then there is a slight possibility you might be able to retrieve the files from there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as backups go, there should be no need for a user warning as its standard good practice in computing to make regular (and frequent) backups. &nbsp;Computers are mechanical products and failure of Drives or loss/corruption of data will inevitably occur
 at some point. It's just a question of when!</p>

 up? just sucks that you spend so much on a trusty device hoping you wouldn't have to also buy an external hard drive that is large enough to fit everything that is also on your laptop and then having to back it up into your hard drive at least once a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so it seems all my stuff is gone? there is no solution to getting all my pictures back? 6 months worth of my graduation photos and events, all gone? grrrreat!</p>

            Hi Terry, the reason no one will help is they don't want to have to tell you the truth . . .
<br />
<br />You would be amazed how many users with HP Streams ask the exact same question, I see this question here day in and day out . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Hi Dave - thanks so much for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I had to buy a new Windows 10 USB from HP because their support help messed my notebook up and they couldn't repair it, can I just use the USB they provided an install a fresh copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never buy an HP product - they don't tell anyone this and I'm a senior citizen on a fixed income.&nbsp; Now I have to look around to try and buy a new or refurbished computer - I will go back to using a Dell that's for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again thank you and God Bless you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS if you know the best place to buy refurbished Dell laptops can you please let me know.</p>
<p>

            Hi Terry, I would not use the HP USB to re-install Windows 10, that edition would be out of date and this problem would re-surface. I would download the latest version from the Microsoft website as explained above so that you would be running the latest version and would require less updating . . .
<br />
<br />With regards to a Dell - I love Dell systems - I run a Dell Mobile workstation - the best system I have ever had, solid reliable and extremely fast !!
<br />
<br />With regards to refurbished Dell laptop, that depends on your location, but I would go for one from somewhere like a government department or big organisation - they hardly use their laptops and they are basically new when bought second hand!!
<br />
<br />I am sorry my advice came with bad news, but it was truthful and accurate !!

<h2>            Black Screen with cursor after installing updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install of Windows 8.1 on my PC. After that I installed Kaspersky Internet Security 2016 and some drivers that Windows didn't find automatically for me. I also updated nVidia graphics drivers and MODIFIED some default icons with CustomizerGod
 software. Then i manually &nbsp;checked for updates in Windows Update. The installation hung on a some sort of security update. It hung for about 10 minutes on that update, but after that it managed to install all of the updates successfully. As always Windows
 asked me to reboot my PC to finish installing updates. And I had to wait years while it was showing "Restarting" (not "configuring updates") . So, after some scary minutes, the PC finally restarted. But when i inputted my password, I had to wait good 5 minutes
 on the Welcome screen, and after that - no desktop, just a blank black screen with a cursor I can move around. I could also use the CTRL ALT DEL shortcut to open up the task manager.</p>
<p>I tried restarting my PC - still the same issue. I tried starting explorer.exe from the task manager, but it said - This app can't run on your PC. Contact your manufacturer for an app that can run on this PC. I even tried booting into safe mode, but I still
 get only a cursor on a black screen, so I don't think it is a driver or an app issue. Can you help me with this? What it causing that weird issue? How can I get my Windows working again?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. My computer is a desktop with Asus Z97-PRO motherboard (says "Windows 8.1 ready" on the box). My current PC state is... Well I restored it to Windows 10 using my previously created disk image. That works fine, but I just like Windows
 8.1 better. Also, how can I follow Madeni K N steps if booting into safe mode gives me nothing but the same black screen with a cursor? I can't do anything. Or maybe I can... Ok, so I just thought we can find a solution to that issue so I will know what to
 do if I encounter the same problem after installing Windows 8.1 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I could boot into my machine and I could login, but after that - no desktop, no taskbar, no start menu - just a black screen with a cursor. And as I said, safe mode doesn't help either. And it kept showing "Welcome" with moving dots for enormous
 amount of time before logging me into the black screen.</p>

b. Once selecting your 'language, time and&nbsp;keyboard' settings, click 'Next' to load the next window, then click&nbsp;on the 'Repair your computer' link.
<p>c. You should then be presented with a Choose&nbsp;an Option screen, with 'Troubleshoot' as an option to select and then click 'Advanced options'.<br />
d. Tap or click 'System Restore'. The computer will restart to System Restore. Select your account to continue.<br />
e. On the System Restore page, click 'Next'.<br />

<h2>            Issues with Kinectimals Unleashed App</h2>
                    <p>this app lacks customer support which is frustrating because this app will happily take your money in exchange for 0 support. I have been dealing with this literally all day with xbox support and was directed to this site. This is the worst experience i
 have had with getting help with an app. It shouldnt take peoples money if it doesnt provide customer service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive experienced many glitches from daily challenges (i have achieved and not been given the rewards for achieving high score), animals glitching, counting in game glitching, payout glitching, and etc...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my coins a gems I won too but it doesnt payout. would be a good game if glitches were fixed and suppprt team was able to be over it.make it easy on customer to get suppprt to instead of being passed around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>The only thing I've found searching the internet for "Real Connect Agent" shows that the software is tied to Corel, Toshiba, or a company called DataLode, Inc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It seems to be tied to some type of registration process.<br />

<h3> jeff berg  say:</h3>
<h2>            defragment hard rive before or after compression&#63;</h2>
                    I am preparing to create a system image of my dual boot system XP/WINDOWS 7. &nbsp;To save space I considered compressing the drives using the DISK CLEANUP utility, but I thought I should probably defrag the drives 1st. &nbsp;Does anyone have any thoughts on this
 or does it even matter? &nbsp;ALSO, would compression impede creating a system image? &nbsp;I have done successful images in the past, but I never compressed the drives beforehand. &nbsp;I though I might save some space if I did the compression.

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the issue on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description, it seems that you want to know more about defragmentation and Disk compression in Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Convert-a-hard-disk-or-partition-to-NTFS-format" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><em>NTFS(New Technology File System)</em></strong> </a>drive&nbsp;then compression can save disk space, compressing data can adversely affect performance. NTFS compression has the following performance characteristics. When you copy or move a compressed
 NTFS file to a different folder, NTFS decompresses the file, copies or moves the file to the new location, and then recompresses the file. This behavior occurs even when the file is copied or moved between folders on the same computer. Compressed files are
 also expanded before copying over the network, so NTFS compression does not save network bandwidth.

            What about the question of imaging the system for backup. &nbsp;You did not address that question. &nbsp;I imagine compression is GOOD for the sake of saving hard drive space on a backup server, but I know how QUIRKY imaging the system can be especially with the
 built in WINDOWS 7 imaging capability. &nbsp;I have witnessed that myself.

            <p>Not an answer to your Q but I prefer to use a third party imaging program as it offers more options than the default win utility.</p>
<p>It would seem to me to be more prudent to defrag prior to imaging.</p>
<p>I have not used any inbuilt compression, but the Imaging utility I've used has the ability to compress the resulting image.</p>

Without ? I was going to defrag prior to imaging. &nbsp;That is my standard procedure. &nbsp;My concern is what would the compression do to the WINDOWS 7 imaging utility. &nbsp;That utility is quite a FUSSY beast. &nbsp;I appreciate the input about ACRONIS, but I believe MICROSOFT
 has a responsibility to put a reliable package in their systems since their documentation states it has this "imaging capability". &nbsp;I guess MICROSOFT's failure has led to ACRONIS &amp; others' success even though those 3rd parties support other operating systems
 as well.

Then I would not be the only one calling them Monopoly$oft, and they would have more companies<br />
(and countries) suing them. <br />
Besides. They aren't, and can't be the best at everything, and&nbsp; one size fits all does not suit everyone's
<br />
taste or needs. <br />
The only responsibility MS has is to deliver a solid basic operating system, and they have enough
<br />
trouble making everyone happy in their attempts to do that. <br />
Take little things like Win7 removing the ability to disable auto arrange in folders ,&nbsp; for one example.<br />
Add to that what many consider bloatware - AERO and Libraries and it's easy to see the needs of
<br />
various users is vastly different.<br />
<br />
I've not even bothered with Windows imaging tool.&nbsp; I also use the Acronis WD (free) version to image<br />
my Win7 install. <br />
<br />
CCleaner is a good option to do a thorough clean before a backup image.<br />
<br />
Disk Cleanup -&nbsp; XP used to have the option to compress unused files, so yes I'd probably use that<br />
tool before a backup image. It's only supposed to compresses files that don't get a lot of use.<br />
When I did that in XP and checked defrag afterwords there was always lots of fragmentation, so in that regard compress then defrag&nbsp; seems the go. I remember compressing any amount over 100,000 (whatever the value was) and defraging&nbsp; took a long time, so I tried
 to do it frequently. <br />
This was mostly with my games. Windows didn't need it much as it was always in use.<br />
I never checked to see how much HDD space the process gained.<br />
I did this on my sister-in-laws XP machine recently. It was running slow as molasses before the<br />
cleanup routine, which took about an hour in this case.<br />

I do not know about any of this, but maybe you are correct; nonetheless, if you provide documentation stating something in your software does something I believe you make sure it does what it says it does or not include it if it is indeed a BONUS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is a BONUS &amp; the BUGS are not resolved you make such a statement.&nbsp; That is not done in the case for the IMAGING package as far as I can see &amp; WINDOWS 7 has been out since 2007 or 2008?&nbsp; Only my opinion as a end user not as a lawyer or business CEO.</p>
