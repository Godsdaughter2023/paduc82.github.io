<h2>            Updates Windows 8.1 &#40;IE 11&#41; Updates&#58; Checking for Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press check for updates, all I ever get is "checking for updates." Nothing happens. My tablet also says last checked for updates "Never." Yet, as I say, whenever I try, nothing happens. I do not how often updates are created for Windows 8.1 Is there
 a list of updates I can refer to? How can I find out if I have all the updates necessary for an optimum safe secure operating system? How can I fix the "checking for updates" scenario? I have run the update troubleshooter as administrator. The results were
 0x80070490 error and components repaired. Both of these were listed as fixed in the report but I still have the same problem!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Defender is up to date</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I had same problems. I ran troubleshooter and it found 3 errors which it repaired. Still could not update until I restarted the PC (don't do a cold boot). Believe you should also set Windows update to 'never check' for updates. The December update is identified
 as KB3205401. The update can be found in the Microsoft Update Catalog. The file is designed to manually update your PC so every 2nd Tuesday, you have to download the new update.<br />

            I have tried both the above and I still have the same problem. I checked my Windows&nbsp;update history and &nbsp;the only update listed in update history is KB2919355 installed 18.03.2014. What else can I do? Thanks

            I have just happened to look in 'Programs and Features' and in 'Installed Updates' it shows the last update installed was KB3102467 on the 4th December 2016 (04.12.2016). This conflicts with what is in 'Update and Recovery: Windows Update.' Does this mean
 my tablet is installing updates anyway? It is set to install Windows updates automatically.

<p>when I tried the step 2 my prompt showed the following message for the&nbsp;<strong>net start msiserver
</strong>command ' The windows Installer service is not started <strong>n/</strong> more help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3521' everthing else seems to be ok, but the problem wasn't solved. Then I tried the last step and I received the following ' Error
 0x800f0906 &nbsp;n\ The source files could not be downloaded.... and so on...'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone had the same problem? I'm out of options too. Already tried almost everything here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows 7 LIP is what you would need.</p>
Language Interface Packs (LIPs)
<p>As was the case in Vista, Windows 7 will continue to enable the widest range of people across the world to use Windows 7 in their own language using Language Interface Packs. LIPs are built on the MUI technology and provide localization of the UI most commonly
 used by Windows users. LIPs do not require a license and can be <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/unlimitedpotential/programs/llp.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
downloaded for free</a> to be installed on any edition of Windows 7: Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate.</p>
Because the entire user interface is not translated, LIPs require that at least one parent language be present on the machine in order to be installed. After the LIP is installed and selected as the user interface language, the parts of the user interface that
 are not translated into the LIP language are displayed in the parent language. Some LIP languages allow more than one language as parent language. For example, the Catalan LIP can be installed if the Spanish language pack or the French language pack is already
 installed on the system. The parent language requirements are specified on each LIP download page.<br />
<br />

<p>Must of had to scroll through several hundred forum pages to find this thread maybe bored. The Xbox 1 system doesn't show the profiles location bio and motto. Only the 360 system does, to answer the question, unless M changes the Xbox 1 system to add Location/Bio/Motto.
 They might do this though there's no guarantee. They've already made lots of changes/updates since Xbox 1 launched.

            <p>Hello Kristakirk,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to figure out the root cause of the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model number of your computer and Display Adapter?</li><li>Did you make any recent changes on your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Have you tried to make primary monitor as secondary and vise-versa? </li><li>Are all the device drivers updated?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>If you have not tried to swap monitors then I would suggest you to try that and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>For changing the settings of dual monitors you can refer to the below links:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guided Help: Dual monitor setup is easy in Windows 7!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976064/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976064/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change display settings on multiple monitors</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/change-display-settings-on-multiple-monitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/change-display-settings-on-multiple-monitors</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This link is applicable for <strong>Windows 7</strong> also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue persists I would suggest you to update the <strong>Display drivers</strong>. As the display drivers for two monitors are not the same, so try to update them and check the status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype for Macbook</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been able to download and open Skype for Macbook since version 8. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using an old version 7, but that is no longer available, and Skype auto updated my app and now, well, I no longer can use Skype on my Macbook. All old versions available automatically download as the current version, so the option of finding an older
 version online, no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling, I've followed all sorts of tips and videos online, but nothing. I need this sorted out. I don't understand how this everyday app is unusable for Macbook users. And looking online, I'm not alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on 10.11.6 on my Mac, with current Quicktime 10.4. The Skype is 8.41.0. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype 7 versions worked for me, but I can no longer access the old version anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on for months, and I'm beyond frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            &#34;Use my Windows user account&#34; Wireless Sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have imaged a Dell Latitude E7480 with a corporate image of Windows 10 Fall Creator's Edition (1709) and I have it joined to our domain. Usually, when our users connect to the wireless there is a checkbox that says "use my windows user account" that they
 can check off and it will fill in the current user credentials of that person and sign them into the Corporate wireless. On the current imaged machines that box is grayed out, any suggestions as to how to get that box "ungrayed"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows Defender is antispyware and not antivirus. Many antivirus, which include antispyware,<br />
disable Windows Defender.<br />
<br />

Norton 360 often causes issues so I would uninstall it. You can't really disable it as it will still load<br />
pieces of itself into memory. Uninstall it and then run the Norton Removal Tool to prevent trouble<br />
causing remnants which can cause strange issues. Below are recommendations to use while
<br />
testing, even better permanently.<br />

<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 6.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 6.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />

<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />

    <title>Which sound card inputs will play through HDMI output&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasperdog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which sound card inputs will play through HDMI output&#63;</h2>
                    My question is this. Can I use the sound card mixer (sound card is a Diamond XS71 PCI and OS is Windows 8) to select which sound(s) is/are output through the HDMI port on my computer? The video card is an AMD Radeon R8. Or is it only possible to hear internally
 generated digital audio, such as from YouTube or video playback? The XS71 has both analog and digital (SPDIF) inputs. In the past I've found that Windows audio cannot mix analog with digital, so I assume that anything hooked up to, say, "line in" will not
 play through HDMI. However, in my case, the only sound card input I need to use is the SPDIF digital input. I also have a USB audio interface available (Behringer UCA222) which could be used instead of the Diamond sound card. Will either of these hookups work?

            <p>Hi Jasper, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows outputs sound to only one device at a time. Select the desired output device by setting the default device and then the sound changes to the correct devices as cables are connected or disconnected. When switching between the sound on the computer
 and the sound on an external monitor or TV, open the sound devices to ensure the correct output device is selected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the device has not been previously configured, when checking the sound properties, the ATI HDMI output does not display unless an HDMI cable is connected between an HDMI device and the HDMI port on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Depending on the Operating System installed and the type of sound chip being used, the images displayed in this document might differ from what you observe when following these instructions on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the steps below to configure the audio output when an HDMI cable is connected:</p>
<p><strong>a: </strong>Connect the HDMI cable to your computer and to your output device.</p>
<p><strong>b: </strong>Click the Start button, type sound in the Search field, and then select Sound from the list.</p>
<p>The Sound window opens.</p>
<p><strong>c: </strong>On the Playback tab, select Speakers and Headphones , and then click the Set Default button.</p>
<p>Sound window - Speakers and Headphones</p>
<p><strong>d: </strong>Select ATI HDMI Output to make HDMI the default sound playback device, and then click the Set Default button.
</p>
<p><strong>e: </strong>Right-click the ATI HDMI Output , and then select Show Disconnected Devices option. The HDMI cable must be connected when it is configured</p>
<p>
</p><p>To view all the available sound devices, right-click any device shown in the Sound window and select the Show Disabled Device and Show Disconnected Devices options.</p>

            <p>Indeed, I used the Behringer UCA-222 USB audio interface to connect my input source (a musical keyboard) and found that I could get HDMI sound on one of the video card ports, but not the other one. The video card is connected to a touchscreen monitor on
 one port and a video projector on the other, but I could only enable HDMI sound on the HDMI port furthest from the surface of the motherboard. Another HDMI interface appears in the list of "Playback Devices," but it is greyed out and can't be selected. Weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's still a problem though. There is a great deal of latency (&gt; 0.1s) between when a key is pressed on the keyboard and sound is heard in the speakers. I suspect this is caused by the encoding of audio into the HDMI video stream, and the decoding at
 the other end by a Denon receiver. So transmitting my keyboard sound over HDMI might not be possible after all, since playing with a sound delay is almost impossible. I'll try using "Direct playback" mode in the Denon receiver, which eliminates some audio
 processing delay.</p>

            "Direct" mode in Denon receiver was only slightly better, but still unusable. Same thing for "Game" sound modes. Next step is to see if there are any settings in the AMD Catalyst Control Center that can be tweaked

    <title>HDR setting in Windows 10 won&#39;t stay enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zonto1983  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDR setting in Windows 10 won&#39;t stay enabled</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased an HDR/4K-compatible graphics card (a GeForce 1080ti). I have a 4K HDR display (LG C7 65" OLED). When I first installed the card and drivers, the HDR option was turned on by default, and I was getting an HDR signal to the display. However,
 the resolution was set to 1920x1080. When I changed the resolution to 4K, HDR turned off. Since then, I have been unable to get HDR enabled again. When I try to enable HDR, the setting just turns itself off again, like so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://recordit.co/2Ez5fx2tEf</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not an issue with my display or receiver, as I'm able to get HDR out of my PS4 just fine, and I don't believe it to be an issue with my HDMI cable either, since I was getting HDR out of the PC when I first installed the card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what other steps to take. I ran dxdiag, and it appears that it's not detecting the full color range:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Display Color Space: DXGI_COLOR_SPACE_RGB_FULL_G22_NONE_P709 (as per this article:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4040263/windows-10-hdr-advanced-color-settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From that same article, it appears to be detecting the display as HDR compatible:</p>
<p>Monitor Advanced Color Capabilities: BT2020RGB BT2020YCC Eotf2084Supported AdvancedColorSupported&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Zonto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This usually happens when you are trying to enable HDR on a multi monitor setup, say a non-HDR monitor and your LG HDR TV. To resolve, make sure that the only connected display is/are the HDR-ready display/s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't resolve the issue, please check for the latest graphics driver update.</p>

<h3> nicolajbky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rode Podcaster Windows 10 - Distorted Windows Sounds through Microphone - Recording works fine.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought the Rode Podcaster and installed it on my Windows 10 machine. At first, it was working totally fine! I could record high quality sounds, I could hear myself and all Windows sounds (from Games, Videos and Skype calls) &nbsp;were absolutely clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But suddenly all sounds other than my own monitored voice, sound totally distorted! Even the "pling" when you change the system volume is super distorted. It sounds like Windows is sending a too loud sound stream to the Podcaster and the Podcaster is distroting
 it trying to reduce the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT DID I CHANGE? I realy checked everything, but I cannot find any option, that has an effect. Any advice please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I checked:</p>
<ul>
<li>I used another analog sound output from my PC, it works.&nbsp;</li><li>I tested two different sets of Headphones: the work</li><li>I changed every possible option in the sound options that are available under windows</li><li>I checked for the latest soundcard drivers for my MSI M3 Mainboard (although I think it has nothing to do with that)</li><li>I tried to find an updated version of the Rode Podcaster microphone driver, but I could find it</li><li>I used a System Restore Point from two days ago (I installed the mike today), but it didn't change anything</li><li>I deinstalled the driver manually and reinstalled it by plugging the mike out and in again, no change</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really appreciate any help from you guys!!!</p>

<h2>            Microphone on Headphones Not Detected &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have the Astro A10 Headphones, which come with a microphone.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have done a couple things to try and find the microphone, but it does not show up anywhere, as if the headphones don't have a microphone at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried looking in the Recording tab of Sound on the volume mixer (I clicked on Show Disabled/Disconnected devices).<br />
I've also tried looking in Device Manager under Audio Inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These headphones are in perfect working condition but the microphone on them is not detected at all. In fact, I've had this problem across all headphones that have a built-in microphone. They are never, ever, detected anywhere, on the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help... My laptop's built in microphone is good, but it picks up the sound of my keyboard and mouse, as well as generally everything, too loudly.</p>
<p>It would be much better to use my headphone's microphone.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sounds Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected and Connected for both Playback and Recording Default Devices.
<br />
<br />If not again right click Volume icon in System Tray to choose Troubleshoot sound problems.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.

<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I gave you many steps to force the headset microphone to show up.  They would take more than an hour to perform, plus the way a forums works is interactively so we don't just give up after the first post but use feedback about your results to suggest more steps.

<p>
</p><p>I checked if my microphone is working, plugging it into my controller which I can control the mic in the settings of the controller. And yes, the mic does indeed work. But I don't want to play with my controller all the time, so again, it would be great
 if my headset mic was actually detected.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I'm not trying to be mean (if I seem that way), I'm just trying to get you to understand that nothing at all has helped me. I've done many things, so I don't really understand why windows 10 is incapable of just simply detecting a mic built into a pair of
 headphones.&nbsp;</p>

            I don't blame you for being frustrated with him. A lot of these "advisors" and Microsoft employees here on this forum never read the text in the first post. It really seems like they just read the title half the time and try to get those sweet sweet "chosen
 solutions" (or w/e its called nowadays here). Its why I have stopped coming here for the most part for help and solutions. What's worst is they even try the lines like he did like "did you even try them?" after clearly stating you did before coming here. Its
 honestly downright infuriating, unprofessional and they should be held to a higher standard when helping other users.<br />
<br />
I know its been almost a month for you now. Odds are its 1 of 3 things at this point. Either there is a mute button on your headset you have overlooked, bad driver (with it plugged in, go to device manager, uninstall the headset's drivers (should be under audio
 inputs just like in the link he gave but this time we are removing it), uninstall it, restart your computer then plug it back in) or its faulty hardware. If you do choose the last resort then you'll want to return it and hopefully it is not too late to get
 a refund. Just to be on the safe side I would get a different make/model.

<h2>            Mscorsvw.exe using 50 &#37; of my CPU - Windows 7 Home SP1 - 64 bit</h2>
                    
<p>Today I downloaded and installed the windows update - Windows 7 SP1 for Windows 7 Home - 64 bit. Ever since it installed I noticed a high cpu usage. Via Task Manager I found out that for some unknown reason Mscorsvw.exe is using 50% of my cpu. I running
 a Intel Core 2 Duo E6700 Conroe 2.66GHz 4M shared L2 Cache LGA 775 65W Dual-Core Processor BX80557E6700.</p>
<p>How that this be fixed - short of uninstalling Windows 7 SP1?</p>

<div>This article should help to explain what the Mscorsvw.exe process is and how to stop it:</div>

<div><br />
<div>Type '<span>ngen.exe executequeueditems' in command prompt (click start, type cmd in search and hit enter, then copy and paste that command and press enter to stop the process)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>

<div><span>I</span>&nbsp;think I&nbsp;have waited an hour now, which is way to long; I have read the article that you have given. I updated Windows 7 yesterday. I had 29, At the 14th (NET update) I closed the computer and let it install what it needed. I installed the

            The reason why ngen is not working in your command prompt is because windows cant find the location of the executable file, which is actually located in .Net installation folder.
<div><br />
<div>A quick way to locate the folder would be to right click the process of the 64bit mscorsvw (the one in task manager without the *32 instance), and choose open file location.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ensure your cmd prompt is with admin privileges: you can hit cmd in the search bar and then right click on the located command prompt link and choose Run as Administrator.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After which, enter the location of the .Net framework file location (Default it should be &nbsp;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319, depending on your version number installed)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You will then have no issues running the line "ngen.exe executequeueditems".</div>
<div><br />

            umm i fixed countless of laptops...didnt matter if it were xp or windows 7, all i fixed help boost my pc and laptops all under 20-30secs even if my harddisk left with 1gb space...first thing when buying a laptop or desktop is to format it, clear all the
 junk things that the manufacturer (acer,dell, etc) installed, and install all the necessary things u need...instead of wasting $$ on buying new laptops, its wise to consult a friend or someone you know that can give u some good help, tips and advice....<br />

 Vision issue on the Vizio TV's I mentioned above, has been fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My TV now has Dolby Vision support on my Xbox One X. Check your Vizio TV's for the latest update if you haven't. I wanted to add my comment to the post above but that thread is locked, so I created a new discussion here to let everyone know.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Upgrading win10, error code  0x8007002c -0x4000d</h2>
                    <p>I am currently trying to install windows 10 and mid install my screen goes completely black. I gave it about 20 minutes and it did not recover so I restarted the PC to be reverted back to windows 7 and having to redownload the entire copy of Windows 10 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code is 0x8007002c -0x4000d. I cannot find anything on support or on google about this error code, It's like it never even existed. I need to find out what this code means so I can install and not have to redownload this for a 3rd time just to
 fail yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much help is appreciated! :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I am also using this link http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 to download Win10 because I cannot get the windows app to appear no matter what I do. IS that the OFFICIAL FULL windows 10 or is that the tech demo?

            I am having this same issue but my install did not time out it just stops at the configuration stage 75% and reverts back to my Windows 8.1 installation.&nbsp; I am making sure to install all my updates and will do a clean boot before attempting this again.&nbsp;
 Any additional guidance from Microsoft would be appreciated.

            <p>Greetings Joe!<br />
<br />
I had exactly the same error message, and was experiencing the issue on four of my systems. &nbsp;I found through a little sleuthing that my problem was due to my Antivirus solution.<br />
<br />
So I removed it and retried the process, it not only worked, but it worked in all four cases that were failing to install. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I decided to blog about it at my site, so <a href="http://www.inmymobileworld.com/2015/08/01/we-couldnt-install-windows-10-0x8007002c0x4000d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hit it up</a> if you'd like the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            My microsoft points are missing from my account&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So, I just upgraded to the xbox live family gold pack, which gives you 4 xbox live gold accounts for 12 months for $99. at this time, I had about 2300 microsoft points in my account. The next day, I am browsing the marketplace and i see a huge number of
 microsoft points on my account: 6100.<br />
<br />
i did a little research and found out that I got these points as a bonus for signing up for the family pack. so to be fair I transferred some to my brother's account. 1600 to be exact. leaving me with 4500.<br />
<br />
today, I get on and instead of having 4500 like i should, I only have 2320. so, i headed over to https://billing.microsoft.com and looked at my history. Instead of it showing that i ever had 6100 points, it says the max i ever had is 3920. and then it says
 i gave 1600 away leaving me with 2320.<br />
<br />
now i just received an email saying i transferred 1600 points from my account to my brothers and it says my new balance is 4500 points!&nbsp; However on my account it says i only have 2320 points...<br />
<br />
how do i fix this? it stole over 2000 microsoft points from me! like $30.<br />
<br />
i think im just gonna call 1800-4-my-xbox tomorrow when i get time, but has this ever happened to anyone else and how can this be fixed?</p>

<h2>            Win7 64bit OS in HP Pavilion Dv6. External Wi-Fi Adapter &#39;Problems&#39; Help&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Folks!</p>
<p>For the past 5 Months now I have been tring to find an External USB Wi-Fi Adapter that will work on the Laptop that is mentioned in the 'Title' of this post, with absolutely NO Success!</p>
<p>The reason for requiring this is that the majority of my interface with the Laptop is in what we in the UK call a Caravan in the USA it's called a Trailer or RV with no engine as it gets towed. Some very nice people call it a 'TinTent'!!</p>
<p>As the Caravan is made of Aluminium when the blinds are drawn on the windows it acts like a Faraday Cage through which NO Radio Signals can pass or if they do they are very weak, therefore the Built in Atheros Wi-Fi facility is next to useless, so sitting
 outside when it's raining is also not really an option!</p>
<p>I have so far tried 4 different makes of External USB Wi-Fi Adapter all of which 'Failed' to work even when the Internal Atheros was not only 'Switched off' by the 'Touch Button' on the keyboard but also by using the section "Change Adapter Settings'</p>
<p>The last Adapter that was tried was a Netgear that with the Win7 Driver from Netgear website was supposed to work with Win7 but not sure about the '64bit' as it was not mentioned, however first time it was installed the Laptop 'Blue Screened' with an error
 message pointing to the Atheros Internal WiFi Adapter as the culprit!</p>
<p>I am nearly at the point of taking this Laptop up a very tall building, attaching it to a large piece of paper shaped like a wing and seeing if it will fly, then going out and buying a Mac, but not of the Detective Columbo sort, as I am totally fed up, hacked
 off with this quite expensive piece of plastic with some electronics stuffed inside!</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>H</strong> </span>ugely <strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">P</span> </strong>roblematic Laptop has also been back to HP under warranty for 'repair' and came back as 'No Fault Found' but with a BIOS update that appears to have done nothing in resolving this problem!</p>
<p>Can anyone help please?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the links.</p>
<p>Whilst the item description does not mention Win7 it only mentions Vista the Downloads section says Vista 32/64bit &amp; Win7.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot find any mention of being <strong>"Windows Certified"</strong> for any of the Operating Systems mentioned and I was advised to look for 'Windows Certified' as Win7 64bit is a "New Animal".</p>
<p>The recommendation was also made as the previous first 3 Adapters claimed to work with Win7 and when found not to it was then establiched that they only work with the 32bit version and NOT the 64bit, so if it don't say<strong>"Win7 64bit Windows Certified"
</strong>sorry I don't want to know otherwise I end up with more grief and total frustration trying to get the dam thing to work when it will not!</p>

A range extender could help if you could find a place to put it...... maybe an rv closer to the signal source.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Slightly puzzled by the latest reply from Rob Brown?</p>
<p>Assuming you are advising me to hook the item on the 'Cantenna' website into a USB socket considering that the Built in/Internal Atheros Wi-Fi Adapter has it's own dedicated Antenna I am not sure this can be 'turned off' or re-routed via the 'Cantenna'?</p>
<p>On the question of 'Make your Own' I don't see a USB Cable or Adapter that I can plug into the Laptop, and I cannot really remove the Built in/Internal Atheros Wi-Fi Adapter out of the Laptop when it is plugged into the Motherboard?</p>
<p>Or are you as we say: "Just having a laugh"?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
For the Cantenna you should check with them for the appropriate method to connect it.<br />
It looks like the picture has a BNC connector which would connect to the antenna <br />
connection on a router to allow it to pick up from a greater range or even a range<br />
extender (also with a replaceable antenna). The connector might be modified however<br />
check with the company. A cantenna can also be built so it connects to the NIC in<br />
you computer.<br />
<br />
The 3rd link is just a collector and has no actual connection to the circuitry.<br />
<br />
The YouTube video is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Mainly these are methods to try to improve your range when trying to connect to WiFi<br />
since you are in a metal trailer/caravan.</p>

<p>Sorry it's NOT the range that is the 'problem'. I need an EXTERNAL Antenna to place outside.</p>
<p>Before I got this new laptop I used a Belkin G+MIMO in a Chinese Takeaway box that was waterproof and tie wraped to the roof rail on the caravan to get the Signal into my Old Compaq Laptop and it was fabulous even on low strength signals.</p>
<p>Now with this <strong>H</strong> ugely <strong>P</strong> roblematic HP 'Craptop' and the Atheros Wi-Fi adapter being built in, I have not been successful in finding an External USB Wi-Fi Adapter that will work in this in this very expensive piece of plastic
 with some electronics stuffed inside to get a signal! Currently my total is 4 different External Adapters tried and all 'failed'</p>
<p>The last External USB Wi-Fi Adapter I tried got 75% of the way to working, but looking back on the settings in the Zone Alarm Firewall now it looks like it was not allowed to connect through the Firewall however it does not resolve the 'Blue Screen' problem'
 during the installation of the Netgear Adapter when the Atheros really got out of its Pram!!!.</p>
<p>One further point in passing:</p>
<p>On the bottom of this 'Post' there is a 'tick' in the box that says "<strong>Alert me</strong> when someone responds to this post"</p>
<p>This facility does not currently work, so at the moment I have to spend some time scrolling through the recent posts to find mine to see if I have a reply! Maybe you know a man who can investigate this problem please or can 'phone a friend' but then again
 maybe my 'spaceship' is not the right one!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi<br />
<p>I know of at least dozen of adapters that are working very well with Win 7 x32 and x64.</p>
<p>As an example the adapter that I linked to above works well and it is only $15 + $3 ship.</p>
<p>If it does not work, the vendor will take it back and you probably will lose $5, which I doubt that is a huge amount of money even to someone on pension.</p>
<p>Whoever told you the certification story is Not very accurate in his advice.</p>
<p>Certification is done by Microsoft only if a vendor submits the device and its drivers to Microsoft.</p>
<p>Many vendors opt not to do so, but that does not mean that it does not work.</p>
<p>Actually, very few OEMs design and sell Wireless chipsets. Vendors of Wireless cards buy these chipsets and put it into the plastic boxes with their logo and customized software.</p>
<p>However, the drivers are based on the OEM drivers, and if a chipset is Compatible with Win 7 it does not matter, much what the vendor’s marketing ploy is.</p>
<p>If someone ask me to help with a system and the Wireless is Not certified I simply search a little to find out whether there are complaints from users that indicate troubles, if I do not find any none I do not insist on "throwing away the device.</p>
<p><strong>While I am glad that you finally solve the problem</strong> , I find your conclusions reflecting your frustration, rather than based on technological facts.</p>

<p><strong>Further to the responses above. It seems that Microsoft included something called "Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport" in the Win7 Operating System, well they did on this machine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sadly this 'feature/facility' has NOT worked correctly since it was introduced and was the cause for the last 5 Months of my not being able to get an External USB WiFi Adapter to work with this Laptop.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consequently whenever I tried to install a perfectly good WiFi Adapter that should have worked with this Laptop</strong><strong>"Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport" BLOCKED it!!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>How kind!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Having now re-installed the other Drivers for the built in&nbsp; Atheros(Wi-Fi) and Realtek (LAN) then got the Updated Driver for the</strong><strong>"Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport" I now have a Laptop that I can hang an External USB Wi-Fi Adapter off,
 while sitting inside</strong><strong>my 'Tin Tent' and connect to "Willy Wonkers Web" formally called the Internet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Incidentally the External USB Wi-Fi Adapter that I am currenly using is a Belkin G+MIMO v4001 (UK) and it's nearly as old as Noah's Ark.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 'problem' required 'Root Cause Analysis' and sadly the 'Quick Fix' that was kindly offered here would not have worked as I was just being offered another bunch of adapters and having tried 4 that I was advised did work with other machines it
 was pointless to spend yet more funds and find the same result at the end of the day with even more frustration and steam coming out of the ears!!!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interestingly the "Alert me</strong> when someone responds to this post" still doesn't work but I am using Mozilla Firefox and not IE, so maybe that also has not been tested fully by you know who.</p>

</p><p><span>The option, <strong>Mandatory profile</strong> has been there in older versions of Windows as well. It is a roaming profile pre-configured by an administrator to specify settings for users. Mandatory profile is very much similar to roaming profile.
 In a domain, wherever you go, you have access to your files and folders, but not your profile settings. Please refer to the link given below.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>NTuser.dat is a portion of the user profile where the registry settings are saved for that user.</span></p>
<p><span>When it is named .dat, any changes made by the user to desktop environment will be saved to user profile when the user logs out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>NTuser.man is same as NTuser.dat, but renamed manually to .man which makes it a mandatory profile. Any changes made to the mandatory profile won’t be saved when user logs out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Roaming profiles are protected from permanent change by renaming NTuser.dat to NTuser.man. Renaming the file to .dat makes the profile read-only, which means that Windows does not save any changes made to the profile when the user logs off.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Mandatory accounts are used in domain systems rather than the computers which are in workgroup. So, for further information and help with your query, please post your question on Microsoft

    <title>No video on mpg files WIndows 8 Media Player. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No video on mpg files WIndows 8 Media Player.</h2>
                    I have some video files that were converted from another format to mpg. They play perfectly on my WIndows 7 PC. I can use WMP and Movie Maker. I have a new PC with Windows 8. In either of those programs the videos play the sound only. No error messages.
 Don't know if I'm missing a CODEC or just what. Any thoughts?

            <p>It didn't work for my case.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ended up having to upgrade to the "Media Center Edition" and then everything worked fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a $9.00 upcharge.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess some people don't use Media Player, so they decided to break that out of the package.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
