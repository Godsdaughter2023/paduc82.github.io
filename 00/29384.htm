    <title>HP Scanjet 3770 Digital Flatbed Scanner - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HP Scanjet 3770 Digital Flatbed Scanner</h2>
                    Since I've bought a new PC with Windows 7, the software for HP Scanjet 3770 no longer worked.
<br />
I installed a Windows 7-compliant basic driver which only allows flatbed scanning of doc (single page only!).
<br />
I then purchased a software called VueScan<span> 9 x64 (Standard Edition version 9.0.48). This software allows full functionality with flatbed scanning but doesn't work with negative/transparency
 scanning. </span>VueScan support says: <span>"VueScan uses the HP driver to talk to the scanner,</span><span> and if the HP driver doesn't support the transparency adapter, then it won't work."<br />
<br />
What should I do now to get </span><span>negative/transparency scanning to work on SP Scanjet 3770 in Windows 7?<br />
Thank you.<br />

                    <p>Hello all,<br />
<br />
I went out for New Year Eve, had a wonderful time and took many pictures. Upon reviewing my pictures, I noticed that about half of my pics were showing a blank icon with a lightning bolt in the top center. I was very upset about this, but said to myself "well,
 at least I have half of my pictures". <br />
<br />
Then, yesterday, I took the SD card out of my phone and put it into a card reader and plugged it into my Windows 7 computer.<br />
Upon doing so, I got the message ".......Scan and Fix (recommended) with the option to continue or cancel. I chose continue and all my pictures were deleted from New Years Eve.<br />
<br />
I downloaded and tried&nbsp;12 different data recovery software and it only found files that I had already copied over; no files from New Years Eve
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fm.bestofmedia.com%2fsfp%2fimages%2fdesign%2fusr%2fsmilies%2ffrown.gif" />&nbsp;.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere that there might be a place where the pictures may be in a hidden file system area under a different file extension and that all I had to do was change the file extension and I would get my pictures back.<br />
<br />
Well, after a thorough search, I came up with no files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to look for CHK files in order to change the extension, but; much to my disappointment, no CHK files were visibly present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows of a way to restore my beautiful, priceless pictures from New Years Eve, I would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read about dirty bit, hidden partitions, chkdsk, clusters and more; some of which I am not knowledgeable enough to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a 64GB san disk card that was plugged into my Samsung Galaxy S4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much to anyone that can help a very sad person who's new year didn't start off the right way.

            <p>File recovery is not the exact science that it appears to be on crime scene TV. For forensic evidence purposes, only small amounts of evidence are required in many cases, nothing even close to full retrieval.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-reading the first paragraph of your original post.. </p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"Upon reviewing my pictures, I noticed that about half of my pics were showing a blank icon with a lightning bolt in the top center. I was very upset about this, but said to myself "well, at least I have half of my pictures".
</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>It would appear that the SD card failed while STILL in the phone. You were in trouble BEFORE removing the card and applying Windows 7 Scan and Fix, so it is a little unfair to blame Windows for the lack of photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not unknown for storage devices to fail and when they do, it is generally terminal. Placing a failed or failing drive in a computer other than the device in which the drive was originally formatted is always a dangerous business as there are slight
 differences in the way that a drive is formatted from one device to another..&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok, I will try a little longer, but thanks for your insight. I do feel that if&nbsp;I&nbsp;had only selected "continue" instead of "scan and fix",&nbsp;my pictures would have been there at least long enough for me to save them on my pc. This coincides with what I read
 on some other blogs/forums as well; hence the "blaming windows" part. I do agree though, that the pictures were probably already in trouble on the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The irony to this is that I can recover pictures that I took and deleted 6 months ago along with pictures that I haven't deleted, but, for some reason, I can't recover the files I took less than one month ago.</p>
<p>Maybe a bad sector of the card is to blame; who knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as I said, I'll try a little bit longer and if by some chance&nbsp;I do miraculously recover them, I'll be sure to follow up here.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Issues still exist with FFB racing wheels following -574 update.</h2>
                    
<p>The problems with force feedback racing wheels caused by the -572 update were not fully fixed by the -574 update.&nbsp; The Forzamotorsport.net thread located at
<a href="http://forums.forzamotorsport.net/forums/thread/5494946.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.forzamotorsport.net/forums/thread/5494946.aspx</a>&nbsp;is continuing to fill up with issue reports by people who have updated to the newer dashboard version.&nbsp; As for myself, I
 have experienced the following:</p>
<p>On Sunday the 24th of June, I started up my XBox for the first time in 2 weeks.&nbsp; It immediately
<br />
asked to down load the update.&nbsp; I declined, cleared the cash, and restarted the <br />
console.&nbsp; When the update was offered this time, I accepted it.&nbsp; After the <br />
installation was completed, I disconnected the handheld controller and re-bound <br />
the CSR wheel to the console, then I started up Forza.&nbsp; I started by running a rival match.</p>
<p>Everything seemed fine.&nbsp; I went into the event list and <br />
ran another race.&nbsp; My car seemed to drive perfectly <br />
through two heats.&nbsp; I moved on to another track, and in the first heat, the wheel felt
<br />
like it had only about half the normal feedback strength and the brakes were <br />
very touchy.&nbsp; I noticed that the on screen wheel showed only about half of the <br />
steering input I was using on the CSR.&nbsp; I stopped the race and rebooted the <br />
XBox.&nbsp; When I restarted the race, everything had returned to normal.&nbsp; I finished <br />
the race, and moved on to two others; everything seemed to operate <br />
as I would expect.</p>
<p>Last night I ran 4 races and in each experienced momentary loss of feedback, which recovered on it's own.&nbsp; In a fifth race, the wheel suddenly spun into a full lock to the left,&nbsp; which required a reboot of the XBox to recover from.</p>
<p>I have never experienced the loss of ffb before, so despite being able to <br />
recover from it, I will have to say things are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>not</strong></span> operating at 100%.&nbsp; My <br />
CSR rig is&nbsp; running the firmware it shipped with in February, whatever version <br />
that is. The XBox is a slim model with Kinect, less than a year old.&nbsp; The CSR wheel is only a couple of months old and had no, repeat no issues untill the installation of the update.</p>
<p>My experience is mirroring those of people using different models of Fanatec wheels, Microsoft Wireless Racing Wheels, and the new Mad Catz wireless ffb wheel.&nbsp; Please pass this up the support chain as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue, and I start my game the same way as the OP. </p>
<p>I have a CSR value firmware 737 that I never played until update 574 came out and it was fine until a few days ago.
</p>
<p>Ran a Rival's event and on lap 2 I lost FFB completely. I turned off the wheel and did a re-bind, and it was fine for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>Just tried to play again tonight, and on the 1st lap of a Event List race I lost FFB completely. Restarted the wheel only and it was fine until lap 4, then I lost FFB when turning right only.</p>

<p>Hi, my wheel is a CSR Elite with firmware 739 which worked perfect before the xbox update, have also tried firmware 742 with no luck.&nbsp;Same issues&nbsp;as other have said, FFB felt very inconsistent, and in long sweeping corners there is an occasional complete
 loss of FFB and after a few laps the FFB becomes weak, my ingame FFB setting is normally set to 78% now I am up to 95% to have the same effects. My dashboard is 2.0.15574.0</p>

<p>Same Problem here, I could not play Forza for several weeks because of a long time sickness. I am playing with Fanatec PWTS plus CSP. After the update, there is almost no FFB and the wheel feels woolly or spongy. No way to play forza that way. I really hope
 Microsoft will solve that, otherwise no need to have a MS licensed wheel. </p>

<p>I have tried firmware 742, 737 en 706 on my CSR Wheel and both updates affected my Wheel. It looks like my wheel is living his own live at the moment. When i turn right the wheel wants to turn left. Etc etc. Very weak FFB.</p>
<p>Still not happy with the last update. MS please fixe it. Thnx.</p>

<p>Same problem here with Microsoft wheel, loss of force feedback , feedback response on off while cornering, sometimes just pulls left or just wants to centre like in dashboard mode but stronger. Also sometimes losses all feedback.</p>
<p>Don't know if its related to this as well but it has a couple of times switched off also.</p>

<p>I have CSR with FW 737. Forza 4. Played 2 hours yesterday. Lap 7 of practise at Nurburg GP track and wheel locked to the right and and FFB was over powering. Reboot wheel and now it is all lame and feels like a rudder in water.</p>
<p>But it works perfectly on PS3 and GT5. Go figure?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Updates - No control - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sterod58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Updates - No control</h2>
                    <p>There are a few threads about the loss of control over updates in Win10, but no apparent fix from Microsoft.</p>
<p>With Win XP, Vista and 7, we had the option to check for updates, but then choose which ones and when to update.&nbsp; This gave us control over which updates to apply, as some were unnecessary for software, or especially some hardware where later drivers don't
 work as well.&nbsp; With a good antivirus package, I also do not need the enormous monthly malicious software tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I'm not the only one to want this option back.&nbsp; The more people that say me too, perhaps Microsoft might listen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, when set to a metered connection, I've been offered the choice to download some Office updates, but the file size is not given.&nbsp; So how am I supposed to make that choice?&nbsp; We need file sizes too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen the registry fix, but this then requires me to regularly check for updates.&nbsp; The previous situation where Windows checks and advises is much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, give it back.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>You do have a little control over updates. Use the store app for controlling office app updates. Disable get updates from more then one place in settings choose how updates are delivered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My opinion you don't need a good antivirus tool with Defender and malicious software removal&nbsp;tool.</p>

            <p>Turning off Apps updates is of little value as I have no Apps running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solutions presented for editing the registry do not appear to work.&nbsp; I have followed the instructions, but Windows is ignoring the changes.&nbsp; Perhaps Microsoft have sussed the hack and prevented it from working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So still no change.&nbsp; What this needs is Microsoft to give us back the options as found in XP, Vista and 7.</p>

<p>Thank Jordan for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This issuse came about after a standard windows update. Unfortunely the only usage on my disk was under the the "system" proccess and I am unable to do any deeper research. I have ran various malware detection softwares and did come up with one
 piece of adware. After I removed the adware my sistem ran fine for about 10 minutes then went high disk on the "System" process. i have check the task scheduler for timed tasks and triggered tasks and came up with nothing. I have Windows 10 64-bit Home installed.
 it might be worth saying that this high disk usage only when I am at near idle aswell. Taxing my machine seems to impove its performance (i.e. multitasking, gaming, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same problem, and in the Resource Monitor I can see all kinds of stuff when selecting the System process in disk usage: search indexer, cortana, .dat files. Right now I’m running a virus scan but im pretty sure that’s not it. I’ve tried disabling
 everything from Search, Superfetch, BITS and I have latest drivers too.</p>

            Task Manager is. But CPU usage isn not the problem, it’s disk usage. I can’t get it to go below 100% and it gets worst by the hour.&nbsp;

<p>I also disabled password and everything worked OK, but then my PC is insecure, so I enabled password and now I'm somehow coping with restarting 2 times and not using sleep mode anymore...</p>

    <title>Unknown app preventing Windows 10 shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drgnhrt968  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown app preventing Windows 10 shutdown</h2>
                    <p>The app looks like a pipe or a snake on a blue background. It has not name. When I try to shut down a message pops up with the app icon that says: This app is preventing shutdown. I can't find the icon/symbol in the Apps &amp; Features settings. If I walk away
 before I see this message pop up, my computer does not shut down and it goes back to my desktop. I need to click "Shut down anyway" in order to bypass this, otherwise it goes back to my desktop screen. I would like to know how to get rid of this problem. Here
 is a link to the photo I took of the shutdown screen:&nbsp;https://photos.app.goo.gl/LvDm6bRzMjBYxQzC2&nbsp;</p>

            Hi.  I'm Greg, a volunteer and eight year Windows MVP who will try to help you.
<br />
<br />If you can't find the program open that's it's referencing at Shut Down, refer to Step 4 in the Windows 10 Performance and Install Integrity Checklist to turn off all the freeloaders that sneak into Startup.  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Nothing needs to start with Windows except Windows, except for a sync, unless you absolutely can't wait to start it yourself.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a problem with one of the features in iTunes that can cause this problem...</p>
<p>The solution is to in stall the newest "GEAR" drivers...&nbsp;There are others as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gearsoftware.com/support/drivers.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff"><span>http://www.gearsoftware.com/support/drivers.php</span></font></font></u></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can look in the registry for UPPER and LOWER FILTERS at this key...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e965-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The filters will be listed on the right side after clinking on the key...</p>
<p>Anything listed there is a potential problem, but all filters don't cause a problem...only some...</p>
<p>Deleting the filter will usually fix the problem, but may cause one of your programs to not work properly...
</p>
<p>You can usually do a Bing or Google search for the file in the filter, and identify which program it goes with...</p>
<p>Then try updating the program... As a last resort, delete it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALSO... </p>
<p>If the drive doesn't even show up in Device Manager, then you need to try this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Run Command Prompt as an Administrator. Hover your pointer over the lower left corner, and right click when "Start" pops up. It will be on the list that opens.</p>
<p>2. Type or Copy and Paste following and hit enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0" /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Type Exit and hit Enter</p>
<p>4. Reboot the system.</p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>You have mentioned that the driver installation program didn’t work. This could be caused if the driver file is corrupted

</p><p>I just want to play solitaire, not connect to the cloud, NOT run an app. Just have an icon that I can play cards.&nbsp; Download the software to my PC and not have to connect with Microsoft.&nbsp; Is that possible?</p>
<p>I have wasted several hours of my life on Windows 10, and it keeps getting worse and worse.</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />The first thing I would suggest to do is to reset the microsoft store app. I know you tried reinstalling. But that does not always clear the cache or settings for the app, whereas this should.
<br />
<br />To do this you can:
<br />Open settings &gt;apps
<br />Search for "Microsoft store" and select it
<br />Click advanced options
<br />Then click "reset"
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Are there any updates you can install for Windows? You could see if a new update will fix the issue. 
<br />
<br />You could also open an elevated command prompt and run this command:
<br />wsreset.exe
<br />Wait for the command to finish then restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Would you be able to upload a screenshot of the error you see?
<br />
<br />
<br />You could also make sure that UAC (user account control) is enabled. To do this you can search for "Change user account control settings" in windows start menu. Then make sure that the slider is not at the very bottom level.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer and check again.

            Hi,  Jenny105
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode with network function.
<br />To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />After you enter Safe Mode try to update your network drivers and then try to enter Normal Mode
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.       
        </p>

<p>PS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; steps to&nbsp;</p>
<p>update network drivers</p>
<p>and where to find Normal mode.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is no denigration to you personally as it is how you are trained by MS but the MS help agents do not understand that many people who use MS do not have a working knowledge of its settings and features. Especially Win 10 which threw all my knowledge
 out of the window.</p>
<p>I get more help from basic steps 02 community members. They understand the need for full, simple steps and explanations</p>
<p>Please pass this message to MS trainers and as high up the line as possible</p>
<p>I am now sorry I never took the trouble and the extra money to start with APPLE.</p>

<p>OK thanks &nbsp; .I will have to start from where I am now. The above was not followed because</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sign in on laptop</span> -&nbsp; I recalled the old password which fits the hint shown on the screen on the laptop.</p>
<p>I can sign in with this&nbsp; and with the old image . Either option. I cannot sign in with my Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>However to sign into Microsoft Account once signed in onscreen and to view the responses . I have to use the password I created online, that is the very latest password for which I received a conformation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you explain&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&nbsp; why I cannot sign in with latest password I created online for Microsoft account</p>
<p>2 &nbsp; why I need to sign in with an old password at start up.&nbsp; Why not the latest password?</p>
