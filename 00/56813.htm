<h2>            File explorer not responding in windows 10 when trying to open files in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new laptop with windows 10 and a 30 day trial office 2016.</p>
<p>For the past week since I got this computer everything was working great, but today I tried opening a WORD file through file explorer in my documents and the thing just freezes and says "Not responding".</p>
<p>I tried restarting the PC but it doesn't help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to system conflict or corrupted system files. Have you made any relevant changes on your device prior to the issue? Did you encounter any error messages?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step, we suggest that you open Word in safe mode and check if the issue reoccurs. If everything works fine, it's possible that an add-in may be causing the issue. You may need to disable and enable each add-on until the problem
 is identified. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Use one of these methods to start an Office application in Office Safe Mode on a Windows PC:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Find the shortcut icon for your Office application.</li><li>Press and hold the CTRL key and double-click the application shortcut.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in Safe Mode.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the steps above doesn't resolve the issue, we'd recommend performing a clean boot in Windows to isolate software conflicts on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. In the clean boot environment, check if the issue persists. The link will also provide steps to isolate
 the possible cause of the issue. Once you're done troubleshooting, check the How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting section to revert your device to normal boot.
</p>

<p>Hi Ive had a similar problem and found the file explorer would not respond at all for anything not just word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that file explorer is overloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/. Open Control Panel (or type it in the search box to bring it up)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/. Click on File folder options</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the General tab down the bottom you will see (Clear file explorer history)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3/. select CLEAR</p>
<p>
</p><p>4/. OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exit and now try opening file explorer again, it should be working normally again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple solution to an annoying windows problem. This worked for me</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want CC Cleaner clears this as part of its clean. but you don't need it.</p>

            This is the answer to the problem. It's not Word that is causing the problem, it is File Explorer. Specifically, I think it's the Quick Access function within File Explorer.

<p>Brilliant db176 thanks very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I followed your advice I found a workaround in that I could at least open Word and XL files from the appropriate Office application rather than using File Explorer.</p>

<p>When i open Windows Explorer (My Documents, Downloads, etc.) I can click on any files other than Word as it locks the screen up and states Not Responding in the title bar...</p>

<p>I'm having this same issue. And not just on Office files. I can select down through the folder hierarchy, but when I get to the file I want to open and double-click it, it hangs and finally gives the NOT RESPONDING error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've cleaned the folder options as well. The only thing that works temporarily for me is to reboot the machine.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            NHL18 won&#39;t load</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please help me! I login this morning to NHL18 on my Xbox One and when it get to the start screen (where David's picture showing) I saw a message that says NHL18 couldn't load my profile. I tried retry and it still couldn't load my profile. Then I shutdown my console and try a few minutes later and it still will not load. Anyone have any suggestion or workarounds? I put a lot of time into this game and I hate to see it erased like that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please can&nbsp;anyone help?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your help</p>

            <p>My brand new Toshiba laptop with Windows 8&nbsp;woke up one morning with none of the apps loading, including MS Office. I am strictly an end user that does not tinker or upgrade things for fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 trouble shooting came up with this error. In reading the Microsoft community boards, I found that most of the posted solutions were over my head. Just as I was about to turn my new laptop into a rectangular Frisbee, I found a post not only directing
 me to the Intel website, but to the exact driver I needed. A HUGE thanks to the person, because after a PC refresh, Windows&nbsp;update, Apps Store update failed, and unable to understand the other solutions posted, &nbsp;it worked.

<p>Does anyone have a list of Games that can play local single unit multiplayer?</p>
<p>I have NHL 2k15 and Minecraft &nbsp;and they can do it.</p>
<p>I would assume that any of the Sports games can do local multiplayer</p>

<p>I was just looking for some other games that my kids can together with friends when they come over.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>I've got a friend that has purchased an XBOX One and we're looking for some games to play together, a quick search of this subreddit brings up a
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1pz2fw/list_of_local_coop_games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
few</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1wughj/any_local_coop_games_to_look_forward_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
earlier</a> mentions of this but I've yet to find an actual list (except for <a href="http://www.co-optimus.com/system/5/xboxone.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> one with a whopping 6 titles on split screen co-op). Does anyone have a list of local cooperative games, split screen or perhaps even turned based?</p>
<p>I'd be very grateful.</p>
<p>Fure future interest, I'll compile a list of suggestions here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rayman Legends</p>
</li><li>
<p>Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare</p>
</li><li>
<p>Diablo III</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: I am not an XBOX One owner and I haven't played the largest part of these games, I add them to the list because I'm told they have multiplayer, please do further research before actually buying any of these for co-op purposes.<br />

<p>The Co-Optimus Prime website is a pretty good resource for info about co-op games. You can search for games by system and look for what they call "couch co-op" which is local multiplayer:</p>

<p>"Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition" is an excellent game.</p>
<p>It's local co-op that doesn't involve a split screen and works really well.</p>
<p>On the ONE your kids can have their own profiles meaning that they can save their own characters as they develop as well.</p>
<p>It's my wife's favourite game and one of my top favourites as well.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 screen blinks and on battery freezes while computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 screen blinks and on battery freezes while computer keeps processing</h2>
                    <p>Since mid October '17 the screen of my Surface Pro 3 started disfunctioning:</p>
<p>The surface pro touch screen blinks or sometimes just 1 horizontal line in the screen isn't working very shortly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is much worse when working on battery. When working on battery the screen finally freezes leaving you no other choice than switching of the device and re-enter it. The freezing only happens on battery and has never occurred when wired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the screen freezes. The computer keeps on computing correctly. e.g. when viewing a film, the sound continues. When attaching the frozen surface to an external screen, the external screen works fine, no problem at all. The blinking or freezing of the
 screen also only happens on the surface screen. The external screen always works fine and is stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first installed the latest driver updates from the micorsoft website (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826</a>) But that
 didn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to return to the previous recovery point. (I received a Microsoft update on Oct. 18 2017, surprisingly close to the first appearance of the problem isn't is. I can't proof that it has started this update, but I'm convinced it has) But the recovery
 didn't work, so desperate I decided to reïnstall my Surface from scratch. Now it's again up to date to the latest Microsoft Update and freeed from any legacy, but not from my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm convinced that the problem is caused by a firmware or driver problem since the problem is a significantly worse when on battery, and when frozen the screen is still showing a very clear image, only still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seached the internet for sollutions, but nothing.... even no recent posts. Has anybody experienced the same issue recently and more importantly found the sollution?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I Hi Mr Avi, many thanks to you for the unending support...would not had been possible without your unending support</p>
<p>
</p><p>First was to create the recovery using USB (16GB)</p>
<p>THEN ensure you enable USB-SSD by clicking POWER ON + VOL DOWN</p>
<p>after inserting the recovery usb...make the power on + Vol up..automatically gives the page for recovery process</p>
<p>After this process my screen went dark after displaying "Surface" I had to download the windows 10 recovery on new usb then transfer to surface
</p>
<p>Done</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Mr.Avi once again...you made me believe in Microsoft once again GOD Bless you once again...again...Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have faced the same problem as you:</p>
<blockquote><span>I tried to resetting my laptop. I choose resetting all my drive and then it stuck when it shows "Resetting this PC 99%". I tried to wait for about 10 hours but nothings happen. What should I do? SHould I wait longer??</span>

<p>
</p><p>And because it's been a couple of days since you posted this, I was wondering what happened next? Did you wait more and if so did the resetting process complete? Or if you found any other solutions?</p>

            I reset two Windows 10 (with Fall Creators Update) last night with one finished. The other one is stuck at 99% for 20hours now under my suspicion of having 1.5% bad sectors. I don't know how much longer I should wait before I hit the power button to shut
 down. I just want to reset it because I want to trade in my older Dell laptops in time for a new one during the holidays. Hope Microsoft could come to the rescue. Thanks,

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update stuck at Windows logo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caprianupam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update stuck at Windows logo</h2>
                    I had Windows 10 version 1511 installed on my computer already.<br />
<br />
Today, the Windows 10 Anniversary Update arrived via Windows Update. It downloaded fine. After the restart, the Windows Update configured without problems to 100%.<br />
<br />
During the installation after 71%, the computer restarted, and the blue Windows logo came up, with the dotted spinning circle below, and it got stuck at this screen. The dotted circle just keeps spinning. There is no hard drive activity at all.<br />
<br />
I waited for about 45 mins first, and then I restarted the system via hard boot by pressing the power button for a few seconds. When it restarted, there was a message shown that "Recovering installation", after which it restarted and again got stuck at the
 same screen as above.<br />
<br />
I again restarted manually after a while, and this time the message was "Restoring previous version of Windows", after which Windows 10 version 1511 was restored. So, that was good.<br />
<br />
After that, to avoid any problems, I uninstalled Avast free antivirus, and other unnecessary programs. I also uninstalled disk imaging software like Paragon Backup &amp; Recovery, Macrium Reflect free, and Aomei Backupper, just to be safe, since I saw some kind
 of error regarding Paragon software in the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
I let the Anniversary Update download again, and again, same thing happened... after installation at 71%, the computer restarted and it is stuck again at the same screen with Windows logo and dotted circle spinning.<br />
<br />
What can be the problem, and how do I resolve this?<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can find out what is causing this problem?<br />
<br />
If no solution is offered, I have two alternatives... one is to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update manually, using the Windows 10 AU ISO, which I had downloaded via the media creation tool.<br />
<br />
If that fails too, then I think I will have to go for a clean install.<br />
<br />
Please offer your valuable advice.<br />
<br />
I am letting the desktop be at the same screen, and I will see what happens, in case it does something, but I don't have much hope, since there is zero hard drive activity. If there was any activity, means it was doing something, and I would have no problem
 waiting. But, there is no activity at all. No clue what's causing this.

            <p>I am glad to post that I was successfully able to update to Windows 10 Anniversary Update.<br />
<br />
Today, I tried upgrading via the Windows 10 AU ISO, and it failed again at the same point. I again reverted back to the previous version of Windows, but fortunately this time, on booting to the desktop, there was a Window with the error code, and error message.
 The error was:<br />
<br />
0xC1900101-0x40017<br />
This installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during BOOT operation.<br />
<br />
I searched for this error, and found that it can occur due to driver issue.<br />
<br />
I had drivers for LAN card and audio installed from Windows 8.1. There were new drivers for Windows 10 for my motherboard, which I might, or might not have installed earlier, I don't remember. Anyways, I uninstalled these two drivers again, and installed them
 again. I also installed the driver for chipset again.<br />
<br />
During Windows Update, driver for display was installed from the update. These always installed from Windows Update even when I uninstalled them. This time I had already disconnected the PC from the internet, so that it did not download the AU update again.
 So, taking advantage of that, I uninstalled the display driver, and installed it again for my motherboard from the vendor.<br />
<br />
I also uninstalled software like Sandboxie and TimeFreeze this time.<br />
<br />
I don't know what did the trick from above, but something did work, and this time the upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update was successful. I couldn't believe it. I was thinking I might have to do a clean install. But fortunately, it worked this time. And
 I am glad it did, because I was getting a bit frustrated.<br />
<br />
I had a feeling some driver might be the issue, but I wasn't sure. Atleast the error message gave me some clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this experience of mine helps someone with the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a bit disappointed with the help provided here though.</p>

            I found out the reason for the issue during the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.<br />
<br />
Today, I was updating my laptop, and it faced the same problem too, as my desktop.<br />
<br />
I again reverted back to previous version and uninstalled Toolwiz TimeFreeze free, as I was suspecting it might be the culprit. I was right. After that, laptop successfully updated to Windows 10 AU.

<h2>            Surface pro 3 black screen after reset</h2>
                    Hi, With apologies for not spotting that this has been answered elsewhere in the forum (if it has), please could I put the following question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having reset windows 10 this morning (keeping files) on my surface pro 3, I am now unable to access the machine
 - save for putting in my password/pin code.&nbsp; The welcome screen appears, but then, after a short while (perhaps 10 seconds), the screen goes black.&nbsp; I can switch off by pressing and holding the power button, but other than that cannot interact with the machine
 at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Has anyone met this problem before and, if so, please could you advise?&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            Most desktop icons become generic white page in Windows 10 shortly after startup</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Envy laptop that was upgraded to Windows 10 about 5 months ago. Recently (last couple of weeks) the desktop icons for most things have begun changing to generic white pages. Here is a screenshot.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The thing is, the regular icons show up briefly (&lt;30 seconds) and then switch. The shortcut icons still connect with the file.</p>

            <div>Hello Charles,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I realize your concern.&nbsp;Let me help you with this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to try rebuilding the icon cache by following the steps below and check if it helps.</div>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R </strong>to open the run command.</p>
<div>2. Type <strong>CMD</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</div>
<div>3. Paste the command and press enter after each command.</div>
&nbsp; <strong>ie4uinit.exe -show </strong>
<div><strong>&nbsp;taskkill /IM explorer.exe /F </strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;DEL /A /Q "%localappdata%\IconCache.db" </strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;DEL /A /F /Q "%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\iconcache*"</strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;shutdown /r /f /t 00</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The last command will restart the computer. Close any programs that are running before you initiate the commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, suggest you to perform SFC scan. Refer the below article on
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system </strong>
files . </p>

<h2>            Stuck on &#34;Preparing Windows&#34;</h2>
                    I had a little trouble. I tried to install Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, and it always got stuck when the installation was nearly complete. Today I was uninstalling all the versions because I was trying to reinstall them. When I was uninstalling the 2008
 version, it became stuck again. I used Task Manager to stop the process and it was removed from application list. Then, I restarted the computer. When I turned it on again, the "Preparing Windows. Do not turn off your computer." screen appeared and it's been
 there for 2hrs already. I'm waiting, if it will do something or the battery will go off. Does it mean I lost all my files? Can I get them back somehow? Is there any solution?

<p>
</p><p>I wonder if its something to do with only having a local (admin obviously) account and not a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original local profile came back after 2 or 3 reboots; also swapped wifi adapter for ethernet cable at boot up but I'm sure this was a red-herring AND at the same time tried a Startup Repair (strangely the latter asked for keyboard language BUT both
 mouse and keyboard USB devices were inoperable; so I did a hard reboot - held power button down for 5seconds - perhaps THAT did it !?!?!)</p>

<h2>            Audio Issue - No speakers or headphones are plugged in</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
Yesterday morning, when I turned on my PC there was a red mark with a cross at the center of it and hovering it it read "No speakers or headphones are plugged in".</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned no update has been carried out.</p>
<p>If I click on it the troubleshooters opens, I select Realtek High Definition Audio and then it says:&nbsp;<strong>Audio services not responding</strong></p>
<p>This is the full report of the troubleshooter:&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Andrea,<br />
<br />
There are many possible reasons why this issue is happening. To help resolve the issue, we suggest running the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">audio troubleshooter</a></strong>. This tool might be able to fix audio issues automatically.<br />
<br />
Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.

<p>What I posted previously are the result of the audio troubleshooter of the system<br />
The one of the link you shared doesn't open, it says:&nbsp;<em>An error occurred while troubleshooting. Something is preventing the troubleshooter from starting</em><br />
</p>
<p>I'm also experiencing other issues, don't know if it may be related:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I try to check for updates it says:&nbsp;<em>We couldn't connect to the update service. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet</em>. But as you can see I'm using this PC to write
 this question, so it's not the case that I'm not connected.&nbsp;<br />
I've ran the Update troubleshooter and it says that there were some updates pending, so I applied the fixes but if I open up the troubleshooter again it keeps telling the same thing, fixing nothing</li><li>When I try to open the store It says: <em>The store needs to be online. It looks like you're not.</em><br />
I've ran the App troubleshooter and it said it could have been the cache, so I applied the fixes but nothing was fixed</li><li>The Spotify Windows App stopped working, so I wanted to install the one from the Windows Store, and that's how I find out it's not working</li></ul>

<p>Corrupted system files are one of the possible reason why this issue happening. Let's try running the System File Checker and DISM tools to help find and repair any corrupted filed. Check out the link below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Checker tool (SFC)</a><br />
System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DISM or System Update Readiness tool</a><br />
DISM checks Windows updates and service packs may fail to install if there are corruption errors.</p>

<p>This is what I got from the tools</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SFC: <em>"</em></strong><em>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations</em>"</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Update Troubleshooter</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;I tried troubleshooting as an Administrator Windows Update but it says:&nbsp;<em>"An unexpected error has occured. The troubleshooting wizard can't continue</em>",&nbsp;<strong>error code:&nbsp;</strong><em><span>0x803C0103</span></em><br />
I also tried to troubleshoot the&nbsp;<em>Background Intelligent Transfer Service&nbsp;</em>but the same thing happens</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Update: </strong>The site suggested to update manually to the latest KB available (compatible with the Windows 10 version) but once I launched it it said:&nbsp;<em>"The update is not applicable to your computer"</em></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>DISM: </strong>Gave me this <strong>error</strong>: <em>0x800f0906</em>,
<em>the source file cannot be downloaded</em> so I downloaded a Windows 10 iso image and used DISM pointing to its
<em>source/install.esd&nbsp;</em>but it says&nbsp;<strong>error</strong>: <em>0x800f081f </em>
<em>The sources file could not be found</em></li><li>I also tried to use the <em>Recovery</em> tool but this is what I get if i try to open it :<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e4b415b-fdd0-44fb-a314-ac103eba987f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e4b415b-fdd0-44fb-a314-ac103eba987f" /></a><br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I think that this will end with me resetting my PC, another time ...<br />
If you think of something that I could let me know, but I think it'll be quicker to reset the OS than try to fix it</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 update not working, won&#39;t download</h2>
                    I bought a refurbished windows 8 computer and am trying to install updates for the first time. Windows Update will sometimes recognize that there are ~180 updates to download, but will always say 0% downloaded, and will just wait there and never update.
 I have run the windows updater troubleshooting tool, and I have no additional software on the computer. Nothing seems to help.<br />

            Hi edspyhill01_844,<br />
<br />
<br />
You can rectify this issue by creating a new user profile. The steps are found on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. After creating a new user profile, you can remove the incorrectly spelled user folder after transferring the files by following these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Press Windows + X keys on the keyboard then select Control Panel.<br />
2. Select System and Security then System.<br />
3. Click Advanced System Settings.<br />
4. Under User Profiles, click Settings.<br />
5. Select the profile you want to copy.<br />
6. Click Copy to, and then enter the name of, or browse to, the profile you want to overwrite. This will usually be in C:\Users\username, where username is the name of the profile to which you are copying.<br />
7. Click Permitted to use, and then add all user accounts to which you want to give full profile control.<br />
8. Click OK.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Windows 10 has changed the add user process. &nbsp;I tried to add a user but the process asked for an email address. &nbsp;I entered a unique email address, then went to that email account and accepted the invitation. &nbsp;I went back to Windows but Windows would not
 allow me to complete the acceptance of the new user. &nbsp;I tried to complete the process 3 times. &nbsp;The whole add user process has been completely redone and made ridiculously complicated.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Reinstall on UEFI&#47;GPT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> name to runaway from fast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Reinstall on UEFI&#47;GPT</h2>
                    As a continuation of my two previous questions,<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/windows-8-clean-reinstallation-using-iso/3221e205-b059-4980-9c11-82aab4dd27b6<br />

http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/reset-for-clean-install-with-multiple-drives/8a744d0c-9d21-451f-9df8-0f82932549d9<br />
<br />
, I'll be using either a DVD or USB with the appropriate Windows 8 Core installation files to clean reinstall my current system.<br />
<br />
However, I noticed that the motherboard uses UEFI and the internal SSD uses GPT. From what I've picked up, it's not entirely hassle-free compared to doing it with BIOS &amp; MBR.<br />
<br />
Am I correct in my assessment that for a USB to boot from UEFI, it needs to be formatted to FAT32 before the installation files are inserted and in the UEFI(BIOS) menu, UEFI Boot &amp; Secure Boot needs to be enabled, whereafter I can boot from the USB using the
 boot menu that's accessed through F11 during the system's startup?<br />
<br />
What sort of steps do I need to take if I want to boot from a DVD? <br />
<br />
Will the installation itself let me chose between GPT and MBR for the SSD, and if so, would choosing MBR make future tweaking and troubleshooting easier? (The SSD is only at 128GB, so I don't really need the extra storage support.)<br />
<br />
Is there anything else I should keep in mind?<br />

<br />
It <i>seems </i>to be applicable to my situation. I'll be following its instructions to confirm that, so the question will stay unanswered until then.

If the issue persists, try removing any memory devices attached to the console, to see if the same thing happens then. If removing memory devices doesn't do the trick, either, then the console will need a repair. You can set one up

    <title>how to log on as administrator in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e045006  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to log on as administrator in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Based on the discussion, it looks like there may not be an answer to this, but I'll try again anyway.&nbsp; My question is how to log on as an administrator so that I can delete a program file, in this case McAfee, which is giving me a never-ending popup message
 telling me that my 30-day free trial period has ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the good old days of Windows 7, the first screen that came up would have icons for each of my family members and also an icon for administrator.&nbsp; It was so easy....</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, it appears that I am considered the administrator but when I try to delete McAfee from the program files folder, I get an error message saying administrative rights are required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does one log in as administrator in Windows 10?&nbsp; I have a vague memory of setting up the administrator log in when I first bought my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help anyone can provide.</p>

            Sending response to most of your questions. The Smilebox problems are going to take awhile to gather info. I'll send those later.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I'm not a computer expert, so I don't know all the jargon...<br />
<br />
I have: Windows 7 Home Premium ...service pack 1<br />
<br />
Hewit Packard...HP Pavilion dv6 Notebook PC<br />
<br />
I don't recall installing any programs prior to the probelms with Smilebox <em>but</em> often Microsoft automatically updates my computer when I shut it down. I forgot to mention that another thing I did was go back to around the time the problems started and
 I unistalled any programs that were added around that time.
<div>The only way I know to describe the Help and Support I'm referring to is that when my computer comes on, there are programs listed on a menu that comes up when I click on the little logo on the very far left bottom of my computer. One of those
 is Help and Support. When I click that, a box comes up in the right side of my computer. At the top left corner is a blue question mark and next to it it says Windows Help and Support. Inside the box with a black back ground, it say HP...HP Help and Support.
 Then there are different options to choose from, i.e.Maintain, Troubleshoot, Learn, Get Help and Assistance. When I click any of those, (don't know if this is an error code or not) I get a message that "HP Support Assistant has stopped working." The message
 is in a little while box and then it says, "Windows is checking for a solution to the problem" and there a green line that starts moving across the box. The it just shuts off and nothing else happens. I don't know how else to descripe what i'm referring to.&nbsp;
 This is the best I can do.&nbsp; Hope it helps.&nbsp; Will gather the info on the Smilebox's many problems and respond with those when I am done.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>SMILEBOX ISSUES:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smilebox allows one to make photoshows with pictures, videos and music. You can burn them to dvd's and/or email them to friends and family.</p>
<div>One of the issues that has recently surfaced is the inability to send the photoshow. It uploads before it is sent and what happens is it uploads to 90 per cent and then stops.</div>
<div>The other major issue is being able to use the dvd maker. After the photoshow is completed and I am ready to burn dvd, the show is previewed. When I watch the preview, everything is great. The next thing that has to be done is to click the record
 button (when the show is recorded, you can then either save the file or burn a dvd). Well, when it starts recording the videos (that were good in the preview) sound so bad I can't use the photoshow. Like I said, these issues are recent and I had this program
 for a year and a half with absolutely no problems at all.</div>

            <p>Very frustrating.&nbsp; Wish I had an answer.&nbsp; What I ended up doing is a system restore which brought me back to the original factory condition of my PC.&nbsp; BUT it took 14 hours of backing up my info onto 12 disks.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I tried to upload disks
 9 through 11, the system won't allow me to do it and I lost my Kaspersky software and other things I need.&nbsp; Am check with HP support on what to do.&nbsp; I no longer get the message that HP Support Assistant has stopped working BUT I wouldn't recommend doing what
 I did in following the solution that was recommended to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I get any help from HP regarding this, I'll share it with you.</p>
