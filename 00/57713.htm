<h2>            Runtime error 70 when trying to open folders in the desktop</h2>
                    <p>Original title: runtime error 70</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep getting this error every time I try to open folders in the desktop. The folders do open eventually but the subfolders in those folders cannot be opened. Even when you run the folder as an administrator, the subfolders don't open. I have tried everything
 from opening the main folder as an administrator to cleaning the registry. I had my computer reformatted but only drive C. The folders were copied from Drive D (which was not reformatted) to the desktop.

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><span>What is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A runtime error is a software or hardware problem that prevents a program from working correctly. Runtime errors might cause you to lose information
 in the file you're working on, cause errors in the file (corrupt the file) so you can't work with it, or prevent you from using a feature. Unlike stop errors, runtime errors don't typically cause Windows or a program to stop working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>

<b>Step 7</b> from the link to return the computer to <b>Normal startup mode</b>.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype &#34;NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, chat support&#34;</h2>
                    Why is it that Skype is making it so impossible to get to the chat support? I have been trying every different combination possible and following all their instructions. It used to be simple; now impossible. Does anyone have a guaranteed way to get through
 to them. I'm guessing they are not broke and laying off people. Maybe they just don't want to hire more people to handle the load. Thanks

<p>Hello Sergei,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm already using the most recent version of IE to attempt to Chat with support. My company is a MS shop here in IT, so we don't allow our users to use anything except IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reason for contacting support is that I can't find any help online about Skype's tutorial showing up every single day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I finish work for the day, I restart my computer. Every day. When I come in in the morning and log in, Skype launches, and I find that my Theme is no longer set on Dark, and the Tutorial/Welcome Feature launches. This happens every day. I was wondering
 if there is any way to fix it. When I tried to search the issue myself, all I got for results were video and text tutorials for Skype. Obviously, I need less tutorial... not more.&nbsp;So I tried to start a Live Chat... and that's where the trouble really began.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;What is the make and model of the printer?<br />
3.&nbsp;Do you face this issue even while printing through notepad?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to search for some setting in the printer software to fix this issue.&nbsp;or you may check&nbsp;for settings of the Printer to eliminate the "Printer Name"</p>

<br />
Check the mouse/keyboard is working in another system.. d<br />
<br />
if they are&nbsp; working in another system<br />
<br />
(1) try to upgrade chip set drivers for your system, go to your motherboard manufacturer and search for the nessasry drivers for win8<br />
<br />
(2)find the compatible drivers/system patches from the manufacturer of keyboard mouse.. wireless mouse should be connected via bluetooth. so have you installed the necessary drivers for bluetooth?

<p>Hey there Angelina, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the Apple AirPods are not compatible on the Xbox One. You would need to connect a headset with a 3.5mm auxiliary connection, or a compatible wireless headset. Go ahead and take a look at this
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/connect-compatible-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Support article</a>&nbsp;for more information on connecting compatible headsets. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>i think i already explained everything about the compensation , as a member of your program i tried to enter&nbsp; a sweepstakes and i wasnt able to do it because of one account problem&nbsp;and i contacted them exactly because i thought was one account problem&nbsp;,
 since that day they gave me wrong information after wrong information and i got everything i already said and for that reason i demanded a compensation from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>as i said this isn't about any sweepstakes is about respect , i understand mistakes everyone does them but i dont accept insults , threats and lies . let me tell you that the only reason why i lost my right to participate on that was the fact that more than
 one agent told me the case was already in your hands that i just had to wait and by that i mean clearly they said the rewards team already had the case to solve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>about the threats , no it wasn't an agent , it was a manager threatening me that if i keep trying to report the situation that would happen and the truth is i just didn't got my xbox blocked because i didn't had one i sold mine and moved to sony because
 of your disrespects but my little brother got his xbox blocked from live during 1 month and it just stopped when i contacted the enforcement team and asked them explanations about it because yes i contacted a lot of times but when you have a problem that is
 what you do you cant expect your costumers to have problems or not be ok with your actions and ignore them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you know what happened after my contact ? the console was unblocked right away but the funny thing about that&nbsp; is that his console was blocked exactly on a date that started your sweepstakes back in January and it ended 1 day before the sweepstakes ended
 which prevented him or me from winning anything he was only able to register but couldnt play anything and for that reason we lost a second sweepstakes by a mistake someone did not us and i cant accept that .&nbsp;</p>
<p>the case was reported at the time , still the manager is there its like you can do whatever the hell you want to your costumers that you are perfectly ok nothing happens you just have to say you dont have tools to anything and send your costumers to get
 a compensation somewhere else , they are very wrong if they think i will let this pass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and this isn't the only thing because the xbox team thinks i am a fool and for that reason comes with the fact that i had to travel for a couple of weeks to Portugal so they say i don't have the right to be compensated , i am sure you know the difference
 between legal residence and a trip to solve personal problems from what i know in your faqs this is very clear everyone needs to be a legal resident and have more than 18 years well i have both of that things so don't try to fool anyone&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Wifi No Longer Showing Up</h2>
                    <p>Recently I had a problem with my wifi not connecting, and nothing showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed it somehow a day ago and now the problem is back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When going through the "Device Manager" I saw one thing in the "Network adapters" had a yellow yield sign beside it. Something might of been wrong there. However, when i went to go look at which one it was, it is was gone.</p>

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

            Hey, I just wanna say thanks for all the help!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now I do understand how it could help, but I do not want to reset my entire PC. As the problem come and goes! It is very odd, I am typing on my PC at the moment, I updated my drivers and everything.<br />
<br />
However, when I was trying to fix it 2 nights ago, I couldn't get the wifi to connect. So in frustration I bapped the laptop near the mousepad, not hard. But a light slap, and it all of a sudden worked! and connected. It worked all the entire night and morning
 even when I turned it on and off, but then it started having the same problem. I actually just turned on my HP laptop today and got on, and the wifi is connected and working(how I am typing this)<br />
<br />
With all the troubleshooting coming back positive, nothing showing wrong, and nothing at all being found to corrupt my files. Could it be something misplaced inside the laptop? I am not too big into tech but to me it sounds possible(or not)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help from anyone who replies to this, now I must go search up a different problem that started.<br />

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply and appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you have an intermittent Wi-Fi issue, suggest you to refer to the steps from this article to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/10741/windows-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>Note: You may have to temporarily turn off or disable the firewall on the PC. Make sure you turn it back on as soon as you can. Not having a firewall
 turned on makes your PC more vulnerable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you got the help you needed.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Firewall is dropping all packets coming from PPTP site to site - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marco antonio araujo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Firewall is dropping all packets coming from PPTP site to site VPN</h2>
                    I have a PPTP site to site VPN built with RRAS. The server at the branch office is a Windows Server 2003 and the server at the main office is a Windows Server 2008 R2. The public profile log of Windows Firewall shows that all packets from the branch office
 are dropping.<br />
<br />
Curiously, I can access all the branch office computers from the main office.<br />
<br />
The configuration is:<br />
<br />
Main Office:<br />
Network address: 192.168.0.0/24<br />
Server IP Address: 192.168.0.3/24<br />
<br />
Branch Office:<br />
Network address: 192.168.1.0/24<br />
Server IP address: 192.168.1.1/24<br />
<br />
I guess the two tunnels are ok because RRAS shows that the interfaces are connected. Each PPTP server interface receives a IP address assigned by the remote RRAS.<br />
<br />
There are no packet filters set.<br />
There are firewall rules allowing ICMPv4 traffic inbound and outbound.<br />
<br />
When I try to ping 192.168.0.3 from the branch office server, the Windows Firewall logs in the public profile log:<br />
<br />
2011-09-28 16:10:44 DROP ICMP 192.168.0.102 192.168.0.3 - - 0 - - - - 0 0 - RECEIVE<br />
<br />
where 192.168.0.102 is the PPP address assigned from the main office RRAS.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated and very helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p><span>I have found the following statement by Nirmal that "The file history will back up the data on the computer only once regardless of the data present on the computer." to not be accurate. Each of the family members in our household has their own account
 on the computer. My wife and I used to share an account. To make it easier for her to find her documents that are under my account I setup her document folder (as well as music, pictures &amp; video) so that it also contains my folders through the new feature
 of Windows 8 that allows this sharing. </span></p>
<p><span>File history is turned on for all 4 accounts. My documents are being redundantly backed up under my account and my wife's account. As my account contains many documents, I am pressed for space on my backup drive. This is also occurring for the public
 documents folder which are being backed up redundantly on each account.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to exclude my documents from my wife's file history by excluding my documents under her account. After deleting the backup folder containing my documents under her account, it was back the next time I looked.</span></p>

            <p>I have not found any part of Nirmal S answer accurate or useful. Just salesman's lies.</p>
<p>At least when we are talking about putting history files to a network share. In my case Synology.</p>
<p>File History merely puts all common Public files to backup location in multiple copies each for every user using File History.</p>
<p>For some reason File History&nbsp;is not able to detect, that an object is already backed up or is not able to create just multiple links to one file copy on the network location.</p>
<p>Anyway Microsoft did not revealed much details of File History backup process to say what is happening.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same questions as you all have!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a solution I will mark the public folder as "not to backup" for my wifes account. That should do the trick. I found this possibility in control Panel --&gt; file history --&gt; ...</p>

                    <p>Okay so on my main Xbox account Walmart bodwash I was suspended not once but twice. The first suspension I got I understood that some person reported me most likely the most recent person that messaged me so I said okay, a day later I get another message from Xbox live saying that I am suspended again and that I can't play games which shouldn't even be possible since I was already suspended. All I want is for some assistance to try and remove the suspension for playing I'm fine with the communication can I just get help with the second suspension that'd be great</p>

====================================<br />
Email providers have filesize limitations.&nbsp; Uploading<br />
the video to a site like the following and sending your <br />
recipients the download link may be the best bet.<br />
<br />
"SendSpace"<br />
<a href="http://www.sendspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sendspace.com/</a><br />
<br />
It's very simple...on the SendSpace site the following <br />
steps are all you have to do.<br />
<br />
Left click the Browse button and it will open a window <br />
that allows you to access the files on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
Navigate to the folder your videos are in and select one.<br />
<br />
Left click the Upload button.<br />
<br />
Wait for the file to upload...<br />
<br />
When the Download Link appears...left click the Copy <br />

<h2>            display driver lattitude e6400</h2>
                    I have a dell laptop: Latitude E6400. I have recurring problem with the display driver that is getting progressively worse. The screen keeps blinking every few seconds. Once in a while the display driver fails completely and noting is visible on the screen.
 Not sure how to proceed to repair this. Anybody with any ideas on the driver i should reinstall?? I do not have the dell driver CD with me.

    <title>64 BIT VISTA Hardware compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jldcfo  say:</h3>
<h2>            64 BIT VISTA Hardware compatibility</h2>
                    OK, I've run the performance test on my Windows 32 bit system and it says my system is 64-bit capable.&nbsp; I have a Q6600 quad core processor.&nbsp; If it says that my system is 64-bit capable, is it safe to assume that ALL components attached directly to the
 mother board are compatible, or do I need to check each and every item on my device manager, system devices list?&nbsp; I'm running a Gateway Fx8020, 4gb ram (will upgrade to 8gb with 64-bit OS) and unfortunately, they're not much help in trying to upgrade the
 OS.&nbsp; All of my external peripherals are compatible, I just don't know about the system devices.<br />
<br />
Thanks, JO

            You will not have any problems with those.<br />
If you want to try to get the latest versions of the inter chipset drivers you can find those on the Intel website, but the ones that come with Vista are just fine.

<p>this message means, that your computer (notebook, netbook and so on) does not have any wireless adapter. Or maybe the software, what you want to install, is not compatible with your wireless hardware in your computer.</p>

            Hello Babu,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks a lot for the tips. Unfortunately, even if I follow exactly the indications, the update fail again (crash at "Applying system settings", 24%).</div>
<div>The only external device is an wireless Logitech mouse (Unify USB removed at the moment of update). No video card installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Two other things I experienced:&nbsp;</div>
<div>- I try to reset the PC to factory settings but I did not succeed (could not find the files needed).</div>
<div>- I try to perform dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth, but no image was found</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Till now I really have no problem, W8 is working fine. But I'm excited to see the improvements of W8.1...&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Mail&#58; Your PC isn&#39;t connected to the Internet. To use Mail, connect to the Internet and the try again.  WHY&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have a HP Stream 7 Tablet running Windows 8.1 w/ Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working perfectly until Various Windows apps STOPPED connecting to the internet. &nbsp;After some work, I decided to do a SYSTEM RESTORE on my tablet to bring it back to original operating condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That didn't totally work 100% because, logging in with my microsoft account, it did bring 'some things' back. &nbsp;That's ok. &nbsp;Fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on my way to work. &nbsp;I wanted to check/respond to emails using the Mail App that comes 'stock'. &nbsp;and I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Mail: Your PC isn't connected to the Internet. To use Mail, connect to the Internet and the try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has NEVER happened before. &nbsp;Before I would be able to load the tablet with fresh inbox/messages, reply to them while on transit, then 'upload' those responses once I reconnected to Wifi at work. &nbsp;This is a basic functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm extremely frustrated and would like to know how to bring this back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I system restore the OS, does that also mean that the Apps also revert to the old image, or is the most recent version of the app installed as part of the process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tablet is a brick off wifi. &nbsp;Why the new behaviour?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The verson that I see on the tablet is 17.5.960020605</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that means May 05, 2017, then I can 100% verify, that I have never updated the mail app since 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I KNOW that the tablet has no access to the internet. &nbsp;I still want to be able to access the Mail app so I can read/review/process my emails while offline.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install Windows 10 on my PC&#33; &#40;Error 0xC1900101 - 0x20017&#41;</h2>
                    <strong>I was really hyped to install the Windows 10 update, and I saw that the "$Windows.~BT" folder was empty. So I downloaded it from here
</strong>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 <strong>(<em>64-bit version</em>).</strong>
<p>I waited for it to download, it got through everything normally, I choose the "Keep everything option" and it started the installation process. I left my computer to do his job and when I came in the room I saw that the installation wasn't
 completed and a error showed up. This is the only photo I caught (PC wasn't properly booted and I couldn't screenshot that).</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1462248d-77ff-416d-b137-6f80559012fa" height="386" width="687" /></p>
<p>If you can't read it, it says the error code and "<em>This installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation".</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I got frustrated, closed the window and the PC booted normally. Tried to open the Installation Tool again and it started downloading it again. Right now I'm waiting for a solution, because I'm pretty sure that I will get this error again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For records, those are my PC specs:</p>
<p><strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Pentium G3258 (Not Overclocked)</p>
<p><strong>Motherboard: </strong>Gigabyte GA-H81M-H</p>

            It's a very specific issue to h81 mobo + g3258 oc'd cpu. You can apparently fix it by enabling only 1 core in bios. For now, nobody can run win10 +h81&nbsp; with g3258 with both cores enabled.

            it's not specific to h81 (nor overclocking). i have it on b85. i think i've even seen a z97 with the issue. one fix is to disable a core. asrock has a bios fixing it for one, possibly more boards.
