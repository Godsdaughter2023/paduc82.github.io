    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant - Failure to complete upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philipadams1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant - Failure to complete upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I am using a ASUS N53S laptop, <span>currently running Windows 10 Version 1607. Drivers updated and Windows updates have been completed. Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant starts up frequently and commences to download version 1709.&nbsp; 100% is downloaded,
 the automatic process then typically starts and gets to 30%. The laptop reboots and restores the old version.
</span></p>
<p>This has now failed over 15 times, used lots of internet bandwidth and much frustration with lost productivity. Can anyone suggest a way forward that does not break windows?</p>

            Hello,
<br />Community Member DaveM has a solution for disabling Upgrade assistant:
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!
<br />

            Hey again - I currently have 3 accounts set up on my laptop - 2 are mine (*** Email address is removed for privacy *** &amp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) the third is one a few friends &amp; I share so we can all access its skydrive. &nbsp;I am trying to create a 4th so I can use it for
 specific information &amp; use it's skydrive to work on at different locations &amp; computers.
<div><br />
<div>The first 3 gave me no problem - this 4th one is nothing but trouble. &nbsp;I have even tried to create a brand new account using the 'create new user' feature of Windows 8 on this machine &amp; I still get the same error message. &nbsp;I have also already run the Microsoft

<h2>            Really bad support</h2>
                    
<p>I have sent my Xbox back 3 times. They can't fix it or even be honest about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two times they sent it back after just factory resetting the console. Acting like the console was fixed. The second time they even told me I needed a new console but still sent the same one back after again just factory resetting the console.</p>
<p>The third time I actually got another console...</p>
<p>But not a new one. Mine was flawless and I got one back that has scratches on the cable ports... B<span>ut I couldnt care about that. I wanted to have the crappy machine work properly</span></p>

<p>They sent me another machine. Same edition with the same oroblem. They couldnt fix it for this other person and they now sent it to me. So this was 3 times *** me over.
</p>
<p>Now here's the point. I have had that first xbox and after I had 4 different xbox 360' after that this xbox one....</p>
<p>Ober 10 years I have been a customer and I have never end one product if theirs back... not once. Now I had this problem and they lied to me... they left me with this gamebreaking problem and it ruined my gaming experince completely. I find the machine worthless.</p>
<p>They did not help me and thats the customer suppoelrt for being a loyal customer for 1p years orso. Instead they had me parading like a circus animal. I had to subscribe to make to the public library to kake the dumb ellabels 3 times... I had to wait a week...
 3 times... I had to downoald my stuff back to the machine which cost me at least 3 days... 3 times.</p>
<p>Now its obvious. This is how they will leave me. So im not sending the console back anymore. Instead I will use my xbox life untill it runs out in two months by being onyoutube and when it runs out I will have my miney for a playstation and leave this whole
 thing behind me...</p>
<p>10 years microsoft...</p>

<p>Yea I have read about this. When I cintacted xbox support. I told them that they leave people hanging and I read all about it. They said I have nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>All they did was delete everything from it and send it back. The third time they send me a second hand xbox back that has damage on it. But still with the same problem. It seems xbox has a problem which they dont want to recognize. They act like little children
 about it. </p>
<p>Well Im donr e now. They promised me three times and they didn't deluver. They have crappy machines and thats that. Nothing to add. They dont want to solve my problem. So after my xbox live runs out. The xbox goes back in the box and it will never come online
 again... nor my profile. Im done with this. If this us how they treat a customer that has been a loyal customer for over 10 years...</p>
<p>They nevermind. I feel very disappointed and its sad that all if my gaming history is with xbox...</p>
<p>Ill have to start over on playstation.</p>

<p>Hi Mister Maka,</p>
<p>You can not help me. No one can. I mean I have sent my xbox back 3 times and all you guys can say is that it is just fine now. Having me wait 3 times a week and download for 10 days orso. Running around to send the machine.</p>
<p>No you guys cant help. This is what my gaming experience is reduced to. To a seraming pile of... well you know.</p>
<p>I have no other option left but to move on. Im already saving up for a playstation. I should have the money before my Xbox Live runs out in two months.</p>
<p>Anyways...</p>
<p>Here's my problem.</p>
<p>My xbix us just a piece of well again... you know. It randomly disconnects my controller in midgame.</p>
<p>So picture this... Im setting up my zombies game and the set up can take hours.
</p>
<p>Then this crap haplends and zombies slap me down and I lose all the progress I made. I can try again after...</p>
<p>But this is how the next game ends aswell.</p>
<p>It is a game breaking problem and it totally ruined my gaming experience. Xbox cant even find it. Let alone fix it.</p>
<p>I have read from many other players having these issues. They are always given the finger. Now I have been with xbox for around 10 years. I had many xboxes and a lot if products. I never send one thing back. After all this time I have a game breaking problem...
 and as the liyal customer I always was... Here the finger.</p>
<p>You have taken my xbox 3 times and I had to wait a week each and every time... making ut 3 weeks....</p>
<p>I also had to download for 3 days everytime... again 10 days...</p>
<p>I had to subscribe to the library and print those e-labels. I was running around and missing out on my xbox for a month. The last two times you guys promosed me a new console. The first was a flat out lie. I got the same back. The seconfmd time you give
 me a second hand console with scratches all over it...</p>
<p>But with the exact same problem!!!!!</p>
<p>I have wrote entire letter explanibg that this problem lies in my special edution Xbox. Because out of 200 friends... I know of only one with the same problem and he has the exact same edition as I have. I explaned this to you people many times and wrote
 a letter and I have literally spend days on the phone and chat with you. </p>
<p>All I have left now is to go to playstation... after 10 f'in years... You just drop me like dead weight.</p>

<p>Mister Maka,</p>
<p>After all I tried, I looked up this problem on internet. That's where I read how this problem keeps slipping by your faulty testing system. People kept getting their console sent back with the message tgat it is good now. But all you do is reset and make
 us download all the stuff for days...</p>
<p>Just to find out how there is nothing fixed.</p>
<p>Anyways....</p>
<p>I contacted you guys after I read about this. I explained exactly what the problem was, but you guys don't even look at it. I was on the phone with you for hours. And I wrote an entire letter which I printed out and stuck on the console... I sent it to an
 email adress of yours and I copy pasted it multiple times to different support people. But you dont do anything with all my effort. You just reset the *** console and do a simple test tgat always fails to find what I explained very well. Then you send it back
 and have ke download all the content for nothing. It still makes the same problem.
</p>
<p>After that I contact again and explain and all you fo is throw my xbox into the same routine and faulty test and send it back again. No one is freaking listening to what I clearly state, my problem is. You keep missing it and Im being ***... for three times
 now. The last time you kept my in perfect condition Xbox and gave me a secilond hand full of scratches back. But I would not eben mind if the *** thing just worked fine. Even if it was pink and smelled like flowers... I would not care. I just want to be able
 to play like everyone else.</p>
<p>But ofcourse, not only do I get back a product less than my own. But it is the exact same model that I keep saying has this problem. I said the very first time that from all the xbox friends....</p>
<p>Only one other friend has this same problem and he is the only one other friend who has the modern warfare edition, just like mine. I kept telling you that only these xboxes seem to do it and I kept explaning how you could experience this game breaking problem.
 It just takes a while before it starts happening. Sometimes it doesnt even hapoen for hours and other times ut happens 10 times an hour. I explained this but you keep messing up with your simple and faulty test. You just dont communicate or read my letters
 or all the effirt I put in it. Very disappointed in this whole thing. By now I am a month further and I hablve done all this trouble, and still have a broken *** machine. I now have no other option left but to go to playstation. Literally no option. You leabe
 me like this and I am not paying anymore xbox live or anything on xbox anymore. My machine is broken. I dont like to play anymore.</p>
<p>Oh by the way. That one other friend who has the same edition and the same problem. He has not been on his xbox for months too.</p>
<p>Now you push me away... leavibg me literally no choice but to go to playstation after ten years on xbox. Thanks a lot for that. But I have now like two months live left. So Ill just use it for youtube and netflix. When live runs out I will get a playstation...
 for which I hopefully have saved enough money in time. Anyways... You guys should know that you push me away and that you treated me like trash. I will not forget it and anytime it comes up anywhere...</p>
<p>I will tell the truth about this circus you call support.</p>
<p>Here...</p>
<p>I will copy paste the letter I wrote and send to everyone at xbox and even stuck a copy on my xbox when sending it to you.</p>
<p>Here's that letter:</p>
<p>Dear XBox/Microsoft Employee,</p>
<p>I want to include this letter to help you find the problem with my Xbox One Console.</p>
<p>I have been a satisfied customer of Xbox for well over 10 years now. I have bought the Original XBox at the time and after that I bought the Original XBox 360 with 20 Gb and after that I bought the 360 Elite Edition with 120 Gb and after that the Slim Version
 of the 360 with 250 Gb...</p>
<p>And latest I bought this machine. The XBox One Advanced Warfare Edition with 1 Tb Memory. I payed upfront in advance, just to make sure I got this "Advanced Wafare Edition" because of its bigger memory. I have always bought the bigger memory editions as
 soon as they come out.</p>
<p>Now, you can see my history and how much XBox Live and MS points I have bought throughout these years. Even before XBox I was a customer playing on PC Windows Games. I've always been a customer and I was always satisfied about the Product aswell as the Service.</p>
<p>Now I found out I have a big problem with my Console. I had this problem right from the beginning but did not realise the bad end of it very well.</p>
<p>Right from the start, the Controller had problems. It seems to just lose connection to the Console randomly. At the time I thought it was a wide spread problem because a friend of mine had the same...
</p>
<p>Also... a lot of things on XBox One did not work properly in the beginning. I always thought that some day you guys would bring out a Patch and fix this. I have waited a lot for this and in the meantime I have tested out Controllers of friends of mine and
 in the end bought new Controllers twice. I even bought the Charger Kit, two different kinds... just to test everything out. With and without Batteries... or Batterypack or with Wire connected or without... everything. I have moved half my living room around
 just to make sure there was no interference for some reason. Note that I never had this problem with any of my other XBoxes or any of the dozens of Controllers including Guitars and Drumset. In this same living room.</p>
<p>I am now 100 percent sure that my Console is the problem and not all these Controllers. I have also tested the other way around...</p>
<p>These Controllers seem to work fine on standart XBoxes of friends of mine but not on my own or the one other friend that has the exact same problem and the exact same Edition XBox as I have...</p>
<p>I went online to see what my problem was and found that this is a known problem in the Community and many more experience this. The things I read scared me and made me lose hope. People reporting this and not getting it fixed saying that "there is nothing
 to fix" and stuff.</p>
<p>So, yesterday it was the final straw that broke this Camel's back. </p>
<p>Ingame... I died again for the millionth time and lost more then two hours of progress...</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>Just because of this problem of my XBox not being connected to my Controller. Its disgusting and frustratingly annoying.</p>
<p>Sometimes it lasts only seconds and reconnects right away...</p>
<p>Sometimes im waiting for a minute before it connects again. Sometimes it doesn't happen for a few hours and sometimes it happends 8 times an hour.</p>
<p>This is truly a gamebreaking problem and it really ruined my gaming experience on XBox. It has become this bad that I can't play anymore. My friend who has the same Edition XBox and same problem...</p>
<p>He gave up on this a while ago...</p>
<p>He is not playing XBox anymore. He is sick of it and to be honest...</p>
<p>I am too. </p>
<p>This problem ruins it all. Now Im not prepared to leave XBox and all that I build up with you guys. I really want you to fix this problem so that I can play games with my friends on XBox Live again.</p>
<p>Please fix this problem and please considder my loyalty to XBox aswell. I have always been a satisfied customer but I fear I will not be a customer much longer if this happens again. I don't like to send my XBox away and be without it for three weeks....</p>
<p>Please don't let it be for nothing or else I have to give up aswell.</p>
<p>Hopefully my cry for help is heard and hopefully the description of this problem helps you fix it...</p>
<p>Sincerely yours...</p>
<p>A loyal customer.</p>

<p>One more thing tho...</p>
<p>This is kind of funny. When you read about this problem online and on xbox its own support articles. They literally say that you need a new console. The support told me twice that I would get a new one. But they lied. The last time I did get another console
 yes. But not a new one. A damaged one with the same problem. So this is actually known with you xbox people... You just act very childish about your own faulty product.</p>
<p>Really just sad.</p>
<p>Anywats. They said the first time that they would include 1 m9nth xbox live free for me... for all the trouble. But even that was a lie. I am being pulled bynxbpx and they took my xbox for a month doing so. They say they give me a month free live but instead
 they took the xbix a month and took away a month of live with that.</p>
<p>Xbox is very bad. I read all about it. You guys kbow that this is a yardware problem and that I need a new console. But instead you treat me lije trash.</p>
<p>Dont forget tgat wnlhen I play on playstation and bash xbox on each amd every chance I get.</p>

            Google's recommendation for graphics cards for Sketchup on Windows 7 are:<br />
<br />
"3D class Video Card with 512+ MB of memory or higher. Please ensure that the video card driver supports OpenGL version 1.5 or higher and up to date.<br />
"SketchUp's performance relies heavily the graphics card driver and it's ability to support OpenGL 1.5 or higher. Historically, people have seen problems with Intel based cards with SketchUp. We don't recommend using these graphics cards with SketchUp at this
 time."<br />

            I seem to have solved my problem by going to "control panel&gt;system and security&gt; system&gt; advanced system settings" select "let windows decide what's best for my computer". I am using Windows 7 OS.

<p>Gra jest przypisana do konta Microsoft na które byłeś zalogowany w trakcie wpisywania kodu z kartki, jeżeli teraz jesteś zalogowany na innym koncie, to nic dziwnego, że gry nigdzie nie ma. Musisz się zalogować na konto wcześniejsze.</p>

Just going by your system specs - no.&nbsp; Not going to happen.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/system-requirements</a><br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Have you checked with the manufacturer of the computer to see if all the hardware (motherboard chipset, video card, audio device, network devices and any external peripherals) is supported by said manufacturer(s) under Windows 8.&nbsp; What abot the software
 you use (in the version you use them)?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
The system sounds fairly old or ill-equipped.</p>

            Hi Molly.
<br />
<br />Some community members reported that issue was resolved by setting up correct time. Make sure your Windows clock is set to the correct time.
<br />
<br />Next be sure that you have last version of Microsoft .NET Framework.
<br />
<br />Try to install the Facebook Gameroom using right click and run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Let me know how it works

            Did not work. This all started after update on 10-25-18. I tried to uninstall update but won't let me. Windows Defender SmartScreen is a big pain. My clock has correct time and right clicking doesn't work. Windows 10 has always been slow but now&nbsp; worse.
 I wish they would ask before updating. And I wish I had never gotten windows 10. I want my Facebook Gameroom back. I have used it since it began. If I had a problem I could always reinstall. Please get rid of last update.&nbsp;

</p><blockquote>Hi Molly. <br />
<br />
Some community members reported that issue was resolved by setting up correct time. Make sure your Windows clock is set to the correct time.
<br />
<br />
Next be sure that you have last version of Microsoft .NET Framework. <br />
<br />
Try to install the Facebook Gameroom using right click and run as administrator. <br />
<br />
Let me know how it works </blockquote>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for making sure I got this message. It did indeed solve the problem. When I first saw the suggestion about "changing the time" from another poster I had no idea what that meant. Then someone else posted step by step instructions on the
 process. That was what I needed..hahahI am PC "challenged" . I am so happy to have my gameroom back. Thank you again for making sure I got your message to know there was a solution.</p>
<p>Gratefully,</p>

            I was able to reinstall by setting date on computer to Oct 24. It reinstalled great but when I went to correct date it went back to flashplayer problem on gameroom games and had to go back to 24th on date and reinstall again. So w by at happens when date
 automatically changes?&nbsp; I don't think it will stay on 24th for good

            You are very welcome.&nbsp; I'm waiting on answer to another question. What happens when date changes to 25th? I reset it back to correct time and it went back to the same problem so I had to redo date again. I think I will reset to correct day but put year
 back to 2017

<h2>            Windows 7 wireless netwok connectivity</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
On Windows 7 installation, my wireless network was detected and internet connection automatically setup.&nbsp; Great!!<br />
<br />
This new installation is on my desktop which is connected directly to the router. (with wire)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My question is the following : My wireless network is setup with WPA2 security and I am surprise that Windows did not ask me for the security phrase at any point. I open the router setup page later on and the WPA2 security is activated.<br />
<br />
Does Windows 7 override passphrase security ?<br />
<br />
System configuration:<br />
AMD 64 4600+<br />
Video card 8800 GTS<br />
Hard drive 1 terabytes +<br />
Wireless Router: Belkin with WPA2 security<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            When you connect to a router with a wire (hardwired), you do not need the WPA2 security. That is only for wireless connections.<br />

            Hi.
<br />
<br />The BSOD is an error screen display which can occur within Windows 10 for a variety of reasons, such as when a critical process died or the boot device becomes inaccessible. Anything from software to hardware conflicts can create a BSOD. Unfortunately, the reasons for a BSOD can remain a mystery.. Check this link, I hope it helps.

            Hi I’m Linnell I'm a fellow Community member here to help.
<br />Sorry to here your having problems with Camera view. 
<br />
<br />Try changing Camera with in the Camera App 
<br />
<br />	• Open&nbsp;the&nbsp;Camera App&nbsp;on your Surface.
<br />	• Swipe down&nbsp;from the top of the camera window (this brings up the Camera Options
<br />	• Tap&nbsp;Change Camera&nbsp;– now you can see yourself in the front facing camera.
<br />Go back to website and check if the camera is still using the front facing camera.
<br />If that doesn't work 
<br />The other way is through the device manager 
<br />1. Open Windows Device Manager (Right click on the Windows menu, select&nbsp;Device Manager
<br />2. Scroll down to&nbsp;System Devices;&nbsp;click to expand the menu.
<br />3. Double click on either&nbsp;Microsoft Camera Front&nbsp;or&nbsp;Microsoft Camera Rear
<br />4. Select&nbsp;Enable Device&nbsp;on the camera that you want to use; Select&nbsp;Disable Device&nbsp;on the other.
<br /> 
<br />Reverse procedure when you are done so you have access to both views from your camera app. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask questions and let us know how it goes.
<br />

    <title>When I send an email, it goes into local storage Sent Items instead of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> porkypig72  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I send an email, it goes into local storage Sent Items instead of IMAP Sent folder. Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Talk Talk account in Windows Live Mail, on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, when I send an email <em>using Windows Live Mail</em>, the email does not appear in the IMAP "Sent" folder.&nbsp; Similarly, when I delete an email using Windows Live Mail, it does not appear in the IMAP "Trash" folder.&nbsp; It turns out they are
 only being stored in Local Storage folders, and not on the IMAP server.</p>
<p>I know my emails are being received, so that is not a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, let me explain that I <em>can</em> see the "Sent" and "Trash" folders in Windows Live Mail, and they contain all the emails that I have sent/deleted previously using WebMail.&nbsp; So, as far as being able to
<em>see</em> the emails <em>that already exist</em> in those folders, that is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My settings are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Include this account when receiving mail or synchronising:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>Incoming mail:</strong> mail.talktalk.net</p>
<p><strong>Incoming mail port:</strong> 143</p>
<p><strong>Outgoing mail:</strong> smtp.talktalk.net</p>
<p><strong>Outgoing mail port:</strong> 587</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>IMAP Folders</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Root folder path:</strong> <em>blank</em></p>
<p><strong>Check for new messages in all folders:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>Store special folders on IMAP server:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>Sent Items path:</strong> Sent</p>
<p><strong>Drafts path:</strong> Drafts</p>
<p><strong>Deleted Items path: </strong>Trash</p>
<p><strong>Junk path:</strong> Spam</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of my IMAP folders are hidden, I can see them all.&nbsp; All the folders (Sent, Trash etc) branch off the Inbox, which I understand is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how it <em>should</em> work.&nbsp; I should be able to send an email from Windows Live Mail and it should appear in my Sent folder.&nbsp; I should then be able to log into WebMail (or any other device for that matter) and see the email in the Sent folder in
 there too.&nbsp; But it doesn't happen.&nbsp; I know it's not necessarily instant, but it should all eventually sync up nicely - that's the point of IMAP isn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed in the TalkTalk Community that my settings are correct.&nbsp; It was suggested that this is a Live Mail config error, and that I should get help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was my post in the TalkTalk forum:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/POP3-and-IMAP-Diagnostics/My-sent-emails-are-not-going-into-my-Sent-folder/m-p/1636215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/POP3-and-IMAP-Diagnostics/My-sent-emails-are-not-going-into-my-Sent-folder/m-p/1636215</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to a reply.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but I think you may have misunderstood the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't actually see any error message as such, it just doesn't work as it should.&nbsp; I haven't got any network problems, and my other email accounts (Yahoo) work correctly.&nbsp; Also if I send an email using TalkTalk's WebMail page, the email
<em>does</em> appear in my sent items in WLM, so I think we can rule out Network problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no emails stuck in the Outbox folder... although there wouldn't be, because my emails do get sent (and received by the recipient).&nbsp; I can also receive incoming emails. So I guess we can rule out Firewall issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, when I send an email from my&nbsp;<em>TalkTalk</em> account <em>using WLM</em>, the email appears in the
<em>local storage Sent Items</em> folder - NOT the IMAP Sent folder, even though I have configured the account to use IMAP storage<em>.</em>&nbsp; That's what I'm trying to solve.&nbsp; Additionally, when I
<em>delete</em> an email, it's the same problem, it goes into local instead of IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already removed and re-added the account in WLM countless times, it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>POP isn't an option, because it's not suitable for multiple devices, and the whole point of this is to get IMAP working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>After considerable testing, I have concluded that <strong>Windows Live Mail is not compatible with TalkTalk accounts with IMAP</strong>.&nbsp; It's difficult to determine whether the bug is with WLM or TalkTalk, because both systems work correctly in separation.&nbsp;
 My tests:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook with TalkTalk (IMAP) - Success</p>
<p>Thunderbird with TalkTalk (IMAP) - Success</p>
<p><strong>Windows Live Mail with TalkTalk (IMAP) - Fail</strong></p>
<p>Windows Live Mail with Yahoo (IMAP) - Success</p>

<h2>            Cursor Icon Keeps Changing</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with my cursor changing from the standard pointer arrow to several up arrows/carrots stacked on top of each other&nbsp;when over/in an&nbsp;Outlook or Internet Explorer window.&nbsp; I have a Dell Precision T3610 running Windows 7 Professional on a
 64-bit system and am typically running&nbsp;AutoCAD, Outlook, Internet Explorer and occasionally Word/Excel also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to happen 1-5 times on the average day and&nbsp;goes away when clicking in and out of the&nbsp;different programs.&nbsp; I have scoured the web trying to find a solution but have been unsuccessful a few of the things I have tried include...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Control Panel&gt;Mouse&gt;Pointers&gt; Scheme = None &amp; no check in "Allow themes to change mouse pointers"</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span>a. Open<strong> Mouse</strong> by clicking the<strong> Start</strong> button, clicking<strong> Control Panel</strong>, clicking<strong> Hardware</strong>, and then clicking<strong> Mouse.</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Select the Pointer Options tab and make sure these boxes are checked: <strong>
Enhance pointer precision, Display pointer trails, and Hide pointer while typing.</strong></span></p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assist you better, I would like to know: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What is the exact model number of your Logitech Wireless mouse with which you face this issue?</p>
<p>2) If this issue has started recently, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>3) Does this happens only when you work on certain applications like Outlook and Internet Explorer? Do you face this issue when you are on the desktop of the computer without opening any applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if this is caused by any application that you might have installed on the computer in the past. To check this, let us perform a clean boot,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<strong><em>How to perform a clean boot</em></strong>” and follow the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows
 7 and Windows Vista</em></strong>” from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows 7 and Windows Vista</em></strong>” given in the
 section “<strong><em>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</em></strong>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 7 and Windows Vista”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the
 above link.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Please get back to us with the troubleshooting result.</span>
