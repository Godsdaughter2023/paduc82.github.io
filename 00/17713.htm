<h2>            Which video format best for PC and Mac Powerpoint embedding&#63;</h2>
                    I use Office 2010 for Windows and Office 2011 for Mac. I have created some technical video animations, and I would like to embed them in PPT slides using a format that both the Windows and Mac Office versions can display, without the need to download additional
 programs. MOV or M4V seem to work on my Mac, and of course AVI and WMF for Windows. I would really appreciate any pointers to a format suitable for both platforms. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;

<h2>            MS Sculpt Mouse WinKey not working on Win10 10074 &#40;32bit&#41;</h2>
                    I have a SculptMouse working on my Win8.1 Toshiba notebook (KIRA). Clicking the "WinKey" brings up the StartMenu (like pressing WinKey-w on the keyboard). On my ASUS G1 Notebook,Win10 build 10074 32bit, pressing the SculptMouse WinKey works sometimes;
 most of the time it does not. It seems as if earlier builds had the SculptMouse WinKey working as expected. The SculptMouse WinKey is a fast way of getting to Power (ShutDown, Restart). Is this a 32bit problem?

            Uninstall, download the Win8 32bit driver, run driver setup in Win8 compatability and it now works as I expect. -- click on the mouse WinKey and Setup appears. Thanks!

<h3> davidmoran_741  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365  Excel - inheriting conditional formatting</h2>
                    <p>I have been experiencing continual problems with Excel Sheets on Office 365 (Win10 OS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open a new blank workbook, and it inherits conditional formatting on cells and columns that prevent normal Excel functions on those cells -&nbsp;text entry&nbsp;to the cell is disabled, formatting the cell is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after regular research for corrective actions, and mining for where I could set some default opening conditions for the new workbook, and following instructions on clearing the conditional formatting, I have repeatedly used the clear conditional formatting
 on cells, groups of cells and the entire sheet.</p>
<p>then hit save..&nbsp; the sheet becomes non-responsive for a VERY LONG TIME&nbsp; -&nbsp; before the changes are completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found I can force the update to take by clicking away from the sheet (to another sheet in the workbook), then clicking back to force the refresh. This has cost me an in-God-ly amount of time and delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried talking to Support, they wanted to start a ticket and charge me $400 to report what looks like a&nbsp;bug.&nbsp; I wasn't impressed..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seen this behavior..??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just set up my BING ads account with all campaigns etc., but there are no ads showing. I checked for keywords where keyword, ad, ad group, and campaign are all shown as applicable (in German it says "Geeignet"), but neither in the live BING website
 nor in the ads preview my ads show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be wrong here? Or does BING really need so long before ads actually start showing?</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm trying to share some annotations I took on a printout. I set the images of the printout to background. I didn't want to export to pdf because the pages were cut off at strange locations. However, images set as background do not show up when exported
 as a Word document or MHT file. Is there a way to get them to show up without having to set the images back to the foreground?</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Unfortunately no, this is how it is designed. Background images are not exported to editable formats like Word or MHT, and are only exported for fixed formats like PDF or XPS. The reason behind this is that Word doesn't properly support laying out overlapping
 objects though the medium OneNote uses to convert the page. Therefore if OneNote wants to export the background image it has to merge everything on the page that overlaps into a single image, including any text typed over. This would remove the ability to
 edit them further in Word. Most people use background images only for stationary (some nice background image on the page) and not as part of content, so this works pretty well most of the time. Unfortunately for you this means loss of content when exporting,
 the only workaround is to move them to foreground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a tool that can read a page content in XML format and save it back, so it is possible to read it, modify it (to remove background property) and then save it back, making it easier than doing one by one, if you have too many images. Let me know if
 you are interested in trying it.</p>

<p>You want to :</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the page in question from the left tree. </li><li>Click on Get Content from the bottom, this will show an XML representation of the page.
</li><li>Copy the XML to notepad</li><li>Remove all instances of background="true" (would be inside &lt;one:Image elements)</li><li>Copy the XML back into the tool</li><li>Click on Update Content</li></ol>
<p>This should move all the images to foreground. If you get any errors let me know about the error code and I can help with that.</p>
<p>This needs to be done per page, there is no way to get/update a whole section or notebook.</p>

            <p>Wow, after resolving/repairing windows&nbsp;installer - installed quite a few updates, several Microsoft.NET framework 4's and about 15 security updates for&nbsp;Office 32bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holding off for now, not seen another apphang error. Although startup has speeded up a little bit I will run another Windows optimise performance routine.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention Java also crashed and I've reported back to Oracle - replied with a new 'instance' and will get back to me in due course. A bit silly as previous updates stated we need to install both 32 and 64 bit updates. It's like come on! Have 64 give
 me 64 - sorry rant over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all it's looking much better and will keep you posted.</p>
<p>And I&nbsp;like to say I like this Microsoft Answers - a great service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

    <title>Office 365 Excel document with VBA shared in Sharepoint - AutoSave and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilyakarichev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Excel document with VBA shared in Sharepoint - AutoSave and Co-Authoring Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 questions but let me give you some context. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Excel document that is built with the latest Office 365 and uses VBA coding to manage different things. This document is on SharePoint and shared with a lot of people that can access it and edit when required.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the latest Office 365 update which has introduced AutoSave and Co-Authoring this is what would happen:</p>
<p>- User Opens the Excel document, it opens in web preview but because it is VBA based the user has to "Open in Excel"</p>
<p>- When the user "Opens in Excel" the file, it becomes under exclusive editing for that user, and they can do everything they need and save accordingly</p>
<p>- When someone else opens the document, they can only view the document as Read Only, they can browse, run macros, but this will not update the SharePoint version</p>
<p>- There was no AutoSave and the editing user had to save manually, and if the macro did something wrong, they could just exit without harming the file on SharePoint</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above worked awesomely for this Excel document and for this scenario. I only wanted single user updates to the document and no data clashes could possibly happen as co-authoring simply didn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the new update that has been getting rolled out as off late, this is what I'm now getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- AutoSave feature is turned on as default for every user (so turning this off is not an option as they might use for other documents)</p>
<p>- AutoSave feature clashes with long macros and this causes problems</p>
<p>- The solution for this was to write a VBA line to turn off AutoSave for this Excel document upon document opening. However the user can still accidentally re-click the button and AutoSave will be active again</p>
<p>- The biggest problem is however is the new co-authoring. I can't seem to change the way the document is shared and I can't get to the option window for "Share this Workbook", it is just greyed out and says "Unshare Workbook", as it is already shared.</p>
<p>- People no longer get the option to view as read only, everyone becomes exclusive editor, so I have multiple people that can click VBA buttons and once they press save, oooohhhh goodness, Excel just can't handle the pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So the two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Am I able to grey out the AutoSave option for my Excel document only via VBA?</p>
<p>1.1. Or is there another option from my programming end, that will stop the user re-enabling AutoSave feature after it has been turned-off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How do I stop the co-authoring for my Excel Document only?</p>
<p>2.1. Workbook.UserStatus function doesn't pick up any additional users that are co-authoring the document apart from the single user that runs the code for some reason? For Example: I open the document and 10 others open it, we are all "editing" the document.
 I run the UserStatus function to check for active users on the Excel Document, it returns just me and no one else, it just doesn't see anyone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice and help would be appreciated. I'm now relying on people being more vigilant but it is human nature to miss things and not pay attention so this has just increased room for error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ilya</p>

<p>Hi IIya,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for providing more detailed information to us. And sorry for misunderstanding your request. Based on your description on each request, I will answer it one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. If you don't want to allow AutoSave function just on this individual Excel document, you can switch off AutoSave on Quick Access Toolbar, but this action still need to performed by users themselves.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. To meet your request, the only way is to disable co-authoring which means you need to roll back to the previous version.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thus, to meet all the requests you mentioned above, the only suggested way is to roll back to the previous version you used to use. You can follow the steps in this article to revert
 to an earlier version: </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2770432/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2013-or-office-2016-clic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to revert to an earlier version of Office 2016 Click-to-Run</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

            <p>It's normal if a website does not recognize when Internet explorer is using Compatibility view,</p>
<p>The solution might be to remove comp-view lists downloading automatically from Microsoft,<font color="#000000">

<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p>If you have a website that does not appear as it should add it to the comp-view list yourself that way it's easier to remove it in the future,</p>
<p>By going to Gear symbol on the top right and Comp-view setting,</p>
<p>If your already on the site all you have to do is click on the Add button and close the page.</p>
<p>Then hit the F5 key to Refresh the existing page,</p>
<p>To remove a site return to the settings page scroll the list and click on the sites listing and Remove.</p>

    <title>Smaller image in Outlook 2016 reading pane - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darren tai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Smaller image in Outlook 2016 reading pane</h2>
                    <div>Hello, I am using Microsoft surface pro4 and I have an issue with Outlook 2016 that the image shown in reading pane looks compressed and smaller than normal. it is probably not my setting problem, it seems outlook will automatically compress the image.
 I have tried with older version of outlook/ outlook for Mac for SAME email,&nbsp; none of those has this issue. Is there any way to get this resolved?</div>

<div>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try reproducing this issue and get no luck. Regarding this issue, do you mean that the image is smaller than normal one in Outlook 2016 even if we keep the zoom: 100%?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4905582-89f1-4281-a42f-a4862b3ab32a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4905582-89f1-4281-a42f-a4862b3ab32a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, can you provide some screenshots on this symptom?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please click View &gt; Current View &gt;View Settings &gt; Other Settings &gt; and untick the Use compact layout option to see if the issue can be improved?</p>

            <p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your info</p>
<p>Yes I mean the&nbsp;image is smaller than normal even the zoom is 100%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot fix the problem by cancelling compact layout</p>
<p>
</p><p>see the email below I received from my friend</p>
<p>his image of screenshot is small</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6efdab8-baab-43ab-9970-73c44c5f6123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6efdab8-baab-43ab-9970-73c44c5f6123" /></a></p>
<p>After I follow his method by viewing message in browser, the image size&nbsp;became normal as below</p>
<p>this is the image size I want, however, I don't like to view by browser every time..</p>
<p>Is there&nbsp;any&nbsp;better solution?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

            <p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the screenshots, we can see that this image is inserted into the body of the message instead of attaching it as a copy. &nbsp;So I’m wondering if this issue happen to an image which is attached as a copy.</p>
<p>Does this issue happen to all images or a particular one? Have you tried changing the display settings on your Microsoft surface pro4 system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image files that are attached as a copy do not have such problem. It does not seem compressed.</p>
<p>But ALL the image/pictures that are inserted into message body get smaller than normal in my outlook unless I open the message by browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I captured my display setting below for your information, seems nothing wrong with these settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suspect Outlook is trying to&nbsp;resize the images inserted to&nbsp;message body so&nbsp;the pic&nbsp;looks with higher resolution, and it may only happen with Surface pro 4 because the display resolution is very high, what do you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Darren</p>

            <p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I would suspect Outlook is trying to resize the images inserted to message body so the pic looks with higher resolution,”</p>
<p>Yes , another common cause for screenshots to become smaller is when you are using screen setting with a dpi value which is higher than the default 96dpi.</p>
<p>This issue usually happens when you are using a picture other than 96dpi.When inserting a picture, Outlook will rescale the image as if it was a 96dpi image. This means that if you have a picture of 150dpi with a height of 88px, it will be displayed
 as an image of 56px high;88px/150dpi * 96dpi = 56px</p>

    <title>Thoughts on Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herodotus2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thoughts on Win10</h2>
                    <p>Some initial thoughts on Win10;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) much faster than winXP and Win7 with lower impact on a host when running in a VM</p>
<p>2) the new store app that gets invoked for items in start menu is tacky and annoying. there should be ONLY one&nbsp; way to get to store not dozens. selecting games form the start menu should NOT take you to the store. that is extremely bad UI design,.</p>
<p>3) mail app was brain dead. too much wasted space. no way to change fonts and sizing. icons are meaningless. basically yucky. first thing I did was install Thunderbird because MS on app was so unbelievably bad.</p>
<p>4) the new popmenu (e.g. for poweroff) looks likeX11 Xlib menus from 1990. you have to be kidding MS. whoever in your UI department thinks that is a modern elegant way to menu needs to spend some time with Motif and Athena widgets. this is NOT progress.
 this is a major step backwards for MS. </p>
<p>5) the o/s tries to simplify things (e.g. PC Settings) and it only serves to frustrate the user. take a lesson from Apple with Mavericks and Yosemite. That is how UI clarity and simplification are done,&nbsp; Win8/Win10 is a HUGE step backwards. If I wanted to
 use Athena Widgets again I would run Linux</p>
<p>6) too much white space and text&nbsp;on the screen for no reason.</p>
<p>7) the store apps "lock" on the system and I have to use task manager to kill it to get the UI back under control</p>
<p>8) the new Start Menu active tiles are pretty cool. most of the other UI element in win10 are a step backwards. but at least the start menu is back so it will probably do marginally better than win8/8.1 did&nbsp;in the market. corporations are going to hate this
 o/s - too much useless UI change for NO VALUE, too much retraining for NO VALUE. I showed the UI to some friends this weekend and the response from ALL of them was wow how tacky. yuck. looks like the 1980s.&nbsp; -- this is not good MS.</p>
<p>9) poweroff and my name disappears occasionally from start menu</p>
<p>10) remove ALL the "all programs" options that go to the app store. stupid and misleading for users. bad UI design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please please please bring back shading and some light 3D effects for things like buttons. the overuse of "hyperlinks" as a replacement for button is a major UI faux pas.</p>
<p>

            This seems like a flawed design and should be fixed. Why would you call the nav element that triggers the dropdown "Thumbnails" if it doesn't show thumbnails? That's absurd.&nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft Word Printing Issue on Android Galaxy S4</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently acquired an HP DeskJet 2542 printer which allows wireless printing and I've managed to print with Microsoft Word on my laptop just fine. However, when I tap "print" on my Android phone using the Word app, all I get is an ongoing message "Searching
 for printers". I've downloaded the all of the HP printer apps on the Play Store and some of them could not recognize my printer as well. I've even tried the main app HP e-print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 - Cursor Jumps while typing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three very strange problems while using word 2016 (as part of office 365) under Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) while I type, the cursor bounces a few characters back, or to the end of the line. It really makes typing paragraphs a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) impossible to select certain&nbsp;lines, words, or characters with the mouse. I need to select some other lines first, and then select the desired word etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) while typing in Hebrew, any number or special character (such as %, !,&nbsp;&amp; etc.) typed at the beginning of a line, is typed backward. for example - 54% is showed as %54. this only occurs if the number and the special character are at the very beginning
 of the line (right side of the page, as I type in Hebrew).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to look for solutions online but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ziv</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 5k display full screen chart hangs</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already had that question on the German Microsoft site but no answer so far!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel hangs if you open a "Chart" (Diagrammblatt) in full Screen&nbsp;Modus on a 5K monitor.</p>
<p>Excel also hangs if the Excel window is close to full screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Easy table on a spreadsheet with two rows and some values. </p>
<p>2. Diagram of these data in a separate "Chart".</p>
<p>3. Excel hangs showing the "Chart".</p>
<p>4. It is not possible to Change in another sheet anymore.</p>
<p>5. Taskmanager is showing about 20% CPU duty time for Excel</p>
<p>6. GPU load about 30%</p>
<p>7. Excel will not recover if you wait.</p>
<p>8. Deactivated GPU support in Excel doesn't solve the problem. =&gt; about 40% CPU duty time</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This effect is independent from size of the Excel file. </p>
<p>Excel doesn't hang in the spreadsheets. Even if they are larger.</p>
<p>In a smaller resolution the effect doesn't occur.</p>
<p>In smaller windows the effect doesn't occur.</p>

            <p>I have had a similar problem with both 4k and 3k screens: charts hang every time and Excel spins with a substantial CPU load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already had to roll back to Excel 2010 for my Bloomberg Terminal machine as the constant useless feature updates made 2016 unstable to the point of actually crashing frequently - I don't remember the last time Excel 2010 crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the canned responses by what seem to be level zero Microsoft drones I have read on these forums when searching for answers to myriad other problems with Office 2016 / OneDrive / Windows 10 I wouldn't hold out much hope for anything even vaguely approaching
 a solution.</p>

            <p>Excel freezes/hangs using 4k monitor when powersaving for either display or computer occurs. Apparently after "restart" the program is frozen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent much time testing different display port cables versus hdmi and finally realized that if I am to use displayport, which is necessary to achieve a 60 hz response rate, I will have to live with excel freezing. I use excel 2013, a NUC 4i7RYH w/Intel
 6100 Iris graphics and an ACER 4k monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the monitor or computer go into powersave mode, it is that action which results in a frozen excel spreadsheet. The problem does not seem to appear with other office apps. And yes this is irrgardles of on/off of "hardware acceleration".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My spreadsheet is a very small file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A recent Intel-supplied graphic driver update for my NUC may have solved this problem as of Aug 2017. I have not yet fully tested, but some of the other graphics minor glitches seems to have disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very sorry to say that my trusty MacBook Pro with a Retina display which is also 4k has never had a problem with any MS product (all Office for Mac) running in Mac OS, nor do I have any problems running Windows only programs within Parallels at 4k resolution
 on the MacBook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may very well be right, that MS just has not fully attended to this....certainly surprising since they seem to be competing against these Retina laptops and iMacs with the surface devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But also, over the years, it does seem as if Apple, by controlling hardware and software, may have achieved an overall better quality array of devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS truly wants to compete against Apple, they have to do a little better than they are doing. I say this, and I have been a devout windows user from CPM days, and only in the last two years have I gravitated to Macs, simply because of the quality of the
 hardware and especially the Retina displays. It is inconvenient running a windows-only program in Parallels, but that is the only downside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I think Carbon Copy Cloner for Mac is a better backup solution than MS has offered for Windows.</p>

</p><p>Excel freezes when you view the chart as a single sheet when viewing on the second monitor. It doesn't matter on the file size. 2 datapoints in a spreadsheet and a simple graph. It does not do this when viewing on the laptop display.</p>

</p><p>When Excel freezes, if you undock the laptop from the docking station Excel will be moved to the laptop display. When that happens Excel is no longer frozen. You can save your file, switch tabs to another tab that doesn't have the graph display, re-dock
 the laptop and move Excel back to the monitor and continue working.</p>

<p>There is a work around which I found works on the Microsoft Surface Studio and some other configurations including the Dell 5k.&nbsp; The trick is reduce the size of the excel windown which reduces the number of pixels excel writes to the screen.&nbsp; With the Surface
 Studio and the Dell it works when the window is about 2/3 of full screen but you have to experiment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a real pain to do this.&nbsp; After more than a year MS's premier hardware product does not work with their premier software product.&nbsp; That does not speak well for the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.&nbsp; There is a bug using the Surface Studio with Word as well.</p>

    <title>protect a form in Word for Mac 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> canonpix  say:</h3>
<h2>            protect a form in Word for Mac 2011</h2>
                    <p>I have created fairly complex registration forms with editable text fields. I went to Word &gt; Preferences&gt; chose to protect Forms and password protected the forms. The text of the questions on the registration form is not editable, but if a user places their
 cursor NEXT to an editable text box and hits Enter, they are able to add an additional blank row to the form table.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to lock the form so users are ONLY able to edit the form's text fields and not change the layout or anything else?</p>

            I can't reproduce that behavior. Are you sure it's an extra table row and not a blank line entered as part of the text field?

            <p>I can't reproduce as stated either, and think the user is probably adding a new line into the field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I do not know how to stop that on Mac Word. Microsoft describes a set of macros at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=211219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=211219</a>&nbsp;to re-assign the Enter key. These macros will work on Mac Word 2011,
 but unfortunately, they do not also disable the fn-Enter key, and right now I cannot see how to do so. (For others here, I thought it might be possible to combine key 63 with the wdKeyReturn key, but that fails).<br />
<br />
Another possibility would be to strip characters such as CR from the string. That would also require a macro, e.g.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub eliminateExtraLines()<br />
Dim s As String</p>
<p>s = ActiveDocument.FormFields(Selection.Bookmarks(1).Name.Result<br />
<span>' replace anything that causes spill onto more than one line.</span></p>
<p><span>' there could be other codes...<br />
s = Replace(s, vbCr, "") ' resulting from Enter</span><br />
</p>
<p>s = Replace(s, vbVerticalTab, "") ' resulting from a hard newline<br />
ActiveDocument.FormFields(Selection.Bookmarks(1).Name).Result = s<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would probably nee to put this macro in the template that your forms are generated from. For each form field you need to check, you would edit the field's properties and specify the macro under "Run macro on Exit"<br />
<br />
If you cannot use macros, I suspect that the best you can do is set the relevant rows in your table to a fixed height. That does not prevent the user from entering extra lines, but it does prevent the extra text from appearing.&nbsp;</p>

            Additional to Peter's last suggestion [limiting row height] it may help to restrict each field properties to a specific number of characters appropriate for the field. That will help prevent a user entering "hidden" content.<br />

            I thought it was an extra row created in the table, since the entire document IS a table. It definitely is not the editable text box getting bigger. The editable text box remains the same size, unchanged and a blank space is created beneath it, full width
 of the table. For example, the top line of the form (row one) is made in a table that has editable fields for Name, Address, City, State, Zip. When I click immediately to the right or to the left of one of the editable fields, I can hit Enter and a new, blank
 "row" is created in the row or space below row one. If I hit Enter again, now there are 2 blank rows beneath Name, Address, City, State, Zip. I hope this might clarify what is happening.<br />

<li>Press <strong>Option F9</strong> (for laptops, usually <strong>Option Fn F9</strong>) or select

            <p>Thank you so much for diligently trying to help! I appreciate your kindness and expertise. I clicked after a text field and entered a Return.</p>
<p>Then, as suggested, I selected <em>Word &gt; Preferences &gt; View &gt; Field Codes</em>. The return did not disappear and was not replaced by
<strong>{FORMTEXT}</strong></p>
<p>With gridlines turned on, the return deepens the cell by a line, but does not alter the text field within the same cell.</p>
<p>---The screenshot below is before I add a return to the cell containing the Name field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>---This second screenshot is after I add a return after the Name field. You can see the black cursor justified left under Name, to me, indicating a new "row", blank space, whatever it should be called.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I've done an injustice calling this phenomenon by the incorrect name, but it still remains problematic as it causes a tight, one-page form to print on two pages (sometimes 3 or 4, depending on how many times and in what location they've added a return).
 Parents are to be printing forms at home from a website, and they are confused when the printed piece is so disjointed, too many pages and doesn't look like it did onscreen.</p>
<p>I thank you again for your kind attention.</p>

            <p>I believe it's deceiving because the common interpretation is that a <em>Text Box</em> Form Control is a
<em>container</em> similar to a Text Box drawing object. In reality, it's more like an expandable
<em>placeholder</em> which is replaced by the typed content. That's why you get no response from Option+F9 after pressing
<em>return</em> -- at that point the control has been replaced by a carriage return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another point that can be misleading is that the the Form Shading will not extend beyond the one line on which it is inserted unless the content inserted on that line actually wraps to another line. IOW, pressing return to create a paragraph break extends
 the field but not the shading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the display of Fields cannot be toggled On while Protection is in force.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly no injustice has been done :-), but our ability to respond effectively relies on the accuracy of the questioner's description of what's happening. I understand that the net result may seem the same, but there is a major technical distinction between
 the height of a row increasing and having a new row appended to the table. Accordingly, the approach to resolution of the issue would differ significantly.</p>

<p>As stated, you need to unprotect the form before you can see the field codes, but r<span>eturns are not shaded when entered in forms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could specify a fixed height for the row (14 pts in the example below). However, typing Enter will cause the cursor to go out of sight. Furthermore, you can apply a monospaced font to the cell (Courier 12 pt, see below) to determine its character length
 by entering digits, then specify that total as the maximum length of the field (20 in this example):</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I've tried the links you've sent but there no use! My account is locked and have no idea what to do or who to turn to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive sent so many emails/ filled out forms etc to try and get this resolved and keep hitting a brick wall! I'm totally at my wits end over this! Have even cried I'm that stressed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im so annoyed/angry for Microsoft for doing this to me! They've left me essentially stranded the other side of the world with NO HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you give me any other info that may help me? &nbsp;Also do you have a complaints department I can contact as I feel I can't let this go?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Lee</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've still had no luck gaining access to my hotmail account since Sept 2014! I've officially given up, as trying to get help from Microsoft is like getting blood out a stone! I've filled out I don't know how many of them ridiculous forms but it's still not
 good enough! I even offered to send a sample of my DNA to prove it's me! I was in the same predicament as you with all my personal info, travel info, bank info, important emails, contacts, work stuff etc saved on my hotmail with no way of accessing it! Microsoft
 have been so unhelpful! I'm the other side of the world and nothing's been done to help me get back into my hotmail account and by the looks of it, I never will again! Shame on you Microsoft!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to write back?</p>
<p>

    <title>Turn off update notifications in Office 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stonesthoreau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off update notifications in Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>Every single time I open a document, the window happily asks/tells/begs me to update my 2013 to 2016. It's annoying and obtrusive. Anyone know any workarounds to this problem? &nbsp;I'm open to any savvy regedit skills, as long as I can get this notification
 gone like yesterday. I am running windows 7, and refuse to update to W10 or office 2016, as I have run into many bugs within each of these "updates". &nbsp;Much thanks in advance!</p>

 an unacceptable solution. &nbsp;Anything else you can think of?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are many reasons to postpone or opt out of an upgrade from Office 2013 to 2016.&nbsp; One would be update planning for multiple users.&nbsp; Another would be that newer versions may take a while to support all of the features available in a previous version.&nbsp;
 Additionally, newer versions may have hardware or software requirements beyond a device's capability.&nbsp; A single subscriber could desire an update on one device and not another.</p>

<h2>            Outlook and Onedrive</h2>
                    
<p>This is starting to look like a joke. Outlook 2016 as had fullscreen view then removed added again and then removed again. Do Microsoft know what they are doing? &nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to one drive for business, I really don´t know what to say. it is after 11 months a mess that has no ending as it seems today. . It is interesting to se when we will get a working one drive client, maybe in the next 12 months, if we are lucky.</p>
<p>In all the years I have used office for pc an mac I have never seen this kind of mess.</p>
<p>When will Office for Mac be a program that works and can be trusted again?</p>

<p>I se that you are referring to a preview, that has to be the second preview since the first was released in january this year. so Microsoft has used about 11 months to give us a second preview, the question is stil unanswered when will we get a full working
 release?</p>
<p>About outlook full screen view I se that you not giving me any answer. What is happening with this?</p>
