    <title>Why does word selection still include the trailing space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> betalogue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does word selection still include the trailing space</h2>
                    <p>In Word, if you double-click on a word to select it in its entirety (or use keyboard shortcuts for word-by-word selection, i.e. option-shift-Left/Right), if the word is followed by a trailing space, the trailing space is
<strong>also</strong> selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) historically, that's what Word has always done</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) over the years, Microsoft has added "special" exceptions that ignore that selected trailing space for certain functions; for instance, if you apply underlining to a word thus selected, Word does not apply underlining to the trailing space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, even with #2 taken into account, there are still multiple situations where Word applies something to the trailing space when it shouldn't. For instance, if you apply a hyperlink to such a word selection, you get the hyperlink functionality and underlining
 for the trailing space as well:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fae87f7a-4953-4965-8eb7-b9458f6de73f" /></p>
<p>And this is just one particular example. There are numerous other character-level options that do not benefit from the special exceptions that Word makes for a few formatting options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is NO OTHER APPLICATION on my Mac that also selects the trailing space when using word-by-word selection. Word-by-word selection selects the word itself, and the word only. Those applications' behaviour is obviously the
<strong>right</strong> thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, because of this Word-specific behaviour, if you copy a selection and paste it somewhere else (a web form, for example), you often end up with an undesirable trailing space!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;question is therefore: Why on earth does Word still insist on selecting the trailing space in word-by-word selection (whether with the mouse or with the keyboard)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that there is no excuse for this non-standard behaviour, and that its persistence is an on-going cause of undesirable side effects and character-level trouble for writers and editors in Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your only answer is, "Because that's the way it is", I am afraid I am not particularly interested in that answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016&#58; how to show the full name of attachments instead of &#39;Modern&#39; &#34;buttons&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>with the upgrade (actually a downgrade imho) from OL 2013 to OL 2016 the attachment names/objects now show as buttons. I use attachments with long names to make the file names self-explanatory. Unfortunately the buttons do not show the full name of the attached
 files unless you hover on them, which is a loss of time when you have 6 or 7 attachments in one email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change the setting of OL 2016 so that the attachments names are shown in full as usual in OL?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            <p>Yes, I can't believe how poorly thought out this new feature is. The biggest problem I am having is that I cannot seem to select all the attachments to an e-mail in order to delete them in one go. I only seem to be able to select them one at a time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The functionality of Outlook with regard to attachments has always been surprisingly poor. Other programs I have used have the ability to automatically save attachments to a folder and remove them automatically. Is this possible in Outlook?</p>

<h2>            Help please&#63; Outlook 2011 for Mac stuck on &#39;updating message list&#39; after deleting 1000&#39;s of emails</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been searching online for an answer and can't find one - hopefully someone can help...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently updated to Yosemite and decided on a general clear-out, so went through 1000's of documents, photos, emails, etc. I ended up deleting the all of the emails in my 'deleted items' folder. Since then, when I go into Outlook and hit the 'send/receive'
 tab it logs on as normal, but then gets stuck on 'updating message list' - it shows me that there are emails and how many, but will not download them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any experience of this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

</p><p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>

            Assuming you are indeed using formfields and not content controls, access the formfield properties and make sure the formfield has a bookmark name and that the 'calculate on exit' property is checked. Then, wherever you want the data replicated, incert
 a cross-reference to the formfield's bookmark name. Once you're done, apply the forms protection to the document and the updates will occur automatically.

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I find this forum is very helpful to all nokia users.</p>
<p>My query is regarding Nokia X6.</p>
<p>I am using Nokia PC suit for connecting my phone with PC.</p>
<p>every time when I download songs or movie from PC and &nbsp;unplugged my mobile there is one problem.</p>
<p>When I open music folder there is message " USB connection active"</p>
<p>this happened even I unplugged my mobile.</p>
<p>It needs to restart my mobile every time.</p>
<p>Can any one suggest good solution to avoid this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hm, sounds weirdly...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just tried to reproduce your problem by 1) plugging via USB-port 2) choosing "PC Suite" 3) shifting a song into my music folder on the mass storage 4) unplugged it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, If I open the music player during the connecting, it gives me the same message "USB connection active". But after I've shifted the music file onto my phone and unplugged it, the message disappears after a few seconds, how it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- What's your operating system?</p>
<p>- Have you tried to reinstall drivers (and Ovi Suite*)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Ovi Suite isn't required to shift music/videos to your phone via "PC Suite" connection, have you tired to just shift the data via Windows-Explorer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Do have the latest firmware on your phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise I would just give you the hint to use the "mass storage" connection instead ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry that I couldn't help you so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear jepjep,</p>

<p>(1) i attached my phone with data cable.</p>

<p>(3) unplugged my phone after transferring all music files.</p>

<p>In this case, the only suggestion I can give you, is to either update your firmware (if available) or to make a hard reset by typing *#7370#. In both terms all of your data on the phone could/will get lost, so it's necessary to make a BACKUP before!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<blockquote>yes, that happens en i them have the contactlist of sim 2, but when i change the sims&nbsp;back its gone</blockquote>
<br />
Most devices that use a SIM have a SIM Manager taht will allow you to either save a contact to the SIM or save it to Contacts on the device.&nbsp; It is a pretty simple process so&nbsp;you need to follow what FrankyNL said and copy the Contacts to the device and you
 will be good to go.

            So Put SIM1 and copy contact from SIM1 to Phone. Remove SIM1 and put SIM2 copy contacts from SIM2 to Phone. Put both SIMs to phone and you will have all contact accessible because they will be in Phone.

<h2>            Test migration hybrid Exchange 2010 - fail - Unsupported recipient type &#39;Mailbox&#39; provided. Only &#39;Mailuser&#39; is supported for this migration type</h2>
                    
<p>I have run the Migration Wizard for Exchange - downloaded the latest.</p>
<p>I was not sure about some of the settings as all of our mail goes to our firewall/antispam/virus as our endpoint and then forwarded on to our Exchange (2010) server. &nbsp;Was not sure if the end points mentioned in the wizard were meant to be our MX record or
 specifically for our Exchange server which we DNAT through the firewall for Outlook Web Access/EAS. &nbsp;Maybe this is my first issue?</p>
<p>When I try and run a migration - I am trying to test moving myself over - I am the Admin account so my email address for my domain is already set up in Office 365 and the domain is verified. &nbsp;I exist as a mailbox on Exchange Online AND local server.</p>
<p>The migration fails with the error&nbsp;Unsupported recipient type 'Mailbox' provided. Only 'Mailuser' is supported for this migration type.</p>
<p>Is this because I exist in both places? &nbsp;How can I remove my mailbox on O365 if this is the case to successfully migrate over my mailbox?</p>
<p>Thank you for any insight into where I am probably going wrong!</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>A mailbox must be unique, If you have another admin on Office 365 and you do not have content on that mailbox that is in Office 365, you can delete it to successfully migrate your mailbox.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Yes, if the affected users have mailboxes on both on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online, it could lead to the issue. When you completed Exchange Hybrid configuration, a user's mailbox locates on your on-premises Exchange server and the user is synced
 to the cloud as a mail user by Dirsync or Azure AD connector tool. After you run the mailbox move wizard, the mailbox is moved to the cloud and converted to mail user in your on-premises.So the user should have only one mailbox in Exchange Hybrid.</p>
<p>From the error message, the mailbox migration failed because there is an existing cloud mailbox already for the user. So please go to Office 365 Exchange admin center
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/ecp</a> to&nbsp;check if the affected users are mail users. You can also run the Get-User cmdlet after you connect your PowerShell to Exchange Online.</p>
<p>If the affected users are not mail users, it is considered as the root cause. In this situation, it is suggested you delete the users and reprovision the mail users by Dirsync. You can refer to the steps below.</p>
<p>1.Filter the affected users in Dirsync. You can move the user accounts to a filtered OU so that they won't be synced to Office 365.
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/praveenkumar/2014/04/11/how-to-do-ou-based-filtering-in-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/praveenkumar/2014/04/11/how-to-do-ou-based-filtering-in-office-365/</a>
<br />
2.The filtered users will be moved to Office 365 Recyclebin. You can delete the user accounts including the cloud mailboxes from Recyclebin using the Remove-MsolUser -RemoveFromRecycleBin -Force.<br />
3.Move the users back to the previous OU and force Dirsync to sync the users back. The user will be synced back to Office 365 as mail users.</p>
<p>After these steps, please re-run the migration wizard again. If you run into any problems, please let us known. If there is any error message, please provide it here.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Alex</p>

<p>Hi Alex and thank you for your help!!</p>
<p>I guess this is where I screwed up then. &nbsp;I registered my email address as the initial and only admin so I presume I cannot delete myself without causing more issues. &nbsp;Can I just remove the mailbox on my O365 account and then migrate it over?</p>
<p>I bought just a few licenses to pilot O365 before committing our organization so this was my initial test to see how we could migrate mailboxes.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>You can create another admin, then after that you can move your mailbox. If your user is already synced you can just remove your mailbox and migrate it again.</p>

            With Windows 10 Preview Build I have been Dual Booting with Windows 7 for almost 2 years and both are Activated and running. I think if I were to stop Preview Builds I imagine the Windows 7 License would be sacrificed. But I have not decided that Windows
 10 is the OS I want as the only one on the computer. I may wait and just buy it when or&nbsp;if ever it becomes stable enough and all the apps that come with it work the way they should.

            <p>Some Windows 10 Pro includes downgrade rights to run Windows 7 Pro or Windows 8.1 Pro for as long as these versions are supported by Microsoft.&nbsp; Section 7 of the Microsoft Software License Terms:<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>7.&nbsp;Downgrade Rights.</strong> If you acquired a device from a manufacturer or installer with a Professional version of Windows preinstalled on it, you may use either a Windows 8.1 Pro or Windows 7 Professional version, but
 only for so long as Microsoft provides support for that earlier version as set forth in (aka.ms/windowslifecycle). This agreement applies to your use of the earlier versions. If the earlier version includes different components, any terms for those components
 in the agreement that comes with the earlier version apply to your use of such components. Neither the manufacturer or installer, nor Microsoft, is obligated to supply earlier versions to you. You must obtain the earlier version separately, for which you may
 be charged a fee. At any time, you may replace an earlier version with the version you originally acquired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC shipped with Windows 7 Ultimate, so I believe this qualifies as a Professional version.&nbsp; I have it installed and activated on a partition, but I don't use it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't think that I have&nbsp;even done Windows Updates on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key thing is that once your Windows 10 device has been recognized as having Digital Entitlement to activate Windows 10, you should be able to activate that same Edition of&nbsp;Windows 10 on it at any time in future, even if you run another OS for a while.&nbsp;
 I would first test that a clean install of Windows 10 activates as expected, before feeling confident about this for a particular device.&nbsp; For example, I had an activated copy of Windows 10 Pro on a partition on my wife's PC, but I could not clean install
 Pro.&nbsp; Her PC has Windows 10 Home activated and is able to clean install and activate Home.</p>

    <title>Office Home and Student 2011 on MacBook Pro Won&#39;t Open Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> linzee2587  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Home and Student 2011 on MacBook Pro Won&#39;t Open Online Documents</h2>
                    I just got a new MacBook Pro and the indefinite version of Office Home and Student 2011 from Best Buy last week. &nbsp;I installed the Office suite using my product key and Word, Excel and PPT are all working fine. &nbsp;However, every time I try to open a document
 online, I see the pop-up box I saw when I installed the software - it's prompting me to enter my product key and/or my login info in order to continue. &nbsp;When I do, it says my product key isn't valid and that my login info is incorrect. &nbsp;My Microsoft login
 info that I used on this site is obviously working because I'm posting here, and my product key is obviously valid because the program is downloaded and working on my Mac, except for the downloading of online documents.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm assuming I'm not the only one with this same problem, but the other threads I saw here that are related to this issue were posted by people who have been using their version of Office for a while, and just recently they're having this problem with
 viewing documents from the internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm a third year law student so it's critical that this issue resolves itself ASAP. &nbsp;I've called Microsoft now four times today, and get someone who barely speaks English every time, and also is a Windows rep and not a Mac person. &nbsp;Please help!!</div>

            I'm downloading the files from my law school's website (the equivalent of Blackboard, TWEN, etc. if you're familiar with those sites). &nbsp;The type of extension is .docx. &nbsp;What's weird though is that last night, I finally got someone from Microsoft to remote
 into my Mac, and she was able to open some files with that extension, but others wouldn't open.
<div><br />
<div>After spending 4-5 hours collectively yesterday on the phone with Microsoft (and 4-5 reps from India later), the last Mac rep concluded that Office Home and Student 2011 for Mac doesn't include the ability to be able to download documents from the internet??
 &nbsp;Thus, the rep told me multiple times that I "must upgrade to Office 365 for $99/year in order to use that function." &nbsp;I'm sorry, but that answer is 100% unacceptable and 100% untrue! &nbsp;When she was in my Mac, she replicated the problem the same way I'd described
 it to her, and that was her legit conclusion. &nbsp;It doesn't seem to matter where I try to download the documents from - be it a random Google document from a Google search, or something from my school's site - it's just not working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Idk if this helps, but when I click download, normally the file should jump down into the task bar at the bottom of my screen and show that it's downloading. &nbsp;Well, my Mac is skipping that part - instead, when I click download, it automatically tries to
 access Word, and even when Word is already open, it just shows that same box again, which is asking for my product key and login info. &nbsp;Funny that the woman on the phone last night refused to try my product key or login code on that screen, so that I could
 show her it's saying the two are invalid when they clearly aren't.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I haven't tried to uninstall and reinstall it yet. &nbsp;Do you think I should? &nbsp;I'm leary of doing that because this is a brand new Mac and brand new Office suite, so I just don't understand how it can't be working.</div>

            Updating to office 365 would definitely not help, so i am not sure why that was suggested.<br />
That said, if some open and some dont, it cant be an issue with the application as well.<br />
Just one more thing to check, you are sure that you never had a trial version of office or older version installed, right?<br />

            Idk if you'd count this as being "resolved," but yes, I guess I kind of fixed the problem? &nbsp;I brought my Mac into my work and had our tech guy help. &nbsp;We first downloaded an uninstall app for the Mac. &nbsp;Macs don't really have a way to truly uninstall programs
 in the same way that PCs do, so definitely get an uninstall app to redo you Office install. &nbsp;So after it was uninstalled, we did the reinstall ... everything went the same as it had the first time around, except I did get a few extra screens at the end of
 the install that I hadn't got the first time. &nbsp;No idea why. &nbsp;After all that, I tried to open an online doc, got the same window asking for my ID and/or product key ... input both ... this time, instead of me getting messages saying both were invalid, I was
 redirected to a page on Microsoft's website to purchase Microsoft Home and Office Business or whatever it's called.
<div><br />
<div>So we concluded that the woman at Microsoft was somewhat correct - there are certain kinds of documents that can't be opened online with Home and Student. &nbsp;We think the documents are those that are either shared (meaning multiple people can edit them)
 or simply not locked as "read only" documents. &nbsp;There's a way around buying the upgrade, though. &nbsp;If you right click on the document link on your Mac, there's a different option for downloading there. &nbsp;It takes an extra step to open, but you will be able to
 open ALL types of docs from the internet if you just take that extra step each time.</div>

            Congratulations on your persistence :-)<br />
<br />
Your conclusion about the Home &amp; Student edition is correct -- It is not enabled for online access to documents. The Home &amp; Business as well as the Office 365 Home Premium editions do have online access capability. The redirect is intended to entice you to
 upgrade to one of those editions.<br />
<br />
What your "workaround" amounts to is that you are downloading the file to your local HD. You're then able to open the downloaded copy without a problem... It's just that any changes you make are saved to the local copy, not to the online source file.<br />

            If you re-enter your MS Office product key it will clear this pop-up window. &nbsp;I recently migrated to a new hard drive and think it may have been caused by that. &nbsp;not sure.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac 15.23 &#40;160601&#41; - Copy &#38; Paste image results in HUGE image</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>Since upgrading to Outlook Mac 15.22/15.23 on my Mac Mini (non-Retina) I have a new issue:<br />
<br />
I often copy &amp; paste graphics into HTML emails and this has worked fairly well on past builds. &nbsp;It appears with the recent editor changes that something has gotten botched. &nbsp;Now, when I copy an image (usually a screenshot taken via the built-in Cmd-Shift-4
 shortcut) when I paste it into the email body, it appears enlarged by around 30%. &nbsp;I can't tell for sure if the recipient also sees this enlargement or if it is only during my composition. But, I did send a test email to my Gmail account and the picture appeared
 enlarged there as well so I suspect that everyone sees it blown up.<br />
<br />
I took some screenshots to illustrate what I am talking about.&nbsp;Here's a screenshot of the "About" box for Outlook, the original, and then the same image from the clipboard, simply pasted into a new email:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13b3553e-8973-4932-b79e-39baf54e5253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13b3553e-8973-4932-b79e-39baf54e5253" /></a><br />
<br />
<em>(note, the image above depicts 15.22 but the bug first appeared there and has not been fixed as of 15.23-160601)</em><br />
<br />
Now, I right-clicked and chose "Size &amp; Position" on that image and scaled it down to 70%, and it now more or less matches the source (it's still "blurry" though)<br />

This is a pretty irritating bug because I do a lot of QA and am always pasting in screenshots to emails. &nbsp;Please fix!!<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm trying to create a simple iif statement to label a person whose been here for a full year as "1" if not then its "0" using : iff([salary]&gt;0,1,0). however its not working i'm guessing due to everything is default text fomat. is there a way to make this
 work without change the format?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for business continuous problems</h2>
                    
<p>Dear all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope someone can tell us what is going on and how to sort it because OneDrive for Business is driving us mad. In the last few weeks my colleagues and myself have had numerous issues with OneDrive not synchronising. The latest situation on my computer
 (after at least 3 rounds of repair - stop synchronising - start synchronising a library, including clearing the OneDrive for Business cache and removing authenticated credentials) is that it worked this morning, until I started adding files to my OneDrive
 folder and then it started synchronising and got stuck. I have since removed those files again and it now seems stuck in "processing changes". Last week the OneDrive for Business app reported to be "up to date" but there were some files online that were nowhere
 in sight on my OneDrive folder on the computer...</p>
<p>We started using OneDrive to get rid of backups and share documents, but it has also cost us a lot of time with synchronising issues. Every time there is a serious problem we have to repair, which - instead of focussing on the few files not in sync - just
 downloads everything again. At 7.000 files this takes for ever, it makes my computer ridiculously slow and in the mean time I'm stuck working. I can do a few things using my tablet, but I have also found (somewhere) in support documents that it is best not
 to work in the OneDrive folder while synchronisation issues are being sorted so that basically makes me technically handicapped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help and get this sorted once and for all!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sofie&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi sofie,</p>
<p>thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>i understand it's a poor experience. i hope you'll stick with it and continue to investigate this issue with us.</p>
<p>firstly, please check all the files especially those un-synced or stuck files referring to the kb article below, we need to remove or rename those unsupported files.<br />

<p>if the issue persists, i'd like to collect the following information:<br />
1.when you right-click the onedrive for business icon on the task bar, can you click view sync problems? is there a yellow mark in the icon? if yes, please click view sync problems to check the sync problems and capture a screenshot for the pop-up.<br />
2.the screenshot for those files in the cloud which cannot be synced to your local synced folder.<br />
3.the screenshots for your synced folder.<br />
4.the version of your office suite and onedrive for business.<br />
for the office suite, open one of the office applications&gt;<strong>file&gt;account</strong>&gt;capture a picture for
<strong>product information</strong>.<br />

<p>hi tim,</p>
<p>thanks for getting back to me. i'll try to answer your questions as complete as possible...</p>
<p>first of all it has nothing to do with unsupported characters in names or names being too long. it is the first thing i informed my colleagues about when we made the switch to onedrive and it is also the first thing i check when files won't upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. there are no sync problems listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. there seems to have been some progress overnight. unsynced files are now in sync but the syncronisation is still stuck on the folders:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7c0e3562-0957-4d03-9ba5-38ac059a7802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7c0e3562-0957-4d03-9ba5-38ac059a7802" /></a></p>

<p>however, files i've added this morning are only present locally and not syncing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e31ac0d0-ad90-4a3b-9f2a-3cd92e975adb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de31ac0d0-ad90-4a3b-9f2a-3cd92e975adb" /></a></p>
<p>if i remove them, i'm back to "processing changes":</p>
<p>4. i just checked and i have the latest version of office:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d478c301-8e6e-4a91-a3af-347bbe1ae966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd478c301-8e6e-4a91-a3af-347bbe1ae966" /></a></p>
<p>as for the onedrive for business sync client (i assume that comes with office, but anyway):</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=82ddf3b1-8e59-429f-882c-a97d4b18edd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d82ddf3b1-8e59-429f-882c-a97d4b18edd1" /></a></p>

<p>hi sofie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from screenshots you provided, the sync is stuck by two files.&nbsp; we can try removing the two files and check the outcome. if onedrive for business work properly, we can re-add the two files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to find the files, you may go to the folder(<b>iwt kmo 2015 soundbar</b>) as shown in the screenshot below to check if any files have the syncing icon. if so, on the lower-right corner of your screen, right-click the onedrive for
 business icon in the taskbar and select <b>pause syncing </b>and then<b> </b>delete the files from the local synced folder and your onedrive for business library&gt; right-click the onedrive for business icon in the taskbar and select
<b>resume syncing</b>. &gt;if it works properly, you can re-upload the two files to your onedrive for business library and check the outcome.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=3b2c0541-6ff3-4c77-8cae-f2961572a549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d3b2c0541-6ff3-4c77-8cae-f2961572a549" /></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if the files couldn't be found, we need to collect and analyze the onedrive for business 2016 logs to find them. you may follow the steps i provided in the private message to collect the related logs and provide your tenant info
 for further investigation. you may access the private message via

<p>Hi Felix, </p>
<p>I might not have explained this clearly, so apologies, but the sync is NOT stuck on files, it it seems stuck on the actual folders. All files underneath these particular folders are synced perfectly. This has happened before. If the files underneath are
 in sync, the issue is less problematic, although it is frustrating because you never get the "Up to date" message and you have to spend time constantly to check whether it is a genuine problem or not. Nevertheless, usually if this occurs within a few hours/days
 real sync problems (files not uploading or showing the green tick while in fact not being online) will happen as well.
</p>
<p>I have (tried to) collect the logs and uploaded them, so maybe these can tell you more.
</p>
<p>Kind regards, </p>
<p>Sofie </p>

<p>Hi Sofie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have received the logs you uploaded which don't include the
<b><i>ODBTrace_GROOVE.EXE_pidxxxx.log</i></b> we need. You may capture the logs again. Before you reproduce the issue, please stop syncing your OneDrive for Business library and then re-sync it by clicking
<b>Sync</b> in the browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if you want to sync your OneDrive for Business library, we suggest you use the OneDrive for Business<b> Next Generation sync client
</b>which has removed the 20,000 file sync limit and can only be used to sync OneDrive for Business library. It would be fast and reliable. Before you sync your OneDrive for Business library using the Next Generation sync client, please check the&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can configure the <b>Next Generation sync client</b>&nbsp; by referring to the steps in the following articles:</p>
<p>For Windows: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Windows 8.1 support: This release is currently not supported on Windows 8.1, this support will be added in the first quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>The SharePoint Document Library sync: This capability will be added in future releases; we will communicate timelines for this support in the first quarter of 2016</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to sync other SharePoint Online libraries in the team site, you can still use the OneDrive for Business 2016.</p>

<p>Hi Sofie,</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>The logs you provided still don't contain&nbsp;the <em>ODBTrace_GROOVE.EXE_pidxxxx.log</em>. Moreover, I have uploaded a document named
<em>Collect logs.docx</em>, which contains the detailed steps and screenshots about collecting OneDrive for Business 2016&nbsp;logs, to my workspace.</p>
<p>For better practice, please try using the <strong>OneDrive for Business Next Generation sync client</strong> to sync your OneDrive for Business library.
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> if you have used the Next Generation sync client to sync your OneDrive for Business library, the OneDrive for Business 2016 will only be used to sync other SharePoint Online libraries(which don't include your OneDrive for Business library).</p>
<p>If there is any update, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Felix</p>

<p>OneDrive for business sync client always has this headache, for large/multiple files, the sync will be slow (no issue , just slow, make little progress during long period) and produce cache, the corrupted cache will then leads to sync issue in turn. Next
 generation client won't produce any cache, and the sync will be more smoothly, I think using the next generation will be a good choice for you!</p>

            <p>Simply for clarification, <strong>AutoCorrect</strong> &amp; <strong>Check Spelling as you Type</strong> are 2 separate features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The former actually makes other changes in addition to automatically correcting certain - but not all - spelling errors. The spelling corrections can be linked to the main Spelling &amp; Grammar Check dictionaries based on a Preference setting. Also, it works
 even if the latter is turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latter uses the default &amp; user-defined dictionaries to proof what is typed but does not change any text in the document. It merely marks what it doesn't recognize as being correctly spelled. It also works even when AutoCorrect is disabled.</p>

<h2>            How Do I Restore a Nokia Phone with Apps saved to an SD Card&#63;</h2>
                    I just purchased a Nokia Lumia 635, and it is great. &nbsp;I have the default setting for Apps to be saved to an attached SD Card. &nbsp;My question is, if I ever need to restore a backup, what is the proper procedure? &nbsp;In other words, if I reset my phone and then
 simply restore from a backup, will my Apps on the SD card (and App Data) be restored? &nbsp;Will my phone even recognize the SD Card after it has been restored? &nbsp;Thanks for the help.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing on Windows Phone forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood your questions, you want to know how restoring a backup process works.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The backup copy is not saved on the SD card, but on the cloud. After resetting your phone and inserting the Microsoft Account (the one which is connected to the backup) you will be asked if restore it or not.

            That's a darn good question. I know restoring from a backup doesn't actually load the apps from the backup file, but directs a download/install to occur. You can see that after doing a restore, a lot of apps are pending and installing in the program list.
 Not sure if the install to SD card setting is restore first and the installs respect that, or if they just understand the majority of program is already on the SD and just needs reprinting. App data is something that seems a bit variable, especially local
 games. I'm not a big gamer, but I here complaints about levels, and progress being lost depending on the game. The cloud backup isn't really an image snapshot, so it isn't a 100% restore. Maybe some with actual experience with this can shed more light.

            <p>Right, perhaps someone with some actual experience can chime in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am worried that if I simply ignored the fact that my apps are saved on an SD Card and performed the backup/restore like normal, then I will experience problems. &nbsp;Hopefully that is not the case, but I am looking for confirmation, either way.</p>

<p>It is up to the developers to include the game progress data on the backup. They chose not to.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Let's go over the basics of a VLOOKUP() and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.&nbsp; In any examples below I'll assume we are setting up a formula for row 2 on the 17th sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VLOOKUP(what to find, where to find it, relative column data to return, ordered list)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - what to find: that's going to be a reference to the person's name - I'm guessing that it is in column A on your 17th sheet.&nbsp; While the row will probably need to change, the column should not, so you probably want an address like $A2 for that parameter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - where to find it: this can be a single column, or a table of several columns.&nbsp; The first column referenced in it must contain the same type of data you use for the 1st parameter.&nbsp; The address must include the starting column and at least enough columns
 to include the information you want to return.&nbsp; Assuming that on sheets 1-16 the names are in column C and the points are in column G and goes from row 2 to row 1044, you could reference it this way (change sheet name as needed)</p>
<p>Sheet1!$C$2:$G$1044</p>
<p>In versions of Excel after 2003 you can cheat and leave off the row numbers at the expense of some efficiency (speed), as<br />
Sheet1!$C:$G</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - this is a relative column number and in a table that goes from C to G, G is the 5th column, so you would have a 5 for this value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - ordered list.&nbsp; That's not what Help calls it, but it might as well be,&nbsp; By setting this to FALSE, you look for an exact match regardless of how the table is sorted, or not sorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for row 2 to retrieve data from Sheet1 we might have this formula:</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP($A2,Sheet1!$C:$G,5,False)</p>
<p>that will fill nicely into the following columns on the 17th sheet, although you'll have to change the sheet name in each column.&nbsp; Once you get all of row 2 set up, you can select them all and fill down the sheet to the end of your list of names.</p>

</p><p>Now, for those sheets where a name doesn't exist and where you want to hide the #N/A! alert, you could write it this way (but I'd wait until I got it working to make the change)</p>
<p>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP($A2,Sheet1!$C:$G,5,False),"")</p>
<p>or if it might be used in Excel 2003 or earlier:</p>

<h2>            Office 15.14 broke IMAP</h2>
                    <p>Installed Office 15.14 on 2 computers. &nbsp;Both wouldn't connect to IMAP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the account and re-adding the account doesn't do anything. &nbsp;It just never shows the new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's up Microsoft?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope your session can help identify the issue but I'm not optimistic. Hard to fathom that they don't understand the issue and have a fix after a week and a supposed fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, there is also an issue with the latest version of Microsoft Remote Desktop which is caused by TSL. Seems they're all in on TSL replacing SSL before they know how to do TSL correctly.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back with us and it's a good thing that you photos were still uploaded on your OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are unable to replicate your concern, so we cannot know for certain what has happened to your phone and why you lost your data. It is also unlikely for the phone to be completely wiped by just plugging it on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to investigate further, please replicate the issue once again while you are recording it. We will also be needing the version of Windows operating system your computer is running on. Do not forget to
