    <title>Why is Outlook app not integrated with the People app&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is Outlook app not integrated with the People app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Tonight I tried using the new Outlook app supplied with Windows RT 8.1.&nbsp; I tried sending an email and was dismayed to discover that it does not read email addresses from the People app!&nbsp; So here we have all my email addresses already on the Surface in another
 app, and the Outlook app requires you to type in the address!&nbsp; this seems ridiculous!&nbsp; Nor does it seem to import the addresses from the email service that you associate to it, as the Mail app can. This certainly reduces my incentive to use it.
</p>
<p>Disappointed at this lack of integration.....</p>

            <p>There must be a problem with your PC: those apps very much do integrate.&nbsp; I've never emailed this girl named Sarah, but you can see that since she's in my People app, I can email her without typing out anything:</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since yours isn't functioning correctly, I would ask:&nbsp; what account are they both connected to (what email/address book service provider... like gmail or Hotmail, etc)?</p>

            <p>I set up Outlook with a GMail account.&nbsp; As I recall from when I got my Surface a year ago, the mail app at that time did import all my contacts from GMail, so presumably GMail still allows that.&nbsp;

            i did not bother any more after the first time.&nbsp; I am content with the Windows Mail app for G mail and the yahoo app for Yahoo mail.&nbsp; Shawn Keene's reply to my earlier post implied a bit of work that hardly seemed worth the effort, at least for me.&nbsp; i
 do not really have a great need for Outlook for personal email, especially since it is not a home page app (it runs off the desktop).

Your information is incorrect. Microsoft does not support CalDAV in Windows 8.1. There is current NO WAY to sync Google Calendar with Windows 8.1, making it the only platform on the planet that can't so this.<br />

            <p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>You're right.&nbsp; Microsoft sent us a page before the Windows 8.1 preview was even available saying they were going to support the new DAV standards from Google, but it's not there. I can't find any place that references this change.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can <em>display</em> your Google account in the Windows 8 mail app by adding the Google calendar ICS feed URL to the Calendar (via Outlook.com), but that is view-only: you can't edit or add new appointments, which means it's not useful.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'll actually be in Seattle/Redmond this week visiting Microsoft's consumer team, I'll inquire about this and post back.</p>

Thanks, that would be great. I would even go so far as to suggest that this is a major weakness to the platform that has resulted in high return rates once people realize that they can't so this.<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t activate the product key on my Microsoft Flight Simulator X Gold edition. It is apparently compatible with Windows 7 64bit and Microsoft say the product key is valid. So why won&#39;t it work&#63;</h2>
                    I've purchased a genuine copy of the game and have been in touch with the Microsoft technical assistance team over the phone. They have assured me that the product key IS valid but won't work when I try to activate the game. otherwise, the installation
 runs perfectly and I can access the trial version which kicks me off after 30min.<br />
<br />
I'm running windows 7 64bit which is apparently compatible with Flight Simulator X Gold, but not deluxe. the whole reason I bought the gold version was because I was told it would work.<br />
<br />
I've tried disabling my firewall just in case it was blocking the connection, but that does not allow activation either. I still get the message telling me I have entered an incorrect or invalid product key.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure what to do now. Can someone please help?<br />

<p>Here are a couple of things that&nbsp;may help to solve the issue:<br />
1. Have you made Outlook the default in the Start Menu? <br />
If not, right-click Start &gt; Properties &gt; Start Menu Tab &gt; Customize and make the email link point to Outlook Express. You should now be able to right-click a document or photograph &gt; Send To &gt; Mail Recipient &gt; and key in your email details.</p>
<p>2. If you still cannot right-click a document and send to a mail recipient. In a Run window (Windows key+R), type sendto and press Enter. Click File &gt; New &gt; Text Document and name it Mail Recipient.mapimail (note the space) and ignore the warning about the
 extension.</p>

<p>I have set it in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second option, firstly says file with same name already there, as it is not missing, just not functioning properly. &nbsp;I can set it up to use Outlook Express, but that is not my mail client. &nbsp;I use Outlook 2007.</p>

            I tried all that (and much more) awhile ago but still doesn't work. I did add Outlook to my Sent To list and it works but I'd like to fix Mail Recipient.&nbsp;If you go to&nbsp;Folder Options &gt; File Types&nbsp;MAPIMail Change Select a program it shows Notepad. If tried
 to change it to Outlook but it does not stay.

<h2>            CPU running hot during windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows updates are taking a very long time lately and the CPU is running hot 50 - 60 degrees. The internal (and sometimes external) fan really is trying to cool it down but not a chance. The notebook is new and I am not doing anything else. Even downloading
 and installing is taking hours. At the moment version 1703 is installed but I am downloading the new updates right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10, i5-7200U CPU, 8GB RAM and 64-bit operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I can fix that problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Using the Clean Boot with particularly Process Explorer and Process Monitor might help you find the cause.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />
<br />========
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10 &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update  those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            Again, answer-by-number without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. Are Windows Defender &amp; the Windows Firewall both enabled (turned on) and working properly as far as you know?
<br />
<br />2. After you uninstalled the McAfee free-trialware, did you then download/run a utility called the &lt;&lt;McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool&gt;&gt; &amp; reboot again?
<br />
<br />Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.
<br />
<br />4. Is KB4048955 and/or KB4048951 offered when you run a manual check for updates and if so, does one or both of them successfully install?

            You can do that on Windows 8 by creating a refresh image. You don't even need a partition for it, although you can certainly create a partition and store the data there if you want.&nbsp; Here's how:

    <title>Lost ownership of DLC for a backwards compatible game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xl irritum lx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost ownership of DLC for a backwards compatible game</h2>
                    Hello, I digitally owned The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and all of its DLC on the Xbox 360 and when going to play it on my Xbox One today I noticed the system is claiming that I don't own all of the DLC. However, you can even check my achievements and
 see that I have unlocked all achievements for the game including achievements that are exclusive to DLC content that the system says that I do not own (e.g. Shivering Isles) Is there anyway I can resolve this?

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/60c78717-1960-4631-9000-9a25c258c7b2" title="xl Irritum lx">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to Xbox forums support. I understand you're having issues with missing DLC on your backwards compat game.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I would recommend checking your <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027310/microsoft-store-view-your-order-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Purchase / Order history </a>to make sure the DLC purchases appear on your account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I would suggest making sure you're&nbsp;signed into the correct Microsoft account that owns the DLC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If those 2 steps&nbsp;don't resolve the issue, try <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstalling / reinstalling your Xbox profile</a> from the console. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that helps! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and happy gaming! </p>

<p>Is it a matter of not having the DLC downloaded? Can you see it in the "Ready to be Installed" menu under Elder Scrolls Oblivion? Go to My Games and Apps, hit menu on the title, and go to manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>In cases like this there are a few things to check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had similar instances where two things needed to happen.&nbsp; I needed to go into My Games &amp; App on the Xbox One side of things, and make sure that I have installed the available DLC.&nbsp; If you don't see the content there, go to the Store for the game and
 see if you can redeem it.&nbsp; There are some games that do not bring over the DLC purchases from 360 to Xbox One (they brought over the DLC but don't honor that you've purchased it).&nbsp; I don't think that's the case for Oblivion, but still need to check if there
 is that extra step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, assuming there are no issues there, and it's installed, you might have to quit out of the game and restart it for it to recognize the newly installed DLC on the system.&nbsp; Some games even require a step further to "activate" or "download" the DLC from

            I purchased it like 8 - 10 years ago and almost no DLC from that far back appear on my purchase history. Also, the removal of my account did nothing.

<p>Installing the available DLC didn't do anything. This is so dumb. What is the point of backwards compatibility if I don't receive everything that I "owned" in the first place?

<p>Hi there xl Irritum lx,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with backwards compatible DLC for the Xbox One. I recommend try the following troubleshooting article:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-playing-xbox-360-games-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot playing Xbox 360 games on your Xbox One</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you have the digital license for the Xbox 360 game and it’s available to be played on the Xbox One, the game will appear in the
<strong>Ready to Install</strong> section of <strong>My games &amp; apps</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
You can check whether you have the digital license for an Xbox 360 game by visiting your
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Purchase History</span></a>. To see whether an Xbox 360 game is available to play on the Xbox One, see

</li></ul>
If the problem persists, try reaching out to the game developer for more assistance on availability for backwards compatible items/licenses.</p>
Hope this helps.</p>

            Once you install the DLC you want to make sure you go back to the dashboard, fully quit the game by pressing the Menu button and selecting quit, and then relaunching the game when it's all done installing.&nbsp; That will make sure the game recognizes that
 the DLC is there by initializing with it installed.

<h2>            This banning people is getting a bit ridiculous</h2>
                    <p>ok, ive been banned twice last year and its gta5 and the kids on there. Last time i checked, gta5 was rated m. I catch people cheating and using exploits. Last time i got banned i got a message from 3 different people saying that they got their friends to report me and they hope&nbsp;i get banned. Last time i checked, you weren't allowed to do that. I hear you investigate the reports but i don't 100% believe it. If you were to do so as you say, you wouldve had to be in the game to hear how kids&nbsp;on gta5 act.&nbsp;</p>

                    <div>
<p>- Windows Updates cannot be installed on the Surface with/without a VPN connection, the "Install now" button is greyed out.<br />
- WSUS is not configured for the clients.<br />
- User has Domain Admin rights.<br />
- All other clients can install Windows updates with/without a VPN connection and with/without admin rights.<br />
- Removed and readded the Surface to the Domain, but the issue still exist.<br />
- User had a support call with Microsoft Support and they told him that this issue is caused by a domain setting and they closed the call.</p>

<h2>            Windows failed to start... I need the Installation disc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so I recently uninstalled Windows 7 by accident... And I tried to get it to work, but it won't, so I need the disc. I contacted microsoft asking if I can get another disc or something. And they said to go to digitalriver.com. So I went on it, got the
 Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool, I got the ISO file to get on my USB. And now I have everything. So I took it out of the laptop which I did all the stuff on, I then went to the computer which needed to install Windows 7. And it still doesn't work! I plugged
 in the USB with the ISO file, then restarted it, and it still didn't work? Can anyone help me? I've been staying up till 2:00 am trying to fix this!
</p>

<h3> likereliability  say:</h3>
<h2>            file-explorer photo editing in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The photo "edit" menu in file-explorer has suddenly changed. &nbsp;Last week I could crop, straighten, adjust light using&nbsp;<em>brightness, contrast, shadows, highlights

<p>
</p><p>All those menus are gone, replaced by panels of stuff to choose from, none of which suits my purpose. &nbsp;Has anyone succeeded in finding the the previous version? &nbsp;What happened to it? &nbsp;Help! &nbsp; I really, really don't want to tackle Photoshop again.</p>

<p>Windows/File Explorer itself never had an edit menu for photos that allowed you to crop, straighten, adjust brightness, contrast, shadows, highlights, color saturation etc. You were doing these from within some program, and probably now in Win10 you're opening
 your images in the Photos app by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to revert then you first need to identify which program you were using earlier. Only then can we see if it's possible to set that as your default image viewer/editor in Win10.</p>

<p>I have just experienced the same problem - and yes, it was the Windows 10&nbsp;photo editor. The new version, which I&nbsp;wasn't even privy to loading,&nbsp;has much of the same look and feel, but has eliminated some very helpful features as mentioned above. The new version
 is a massive downgrade - and I would like the older version back.</p>

<p>I have just experienced the same problem - and yes, it was the Windows 10&nbsp;photo editor. The new version, which I&nbsp;wasn't even privy to loading,&nbsp;has much of the same look and feel, but has eliminated some very helpful features as mentioned above. The new version
 is a massive downgrade - and I would like the older version back.</p>

<p>If you mean that a newer version of the Photos app is worse than an older version of the same app, there is a way to revert back. It would require you to uninstall the current version via PowerShell, obtain the older appx from a reliable source, install
 it via PowerShell and turn off updates to the app in the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally don't recommend this and my suggestion would be to simply use a better viewer and editor, but if you're really interested you can search the net for ways to do what I've mentioned above.</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. Your suggestion sounds a bit complex, and I agree that it may not be the best option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did Microsoft ruin this perfectly good app? I do have Photoshop, but with the older version's&nbsp;built-in saturation, colour boost and other features, it was a quick and easy alternative when you have a lot of photos to do quickly. I'm disappointed in the
 company for downgrading such an efficient and well designed product.</p>

<p>Who can tell really? They keep tinkering with stuff and sometimes it works out well, while at other times it's an absolute disaster and one wonders how such code could really be approved and released, and whether it was tested at all.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice. I've used both Gimp and IrfanView, and yet the last version of the Microsoft Photo app was just so quick and easy. The simple act of employing the mouse roller to very quickly boost saturation, adjust brightness/colour/contrast, and
 to click on a particular colour and use "colour boost" to really make photos pop is a level of utility and user friendliness that none of these can match.</p>
<p>I sometimes have to plow through a load of photos, and with all requiring a different approach, I can't use macros. The Microsoft photo app was a real time saver.</p>
<p>Thank you anyway.</p>

<p>I'm also curious why Microsoft would eliminate useful features from this app. Perhaps it was giving some paid photo editing software a run for their money?</p>

Bug check description: This indicates that a pool header is corrupt.<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem. This might be a case of memory corruption. More often memory corruption happens because of software errors in buggy drivers, not because of faulty RAM modules.
 This problem might also be caused because of overheating (thermal issue). <br />
The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time.

<p>The rule of thumb is, you cannot have more than one AV software with real-time protection installed on your system. Doing so, causes a conflict scenario that results in issues like the ones you now have happening.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply, I will try as you suggested and post back with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do still have Hotspot shield so I will uninstall along with my Anit Virus programs, It is strange if that is the case with Malware and Norton as I used one (Norton) to catch the big fish and Malwarebytes to catch all the mal/spyware. This not proved a
 problem in the past but I will try your instructions and fingers crossed it works.</p>

            Hi wildcat58
<br />
<br />cmpcuac is CleanMyPC
<br />
<br />The other application string - 5F6010C8-60ES-C3AF5DBE12D4 is associated with malware
<br />
<br />You should remove both tasks and then uninstall CleanMyPC, it is not a piece of software you need or want on your PC

<h2>            Skype update</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a MAC user and have recently after all app upgrades was asked to log on to Skype with my Microsoft ID, as I did. But I only found out that all contacts linked in the past, are not there anymore. Any way to migrate all contact details from "old" Skype
 username to maintain link or should I re-send invitation to all and connect again ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite all app upgrades on my iPhone nothing like that has happened. Should I expect the same "surprise" there ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aggelos</p>

            A Skype name is essentially a Microsoft Account. When promoted for any type of Microsoft account, your Skype name should suffice. Signing in with a different Microsoft account will sign you into a different Skype account without your existing contacts,
 credit, or subscriptions. Simply sign out of this other account, and sign back in using your Skype name. That is what works for me regardless of the OS/device I use.

<h2>            microsoft wireless mobile mouse 4000 - how to disable the side button</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I often unintentionally hit the side button of my mouse resulting in the "back" function on my browser. This is very irritating.</p>
<p>I appreciate anyone's suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s. Even if the button can't be disabled is there anyway to change it so that it prompts another function other than "back".</p>
