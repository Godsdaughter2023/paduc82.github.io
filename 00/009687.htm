<h2>            Word on iPad</h2>
                    So I’m using word in my ipad and when i open most files from emails or files that I’ve downloaded and they appear formatted in a really strange way and I don’t know if its a setting that I’ve triggered or that its a genuine bug with Word on iPad. It makes
 most files unreadable as it blanks out most of the text but acts like its still there. I’ve attached a picture to show what I mean.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82b93b1b-589e-4f8c-a4b6-1c4e77f14aa2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82b93b1b-589e-4f8c-a4b6-1c4e77f14aa2?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hi <strong>Greg</strong>, <br />
<br />
We have noticed that the post has been inactive for quite some time. We'd like to confirm if you still have issues in using
<strong>Word</strong> on your device. If so, I'd suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the said application and check if the issue still persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: To ensure the safety of your files, please make sure to save them first prior to uninstalling.</em></p>
<p>

<h2>            Word&#47;Excel not responding when opening file</h2>
                    
<p>I open any file on my PC and it comes up not responding. I can close out of the not responding box and carry on with the file but halfway through working it pops back up. This issue was only happening with me but is now happening with my colleague. Any help
 would be greatly appreciated thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 - how to end a IE session</h2>
                    I have just purchased a new Toshiba laptop with Windows 8 installed.&nbsp; I am going from XP and it is driving me a bit nuts!@&nbsp; When I have a IE session running (ie Facebook), how to I close the session.&nbsp; I used to click the X at the top, but that has now
 gone.&nbsp; I am resorting to shutting it via Task Manager, surely there is a MUCH simpler way.&nbsp; I really don't want to leave the internet connected all the time.

            <p>Hi Mic_intel</p>
<p>not sure if re-setting by IE is what is needed.&nbsp; It just seems that in Windows 8 there is no little "x" in the top right corner to close the session.&nbsp; I have also tried F11, but that doesn't work either.</p>
<p>I'm still resorting to Ctrl+Alt+Del to close it is Task Manager.</p>
<p>Surely there is a simpler way?</p>

            <p>Hi NakiDeb,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have mentioned you recently purchased a Toshiba laptop with Windows 8 Operating System installed and facing issues with closing the Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description, it looks like you are referring to Modern UI Internet Explorer 10 in Windows 8 Operating System. Here are the methods to close Modern UI Internet Explorer 10:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Mouse to the top of the page, click and hold for a second, drag the screen to the very bottom of the window and release. Similar with a touch screen, touch at top edge for half a second, drag to bottom edge of screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Hover mouse over upper left corner then move mouse directly downward to show Metro task bar. Right click on entry you want to close and click close. With a touch screen, swipe in from left edge then quickly out again on left edge to bring
 up the task bar. Drag entry to very bottom edge of screen to close. You can also drag to the bottom edge with the mouse to close.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b> You may use the keywords Alt key + F4 to close Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer to the article mentioned below for more information on closing an app:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Known Issue&#58;  Insider Preview Settings Changes Not Working in Build 14905 for PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello Windows Insiders!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the release of 14905 we have discovered a new bug we wanted to call attention to.&nbsp; This bug only affects users on build 14905 for PC.&nbsp; It *does not* impact Mobile users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users on this new build will not be able to change the Insider Preview Build settings on their PC.&nbsp; As a quick refresher, the below image displays the settings page that is not functioning as expected:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cfc36ad-b21c-4248-b401-b89c3cb8d74a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cfc36ad-b21c-4248-b401-b89c3cb8d74a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The cause of this issue has already been discovered and a fix is already in the works.&nbsp; This fix will be included in an upcoming flight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no workarounds for this issue.&nbsp; It does not impact core OS functionality, only the ability to change flight settings.&nbsp; If you find it necessary to make changes before a future build is released with the fix, you may roll back to your previous build
 via the Settings menu.&nbsp; This however should not be required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any questions arise, please share them here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you as always for being a Windows Insider!</p>

<p>Hello, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/41e2f6f1-5df3-4e69-b677-860c5b2f38a5" title="RobinSauve">

<p>
</p><p>Changing your name as people see it - in Skype, we call this the name as it is displayed - can be done in your profile settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If what you are asking to do is to change your Skype account ID, which is one way people can find you on Skype,&nbsp; unfortunately this cannot be changed.&nbsp; The only way to create a new ID is to start a new Microsoft account with its own new email address.&nbsp; The
 xxxxx in the live:xxxxxx is whatever is typed in the email address before the @[email domain, such as outlook, gmail, yahoo, etc.].</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you reply with the details of what you use Skype on, its operating system, and
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10659/what-version-of-skype-am-i-using-on-my-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the exact version of Skype</a> you use, we can show you the steps to changing your name as it is displayed or shown on your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            <p>Yes, that's pricey.</p>
<p>You can do it yourself for the cost of an external drive or even blank DVDs or CDs.</p>
<p>Backup can mean copy important files or back up everything. It is done for safety's sake, but can be skipped if you are willing to risk data loss. Remember, though, that backup shouldn't be avoided altogether as it isn't "if" you have a problem with the
 hard drive, it is for *when* you have a problem.</p>
<p>Removing Norton is easy. Using the cleanup tool is fairly easy. Your Norton is expired, so the longer you wait, the more at risk the PC becomes, so don't hesitate!</p>
<p>Installing MSE is very easy, assuming all other steps in the guide/FAQ were followed.</p>

<p>I've been going around this for a while. I have office 365 installed on my win 10, configured with gmail imap account, and the 'browse office store' button in the ribbon is missing. Tried to add it as customization , but it os added greyed out.</p>
<p>After a bit of research it appears that this button would show only if exchange/outlook.com account configured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to install add-ins from the store when imap account configured (my business email is a google business email)? I need the hangouts meet add-in that is only available in store.</p>

<h2>            word mail merge to email send error</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to send emails from a mail merge in Microsoft word</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a popup telling a program is trying to access email information stored in outlook</p>
<p>in the trust center my setting is warn me when antivirus is inactive</p>
<p>I can't change this setting (controlled by network admin)</p>
<p>however it shows antivirus status: valid&nbsp; (antivirus is Sophos)</p>
<p>I check allow access for 10 minutes</p>
<p>however the popup comes back for every record in the merge file</p>
<p>I am sending about 100 emails per day so this is extremely annoying</p>
<p>
</p><p>this happens with office 2013/windows 7 and with office 2016/windows 10</p>

<h2>            Make Publisher email template responsive to email host</h2>
                    <p>Hi I've just started working for a small NFP organisation part of my job is sending a thank you letter to each of our donors acknowledging their donation and telling them what it has gone towards. At the moment we are sending an email with a brief blurb
 and including an attachment with more photos and text (pdf created in publisher). I personally think this looks clunky and not very professional, so I'm hoping to move our thank you templates into an email publisher file and then send so the info and photos
 are embedded. One issue I'm having is getting the email to be responsive to different email hosts, so it looks good no matter what email host or clients are using or how they are viewing it (phone, computer or tablet). Is there a way I can set the publisher
 file to automatically optimise the way it displays based on the email client and viewing platform?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Each email client renders HTML coding in a different way. Furthermore many recipients will have their email client set to read only plain text and no pictures for security reasons. IMHO the&nbsp;<strong><em>only</em></strong> way to get consistent results is
 to do it exactly as you are doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you write a simple but effective introduction in the body of your email message and your message is of interest and wanted by the recipient they will open the attached PDF. I think a properly rendered email with a PDF attachment is a lot more professional
 looking than one that breaks the HTML coding and does not render correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said if you really want to move everything into the HTML formatted message body and avoid attaching a PDF then don't use Publisher. Use specialty software such as:

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer to save the entire HTML file and supporting images to a web server, then use Outlook to send the page. This sidesteps the "helpful" changes Outlook tries to make to imported HTML. Here's a page that has a couple of ways to send a web page as a message:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.extendoffice.com/documents/outlook/1404-outlook-insert-embed-web-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Embed

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When exactly do you get this error message?</p>
<p>2. Was a software change made just before the problem began such as a new security program, updates to a security program, updates from Microsoft, etc?<br />
</p>
<p>Follow the methods.</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some third-party security programs, such as antivirus and security suites, are capable of blocking ActiveX, scripts, other active content. Look through settings/options of any security programs for this feature.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Let’s temporarily disable the antivirus software and check if you’re able to access the access the files on the network.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important: </span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You can follow these steps to reset settings to Default Level.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open <strong>Internet Explorer
</strong>from desktop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press <strong>Alt + T</strong> keys simultaneously, Click on
<strong>Internet Options,</strong> Click on <strong>Security,</strong> </span></p>

            If it doesn't affect printout, then perhaps 100% is just larger than you're used to seeing. You could drag the Zoom slider to the point where the type looks the size you think is right. Also, note that if you are seeing just the slider and not the Zoom
 box that shows the actual percentage, you can add the box: right-click on the status bar and click on Zoom to select it.

<h2>            Word 2007 - Citation in embedded Excel spreadsheet</h2>
                    I am working in Word 2007 and have embedded an excel spreadsheet through "insert" &gt; "table" &gt; "excel spreadsheet". Is it possible to place a citation field ("references" &gt; "insert citation") in one of the cells of the embedded spreadsheet?

            The short answer to this question is, I think, "No."
<div><br />
<div>But there is a slightly different longer answer, as follows...
<div>
<div>&nbsp;a. Not directly - i.e., in Excel you get to put Excel stuff, not Word stuff</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. However, one bit of Excel stuff you can put in an Excel cell is an embedded Word document</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. That Word document could contain a citation, but...</div>
<div>&nbsp;d. ...I think Excel will display the result as a graphic, and it will probably not look very good either on-screen or in print, and</div>
<div>&nbsp;e. ...I do not think any list of citations in the containing document would "see" your citation in the contained document</div>
<div>&nbsp;f. ...embedding even one level of object within Word can create problems. Embedding something within an embedding is I suspect, just asking for trouble.</div>

                    <p>I was informed of a neat tool today for Word 2010.&nbsp; Where you can Drag and Drop document s from Windows Explorer into a Word Doc to merge them together.&nbsp; My problem is that it only brings in the first page.&nbsp; i.e.</p>

<p>Doc1 = 12 pages</p>

            What you're doing with drag and drop is embedding "Word document objects" in the receiving document (equivalent to using Insert &gt; Object &gt; From file). The problem you're seeing is that no object (document, graphic, etc.) can display more than one page
 in the receiving document -- this has always been true in all versions of Word.<br />
<br />
You can use Insert &gt; Object &gt; Text from File and choose another Word document to insert. Or you can open two documents at one time, copy everything from one document, and paste it into the other document. But drag and drop won't do.<br />

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you access Outlook.com? Is it through browser or mail client?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are accessing through browser, you&nbsp;can&nbsp;follow the steps below and check if it works fine;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To remove it do the following: 1) Go to Skype.com 2) Login with your Skype ID and password. 3) My account Page will open, there, click on Account settings. 4) In this page, you will find your Skype Name &amp; under it the Microsoft account. 5) Click on Unlink
 in the Microsoft account and confirm it. Then you will get rid of Skype login every time you check your emails on Outlook.

<p>I installed an app, and then I reset the phone, so it was no longer installed. Now I'd like to reinstall it, but marketplace says it's already installed, so I reach a dead end.</p>
<p>What does one do to get access to the installer again?</p>

<h2>            Excel Export Data Table to a file</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Excel 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Book1-&gt;Sheet1 with a table</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some cells of this table have values linked to other cells residing on same book but other Sheets;</p>
<p>Some other cells of this table have values linked to other books residing on another file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to select the table and click a button to export table data to an external file</p>
<p>the button shall call a VB script to export the table to an external file (file format can be selected, such as .xml , etc.)</p>
<p>Probably xml is preferred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I will need to import it back</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for any assistance</p>

<p>I am not aware of any option to export an Excel file in ca file format. Your question has been posted for quite a while now with no reply so I am posting the following to see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many applications provide a method of importing a csv file so the following VBA code exports to a CSV file.</p>

<p>my apologies</p>
<p>somehow some of the words went missing</p>
<p>
</p><p>the export file format is open</p>
<p>perhaps .xml would be preferred</p>
<p>

<p>I need to export data values to external file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might need later on to import the .xml file and make some modifications and export it back</p>
<p>
</p><p>the reason of being unable to save the original Excell file is because the file size is too large.</p>
<p>One of the Sheets have thousands of rows, as it is a database.</p>

<p>If you comment out or delete the&nbsp;code that saves the workbook as csv, does the&nbsp;code example satisfactorily export the table&nbsp;values to a new workbook? It should only export values and not export formulas or links.</p>
<p>

    <title>Any Former Hotmail Users Having Problems with Outlook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bps461  say:</h3>
<h2>            Any Former Hotmail Users Having Problems with Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    Microsoft is quoted as saying that it will spend $30 million to $90 million telling people how great its new Outlook.com is.&nbsp; However, it appears to be ignoring in most part my complaints and those of a multitude of others who have found and posted or
 agreed with comments on this Outlook.com and the Hotmail.com Community Forums.<br />
<br />
Since there are so many different threads going on out there to try to follow, I would suggest that anyone with a specific complaint add it to this thread.&nbsp; That way, all are in one place and easy for users, anyone at Microsoft who actually may want to resolve
 these issues, and the press to find.<br />
<br />
The ones that appear below, all of which I have experienced and continue to add to on nearly a daily basis, take up more than seven pages of Microsoft Word.&nbsp; If you, yourself, are experiencing any or all of them or have found ways around them, I personally,
 and I expect others, would be interested in hearing about them.<br />
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>First</span></b><span>, I would suggest to any of the more than <b><i><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">12 million individuals</span></i>
</b>who are officially unemployed, the millions more who have lost their unemployment benefits or are underemployed, and the millions of entrepreneurs who may be using Outlook to check out some of the issues below and if you, too, are experiencing them, to
 determine whether to flee Outlook quickly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Having been involved in working with the unemployed and underemployed for many years now, having made hiring decisions, and having been the owner of small businesses, some of the graphical issues, in particular, that I am experiencing with Outlook
 provide a very unprofessional image to a potential employer or customer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If anyone is a potential employer or customer receiving an e-mail message from an Outlook account and see any of the errors outlined below, I hope you will understand they are not the fault of the sender.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Second,</span></b><span> as noted, I currently have over seven pages of single-spaced descriptions of problems that I have experienced with Outlook, with more occurring before I can find time to add to the list, none to the best of my knowledge
 having been repaired or mitigated despite several personal complaints to Microsoft going back some four months now.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Third,</span></b><span> due to there no longer being a way to revert back to Hotmail, some of these descriptions may not be entirely accurate because prior features are being recalled from memory as to what was able to be done with Hotmail prior
 to the change.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, it would seem that the magnitude of the content verifies the seriousness of this situation and the apparent lack of regard toward fixing it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Fourth,</span></b><span> the following are issues only that have been found and recorded thus far.<span>&nbsp;
</span>More are appearing every day.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, this basic list grew from three pages in just two weeks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Nearly three pages were added just in double-checking some of the information appearing below.&nbsp;
</span><span>A half page was added yesterday alone.&nbsp;<span> </span>Therefore, due to size, this post may be broken up into segments, depending on how many characters are allowed to be posted here at one time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As has been suggested in many posts in this forum, Outlook doesn’t even have the
<b><i>working</i></b> features of a rudimentary e-mail system, no matter how many toots and whistles and “pretty” that have been added.<span>&nbsp;
</span>From my perspective, it has gone from a very usable system under Hotmail to an amateurish, poorly tested, glitzy-packaged product that has been jammed down the throats of users.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issues I am experiencing:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Features that Actually are Better:</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ability to click on the arrow image in the top right corner and have a message go to full screen,
<b><i>subject to the new problem noted below</i></b>.</span></li><li><span>When there is mention of an attachment in an e-mail, it isn’t sent without querying as to whether there is supposed to be an attachment.</span></li><li><span>A problem of “hair-triggers” as it relates to items being deleted or moved, occurring under Hotmail, appears to have dissipated.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is a situation in which one deletes or moves an item and suddenly finds the one or more e‑mails following it also having been deleted or moved.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Problems:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Instability:<span>&nbsp; </span>This program does not appear to be stable:</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Outlook locks up at different times, for no apparent or consistent reason, and one is left trying to determine how to free it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Although one might assume it is due to the computer itself, it appears more consistent with the pattern for additional follies described below, particularly when one wasn’t experiencing this problem with Hotmail.</span></li><li><span>When one is clicking on check boxes in preparation for moving messages to folders, the lines of e-mail jump around on execution.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is not even consistent in how it occurs, often resulting in succeeding check marks occurring on the wrong message due to the jumping.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes the jumping causes the next message to go out of sight on the screen, requiring one to scroll up or down, trying to find it again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only <i>partial</i> solution to this situation is to slow down operations to a crawl.</span></li><li><span>Cursors suddenly move inconsistently when one is working.<span>&nbsp; </span>
One often cannot go to a location on the screen and get the cursor to “take”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This particularly is true at the beginning of a line.<span>&nbsp; </span>One then has to try to insert a curser in the middle of the line and then hit
<i>Home</i> or backspace.</span></li><li><span>Links hang up.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, e-mail appearing in the <i>Junk</i> folder with a
<i>Wait, it’s safe!</i> link, won't always transfer to <i>Inbox</i> when clicked.</span></li><li><span>E-mail has simply disappeared when it is moved from the <i>Junk</i> folder via a supposed
<i>Not Junk</i> link.</span></li><li><span>The curser sometimes jumps around for no apparent reason when one is deleting or backspacing.</span></li><li><span>One is unable to drop and drag folders within the left pane if the destination location is not visible on the screen due to not automatically scrolling up.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In addition, it took me four attempts to <i>Rename</i> a folder and each time the attempt was made the folder was “lost” until I went up to
<i>Folders</i>, collapsed the list, and then uncollapsed it.<span>&nbsp; </span>In one instance, it took approximately five minutes and over a dozen actions and attempts to simply
<i>Rename </i>and move one folder to the desired location.</span></li><li><span>On another occasion, a folder was repeatedly <i>Renamed</i> but the name did not change.</span></li><li><span>Highlighted words often cannot be dragged and dropped to another location.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One has to type anew and then remove the replaced information.</span></li><li><span>Microsoft <i>Updates </i>with unknown detrimental impacts occur often while I am typing out an e-mail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I try to save the document because a new log-in or screen refresh is required, it won’t save – at least in any reasonable period of time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It only says <i>Saving</i> and nothing more happens.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, I have to copy the message – fortunately, this feature still is available,
</span><span>at least so far </span><span>-- <i>Refresh</i> and then paste into a new document, after I have had to re-enter an e-mail address and Subject line.<br />
<br />
I also have <i>Refreshed</i> the browser and found that only a prior edition rather than the current one has been saved.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, the last three paragraphs (for example) have been changed from 12 pt. to 10 or 8&nbsp;pt. type and one cannot highlight and change it back.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One only can re-type the information again.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Graphical Output</span></i></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Outlook indiscriminately will change type size (often) and style (sporadically) while one either is typing along, backspacing to another paragraph, or copying information from another file, apparently picking up characteristics from elsewhere.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This can happen in the middle of a paragraph, a sentence or a word.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There does not appear to be a pattern.<br />
<br />
I have confirmed this to be a problem in e-mails received from other individuals who have updated Outlook accounts.<br />
<br />
Once this occurs, there normally is no way to highlight and change it back (as noted below).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The highlighted error shows on the type size drop-down as being correct.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once in a while only, one can highlight, go to a smaller or larger typeface and then back to the correct size shown in the drop-down.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, one only can <i>Undo</i> and re-type or go into a word of the original text and start typing, and then go back and delete the error text.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, one only can <i>Undo</i> and re-type or go into a word of the original text and start typing, and then go back and delete the error text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Of course, none of this guarantees that it will remain correct in sending, as noted next.<br />
<br />
Even worse, these changes can occur as the document is being <i>Sent</i>, unbeknownst to the sender unless the sent copy is checked and, then, it is too late.<br />
<br />
This results in the receiver having a message in different type sizes from paragraph to paragraph, in the middle of a paragraph and in the middle of a sentence, leaving the recipient to wonder if the sender is competent or is trying to highlight something that
 has been written.<span>&nbsp; </span>Regardless, it makes a very poor presentation to the recipient and is particularly detrimental to job-seekers and small business persons.</span></li><li><span>This problem also occurs as it relates to lines between paragraphs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One or more extra lines can be inserted randomly and inexplicably.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Sometimes they are seen, although one has to struggle trying to correct them, and, more often, not visible until after they have been sent.</span></li><li><span>This problem is even worse if one is using bullets or numbers, particularly if information has been copied over from another source, such as Microsoft Word.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What is on the screen often is not what ends up being sent.</span></li><li><span>In some cases, Outlook will change bulleted paragraphs copied over from a document by not only adding an extra space but bulleting that extra blank space.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One then has to go back through and backspace to the previous paragraph and put the bullet in again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, this doesn’t mean that the sent copy will be the same as the changes made on the screen.</span></li><li><span>If one makes a correction in a word that is in color, bold or italic and then goes elsewhere in the document, the characteristics of the color, bold or italic often follow the cursor and one will start typing in another part of the document with that
 color, bold or italic.<span>&nbsp; </span>The same thing also can occur when one deletes a word with those characteristics in one section of an e-mail and then goes elsewhere to resume typing.</span></li><li><span>The <i>Subject</i> line typeface is too large, resulting in:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>The <i>Subject</i> line frequently not being able to be seen in its entirety without spacing over, again adding extra steps.</span></li><li><span>It being more difficult and time consuming to check the Subject line for grammar and accuracy.<br />
<br />
</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><b><span>Printing</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>With a Skydrive attachment, I am not able to simply print out a document without going through additional steps of saving the document.</span></li><li><span>There doesn’t appear to be a way to preview a document before it is printed in order to determine if all the pages are needed, particularly those e-mails that have dozens of pages of prior messages and replies.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Overall</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The software, in moving from Hotmail to Outlook, appears to have slowed down considerably in several areas:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>One has to wait various lengths of time for an action to occur when one clicks on the
<i>Mail</i> link in the Outlook drop down menu in the upper left corner of the screen.</span></li><li><span>When one searches for a document and the list finally comes up, several -- too many -- seconds go by when trying to move from one page to the next, an action that was instantaneous under Hotmail.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>The new typeface being used in Outlook versus Hotmail is either larger and/or has more space between the lines, resulting in a lesser number of lines on the screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This results in much extra work:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Less messages are able to be shown on the screen, resulting in more scrolling and wasted effort in going up and down trying to find what one is looking for.</span></li><li><span>Less folders show in the left pane, resulting in more scrolling.</span></li><li><span>A lesser number of folders show in the drop down Move menu, again resulting in more scrolling.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>The drop down Move menu doesn’t always come down with a scroll bar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, one has to play around trying to get it to work.<span>&nbsp; </span>
This is another example of simple actions hanging up in this software.</span></li><li><span>The typeface on the Toolbar also is larger, apparently resulting in the need to place several items previously showing on the screen in drop-down menus.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This results in many additional steps.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>The typeface and size were both on the Toolbar and could be changed individually with one execution for each.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now one has to click on the drop down menu for each and then click on the style or size desired, doubling the time involved.</span></li><li><span>The color palette symbol formerly was on the Toolbar by color.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Now one has to remember which of the three letters is the color, click on it, and then pick a color, another increase in time.</span></li><li><span>If one shows 12-point type on the Toolbar and the type size suddenly goes to another through no action of the keyboarder, one cannot highlight the incorrect type size and change it back to the 12-point size.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It just doesn’t work in most cases.<span>&nbsp; </span>One can try making it another size and then go back again to 12-point, but this only works once in a while.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only other option, it appears, is to type it out again, as noted above.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>As noted, one of the extremely few improvements to this basic e-mail system is the ability to click on the arrow in the upper right side of the screen and have the message fill the full screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span><b><i>HOWEVER</i>, </b>the arrow is not present on all messages and there no longer is the ability to at least scroll down to the bottom of the advertisements in the right pane and execute a full screen command.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, the only way one can see the entire message horizontally is to move the scroll bar back and forth on the bottom of the center pane, an extremely cumbersome series of actions, particularly if it is a long e-mail.</span></li><li><span>The cursor often just appears on the screen “somewhere” – not at the beginning of a line, at the beginning point of a line at which one should be able to start typing -- just anywhere.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it appears in a data entry box, it often is in the bottom right corner so one has to sometimes click around to find the beginning of a typing line.</span></li><li><span>If one clicks outside the <i>To</i> box to get rid of the <i>Frequent Contacts</i> list, the cursor is lost or moves to the bottom right corner of the address box, having no apparent purpose there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One then has to manually click inside the box and the <i>Frequent Contacts</i> pop up again.<span>&nbsp;
</span><b><i>HOWEVER,</i></b> I have no idea where this <i>Frequent Contacts</i> list comes from.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On mine, I haven’t corresponded with the first listed person in two to three years, the second one I haven’t communicated with more than a handful of times in eight years, and the last one out of five is my own e-mail address.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In other words, a three for five cumbersome and specific waste of time, and little value for the other two.</span></li><li><i><span>Forward</span></i><span> is under the <i>Reply</i> drop down menu now, requiring an additional step to forward a message versus Hotmail, another time addition when using this program.</span></li><li><span>By placing <i>Forward</i> under the <i>Reply</i> drop down, potential occurs for slippage and clicking on the wrong line, going to
<i>Reply</i> or <i>Reply All</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then one has to back out and start over again, more wasted time.</span></li><li><span>The screen jumps around, leading to many errors that then have to be tracked down to fix.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is particularly true when one is attempting to check several different Inbox e-mails to be moved to a single folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Insert a checkmark and the other lines usually jump.<span>&nbsp; </span>At worst, click a second box too quick and one has checked the wrong box; not noticed, the checked e-mail moves out of the Inbox and into a folder which may not be caught or discovered.<br />
<br />
If it is discovered, one may have a hard time finding an e-mail that one only had “seen out of the corner of one’s eye”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At best, one has to keep scrolling to find other e-mails on the same subject that it wants to move into a single folder.</span></li><li><span>The drop down menu for typeface colors has black and gray on the bottom instead of the top with the white.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is a seemingly small thing, but it is consistent with development of a product in which many intuitive features have been removed or changed, various features seemingly have been dropped wherever someone is “going by” at time, and one has to stop
 and find something because it isn’t where one might expect.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>I am not even sure what some of the new toots and whistles that are cluttering the screen are for and, as with most everything else, it will take hours, if the time is expended, to try to find out what they are due to there being no real
<i>Help</i> tutorial.<br />
<br />
The fear in clicking on any one of these is that messages will be lost or sent somewhere where it will take forever to find them again, as has occurred with other supposedly simple tasks that are described elsewhere, if they can be found.</span></li><li><span>The <i>Help </i>and explanation of new features seem, instead, to be a rudimentary attempt to get people to upgrade or buy into Outlook.&nbsp; The amount of actual information provided is almost non-existent.<br />
</span></li><li><span>There seems to be a new abundance of red underline highlighting to indicate misspelled words, even when the words aren’t misspelled, resulting in additional time being wasted in trying to figure out what the problem is.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Periodically, if one re-types the word, the underlining goes away.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Search Feature</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>In addition to slowing down to a crawl when trying to move from one page to the next, when one enters a search term in the box in the upper left screen, the only apparent way to replace it is to go to the end and backspace.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It can’t be removed by highlighting, <i>Refresh</i>, singular key <i>Delete</i>, click in the middle and backspace to correct spelling, modified or any other apparent means, again leading to much wasted time and aggravation.</span></li><li><span>When trying to find a missing e-mail that is hidden and cannot be moved back into a folder because it won't appear there when moved, as described elsewhere, the same search terms do not always bring up the same list of folders.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Blocked Senders and Related Tasks</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The <i>Blocked Senders</i> doesn’t appear to work.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have two or three junk mailers that I have included and they still appear in the Junk folder several times a week.</span></li><li><i><span>My Friend Has been Hacked</span></i><span> has been transferred to the
<i>Junk</i> drop down menu instead of the <i>Delete</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, I have to manually move items since many non-<i>Junk</i> items are found in my
<i>Junk</i> folder, rendering the “check all” box useless.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Moving Documents</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Move documents to a folder, either singularly or, particularly, by checking several, and they are gone.<span>&nbsp;
</span><b><i>HOWEVER</i></b>, go on to something else and they are back, like they never left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This, again, is a case of things on the screen not being the same as what is going on in the background.</span></li><li><span>E-mails suddenly disappear from the Inbox for no reason.<span>&nbsp; </span>
They are there and then gone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Looking around they can’t be found.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then, for no explicable reason again, they re-appear.<span>&nbsp; </span>A couple, I only am able to find in the background through a
<i>Search</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They simply are very much hidden somewhere for some unknown reason.</span></li><li><i><span>Draft</span></i><span> copies are not always removed from the <i>Drafts</i> folder when they are updated.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, one has to go through a <i>Search</i> to find each sent copy of the one that still is in the
<i>Draft</i> folder to determine whether a mistake has been made or it wasn’t sent after all.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Another waste of time.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>E-Mail to Lists</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This ability now is very cumbersome and time consuming since multiple addresses do not cascade.</span></li><li><span>If one has an e-mail list that has extraneous identifiers between e-mail addresses, Hotmail would delete it automatically and just insert the e-mail address into the
<i>To</i> line when the list was copied over.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, it won’t send and one has to search through the list to find the error.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In addition, if there are two “errors” in a row, they cannot be removed one after another because when one is removed, the cursor automatically jumps to the end of the list and one has to start the manual search process again to locate the "error".</span></li><li><span>When one sends a single e-mail to several people, different types of unknown-impacts coding is added to some addresses, such as (; in the Subject line address and double ( (s.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As a result, one has to wonder if everyone on the list actually is receiving these e-mails.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Firefox Browser</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>As of the last couple of days, Outlook in the Firefox browser had changed significantly as it relates to
<i>Sending</i> e-mail. It changes to a horizontal presentation and:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>If one wants to bold, italicize or highlight in a color, it has to highlight and scroll back up to the top of the page since the toolbar rolls up with the page and no longer is locked in at the top.</span></li><li><span>If one attempts to forward an e-mail, one cannot see the entire forwarded message, only the first screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That means several things:<span>&nbsp; </span>if there is an error, such as those listed below, there is no way to see and try to correct it; there is no way to delete the dozens of extraneous e-mails that may not apply, and any number of other issues that
 may need to be addressed (still trying to figure them out because new problems are being found “every hour”.</span></li><li><span>The color palette on my 17” monitor has colors askewed in the box.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This isn’t a use problem but appears to confirm how changes are being rushed to
<i>Update</i> without checking them.</span></li><li><span>The heading lines and the body copy now are locked as one, instead of the message portion being in its own pane.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If one is writing an e-mail and wants to modify the Subject line because an additional subject is being added, or an additional recipient, one has to scroll up and back to make the addition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is particularly cumbersome when one is reviewing and editing, has to make changes and then find where they were.</span></li><li><span><span>E-mail addresses no longer show in the <i>To</i> box, only the individual’s name, if the name is in one’s
<i>Contacts</i> list.<span>&nbsp; </span>One has to put a cursor over the name and, hopefully, it will come up in a highlight box.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the individual has more than one e-mail address in the <i>Contacts</i> list it is not readily visible if the incorrect one was chosen, particularly if it is an old one that didn’t get deleted.</span>One no longer can paste a substitute e-mail address
 in the middle of a group of names.<span>&nbsp; </span>One has to insert the new one at the end and then remember where they were in order to delete the old one or to go on in checking a list.</span></li><li><span>E-mail addresses again no longer are visible, whether or not they are in the Address Book in this application.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They just appear as an “X”.</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Helpful</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>It would be helpful to have <i>Superscript</i> ability, rather than having to cut and paste a trademark registration or copyright symbol from a Word document.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It also would be helpful with the <i>Superscript</i> to be able to return to the regular typeface rather than it retaining the characteristics of Superscript after inserting it and one having to figure out how to get around that.</span></li><li><span>The <i>Horizontal Line</i> feature available in Hotmail appears to have been removed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I found this helpful from time to time in separating components of a long e-mail so the reader could locate information more easily while having to scroll through a document.</span><span>
<br />
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Summary</span></b></p>
<p><span>The Outlook e-mail program may have a lot of toots and whistles, but the basic e-mail features that have been around for years have been compromised dramatically, much like a wonderfully wrapped Christmas package of snakes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>I would strongly suggest that the Hotmail option be returned to the menu so individuals can switch back to a stable e-mail program and that Microsoft stop updating automatically until it is able to not only repair this damage but have a product
 that has been more than slapped together and being compromised more every day.</span></i></b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><span><span>As </span></span></span><span><span><span>noted at the beginning, please provide your own experiences, confirmations, or work-arounds for the benefit of others and, hopefully, to result in at least a mediocre product at some point.</span></span></span><b><i><span><br />

            Long-time user of hotmail I am driven up the wall by the instability of this imposed new programme. I will be forced to move to gmail - in my view a more gadgety and less satisfactory solution than hotmail - if the problems outlined above are not solved
 extremely rapidly, or hotmail reinstated without forcing the hostages to perform complicated operations to recover the quality of service they had

            I use Verizon 4G mifi.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure if it is the internet or Outlook, but when I start typing on a new or replying to an email, it takes awhile before I see the letters that I type.&nbsp; Or I do not see the letters until I hit the return button.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
 very frustrating. &nbsp; I never had this problem with Hotmail.&nbsp;

            Long list of info here, didn't have time to read all.&nbsp; But don't think it addresses my issue.
<br />
<br />
How do I set up the new Outlook to allow me to view the messages with out having to scroll left or right?&nbsp;&nbsp; I see a way to change to "full view" but after deleting it goes back to having the "Ads" on the right and folders on the left.

I can't stand this email!&nbsp; Give me Hotmail back please!!!&nbsp; <br />

If can't fix I'm dumping this email and transfering all contacts to my Yahoo account.

Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the response.<br />
<br />
However, the notation that the references provided "<font><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">gives you an idea about the new interface" really only continues to confirm that Microsoft is saying "tough luck, you are stuck" rather than allowing us to revert back
 to Hotmail until it can resolve at least the most serious of the eight pages of problems (more now) that I personally have encountered, along with the many more that have been brought to light by others that makes Outlook e-mail, in my experience, a less than
 second rate program.<br />
<br />

            "Your opinion is important to us" . . .&nbsp; I HAVE left feedback and I'm sure others have too.&nbsp; It seems our feedback is being ignored.&nbsp; It seems that the feedback section is just to gjve us the false sense that our opinions are important to Microsoft.&nbsp; IF
 our opinions were truly important, Microsoft would be taking this issue more seriously.&nbsp; Instead, we get empty words about how Microsoft cares.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit IE11 freezes when trying to upload files</h2>
                    <p>Ever since last night, I've not been able to upload any file to internet sites; facebook, pinterest, filesend, etc. It works fine in Safe Mode. All ad-ons and third party extensions are disabled, Java, Flash, Windows are up to date. As soon as I click on
 "browse" to try to access an image or a file, IE11 freezes does not respond. The same happens when I use Firefox and Chrome. I've performed a virus scan with AVG and the PC is clean, and I've also used AVG PC Tuneup to correct any error. I've also downgraded
 to IE8 to see if it made a difference, but the problem persists. Need help as I use the function to upload images and files for clients.

            <p>Hello Bon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Did you make any software or hardware changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message while uploading the files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>Method 1</p>
<p>If the system works fine in the safe mode, try to clean boot the system:</p>
<p>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 Disable the anti-virus and then try upload the files.</p>
<p>Disable anti-virus software</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3</p>
<p>What to do when Internet Explorer stops working</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-crashes-stops-working#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-crashes-stops-working#ie=ie-11-win-7</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disclaimer:<span>&nbsp; </span>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>&nbsp;Adobe have stopped development of Flash for mobiles, so no, the 920 won't have a Flash player. It does support HTML5 though.</p>
