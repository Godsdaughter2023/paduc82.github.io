            Hi <strong>Anthony</strong>,<br />
<br />
Office apps can be personalized depending on which Office themes you would choose from the drop-down list under the Office Background option. Here’s an

<h2>            Printing problem with wrapped text</h2>
                    <p>I've inserted an image into a text document and chosen the text to wrap around the image. No problems so far.</p>
<p>When I print the document however the text wrapped around the image becomes bold font although the rest of the document is not. This can't be seen on the screen but occurs when printing. The text above and below the image is not printed in bold.</p>
<p>In the attached image note how "migrated from siberia..." is printed i bold whereas "geographically, climate, and wildlife...".</p>
<p>What to do?</p>

<p>Does the same issue occur if you save the document as a PDF or use the Microsoft Print to PDF facility to create a PDF and then print that from Adobe Reader?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using an Ink Jet printer with both color cartridges and a black cartridge, when it encounters the image (that is not black and white, it probably switches from using the black ink cartridge for the text to using a mixture of the colored inks and
 that maybe what is causing the issue.</p>

<h3> ally z_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Make table query to create a new table &#40;no overwriting&#41; each time it is run</h2>
                    <p>I want to make my query create a new, uniquely named table each time it is run, rather than overwriting the old output. I don't want the person&nbsp;using the database to have to edit the query each time to do this. Ideally the tables created would be differentiated
 by date. So if the query were run today, the output table&nbsp;would be - </p>
<p>"output table 7/28/2017"</p>
<p>and&nbsp;then if it's run again next Friday, a separate output table would be created:</p>
<p>"output table 8/4/2017"</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I do this? Thank you so much to anyone who can help!</p>

<p>Well... this can be done, but WHY would you want to!? Storing data in Field Names is bad design; storing data in Table Names is much worse! If you want to see data for a given week, simply store all the data in one table, and use a Query to select that week's

            You would have to do one of two things, in each case calling the Date() function to name the table:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Build and execute the SQL statement in code.<br />
2.&nbsp; Create and save a query, and change its SQL property in code before executing the query.<br />
<br />
However, as John points out, this is bad relational database design.&nbsp; All you need to do is to have a single table which includes a column of date/time data type which allows Nulls.&nbsp; Having inserted data into other columns in new rows you can then simply update
 the table whenever you want to date-stamp the new rows with:<br />
<br />
UPDATE [YourTableName]<br />
SET [YourDateStampColumName] = DATE()<br />
WHERE [YourDateStampColumName] IS NULL;<br />

<p>The database will eventually be used by a group of employees who have varying degrees of computer knowledge (some have very little). I want them to be able to run&nbsp;a report weekly, using the smallest number of steps to do so, and with minimal room for error.
 The report pulls records that require follow-up from the database's main table which is updated daily/as needed. I want the report to be run in one click, and I also want to be able to look at a history of it over time.</p>

            In which case why do you need to create an additional table?&nbsp; Do the values in the 'main table' provide a basis for returning the rows which need following up?&nbsp; If so just base the report on a query restricted to those rows.&nbsp; If not, include some means
 to identify which rows in the 'main table' need following up, such as a Boolean (Yes/No) column, and restrict the report's query on that column.<br />
<br />
The users' IT knowledge should not be material; it's for you as the developer to provide a user-friendly interface.<br />

<p>As Ken said there is NO reason for multiple tables here. And the knowledge level of the employees is immaterial. You can easily provide a button to run the report.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have two options. Either base the report on a query that sets criteria for records that require follow-up or open the Report with a WHERE clause that filters for those records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you don't define what constitutes a record that requires follow-up we can't be more specific.

<h2>            How to create an Excel template to sort data from Sheet 1 out to multiple worksheets.</h2>
                    How do I set up Excel to automatically divide data between multiple sheets.&nbsp; Basically, data will be dumped into Sheet 1.&nbsp; I need to set up an excel template so that if for example: Sheet 1 contains 10 accounts where 2 contain "Apple", 2 contain "Banana",
 2 contain "Cherry", 2 contain "Donut", and 2 contain "Egg".&nbsp; Once the data is dropped into the template into Sheet 1, I need the "Apple" accounts to be sorted into sheet 2, "Banana" into sheet 3, "Cherry" into sheet 4, etc.&nbsp; I need to template to be reuseable
 daily with a new set of data.&nbsp; I hope this makes sense.

    <title>Communication error between Outlook and Time Warner Cable Road Runner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timvargo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Communication error between Outlook and Time Warner Cable Road Runner email.</h2>
                    <p>I am volunteering for a local teen center trying to fix an issue retrieving email through Outlook from TWC Road Runner email.&nbsp; The network and email setups are all new, but both were communicating appropriately prior to last week.&nbsp; TWC says it's a firewall
 issue.&nbsp; I have, along with help from the company who set up the network, tried to troubleshoot just about every setting but cannot correct the problem.&nbsp; All cookies, cached files, etc. have been dumped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue lies with connecting to the&nbsp;TWC&nbsp;webmail site.&nbsp; I cannot get to it via internet explorer at webmail.roadrunner.com.&nbsp; I get the mesage:</p>
<p>Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage.</p>
<p>This problem can be caused by a variety of issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet connectivity has been lost.</li><li>The website is temporarily unavailable.</li><li>The Domain Name Server (DNS) is not reachable.</li><li>The Domain Name Server (DNS) does not have a listing for the website's domain.</li><li>There might be a typing error in the address.</li><li>If this is an HTTPS (secure) address, click Tools, click Internet Options, click Advanced, and check to be sure the SSL and TLS protocols are enabled under the security section.</li></ul>
<p>I have used IE 8 and 10 as well as firefox and google.&nbsp; None of the 4 computers on this network, or any linked into the internet service here, can reach the website.&nbsp; From my wireless phone, I can reach the webpage, but with security certificate issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome.&nbsp; I have exhausted my limited expertise.&nbsp; I am beginning to think there is some malware causing this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have additional questions.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

    <title>Cannot activate Office Enterprise 2007 - too many installations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> american in oz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot activate Office Enterprise 2007 - too many installations already</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007 as part of my company's corporate arrangement with Microsoft.&nbsp; Here is my installation history:</p>
<p>1) I installed it on my Windows XP laptop.&nbsp; That laptop experienced a corrupted hard disk (MBR was corrupted).&nbsp; Being pissed off with Microsoft, I installed Ubuntu.&nbsp; So, at this point, I don't have Office installed anywhere, since the hard disk was wiped.</p>
<p>2) But, I installed Windows 7 using VirtualBox and Ubutu.&nbsp; I then installed and activated Office 2007 under that virtual machine.</p>
<p>3) After buying a Macbook Pro, I wiped that VirtualBox image from my old laptop.&nbsp; So, at this point, I don't have Windows or Office installed anywhere.</p>
<p>4) I bought Parallels for my Macbook, and installed Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mint, Solaris 10, Solaris 11, and OpenSolaris under Parallels and Mac OS X.&nbsp; All of those virtual machines launch and perform beautifully.</p>
<p>5) I also installed Windows 7 under Boot Camp on my Mac.&nbsp; So, at this point, I've got one instance of Windows 7 installed from my Windows 7 installation cd.</p>
<p>6) I installed Office 2007 under Boot Camp, and successfully activated Office 2007.&nbsp; So, at this point, I have one installation of Office 2007 from my installation CD.</p>
<p>7) Parallels allows me to run Windows 7 in a virtual machine, alongside the Mac OS, using my Boot Camp partition for the virtual machine.&nbsp; However, when I launched Windows 7 in the virtual machine (not Boot Camp), Office said my hardware configuration had
 changed, and I had to reactivate my software.</p>
<p>8) I called the activation number, punched in the installation code, and got an "activation error".&nbsp; Spoke to a brain dead support person, who had me rattle off the installation code again.&nbsp; Why the 2nd largest tech company in the world (recently passed
 by Apple) can't retrieve the installation code from their IVRS system is beyond me.&nbsp; Anyway, the brain dead support person said I needed to reinstall Office.</p>
<p>9) I uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2007.&nbsp; Got back on the phone, and after going through the whole process again, was told I'd have to call customer support during normal working hours (it's Sunday afternoon here).</p>
<p>10) When I call customer support tomorrow, I suspect I'll be told I've "installed Office too many times".&nbsp; The thing is, I'm not violating the license.&nbsp; I'm only running it on one computer - my current virtual machine.</p>
<p>11) Another problem is, if I make ANY kind of change in my virtual machine, Office is asking to reactivate.&nbsp; It asked to reactivate when I changed the virtual networking from DHCP to a static IP address!!!&nbsp; If I add more virtual memory, if I add another
 CPU, if I add another virtual hard disk...if I breathe on the virtual machine in any way, Office is going to ask for reactivation.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'm pretty pissed off with Microsoft right now.&nbsp; If I can't activate Office in this scenario, I hope I can get my money back.&nbsp; If Office won't stay activated in this scenario, I think I'll just have to use Open Office or iWork.&nbsp; The thing
 is, there are some good templates available for Access 2007 that I wanted to use.&nbsp; And, of course, I have to use Office at work.</p>
<p>Do you have any advice on how I can activate Office in the above scenario, and have it stay activated?</p>
<p>Frustrated with Micro$oft...</p>
<p>Scott</p>

    <title>Access 2016 Report Print Preview Freezes Window &#38; Ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fabi_428  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2016 Report Print Preview Freezes Window &#38; Ribbon</h2>
                    <p>I'll try to make this as short as I can while still explaining the issue I'm having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a command button on a form, I open a report in Report view. I click a command button I created on the report to go to Print Preview. &nbsp;When Print Preview opens, the window and ribbon are frozen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using a macro as well as VBA on the control.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>VBA: </p>
<p>Private Sub cmdOutputTo_Click()<br />
&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport "rptName", acViewPreview</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Macro: &nbsp;RunMenuCommand - PrintPreview</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both ways yield the same result. &nbsp;Clicking the command button opens the report in Print Preview but the Access window is completely frozen. &nbsp;Nothing is clickable on the Print Preview Ribbon or anywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I move away from Access (to another open app or the desktop, etc.), then move back to Access, everything is unfrozen and works again, including the options on the Ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also experimented and found that if I generate a MsgBox using VBA, the message appears and once I click "OK" I again have all the tools on the Ribbon available and the window unfrozen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>VBA:</p>
<p>Private Sub cmdOutputTo_Click()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;DoCmd.OpenReport "rptName", acViewPreview<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox "Click OK"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, either moving away from Access or generating a Message Box and clicking OK on it will get the window unfrozen and the toolbar working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens for every report in my database. &nbsp;I'm using a simple accdb split in two with back end tables and front end everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other things I've tried/noticed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>---If I use a command button on a form to go to Print Preview, it works fine. &nbsp;There are no problems with the window or ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---If I right click on the open report's tab to go from Report view to Print Preview, the window is not frozen but the Close Print Preview button is greyed out until I click and use another of the tools on the Ribbon. &nbsp;Then the Close Print Preview button
 reactivates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to be able to use a command button on the report in Report view to access the Print Preview view and Ribbon options. (without having to move away from Access or use a message box to unlock the window)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why this could be happening or a way to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            I had this same issue and the way to fix this is open the "Event" Macro you created and underneath the last statement after opening up Print Preview in Normal Window, Select from the list of available macros, the following Macro Action and put it as the
 last macro action in the script:<br />
<br />
CANCEL EVENT<br />
<br />
Then this issue will be resolved and it will no longer lose focus. &nbsp;Issue is that your macro doesn't have an IF Statement in it, so it is waiting to timeout waiting for next command. &nbsp;By adding "Cancel Event" to the the end, it exits the macro script.

<h2>            Does Changing the Computer&#39;s &#34;name&#34; alter the author name on all documents&#63;</h2>
                    When I bought my new computer it had another person's name on it because I bought the last one... so whenever I made documents the author would be their name. I sent out a document to someone and then I found out how to change the name on the computer.
 Now all the documents have the new name, and it changed the name on all documents. My question is will the document I sent out before the name change have my new account name on it or the old one?

            Hey, thank &nbsp;you for your reply. No I changed the name of the whole system I don't actually remember how I did it because I followed a tutorial, and I'd have to do a little searching to find it again. But I didn't just change the user name on Word. I actually
 just downloaded an old document and the author name came up as the new name that I changed the system to, and I know I made this document way before I changed the name. So I guess it did change it. Thanks!

<p>Hello @Mell19: Look, I've been having a similar problem especially on the part of renaming the PC but I actually got a solution, a lasting one here;&nbsp;http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/quick-tip-change-the-registered-owner-in-windows/</p>
<p>But on the part of having the MS Office documents switch the Author to your new PC name (which Windows 7 does by default) I had to uninstall and reinstall again a copy of the MS Office and it worked. Try and see if it helps. Thanks. :-)</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 Xpress Music email problem - headers only&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a bit new to all this - but have just got a new Nokia 5800 Xpress Music and have set it up to access my work emails through our server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be fine in doing this and retrieving the headers of however many emails I want - the problem is when i try to open them.&nbsp; When I click on them it says it's going to retrieve them, but I can only ever get the header.&nbsp; In the email retrieval settings,
 there is only the option to download headers only - no other possible options on the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This effectively means that I cannot use the phone for work as I had planned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be gratefully received!&nbsp; :)</p>

<h2>            Resize Image Option in Outlook 2016 Does Not Work</h2>
                    <p>I have just sent some images to someone, and I selected the "Resize large images when I send this message" option.&nbsp; However when I sent the email, it did not resize any of the images, and so the email ended up being over 17mb.</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The option to resize large images when sending the message only works if the image is attached to the message by using the
<strong>Attach File</strong> option. If you used the <strong>Insert </strong>option to add the images in your message, you have to either resize or compress the images. The image below shows the two different option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Insert option</strong></p>

<p>We appreciate your response. The Drag and Drop option works just like the Attach File option. That being said, it means that the resize large images when sending the message option should be working. We suggest that you check your Outlook for any updates
 by following these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>File</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Office Account</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Product Information</strong>, choose <strong>Update Options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Update Now</strong> and wait until Office is done checking for and installing updates.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take note that you may need to click <strong>Enable Updates</strong> first if the
<strong>Update Now</strong> option is not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, proceed with repairing your Office application by following the steps by following the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on <strong>Start</strong> (<strong>Window icon</strong> on the bottom left corner).</li><li>Select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the Office product you want to repair.</li><li>Select <strong>Change</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Online Repair</strong> from the <strong><span>How would you like to repair your Office Programs</span></strong><span> screen.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Repair</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the repair.</span></li></ol>

<p>I have the same problem. The option used to work. I have added the picture with Attach file. I have Automatic Updates and my latest update was on 6th September (according to Programs and Features - Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016, version 16.0.8326.2096))</p>

<p>
</p><p>Same here -- under Outlook 2016, the files (JPGs) are not being resized when sent.&nbsp; They go through in their full size/resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When is the next release for Outlook 2016?&nbsp; This is a very important feature considering how ridiculously low the limits are set for most mail servers, even though it's 2017.&nbsp; It's also horrendous when trying to send email through a slow internet connection.</p>

            Ok, here's what will fix the problem, at least with Outlook 2016 under Win 7 Pro: &nbsp;Install the "fast track" build, which will give you Outlook build 1708, not the 1707 build issued under the standard Office profile. &nbsp;I did this Weds night and it fixed
 the attachment resizing problem. &nbsp;Very stable so far, no issues.

            Good to know this, TedMacDonaldrm. For the time being I will stick with the workaround that JohnRizk provided, hoping that Microsoft will repair the standard Office release (for Win 10)...

            Hi. Thanks for reply and suggested methods.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>1) Unfortunately I don't know anybody who has WP8.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) The contact's pic was taken by me with my phone, so nobody has the original file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Luckily I figured out a third method. I found an app (Contacts+) for my Android tablet that can manage contact's details and pictures from multiple sources, including MS Live contacts.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Unfortunately, there is no way to download the profile photo. It is stored in your account, though. If I wanted to do get that profile photo, in your position, this is what I would do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning - The steps are a little long, but if you really want that photo ;) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you need to get a phone, which is running on windows phone 8. You see, windows phone 7 cannot take screenshots. (Not unless, you have a developer account enabled).</li><li>Next, you need to sign in to that phone running windows phone 8 using your account.
</li><li>Then, you wait for the contacts to synchronize. </li><li>Now, you can open that contact and take a screenshot of the profile pic. Press, windows button plus the lock button, to take a screen shot.
</li><li>Obviously, the profile is going to look small, as it occupies only a small portion of the screen.</li><li>To overcome this problem, you can wait for this contact of yours to call. You see, whenever a person calls, their profile pic takes up the entire screen. You can take a screenshot when this happens, and get a much larger picture.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above method is not feasible, which is highly likely, there is a second thing I would do. This happened to me once. One of my contacts had this amazing pic and I really liked it. I just mailed her to send me the original pic that became her profile
 pic, and got the original picture, directly from the source. You could do the same :)</p>

    <title>Paint 3D - Unwrapping texture&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Paint 3D - Unwrapping texture&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Recently I've been using Paint 3D as a way to directly paint on my models, as I found it easier to use than manually unwrapping the model and then figuring out which is which part (So basically, this app serves as a shortcut for me). I recently made a new
 model, used Paint 3D - and as I finished painting my model, I tried to upload it to a rigging website as I was using that model for a game avatar - of course, it was just a pitch black model or just grey.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is if it's possible to get the texture of the model as if I unwrapped the model in blender and didn't paint directly on the surface of my model. (Or, if anyone would know - if I can make it work with mixamo!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

</p><p>Hi Ana,</p>
<p>I have the same issue for one of the users I support at my work. Tried outlook in safe mode, that did not help. Created new outlook profile, uninstall office 2016, restarted the computer and then reinstalled it, that did not help. Hopefully you have other
 suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi Mohamed Sayad,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post in the community. Since we have a known issue that <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outlook-freezes-clicking-the-signature-button-c70b36c2-66ca-401c-ab45-f29a46495d02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook freezes clicking the Signature button</a>. There’re some workarounds for this issue.<br />
<br />
1. You can try to uninstall the <strong>Microsoft Office Desktop Apps</strong> which is installed by factory. To do this, please right click
<strong>Start </strong>and navigate to <strong>Apps and Features</strong>. In the program list, uninstall the factory installment if it exists.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b6501ce-2595-4e5d-af42-fa5c09b96292?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b6501ce-2595-4e5d-af42-fa5c09b96292?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Also, you can update the Outlook desktop client to the latest version cause the issue was fixed in
<em>1802 (Build 9029.2167)</em> and higher. Please navigate to <strong>File </strong>
&gt; <strong>Office Account</strong> &gt; <strong>Office Updates</strong>.<br />
<br />
And if the issue still exists, please let me know the detailed situation.<br />
<br />
1. When the user tried to open Signatures or Stationery and Fonts, did he receive any error message? Or just stuck there? If there’s an error message, please make a screenshot here.<br />
2. What’s the detailed Outlook client version? Please capture a screenshot in <strong>
File </strong>&gt; <strong>Office Account</strong> page.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marvin<br />

I can't do it on that laptop as I had to&nbsp;return&nbsp;it to the store. &nbsp;They said that I can get my PC product key for the Microsoft Home &amp; Student 2013 that I bought, by going online and&nbsp;removing&nbsp;it.
 but I cant seem to find where to&nbsp;uninstall&nbsp;it online. I have tried going to My Account at the office.com website, but still can't find where to deactivate it.

            OK, then the answer to your question is there is no way of "deactivating" your old installation.
<br />
<br />
"Deactivation" is only required to comply with the license terms that you limit your number of concurrent usable installations.&nbsp; A "dead" computer, and/or one that has been returned to the vendor/manufacturer meets this license term.<br />
<br />
If the computer is still working, the requirement is to uninstall it. BUT, the uninstall is completely a local process. Unfortunately it does not contact the MS activation system at all.&nbsp; This has changed with Office 365/2013, but ONLY with the 365 installation
 so it is not relevant to your question.<br />
<br />
There is one more consideration. Did you buy a "Product Key Card" or "Retail" license? PKC licenses cannot be transferred to new computers, Retail licenses can (although initially Office 2013 did not allow this, MS agreed to change the license terms to allow
 it again).<br />
<br />
What you will have to do is install on the new machine. Then do a Phone activation. When you phone in, don't answer the initial prompts. They will just give you the same "too many activations" type error.&nbsp; When you talk to the service rep tell them you are
 transferring the installation from a dead computer. They should allow the activation to complete.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi <strong>Sarah</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’d like to ask you some questions for me to learn more about your concern with the PowerPoint slides you’ve created and don’t display accordingly. Please answer these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you also use the <strong>PowerPoint for Office 365 version</strong> when you’ve started a presentation on another computer?</li><li>Did you insert pictures from the <strong>web</strong> or from your <strong>computer</strong>?</li><li>Can you send a <strong>screenshot</strong> of the actual presentation to check exactly what it looks like? See this:
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">How to include a screenshot in your post?</a></strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I’ll wait for your answers in line with those questions I’ve asked so I could identify what seems to be issue on this. Now, to answer your question about
<strong>Standard 4:3</strong> and <strong>Widescreen 16:9,</strong> these are actually the default size of the slides in PowerPoint. Additional information about this can be found

<h2>            need MX record for my custom domain Outlook.com email address - changing registrar</h2>
                    Hi! Not sure where to go but here. I just changed my custom domain's registrar from Melbourne to Dreamhost, and I have an Outlook.com email address using my custom domain. I need the MX record to use to update my Dreamhost records so the email address
 can send and receive, but my records of it from before the changeover have disappeared. Can any Microsoft folks help me get the records? The transfer went through over the course of the last week or so.

<h2>            Same computer shows twice in My Account as having been installed</h2>
                    This past weekend I had to restore CMOS. It caused some problems with my Office 365 installation and prevented me from accessing my account page and the download/install pages.&nbsp; With the help of a Microsoft support person, I was able to fix some problems
 butt had to use my original setup file to download and install.&nbsp; Now I can access My Account but it shows two installs for the same computer.&nbsp; Can I deactivate the older install and still have Office 365 working on my computer?

Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Office Community.<br />

Since Office suite is re-installed, up and running, you may certainly proceed in deactivating the older instance of Office installation from

<h2>            GPS on Windows Phone 7, Vietnam</h2>
                    I have used Xperia X1 for a long time, before I changed to HTC 7 Mozart.<br />
When I used X1, with Google maps, when I stayed inside my house, it will automatically changed to A-GPS, with a circle around my position.<br />
<br />
But with my HTC 7 Mozart now, when I'm in my house, and searching for my location, Bing Maps only "Searching ..." with no result, while other apps like JustAnotherMaps, TAMaps, Advanced Maps Viewer also have no respond at all.<br />
// of course it respond perfectly when I'm outside.<br />
<br />
Is there any problem with my Mozart?
