<h2>            no recovery disc, or password recovery disc, or os installation disc win 7 home edition. On my Toshiba Satelite m505d.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a toshiba satelite 505D-s4970 &nbsp;factory installation of windows 7 home edition. I have forgotten my administrative password and did not make the password recovery disc due to the disc size i had was too small to accommodate the makings of the
 password recovery disc.</p>
<p>Would someone please assist me at either doing a wipe system of win 7 &amp; reinstall win7 without installation disc.</p>
<p>Or, recover my password without download or password recovery disc!</p>
<p>I've been trying to remember my administrative acct password for 6 months now. if i haven't remembered it by now, i don't think i will..... ;...(</p>

<h2>            You must restart your computer to turn off user account control</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a brand new HP probook laptop last year in July(2016), it was working fine and perfectly(I used it for 9 months without any error), 2 months ago,I was working on it, then suddenly I got notification "you must restart your computer to turn off
 user account control" and it restarted automatically, After restart, this screen starts appearing and I was unable to do any thing after this screen</p>

<p>
</p><p>I contacted the shop owner(I have in-voice slip), he tried below things</p>
<p>1: Re-install windows 3-4 times</p>
<p>2: Re-install BIOS</p>
<p>
</p><p>But every time,this screen start appearing as soon as I connect to internet.</p>
<p>Finally, I claimed warranty and they replaced its motherboard, I was just using it gave me the same warning and restarted again, and after restarting, this screen starts appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting this company but no response from them.</p>
<p>Please suggest me what should I do?If the company is the owner of this pc,then how it worked till 9 months? Also what should I do to start working again(or remove ownership of the company)</p>

<p>Hi Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible reason why this Warning message shows up is that the hard drive that's in your computer is previously owned by the company that's mentioned in the Warning message. We suggest that you reformat or replace your hard drive before reinstalling your
 Windows operating system. Do clean install your Windows. To do so, you can get a new copy of the Windows ISO and use media creation tool to install it. See this

</p>
<br />
<p>Do update us on how it goes.</p>

            If the Media Disconnected shows, while your system is happily connected to the internot with no issues, then leave it as is. Media disconnected shows, if you have no Network medias/drives conected from your Modem's USB slot.<br />
<br />
Onto the another PC's concern, i may suggest that you recreate another thread for it. the thread you made applies to Network and Internet, and it will be a litle different. But i advise taht you should install the proper driver for the laptop's WiFi device.
 try to reach the Manufacturer's support site for the right wifi driver.<br />

 norton security centre preinstalled but am unsure whether a clean up tool was used.<br />
From the windowsupdate.log file i found this:<br />

I´ve tried all of the solutions i could find including the system update readiness tool, windows update troubleshooter, i´ve tried updating manually and with the antivirus and firewall switched off with no success. Could you please help, thanks very much<br />

When a started hardcore it would have been my 5th play through. I have beaten the other modes so to start i had the over clocked parts. Having these made it so instead of focusing on weapons i could have the best and worry about staying alive. Any experienced player can beat hardcore in just a few hours. The challenges are the following.<br />- It is completely stupid but the first space jump when you leave the earth gov ship is hard if you do not concentrate. For me on my second hardcore attempt I died during the jump and is sucked because I had to do the first 2 chapters over again. And for some one who has played through the game almost 5 times already the first hour of the game is the most boring part ever.

            <p>Thank you&nbsp;for letting us know about the status of the issue.</p>
<p>Sorry for delayed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there are no windows 8/windows 8.1 compatible drivers released by Lenovo for Bluetooth, try to download windows 7 drivers from the following website and then try to install them in compatibility mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-w-series-laptops/thinkpad-w520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-w-series-laptops/thinkpad-w520</span></a></p>
<p>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And make sure you have the latest Windows Updates installed. Check for the optional updates as it may have the required drivers or fixes. Check for the optional updates&nbsp;released in windows updates for Bluetooth as there are no drivers available on Lenovo
 website.</p>
<p>Refer “Do I need to check for updates?”</p>

            The first thing in this case too, would be to use another keyboard and narrow down the cause. The symptoms at least point to keyboard keys unnecessarily pressed.

            Yes. 
<br />Unfortunately you would have to visit a hardware shop and get it corrected/replaced

            <p>I was using my 32 inch Insignia television which is HDTV to use as a monitor for Windows 8.</p>
<p>My TV has the same connection as my monitor so it worked for W8 !</p>
<p>It worked fine until I upgraded to Windows 10, my computer no longer recognized my Monitor.</p>
<p>My monitor ( tv ) only said " No Signal" across the screen.</p>
<p>I re-connected to the original monitor and tried "Add a Device" , trying to find it.&nbsp; No luck with that either.</p>
<p>In fact W10 doesn't let me add anything, I could not find the "Drop Down" list of any devices at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather go back to windows 7 because that was the beginning for this big monitor usage, I did NOT like W8 and I am not liking W10 due to this set back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC will not even "see" the monitor in order to get a "error" message at all.</p>
<p>I will try what you are suggesting until I hear from you or someone else.</p>

    <title>Multiple issues once again with Windows 10 PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeno clipz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple issues once again with Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, for the 2nd time, my PC has become (what seems to be) corrupted after a quick power outage. Basically, the story follows a very similar route as a previous post I had posted a few months ago: https://goo.gl/UKvcTB. The cause and effect
 are nearly the same; power goes out for like 10 seconds, power turns back on, PC turns back on, PC crashes after 10-15 minutes, restarts, and then multiple things like the Cortana search bar and the game Forza Horizon 3 no longer let you type in it/disappear
 completely. The solution last time was a Reset, after trying many things like running an SFC scan, DISM scans, and downloading ISO files. I really,
<em>really</em>, don't want to Reset my PC completely once again. On top of Cortana not working and Forza Horizon 3 completely disappearing again, nearly all of my other games do not launch at all. Games like Battlefield 1, Arma 3 and GTA V all give the same
 error stating: <em>"C:\Windows\System32\ieframe.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support.
 Error status 0xc0000020" </em>Also, it seems that every last video and picture saved on my computer (quite a ton of them) will state an error saying: (Insert file name here)<em> "Class not registered"</em>. I did in fact have a restore point that I created
 literally like 10 minutes before all of this happened, so I decided to load it in, only to not have any noticeable difference in anything at all (I have some other system restore points saved from a couple days ago, should I try those too?). Lastly, I've tried
 running an SFC scan, but that quits at about 15% and gives me an error. A DISM scan does the same. According to my drives (Windows 10 booted on SSD, 1 TB HDD too.), they both say that there is no corruption at all on any of them...which doesn't exactly seem
 right to me considering the many problems I am running into right now. Does anyone please have any sort of idea besides that dreadful reset I could do that could possibly fix these issues?</p>

Clean Install Windows 10</a> so you know nothing has been forgotten, install it properly, optimize it to perfection, and keep it that way as long as you stick with those tools and methods.&nbsp; This is the gold standard install&nbsp; better than any amount of money
 could buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to find a guide for how to install an SSD on laptop, probably even on your make/model if you ask google.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's always best to unplug any other drives during install.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise you'd take extra care not to touch the drive on the drive selection screen during install, when you select the SSD (triple check) and then click Next to auto-format and begin install,
 as illustrated in the link.&nbsp; But since you'll be in the case, I'd carefully pull the plug out on the HD until afterward or look for it's listing in UEFI/BIOS Setup to disable it during install.&nbsp;

            The wininet.dll file should never be missing so it may have be quarantined (effectively deleted) by your unspecified antivirus/antimalware program(s) on your system of unspecified make and model with unspecified XP version and Service Pack.<br />
<br />
In addition to the advice from contributor Elizabeth32, answer a couple questions so we might be able to figure out how the file came up missing in the first place,&nbsp; then read the rest of my reply all the way through and then see if you are able to replace
 the missing file by using one of the ideas.<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
If the c:\windows\system32\wininet.dll file is missing XP will look like it is trying to start up and you will see a message like this:<br />
<br />
Explorer.EXE - Unable to Locate Component<br />
This application has failed to start because WININET.dll was not found.&nbsp; Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Clicking OK, you may then (after a while) see a message like this:<br />
<br />
dwwin.exe - Unable to Locate Component<br />
This application has failed to start because WININET.DLL.dll was not found.&nbsp; <br />
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Depending on your configuration, you may see lots of other complaining messages, so just keep clicking the OK button as they come up.<br />
<br />
Clicking OK, you will eventually get to an empty desktop with just the background wallpaper showing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Since the Explorer.exe will not start without the file and therefore is not running, there will be no desktop icons or Task Bar, but you can still navigate and do other things using Task Manager.<br />

Since the Explorer.exe will not start without the file and therefore is not running, there will be no desktop icons or Task Bar, but you can still navigate and do other things using Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Depending on your configuration, other applications may complain in various ways, so just click the OK button as each message comes up.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not be able to replace the missing file until all the pop up error messages are acknowledged (work quickly).<br />
<br />
From the desktop background image. press Ctrl-Alt-Del to launch the Task Manager and from there you can replace the missing wininet.dll file (you can replace any missing file from Task Manager).<br />
<br />
We know that XP keeps copies of critical system files in the following folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
You need to copy the backup copy of the file from the dllcache folder into the system32 folder where it belongs.<br />
<br />
From Task Manager, press the Ctrl key, then click File, New Task (Run...) and a Command Prompt window will open.<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt enter this command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):<br />
<b><br />
copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\wininet.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
</b><br />
If the file is also missing from the dllcache folder, this may work depending on your system environment:<br />
<b><br />
copy c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386\wininet.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
</b><br />
In either case, respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file and then you should see a message that 1 file(s) was copied.<br />
<br />
It could be that the file is missing from both places and there is no backup copy, so in that case, from a working system, you can download a copy of the file from
<i><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">my SkyDrive</a></i>, copy it to a floppy or USB thumb drive and carry that to the afflicted system and copy the file from the source (either the<br />
floppy or the USB thumb drive) into the c:\windows\system32 folder where it belongs.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Somehow, you must replace the missing file.<br />
<br />
If any pop up messages come up from other applications complaining about the missing file, just click OK so you can complete the file copying process.&nbsp; If there is a complaining message, you need to click OK to get rid of the message to complete the file copy.<br />
<br />
After the file has been copied, from the Task Manager, click Shut Down, 'Restart' to restart the system (always try to avoid using the power button to restart the system).<br />
<br />
If the c:\windows\system32\wininet.dll file is missing, you can also replace it by booting the system into Safe Mode with Command Prompt and copying in the backup copy of the file.<br />
<br />
After booting into Safe Mode with Command Prompt, from the Command Prompt window, replace the missing file with the backup copy be entering the same commands as above (in the Command Prompt window).<br />
<br />
Enter '<i>exit</i>' to close the Command Prompt window and restart your system from Task Manager.<br />

            Hi ElderL<br />
<br />
I got as far as c:\windows service pack i386<br />
<br />
I managed to locate the wininet.dll file right clicked to choose copy, but I don't know how to
<i>navigate</i> up one level to the following folder&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Look forward to your reply<br />

            Yeah - that is not very clear, so I replaced the old instructions with some new instructions that should be a little easier (if not, I will change them again).<br />
<br />
It is good to get feedback on the instructions that are not clear so I can make adjustments until they are clear and sometimes I hope other contributors will recreate these problems and see if the instructions are good enough or not (this one is easy to reproduce).<br />
<br />
If you found the file in c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386, you would actually have to go up
<i>two </i>levels and down one to get back into the system32 folder - too much clicking and clacking.<br />
<br />
So read the previous message again that describes how to replace the file from a Command Prompt window - that might be easier than messing around with Task Manager and those silly pop up messages you might see.<br />
<br />
@Elizabeth23, since I know you do alot of experimenting like me, you might want to make an adjustment to your Explorer settings...<br />
<br />
Click Tools, Folder Options, View and check the box:<br />
<br />
<i>Display the full path in the address bar</i><br />
<br />
Then when you are exploring, it will be easier to see where you are...&nbsp; instead of in the Address bar just saying:<br />
<br />
<b>dllcache</b><br />
<br />
It will say:<br />
<b><br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache</b><br />
<br />
S'up to you of course :-)<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>are you then able to see the file, your explorer is working??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you can see file, copy/paste is all you need to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>once you copy, go to the windows/system 32 folder and right click in an empty space and choose paste.</p>

            Hi. I am a fellow community member who likes to help my peers when able. When your PC locks up and you can't access any of the normal menus or troubleshooting options from within Windows it may be helpful to access the recovery menu using another method. Please try the following.<br /><br />Power on and off your computer three times <br />as follows.<br /><br />Power on and when you see the Windows Logo power off <br />Power on again and when you see the Windows Logo power off <br />Power on again and your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment <br /><br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. <br /><br />Click on Advanced Options <br />Then Click on Troubleshoot <br />Then Click on Advanced Options <br /><br />boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'<br /><br />This answer was adapted from - AndreJA

<p>
</p><p>Please answer these question to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does this issue occurs while using any particular program?</li><li>Did you make any hardware and software changes in your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Which is the latest build installed in you PC?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the&nbsp;Methods below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Install all pending Windows and driver updates in your PC and check.
<span><span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer to the following Wiki article created by Andre Da Costa on
<strong>How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with the Bluetooth adapter. Refer these steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows key +X</strong>, select <strong>
Control panel.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Change the <strong>view by </strong>option on the top right to
<strong>Large icons.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>troubleshooting</strong> and click on the
<strong>view all</strong> option on the left panel.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Run the <strong>Hardware and devices troubleshooter.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> your computer and check if the issue is resolved.
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Also type System information and provide the exact system model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know the status of the issue. Thank you. </p>

                    I have an Epson WF-3640. I need to UNINSTALL the software and the program will not complete the task. I was told to look for 'Epson Unistall Utility" on the net, all I get are sites that want to sell me something. The Epson site is useless, I followed
 instructions and the process, it continues to not complete the UNinstall task. I am running on Windows Vista. Since I started this journey, my 'Control Panel Explorer' has malfunctioned and now it will not respond. It looks like I am digging myself deeper
 in trouble. I need help asap. Thx

<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work at the Microsoft Store, we just had a customer come in with this exact problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Go to the 'Device Manager' (Right click the start button, it's the 6th option from the top)</p>
<p>-Select 'Display Adapter'</p>
<p>-Right click the integrated display card</p>
<p>-Select 'update drive software'</p>
<p>-Select 'search online for new updates'</p>
<p>-wait for loading to complete</p>
<p>-Your problem should be solved (at least it was in our experience)<br />
<br />
If this does not work you can try uninstalling the integrated card, then restarting your Surface Pro 3.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
-Steve</p>

 NOT recognize the Premium and the other does... thanks

<p>If you loaded these games off of a disc onto your computer there is a problem with the safe-disc2 otherwise known as secdrv.sys . Windows 10 is unable to read that file in order to tell the game to load. The samething is happening to a lot of older games
 that would run on windows 7 &amp; 8, 8.1 , Hopefully Microsoft will put out a update otherwise the only solution to this problem is to buy the game online and download it onto your computer since it won't require a optical drive in order to work. GoG, Gamergate
 &amp; Amazon are DRM free unlike Steam &amp; Origin that require you to be online in order to use the games you purchase.</p>
Please Microsoft fix this!!!!</li>

            <p>I was running Windows 8 and loaded these games from the Store and they became apps. They are Xbox games from Microsoft. That might be some of the problem, just don't know. The games still lock up and some don't work at all, but they are from A&amp;E and Microsoft.
 I believe in time there might be updates that will fix these, but until then, we'll see.....</p>

<h3> lordszat  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;regedit&#63;&#93; Cannot reset Windows 7</h2>
                    I recently installed something called "Respondus Lockdown Browser" as a part of my university courses, but the browser appears to have made numerous registry changes, locking me out of the Task Manager, disabling function keys, among others. I don't know
 them all, but I'm currently unable to reset Windows from the Start menu. The reset options only allow me to lock the PC or switch users, I cannot power off or reset!<br />
<br />
I suspect the registry is again the culprit, and I want to know the steps for me to restore this function. I can't turn my computer off short of ripping out the power cord any other way.<br />

<h2>            keyboard is hanging</h2>
                    <p>Since I've got a new windows machine at work, I cannot type code anymore.</p>
<p>Now I often see a</p>
<p>
</p><p>make_Pair</p>
<p>
</p><p>instead of a</p>
<p>
</p><p>make_pair</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got the impression that the (left) shift key is hanging.</p>
<p>I was thinking that I already switched off some unnecessary AI in the keyboard settings -- but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only happening at work.</p>
<p>At home I can still work -- both machines are running windows 10 (on a dell laptop).</p>
<p>At work I'm using a wireless keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more accurate:</p>
<p>There is nothing enabed under "Ease of access center -- Make the keyboard easier to use", except "turn on toggle keys by holding down the num lock key for 5 seconds".&nbsp;</p>

    <title>extremely slow laptop after september 2017 update on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tincanlas  say:</h3>
<h2>            extremely slow laptop after september 2017 update on windows 10</h2>
                    Is there a way I can speed up my computer? My computer became extremely slow in booting and now freezes up 90% of the time. I cannot even open any application as it takes 5 minutes to open a windows folder. Clicking the windows takes 5 minutes to load.
 I already tried system restore and after 1 hour said restore failed. Please advise what I need to do as I cannot use my laptop anymore. Before the update my computer works just fine.

<p>Hello Tin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you experience this performance issue is due to driver incompatibility. While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, it's recommended that you verify if there are missing or outdated
 drivers that may cause incompatibility between your operating system and drivers. You can visit this support
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to know more details about this.</p>

<p>I'm the exact same. Right after that update this month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how would a generic driver update fix it. If i could even get in to fix it which device will i update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>any other fixes? This laptop has been working perfectly for 5 years until this.</p>
<p>

            If the laptop is slow, this means that searching for the correct drivers, or even attempting to update them will not work. Best thing to do is to format the PC and if you are a user like me looking for an easier interface and 0 headaches, switch to apple.

            I have check every single item in the device manager. Why would MS roll out an update that kills overall computer performance. I am running an Intel I7 with 12mb of RAM and it has brought my laptop to its knees performance wise. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! Why
 Microsof, Why??!?!?!?!?!?!

<p>This 72 yr. old great-grandma had same problem.&nbsp; Don't know what I did to "fix" it but seems to be working OK this am. Articles talked about "safe mode" which I know nothing about so stayed away. Yesterday I could barely type, the curser so slow, freezing,
 etc.&nbsp; Also noticed on Chrome java denied. Didn't go into any command prompts.</p>
<p>In no particular did troubleshoot, driver fixed; disk clean up, removed old windows, etc. Went back later and cleaned up previous defender. Somewhere along the line, may have accidently got working again. Or, at least I hope so.</p>

<p>Exact same issue. &nbsp;I have Christmas photos to update for clients and am at my wits end. &nbsp;It seems insane that I have to spend money to fix a computer that worked well prior to this update. &nbsp;Your drver fix comment is laughable, it takes a half hour just to
 load a window. &nbsp;I had to reset and (of couse) all my apps are gone and there is no way I can re-install in its current state. &nbsp;VERY FRUSTRATED</p>

            I always tried to avoid windows updates but it was bugging me for a "critical update" for three straight days and I finally caved in.&nbsp; Took almost an hour for the computer to restart multiple times and it was finally done by 10:30 at night.&nbsp; I tried to
 start the computer this morning, it was extremely slow to boot.&nbsp; The Dell logo popped up then the screen reminded black for a few minutes.&nbsp; I thought something was wrong with my computer so I restarted it, same issue.&nbsp; I had to walk away from the laptop and
 came back later.&nbsp; It finally started up but it was extremely slow at every freakin' step.&nbsp; I can't believe I fell for this "critical update" scare tactic.&nbsp; It's critical all right and now I have to spend hours on finding a fix for this stupid problem.&nbsp; Thank
 you Microsoft for making my Christmas merry.
