<h2>            Error 800700E</h2>
                    
<p>Help! I have the latest updates and everything, however, I am unable to connect to the Marketplace. I can go into the marketplace, view the games, but if I select any one of the games, they give me a "Status Code" 80070E8. I can't download games. I can,
 however access only like 2 games. I live in Singapore and have been able to connect to the Marketplace before.</p>

<p>Hey Slyvan, sorry to hear about the Marketplace issue! First off, are you sure that's the exact code? Most codes have 8 digits, not 7, so please let us know if the code is actually slightly different or not. I'm curious, when was the last time you connected
 to the Marketplace? Was your console purchased in Singapore? Was your account created there, too?

<p>Oh Yes My title is mispelled. The code is 800700E8. Well the last time I connected to the marketplace was about 3 months ago, It hasn't worked since. My console was purchased in Singapore and it was created here.

If yes, then you may use that to take a picture with the built in cam.</span></p>
<p>
<span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press the "Picture" button in the "Camera Assistant" program window to take a picture using your built-in camera.</span></p>
<p>
<span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take one still photograph for every time you click the button.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image you are taking will appear on the right side of the main program window.</span></p>
<p><span>If the software is not installed on the netbook, then you may download it from the manufacturer’s website, install
 it and then check for the option.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 IME &#43; Google Chrome &#61; CTRL &#43; TAB Conflict - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simon quasar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 IME &#43; Google Chrome &#61; CTRL &#43; TAB Conflict</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I am using Windows 10 with Japanese IME Input and Chrome Browser, both have&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;as
 predefined keyboard shortcuts: the OS changes the character input (and this is where I use the shortcut for), while the browser switches to the next tab, so if I want to change the character input while writing in a form on a website, the weird outcome is
 that I jump to another tab AND then have the new char input ready.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I can't change this shortcut settings in the OS / Language settings like in Win7, and neither the browser config (or available plugins) let me change this behaviour.</p>

    <title>Disconnecting controller issue&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disconnecting controller issue&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've noticed I've been having disconnecting controller issues. &nbsp;Originally I thought it was because of a low battery, but now I'm thinking it is just NBA 2K14 is buggy. &nbsp;Is anyone else having this issue? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also had crashes as well with this game.</p>
<p>Dead Rising 3, Ryse, Battlefield 4 and Killer Instinct are all working well. &nbsp;My controllers have never disconnected while playing those games. &nbsp;</p>

<p>in the middle of playing a games with my son. at random a message will come up telling me to reconnect controller 2. but the controller is already connected! everything I try is useless. When we go back to the game I have no control over my team. Game Over!</p>
<p>Always happens quick, 1st quarter. Just long enough for me to get invested in the game. And happens every time! controllers have.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>You guys all misunderstood what is happening here. This is not a bug with the game, but a "feature" of Kinect. It's actually extremely silly.</p>
<p>Basically in 2k14, you cannot play multi-player unless you add another person in the Xbox account. You can just add a guest. Once you add a guest, then you will be able to play two players in 2k14. However, Microsoft didn't tell you that, when you added
 the "guest account" it associates the face of that guest to that guest account, so when you later play the game with your guest (wife, brother, son, friend, whoever), and when that face goes outside of the view of Kinect (says that person walks away, or blocked
 by a furniture, or whatever), then Kinect no longer could "See" that player anymore. When that happened, it will say "Controller x" is disconnected. What it means is that, the person the Kinect used to "See" as Player 2 has disappeared. See, this would happen
 too if you simply switch your controllers with your friend (P1 and P2 switch controller), or if P1 grabs P2's controller to press something (P1 holding both controller). In either cases, Kinect will "see" the controllers associated with a wrong face, then
 Kinect will pause the game and warn you that the original player has left the game. This is ridiculously stupid. What I have leanred to do is that, when this happens, NEVER simply press the 3-bar button. You must have the guest (whoever whose controller "disconnected"
 himself) click on the Xbox button to get out, go out to the Account page, and click "it doens't recognize me." That person must wave his/her hand above his/her head until it finds the correct username. Guest will have a generic username that's simply a digit
 appeneded to the primary account holder's user name. For example, if my username is abc, my guest username would be abc(1). So if my guest has disconnected, the guest needs to perform this action, then identify him/her as abc(1) in the account view, so Kinect
 will reassociate that controller with his face with abc(1). This MUST be done by that guest, otherwise the primary account holder would lose his/her controller (he would take over the Guest account and loses his association with the primary account.</p>
<p>Hmm after explaining this I realize this is not easy to explain. I don't know why did Microsoft make things so complex....it would really confuse a lot of people and make them think that something is wrong w/ their games....</p>

<h2>            My achievements are bugged. Fix this, immediately.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, there. I have two games with bugged achievements on my Xbox One. The two games are Outlast, and Another World: 20th Anniversary Edition. Both games are at 100%, and yet the achievements with that 100% are locked. I have tried many solutions. For example,
 reinstalling the games, deleting the saved file, even a hard reset/system reboot on the console. But none of the achievements will pop up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The achievements that I need fixed as soon as possible are -</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)"><strong>Another World 20th Anniversary Edition</strong></span> -
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Gladiator, Escape Water, Warrior, Survivor, Free Fall *Secret Achievement*, Explorer *Secret Achievement*,
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">and Secret UFO *Secret Achievement*</span></p>
<p><strong>Outlast&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">-</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Energiser.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please, I worked hard for some of these achievements, and I do not want to lose them. Thank you.</span><br />

<p>Yeah, I knew other people were having trouble. My Outlast achievement bugged today. But Another World, this has been going on since Saturday, August 2nd. So that has been more than a few days. Hm, hopefully this won't take long.</p>

    <title>High Surface Book 2 Temperature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rex catipay  say:</h3>
<h2>            High Surface Book 2 Temperature</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Book 2 15" 512gb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that my surface gets quite hot at above 90<span>°<span>C doing various tasks. For example like launching an application like Adobe Photoshop or doing any tasks which require high processing like Cinebench Benchmark. even when doing a file
 search in windows explorer it gets as hot as 95<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">°<span>C.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My idle temperature sits between 40<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">°<span>C and 50<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">°<span>C. Sometimes the high temperature stays like that for a minute or so and sometimes
 it only lasts for a second. Also the temperature starts off at 85<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">°<span>C when the computer is given load just right after booting up then gradually increases above&nbsp;<span>90</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">°<span>C.
 This is occurs on battery and when the laptop is plugged in.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The software I used to monitor temperature is CPUID HWMonitor.
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span>I have tried to troubleshoot using the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit and even doing a complete reinstall of Windows 10 with no luck.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am wondering if this is the normal or if this could possibly be an issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Edit: Temperatures explained above is for the CPU.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>

            There is no fan for the Intel processor only the vent holes around the tablet and the cover as a heat sink. It's best to use the DGPU for applications requiring high performance. Some owners are&nbsp; using a small fan behind the tablet as well. Also if you
 are using an external monitor the Surface base will not cool well with the tablet closed as the vents for the base fan are behind the keyboard / in front of the hinge.

<p>There's a fan in the 15 inch model which is the one I have. I can even hear and feel the CPU fan working. It doesn't feel that effective though, the air coming out isn't anywhere near warm compared to the back of the device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the dedicated graphics is fine with temperatures, just the CPU is the problem.</p>

</p><blockquote>My mistake on the fan. As for the CPU heat it's a common complaint. Microsoft has not properly addressed it.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I see that a lot in other forums. I just want to get a confirmation of the issue as I may have a defective unit, along with the heat, my benchmark scores doesn't quite reach as much as the ones in online reviews and reports from other people. My Cinebench
 score only reaches about 520cb multicore compared to online reviews which reach above 650cb. My surface cant even maintain 25watts for 5 minutes under load and power limit throttles to between 10 and 15watts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the machine appears to work properly, except for the heat and slight underperformance, I am a bit hesitant to exchange the machine until solid confirmation as the comparisons I have made relies on third party reviews and online discussions which I
 think may not be enough reasoning for exchange. Hence I posted here in hopes for a heads up from a Microsoft Moderator to confirm weather this is a defect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: I bought the Surface Book 2 in jbhifi Adelaide Australia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: You know, the store may just reason out that the device is working fine and reject my request. I do not live in the city I bought this device in so it would be a waste of time if not successful</p>

<p>That's a tough call. A number of owners have reported reduced performance after recent updates. Possibly something Microsoft did to solve other problems? I don't know what your exchange situation is in Australia but here in the US after the initial return
 period you can only exchange for a refurbished unit. Personally I would rather have slightly reduced performance than someone else's problems.</p>
<p>I've never run benchmark software on mine (15" 1TB) since it does everything I want and I'm not going to burn it up out of curiosity.</p>

<p>I have decided to return the Surface Book 2 due to issues highlighted in this post. Its been two weeks now in writing this since I returned my Surface Book 2 and I just got it back 3 days ago. Indeed the store identified it as an issue and told me it was
 going to be shiped back to Microsoft for evaluation and that Microsoft will send me a new device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my new device now 3 days ago and it no longer has the high temperature issue, temperatures now rise up to only in the high 80's under extreme synthetic CPU loads which is acceptable for me. The device I got was also brand new sealed which was good
 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend anyone reading this post to double check if their surface book has these issues so they can take action immediately as this issue could potentially reduce the life span of your surface in the long run. At least in Australia, you have the right
 to request a new replacement as remedy if the product is not of acceptable quality as per consumer laws.</p>

    <title>Ultra slow download speed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ultra slow download speed</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am a "happy" owner of a Surface Laptop 2. I really love the product, but for one issue: DL speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I want to download a file, it starts at like 1MB/s then drops at around 6kb/s.&nbsp; So a 90MB file needs... 7 hours to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several laptops, one of them is a Lenovo, I installed the same build, and downloaded the same file on it, which took roughly about 55sec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>less than a minute on the lenovo, 7 hours on the Surface Laptop2. There is something weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet browsing is generally slower on this machine than on my older devices. Sadly. But I can manage. But the download speed is really unbearable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be an issue with the Marvell network card? All my other laptops have qualcomm chips. I wonder if Marvell encounters some issues with the latest Windows build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone has a fix or even an idea about the reason, I would be very very happy. I am really close to send the device back to Microsoft and ask a refund. Sad, because I really love this product otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day</p>

<h2>            windows 10 remote desktop to windows 2008r2 server</h2>
                    <p>i have been able to connect to our windows server using the remote desktop app successfully for several years. &nbsp;earlier this week we updated our server. the updates were applied via windows updates and included all updates since december of last year. after
 the updated completed i could no longer access the server via Remote Desktop. i get the error&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Can't connect to the remote pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>this might be because of a network connection problem. Try connecting again. If this keeps happening, contact technical support, or ask your system administrator for help."</p>
<p>
</p><p>the error log on the server shows "the following fatal alert was generated:10 The internal error state is 1203."</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, if i use the rdp app on my windows phone, i can successfully connect to the server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried a number of windows 10 machines and they all exhibit the same behavior. i am pretty sure it is not a server issue (except that i suspect one of the updates changed the connection handshake). i have read many posts about how to delete and recreate
 the server certificate and have tried turning off the firewall on both the server and the local pc. as i said what is really interesting is that the rdp client on my windows phone works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stumped and need a suggestion or two?</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have the Windows 7 recovery partition on the hard disk?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have the Windows 7 recovery disc provided by the computer manufacturer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if the core system files associated with Windows are not working properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows 7, the qualifying product for the Windows 8 upgrade is Windows 7. For this Windows 8 upgrade to work it will look for the qualifying product. In this case it is Windows 7. Hence, you need to have Windows 7 installed
 first and then upgrade to Windows 8. Without the qualifying product installed, you cannot install Windows 8 on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need a previous version of Windows installed on your PC to perform a clean installation of Windows 8.1, but you do for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Windows 7 came pre-installed, you may put the computer back to factory settings so that the base platform or the qualifying product is ready. Ensure to back the data before performing the factory reset as this will erase the data.</p>

            Thanks for the help and advice. I was able to determine my Windows 8 key by installing Belarc Advisor. Running the program calls out lots of system detail including the Windows system key. This gives me what I need to do a clean Windows installation. Thanks&nbsp;

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Skype start on my Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble with Skype on my Mac.&nbsp; When I launch the Skype application, the login window doesn't come up.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling skype (both manually and using app cleaner) and installing it again - but no luck.&nbsp; Skype version I am trying to install
 is 8.34.0.78</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have been having this problem for quite sometime now and as a work around I was using an older version of Skype (don't remember which one as I deleted the dmg) which again had the same problem, but works when I uninstall and reinstall it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now wish to resolve the problem permanently.&nbsp; Appreciate if someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is my Mac configuration and it is up to date with all software updates:</p>
<p>MacOS Mojave Version 10.14.1</p>
<p>Processor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5</p>
<p>Memory: 8 GB</p>
<p>Graphics: Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB</p>

<h2>            Disabling of programs with Windows 10 installation or update</h2>
                    Windows 10 installation and major refreshes or updates have the annoying habit of disabling older programs or some that MS believes might be a security risk to the user that ran fine under Windows 7, XP, and Win 10 before the last major update.&nbsp; MS had,
 in my opinion, no valid reason to disable compatible programs.&nbsp; I reinstalled the two I really like, , using an updated installer or compatibility mode.&nbsp; They work fine with Windows 10.&nbsp; MS claims security concerns, but it is not for them to correct users'
 risky behavior.&nbsp; If MS wants such security that it disables third party apps that are otherwise compatible with Windows, then it should design it so it will only run MS apps and devices that are&nbsp; manufactured by MS, refuse all others, and uninstall or disable
 anything else.&nbsp; Otherwise, they should assume the best of their products' users, warn them of any incompatibilities the Windows installer may discover, and allow the user to make the decision to

<p>Two programs got my ire when Windows 10 disabled them.&nbsp; One is the Gadgets.&nbsp; These handy applets display very conveniently basic information that I use everyday in an unobtrusive manner much superior to those displayable on the start menu.&nbsp; They require
 opening nothing to view them and supply a continuous stream of desired information while occupying an insignificant amount of the screen.&nbsp; When I updated to Win 10 they were disabled.&nbsp; Microsoft actually explained that they were protecting the user from vulnerable

<p>
</p><p>The other program is JASC Paint Shop 9, a really old graphics program dating from Win XP, the last version of this program before Corel bought it and reduced it to just a photo editing program.&nbsp; It ran fine under Win XP and 7, and I really like it.&nbsp; It was
 disabled.&nbsp; There may have been some compatibility problem, but no message relating to this was shown.&nbsp; It was simply disabled.&nbsp; I reinstalled it using the compatibility troubleshooter.&nbsp; It works fine with Win 10 in Win XP SP3 compatibility mode.</p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>Microsoft deprecated Sidebar Gadgets with the release of Windows 8.0, so it has not been supported for quite a while now.

<p>
</p><p><strong>True, in some respects, its a direction the company has taken in the last couple of years to be the company that defines work and productivity. Then again, 15 year old software running on Windows 10 is kind of pushing it as Microsoft abandoning customers.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, average people just want their stuff to work out of the box, period.&nbsp; They don't want a steep learning curve or a plethora of new "features."&nbsp;

<p><strong>If that was the case, computers would never get easier to use, you would still be using punch cards and probably only be able to access a computer through a university or employer. Innovation and change is a required expectation. Computers have gotten
 tremendously easier of the past 20 years. 20 years ago, you had to know your IRQ's, buy a web browser, TCP/IP stack and configure it yourself. Today, most of what you can do with Jasc Paintshop Pro is freely available in Paint and requires little learning
 curve. </strong></p>

<p><strong>They haven't lost sight, its just a case of you being contented with a release and not wanting to move forward. Computing is so much easier now and Windows 10 in comparison to Windows XP or Windows 7 is very easy to use. Most of the functionality
 offered in things like Gadgets are right there in Live Tiles or the Action Center, when you really need it. You don't need to have it on screen all the time to know whats going on.

<p>
</p><p>But I like having it on the screen all the time. It's not up to you or anyone else to say what we may want or need. I liked having live weather radar, CPU load and network usage sitting in the corner of the screen. Given the move toward ultra-wide displays,
 it makes even more sense to be able to set your screen up with gadgets or their like at one edge &nbsp;and have your applications in the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is this thing with people telling others what they should like and not like or how they should use their PCs or not? We develop our usage over time making use of all the facilities of the OS with multiple ways of doing things so we can choose at any
 time how we want it to look and act. Some of us like to make our environments suit our personal aesthetic. Same as making furniture or artwork or whatever.</p>

            <p>I thought this thread had ended, but I see it hasn't.&nbsp; I'm not a person who doesn't want to change.&nbsp; What I want in change is something that is useful and sufficiently different to warrant the change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ease of use is nice, but Win 10 is not significantly different from Win 7 in ease of use.&nbsp; It just has a glitzier interface.&nbsp; There may be some under the hood improvements, which are appreciated by the tech savvy, but mean almost nothing to an average user.&nbsp;
 For example:&nbsp; its use of multi-core processors is superior to Win 7.&nbsp; I noted in a recent article on operating system market share that Win 7's share slightly increased compared to Win 10.&nbsp; I'm sure this vexes MS to no end.&nbsp; I do have the capability to move
 back to Win7, but have no compelling reason to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The comment about 15 year old software fails to recognize that the 15 year old graphics software still does 95% of what the latest version of Adobe Photoshop does (no change there).&nbsp; I do have some software that is used on those very rare occasions when
 its age does show.&nbsp; After all, technology does advance, mostly for the good.&nbsp; However, why change just for change?&nbsp;
 since it is no longer maintained, but I'm happy with it until then; and that's what counts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One change that I do like with Win 10 is the improved built in anti-virus protection. Defender combined with&nbsp; good computer habits makes a computer highly unlikely to be infected, but even with the careless it is pretty good.&nbsp; Another is some of the small
 browser apps from the MS store that make a few things more convenient.&nbsp; I'm sure over time, I'll find some further things that are useful improvements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to the Gadgets, it is a personal preference to have them on the screen all the time.&nbsp; This is something that the live tiles do not provide in an unobtrusive way, and having to open a window to check something out is a nuisance to me and many people
 who want the information available with just a glance without chewing up a lot of real estate on the screen or interrupting the flow of work to click on the little windows icon in the corner to see the live tiles cover up what they are doing.&nbsp; Fortunately,
 there are enough people who feel as I do to build new installers and modify the Gadgets to work with Win 10.&nbsp; It shows that there are a lot of people who prefer the Gadgets, and MS needs to recognize this and stop killing the gadgets when there's a major update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used computers starting when there were no monitors and no keyboards available to the normal use.&nbsp; Think keypunch, card readers, and printers and flashing lights as the only I/O.&nbsp; I think I've used just about every model of computer and operating system
 over this fifty year period available to the general public and most businesses.&nbsp; I've programmed in almost every language except machine code, often just to see how they worked and in most cases with MS products.&nbsp; So, I think I'm qualified to judge what is
 useful change and what is not.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update 1607 - constantly failing...</h2>
                    <p>For the last month and a half, my Dell Vostro 3560 has been running very slowly and the HDD light is pretty much constantly illuminated. At the same time the internet band width was awful. &nbsp;I discovered that the 1607 Feature update was trying to download
 and install and repeatedly failing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a clean boot with no joy and just this week saw several Gig of mobile data used when I stupidly used the laptop away from the home/office wifi network! I've tried disabling Antivirus (Trend)but that makes no difference. &nbsp;the machine has been switched
 on for 2.5hrs this evening and it still says Downloading updates 0%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got Windows 10 Home 1511 OS build 10586.633</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time MS Office Access Runtime and Data Connectivity Pack 2007 (SP3) attempts to install and fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest anything that might help? &nbsp;I'm seriously considering dumping the thing and buying a new laptop! Current workaround is to turn off the internet connection on the laptop and use my iPad!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 ever since it was possible last year. Each and every time, the installation fails due to:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Other than the update failing, there are no consequences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other info:</p>
<p>1. I have automatic updates ON, so my system is up to date.</p>
<p>2. I have never messed with the registry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am st a loss as to why the upgrade fails.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thx for your quick response. However, it looks like too much trouble to upgrade. I have decided to stick with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise those on the Windows 10 team how incredibly disappointed I and my husband are that an upgrade of a Windows product which only Microsoft has ever altered via its updates is so difficult and time-intensive.</p>

</p><p>When Microsoft announced last year that Windows 7 users would be able to upgrade for free, that was clearly pucky. I doubt that even half of all individual Windows 7 users could successfully follow the instructions you provided to maybe make the installation
 work. I am not sure I could either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest frustration over the past year and dozens of unsuccessful attempts to upgrade has been getting the message that the upgrade failed for an "unknown reason."</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can Microsoft, the largest software company in the world, not know why an installation failed involving its software when its employees created that software, were responsible for all changes in that software and supposedly created a compatible upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only answer is it never intended to allow Windows 7 users to upgrade for free.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Click Ctrl+Alt+Delete simultaneouly. If the logon screen appears with the options - "Lock this Computer", "Switch user"... select "Start Task Manager". When the Task Manager window appears, select Process tab, navigate to explorer.exe, select End Process.
 A dialog box opens for your confirmation to end the process -&gt; click "end process".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot find explorer.exe as in step 1, proceed to step 2.</p>
