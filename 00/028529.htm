    <title>Excel office365 crashes when using recommended chart - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel office365 crashes when using recommended chart</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently multiple users in our company have the problem that excel crashes when using the feature "recommended chart".</p>
<p>The crashes occurred when creating both a new sheet and editing a older one.<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried the following to solve this issue:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Online repair through apps and features</li><li>Office365 reinstall</li><li>Using different laptops and different accounts&nbsp;</li><li>Using accounts local accounts instead of AzureAD connected ones.&nbsp;</li><li>fresh windows install</li><li>OffCat scan gave me the following issues: Cached Credentials and profile type = local.</li></ul>
<p>None of the above were able to make excel stable to work with. Every time excel crashes, and restarts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also excel crashes when the app is being loaded, and when clicking the " files -&gt; office account" .</p>
<p>
</p><p>An older version of excel works fine when using this feature: 16.0.7167.2060</p>
<p>but reverting the office version on the devices that have this problem doesnt solve the issue either<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Rena,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im currently using a clean windows install with only office365 32bit installed. I've just updated office to the latest build: 8326.2073. Older version don't work either, as stated in my previous message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Holding CTRL and opening the sheets/running the application and opening the sheets dont make a difference compaired to running it normally. It still crashes and restart without any stopcode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now 2 laptops with me, one that works Fine and a laptop with a fresh windows installation that doesn't, to isolate the problem. Both are the same Lenovo Thinkpad T410's. Both have the same Office build 8326.2073&nbsp;without any added features compared to
 the normal office setup. This problem also occurs on the Lenovo thinkpad 13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only occurs when the recommended charts feature is activated when selecting the data that needs to be applied to the chart or when clicking on a specific type of chart en pressing "more charts" in the dropdown menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem began occuring on monday. Nothing was changed to the laptops with this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Gideon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my test and your description, it should not be an Office version bug, and this is not related to any other third-party programs as the issue also happens in a new refreshed windows computer.
</p>
<p>I suggest you create a new windows user account to log in to the computer to see the result, sometimes the issue can be caused by a damaged user profile.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

<h3> marvin lemmon  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA, macro, to check IF formula returns text then push formula to next cell until a zero value is returned.</h2>
                    <p>Hello and thank you for helping me with my beginner VBA skills.</p>
<p>I manually recorded a VBA code that helps to populate columns A &amp; B.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b36e21e-7a10-4ecc-898e-401308a92dc0" /></p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9dde6b9-1067-41ce-969f-823748af8b25" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like the VBA to check the bottom cell of column A for &nbsp;when/if an array formula returns a zero value. &nbsp;The array formula checks an adjacent list for a unique value and returns it; as presently it returns a zero because there is no list. &nbsp;My impression
 is that when I have the VBA 'Goto Reference:=...' it would check the cell value and if the array return anything other than zero it would completed the action of Range.Select and Selection.FillDown to continue the array formula's function of returning unique
 values.</p>

<p>Hello and thank you for helping me with my beginner VBA skills.</p>
<p>
The array formula checks an adjacent list for a unique value and returns it</p></blockquote>
<p>Most VBA beginners thinks that they have to fill formulas in cells to get the results they want, because they are experienced with formulas. But that is the wrong way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In VBA you <em>can </em>write formulas, and you <em>can </em>select and activate and goto and do all the other things that you
<em>see </em>within the recorded macro. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">But you should not</span> write VBA code as a recorded macro shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please never use SELECT, SELECTION, ACTIVECELL, it is slow and error prone. Always refer to the objects directly. The macro recorder doesn't know where your goal is, that is the reason for that &amp;%$"! code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said you want to check a list for a unique value, so let us start with a simple example. I assume that the value is in cell A1 and the list is in column B, then this is all what you need:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp; Dim R As Range<br />
&nbsp; Set R = Range("B:B").Find(Range("A1"), LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole)<br />
&nbsp; If R Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Not found"<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Found in row " &amp; R.Row<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>That is that same as you search for the value manually, easy, fast, effective. Paste this code into a regular module, place the cursor at
<strong>.Find</strong> and press F1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, here is a good tutorial for beginners:</p>

            <p>Morning Andreas</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can read a bit of frustration in your response so it is good to know that you are passionate about the subject of simplifying a process. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you asked, the process is getting 1) 'Raw CRM Data' which is pasted onto worksheet #4 2) Worksheets #1 &amp; #2 read the data; which #1 is a formatted individual 'Distributor Payout Report' #2 is a formatted grouped 'Distributor Payout Report'. &nbsp;Worksheet
 #3 is a static worksheet with various elements and schedules of how payouts should occur based on sales types and volumes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'Raw CRM Data' has the anchors, one for Worksheet #1 and one for Worksheet#2, for what the client wants to pivot from. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 pivots on the distributor name, using what I know of formulas it reads from 'RawCRM Date' and WkSht#3 based on the unique name selected, e.g. the distributor name. &nbsp;It is adjacent to the aforementioned SnippingTool capture in column C. &nbsp;Using {=IFERROR(INDEX(C2:C,MATCH(0,COUNTIF($A$1:A1,C2:C),0)),"")}
 the unique values list is created based on the name &amp; # of distributors, column B just tells me the COUNTIF for each distributor in C2:C; C1 being the table headers. &nbsp;Presently the list is manually completed with .FillDown until Zero values appear indicating
 no further distributors exists. &nbsp;That is the code I would like to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hope is the macro would be reading that RawData and populate a list of unique distributors. &nbsp;That would be the first data analysis. &nbsp;2nd step, when it reads zero it stops then begins a new process of report generation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking those unique names from first to last in the list and pasting it into a named cell where-in the process has been cleaned up to a more simpler solution, using formulas :|... &nbsp;&amp; &nbsp;beautiful
 is poorly... :*(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p />

            <p>Okay Marvin, your choice. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not know, when the formula returns zero before you have fill it, so I suggest to fill the formulas down in on step
<span><span>so far</span> <span>that you can</span> <span>be sure that</span> <span>
a</span> <span>0</span> <span>appears. Then you can remove the unnecessary formulas below the 0.</span></span> That is much faster as to fill it line by line.</p>
<p>

    <title>Why does Microsoft Word Intentionally Defeat the Purpose of Importing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does Microsoft Word Intentionally Defeat the Purpose of Importing SVG Drawings</h2>
                    <p>So, last year when I saw the news on Ars Technica stating that the Office suite was adding support for importing SVG files, my reaction was, “it’s about frelling time.” Granted, in Microsoft’s defense, a number of graphic design software also lacked SVG
 support until relatively recently. Editing SVG was not a consideration for me, as that is why I have Canvas Draw, Canvas X 2019, OmiGraffle, and Affinity Designer. As SVG files are for vector-based graphics it is a metadata file that describes the drawing/illustration,
 so even relatively complex drawings generate files that are smaller than a bitmap graphic file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I used this capability for a rather lengthy annual report, I was shocked to find that the report was substantially larger than previous reports. In previous reports, I rendered graphs and photos edited in Canvas X at 144 ppi. As the images were imported
 and pasted into placeholders that were 75% of the image design size the imported images were 192 ppi. One of my annual reports had well over 100 images, and the second report had upwards of 100 images. The reports that I authored before SVG support was added
 to Office were well under 10 MB, so they could easily be e-mailed to my client that has a government-issued Windows PC. As his work PC is hardened in terms of what he can do, I could not send a copy to him for review using my OneDrive account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2018 reports that had all graphs in the SVG format were up to 30+ MB. So, the use of SVG drawings dramatically increased file size when it should have reduced file size. When the reports were converted to PDF for distribution to stakeholders, the PDF
 files were substantially smaller (≪ 10MB) than the Word version. When I recalled that DOCX files are actually containers I explored the contents to find a very disturbing reason for the container being so large. In the media folder within the DOCX container,
 I noticed that every SVG file had an accompanying JPEG image. The only JPEG image I added to the report was the full-page cover; all remaining graphics were graphs in the SVG format. Therefore, the reason my reports were bloated was due to Microsoft creating
 bitmap versions of the SVG drawings at rather high resolution (≈ 300 ppi). As a result, the JPEG versions created by Word were, on average, 10 times as large as the SVG version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why on Earth did Microsoft take this approach? The implementation completely kills the reason for importing graphics in a vector format.</p>
<p>

<p>MS does make a lot of seemingly unfortunate design decisions. Often it is for "backward" compatibility. Sometimes it is seemingly just to be contrary.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I don't know the answer to your question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is extremely unlikely you will get the answer to this sort question by posting it here. While there are a couple of very knowledgeable Word experts on the forum, with access to real MS Developers, it is hit or miss if they look at an specific question.
 There are also some MS managers who might have answers lurking on the forum, they pop up once or twice a year to answer questions like this. But it is very unlikely that they answer a specific question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too will suggest you submit a "Feedback" to MS. But don't use the Feedback in the application. It is a one-way "black hole". You get no information back from it. Instead, use either the appropriate UserVoice web page, or the Win 10 Feedback Hup &lt;cr&gt;applet.
 At least in both of those venues you can monitor your submission to see if there is any reply from MS.&nbsp; They update the feedback "status" to indicate what is being done about it. And, very rarely, they do post a more expansive reply for everyone to see.

<p>Thanks for the info. I did send feedback through Word, but I will also look into the resources you noted. I have found that posts here tend to rapidly fade into obscurity simply due to the large user base of Microsoft products. I am also not surprised that
 you mentioned that the in-software feedback is a one-way black hole; is there anything other than a one-way black hole. 😁 As a Mac user, I have to admit that Apple’s feedback site is much the same, and they remove posts to the community pages that are either
 feature requests or polling to measure the demand for a feature within the macOS base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also sent inquiries in the past about the epic fail that is Word cross-references. Much of how cross-references work in Word makes you wonder from whom did the Office development team bought their research papers for their required English courses
 in college. The most glaring of the cross-reference faux pas is the fact that the default item in the
<strong>Insert reference to</strong> drop menu for many reference types is “Entire caption”. As a published scientist, in the roughly 40 years since I wrote my first research paper in middle school I have authored a document with cross-references using the
 entire caption, or seen another document that does so, has been 1… 2…, oh wait, never. It is simply not done. “Entire caption” should not be in the list at all, let alone the default choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The link in my previous reply lists 4 ways of submitting feedbacks. 2 apply to Mac, the in app black hole and links to "UserVoice" websites.&nbsp; You will be able to monitor other replies, including MS<br />
&nbsp;"status" updates at uservoice. Some of the uservoice subsites are OS Specific, some are not. UserVoice is a real wild west show of randomness. But it gets the information to MS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cross-References", or "References". Cross references, links to content in a document seems to work OK for me.&nbsp; But I do agree the whole bibliography / citation feature is a slow motion train wreck.&nbsp; It seems to have zero priority at MS when there are bugs
 or updates to the standards. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? I used WordPerfect back in the 80's when it was the market leader. Word introduced features, that worked well, MS followed with marketing fluff "copy-cat" versions of the features. MS Marketing pushed these new "features" to suck in unwary buyers. 2
 examples of that were "Full justification" and Master / Sub documents. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For "justification" MS just stuffed full spaces between Word up until 1995 or later.&nbsp; For a while they had an option (buried in options list) "do justification like Word Perfect", eventually they finally merged the feature in as a default.&nbsp; WordPerfect has
 since the 1980s done "proper" justification, subtly increasing space between words (less than full space increments) AND between letters in word.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Master / Sub feature was a god send in the 80's when computer RAM was measured in 10's and hundreds of KB (not GB!) and an 80MB hd was a $500 extra on a new computer. Files were saved on "floppy" disk that really were floppy and stored a grand 360Kb,
 which could be bumped to 720KB with a hole punch in the right spot ... So if you wanted to work on long documents, like a book or a thesis, you almost certainly had to split it into sub documents.&nbsp; In WP, master / sub worked great. You could expand/compress
 the master, and everything else worked in a well thought out way. Even today non MS experts Word experts consider the Master / Sub feature to be an open invitation to document corruption and vehemently advise against using it.

<h2>            SOLUTION to a common problem syncing PDF annotations in OneDrive on iOS</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed that a lot of other people have had a difficulty with syncing PDF annotations made with OneDrive for iPad’s internal PDF viewer. Yet, I have not seen any solutions that worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a matter of frustration for several months, but I finally found a very SIMPLE solution that worked right away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the iPad, go to Settings&gt;OneDrive. Then toggle&nbsp;<strong>Background App Refresh
</strong>off and back on. That worked for me. Annotations that hadn’t been syncing for MONTHS (!) starting uploading immediately. It took time for everything to synchronize, but now everything is in order.</p>

                    I want to print the Team Planner view which will span several pages horizontally and include the resource name (first column) on all pages. When I go to the View tab in Page Setup when viewing the Team Planner all options (including "Print first x columns
 on all pages") are disabled. Is there a way to do this?

            <p>br60grit,</p>
<p>Wow, 60 grit, that's pretty coarse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Team Planner is one of those custom views that has limited flexibility and that's exactly what you are experiencing with the pint. You can however, customize the header or footer and you might consider using that to get the resource name on each page.
 I tried using a formula to copy the resource name to the Text1 field but that didn't work, might be a little glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Clearly it appears as if the screen was damaged after the drop. Could be a connection that became faulty or something to do with the digitizer. I suggest having a service center look at it. I'm not sure what else to offer...

"There is not enough memory or disk space to save the entire Ignore All list."<br />

Thank you.<br />

            That message means that the document has corrupted.
<div><br />
<div>The cure is a Maggie: &nbsp;see at the bottom of this post.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to add a little more explanation: &nbsp;"not enough memory or disk space" means "something to do with saving the document failed". &nbsp;The only possible reason the coders thought that could happen was because you were out of memory or disk space. &nbsp;These days,
 that is the LEAST likely explanation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The reason the document won't save is because its internal code has become corrupted. &nbsp;The cause is often the use of Tracked Changes. &nbsp;Chances are, that document has been tracking changes&nbsp;all its&nbsp;life, and you have switched off the display of tracked changes
 so you do not have to look at them. &nbsp;If you turn the&nbsp;display&nbsp;of tracked changes back on, you will see that the document has now become impossibly complex, and that is why it has corrupted: it is now so complicated Word can't read its own handwriting. &nbsp;If you
 "Accept all changes in document" then save and close the document, that may resolve the issue for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the "Ignore All" list becomes large (more than five or six items) in a document, that usually indicates that either the text is in the wrong language, or the custom dictionary is in the wrong language. &nbsp;Either way, the spelling checker is not working
 "well" if you have to ignore sufficient words to give you this problem. &nbsp;Fix that issue and your work will be a lot more productive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Maggie is very likely to cure your issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is not the place to be asking questions about Word 2010: that's the PC version, this forum is for the Macintosh version which is very different.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>The Maggie:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Create a new blank document in .docx format</p>
<p>2. Carefully select all of the text in the bad document EXCEPT the last</p>
<p>paragraph mark</p>
<p>3. Copy it.</p>
<p>4. Paste in the new document.</p>
<p>5. Save under a new file name and close all, then re-open.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This technique for de-corrupting is known as "Doing a 'Maggie'", after</p>
<p>Margaret Secara from the TECHWR-L mailing list, who first publicised the</p>
<p>technique.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Hi Beatrice,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Glad you are using a Mac! You are in the right place here.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In addition to John's answer, make sure your file name has no special characters. Slashes in particular are troublesome anywhere in the file path. Make sure your hard drive and all folders you make do not have slashes / or other special characters anywhere
 in the file name,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think there may be a 255 character limit to file names, as well.</p>

<p>I have problem where some holiday calendar from old time in different time zone from one&nbsp;than I&nbsp;use now shows events on my primary Calendar. It's really annoying and as right now I don't have any important events on my calendar I would like to purge it and
 hopefully clean unwanted events I tried&nbsp;deleting events&nbsp;manually but its lots of work there is many years of events in there.</p>

            <p>Problem is that holiday&nbsp;events&nbsp;show up&nbsp;on my primary calendar not separate holiday calendar (as they are now if you add holiday calendar, so I have double events for holiday in different time zones, I lived in different time zone some time ago)&nbsp;how they
 got there I have no idea probably something with migrations to new versions.</p>
<p>I think I got my problem solved now by using outlook 2016 making my calendar as list selecting all events and deleting them, that got rid of lots of holiday events for many years to come I think&nbsp;all the way to&nbsp;year 2025. Now I use separate holiday calendar.</p>

<p>Hi All, I have bough <strong>HTC HD2</strong> recently and I want to disable the features like calender, clock, Quick Application Launcher in Home screen. Basically i just want to see the plain empty home screen. Can any one help to disable these functionality.
 As far as i understand this consumes more battery power (I can able to do with the third party application "<em>Home Screen Customizer</em>" but i am looking from the phone features).<br />
<br />
I also mailed to HTC support that they&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;you need to disable "Touch Glow". I am not sure where i can find this. Appreciate if any one can help me.. Thanks</p>

<p>You can disable the HTC gui (maybe it's called Touch Glow on your phone) and choose the Windows Tap Start &gt; Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; Today &gt; Items tab &gt; you can try out the Windows Default or you can choose the specific items you'd like to display on the
 home screen by placing a checkmark in the box.&nbsp; If you scroll down the list, you'll see that HTC gui is selected.&nbsp; The HTC and the Windows Default options "cancel out" any other selections here.&nbsp; So if you choose HTC&nbsp; or Windows Default, you will not be able
 to choose any of the other items in the list.&nbsp; Play around with it and see what you like.</p>

                    <p>I've been having problems with my Outlook e-mail account and have noticed that when clicking on the e-mail icon on my computer, I have to sign in, which I've never had to do before.&nbsp; And then I've recently noticed that once I sign in to my account, the address
 is http://outlook.live.com and then a long, long line of numbers and letters after it that is longer that the window is.&nbsp; What the heck is this long stream of letters and numbers?&nbsp; Have I been hacked?</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions and tried to set my primary alias as my one e-mail, but the choice was not allowed.&nbsp; When I went to the "Manage How You Sign In" page my e-mail address was viewable as a greytone and appeared to already be checked, but when I
 put my mouse over it, a black circle with the bar across it appeared indicating that I could not click on it.&nbsp; So now that didn't work, any other suggestions?&nbsp; Or should I just let it be and wait until Microsoft solves the issue.&nbsp; I was just worried that it
 was a virus or something that could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions tho. &nbsp;</p>

<br />But do you use that MSN account in browser (Outlook.com) or you have set it up in email client ?

<br />What happens when you log to your MSN account here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/</a> and you try to send email to yourself ? You receive it normally or as outlook_long series of letters and numbers @ outlook.com.

<h2>            Task Scheduler-Windows Defender Scheduled Scan fails &#40;quick scan&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running windows 10 home, version 1607 (anniversary edition) since 8/31/16, and can't schedule a quick scan in task scheduler. There are four parts to this task, cache maintenance, cleanup, scheduled scan &amp; verification. Three parts of task complete successfully
 with exception of scheduled scan, I always get error code (Ox80070002), the system can not find the file specified. Prior to 8/31/16, I was running windows 10 home, version 1511 and all four parts of task completed successfully with no problems. I'm not a
 very, very tech savvy person, but I do read a lot, and have tried using the sfc /scannow&nbsp; command prompt to try and locate this file. I don't know if this has anything to do with scheduled scan issue I'm having. If anyone has knowledge about this please post.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>It looks like you’ve added triggers to all of the Windows Defender scheduled tasks. All of these tasks are actually
</span><strong><span>system tasks</span></strong><span> and they’re all being triggered automatically every day by
</span><strong><span>Windows Automatic Maintenance</span></strong><span> – so it’s pointless to add another trigger to any of them (despite the fact that</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Microsoft published a bogus method for scheduling a scan by adding
 a trigger to the </span><strong><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan </span></strong><span>task):</span></p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/windows-10-how-do-i-set-windows-defenders-scan/f399bb87-37c9-4a74-bb35-1d7e3d3c2436"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/windows-10-how-do-i-set-windows-defenders-scan/f399bb87-37c9-4a74-bb35-1d7e3d3c2436</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are multiple issues with scheduling a scan by adding a trigger to the
</span><strong><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan </span></strong><span>task in the new release of Windows 10 (Version 1607), as&nbsp;I've explained&nbsp;in this thread:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/windows-defender/131bb44c-2593-4f35-b9e3-84bab934cc5e"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/windows-defender/131bb44c-2593-4f35-b9e3-84bab934cc5e</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Additionally, you might have an issue with the file path for the </span>
<strong><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan</span></strong><span> task that needs to be corrected. My recommendation would be to delete all of the triggers that you’ve added to the Windows Defender scheduled tasks, and then set up a daily Quick Scan with
 the proper method for scheduling any task in any version of Windows – the </span>
<strong><span>Create Basic Task Wizard</span></strong><span>. </span><span>In order to avoid the new
</span><strong><span>erratic scan issue</span></strong><span> that cropped up in Version 1607, you’ll also need to be sure that you
</span><strong><span>don’t change the user</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>account</span></strong><span> when you get to step 7 here – just leave&nbsp;the account for your task&nbsp;at&nbsp;the default setting:</span></p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Vlookup Column Number missing when highlighted</h2>
                    <p>You know how in the previous office versions, you get the column number in a tiny little box when you are highlighting selected columns while writing the vlookup formula? It's gone from this 365 Excel 2016 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me how to get it back?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very crucial for my day to day job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I know if I'm working on the same workbook, I can see that in the Name box. Unfortunately I usually work across different files and it's ridiculous that excel is not telling me how many columns I selected while in the vlookup formula.<br />

<p>Hi, I know how frustrating it is. But I worked out a way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the top row as table_array up to the column you want, instead of the whole column, it will show you how many columns you have selected, release the mouse, then highlight the whole column as we normally do, you already know how many columns you have
 selected.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Search for footnote text in .Docx - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonydiaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Search for footnote text in .Docx</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Im currently using Windows 7 Enterprise x64 and Office Professional 2010.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>I am able to configure Windows search on a Windows 7 workstation to search for
<b>exact phrases</b> within Word documents. However, I noticed that I cannot seem to obtain search results on text contained within a footnote in a Microsoft Word document. If that
<b>same text </b>phrase exists within the normal body of the document the search will indeed pick it up, but not when its
<b>only</b> contained in the<b> footnote</b> text of the document. Wasn't sure if this was a limitation of the windows search capability, a configuration change I needed to make, or something within Microsoft Word that needs to change in order to the text contained
 within the footnote to be picked up by the operating systems search engine. </p>


<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tony Diaz</p>

    <title>Strange DNS &#47; Certificate Issue - Outlook 2013 &#43; Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Strange DNS &#47; Certificate Issue - Outlook 2013 &#43; Outlook.com Custom Domain</h2>
                    For the past couple of weeks I've been frustrated by my inability to set up an Outlook.com custom domain in Outlook 2013 on my computer, and then yesterday I finally realized that the issue is specifically with my computer (adding the domain to any other
 computer here or at work is fine)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The issue is that there seems to be something cached on my computer. It has to do with a secure certificate for a website that I was involved in testing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HERE'S WHAT I'VE ALREADY TRIED</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I checked the Certificates store on this computer and there's nothing for that website</li><li>I've also done ipconfig /flushdns which also has not helped</li><li>Somebody also suggested to me that I remove my profile from Outlook 2013 and re-add it (or at least add a new profile and see if I can add the e-mail account successfully that way). I can't do this because the Mail applet in the control panel won't run,
 which is another strange thing on this computer. The Control Panel window flashes for a second when I try to run it, as if it's trying to start, but then nothing happens</li><li>Then it was suggested that I manually remove my profile from the registry, which I can't do, because there's no registry key in the correct place that has my profile name. Everything is REG_BINARY and so of course I can't read it</li><li>And I've shut down every device on the network including the cable modem / routers, but still the problem persists</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea where else I can look for something related to certificates or DNS that might be stored someplace that I should delete / flush?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks...</div>
                </div>

            <p>So what exactly is this certificate issue?<br />
What error do you get and when do you get it?<br />
Which website is it looking for?<br />
Which are on the certificate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that the Mail applet doesn't work for you would suggest an installation issue. Have you tried reinstalling already?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still want to delete your mail profiles via the Registry, then the correct location is:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Outlook\Profiles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, remove any custom certificate which you might have installed to make sure it isn't interfering for whatever reason.</p>

            I'm having trouble getting the certificate error to display...I can't remember how I saw it previously, but the error from Outlook itself is just fairly generic:<br />
<br />
Send test e-mail message: The connection to the server was interrupted. If this problem continues, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).
<div><br />
<div>The error that I saw related to the certificate had to do with rd.menuminder.com which isn't even the same domain as the e-mail address. That certificate was used for testing a web project that was in development earlier this year, but again, when I go
 into certmgr.msc and look through the entire tree, there's no reference to that domain anywhere.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A search of the registry also finds no references to rd.menuminder.com.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Every other device in the house, on the same network, can access custom Outlook.com domains without any trouble.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I'm looking in the correct part of the registry for my profile, but there's nothing listed with my name. The first key is:<br />
{D9734F19-8CFB-411D-BC59-833E334FCB5E}</div>
<div><br />
<div>After that, there are 80+ keys that are like this:</div>
<div>011a89906d21cc49bd5a56a7fa471b58</div>
<div><br />
<div>(that's just the first one, but all 80+ of them are similar to that...nothing with my name)</div>

<p>The keys are MAPI properties and are not intended for direct reading or editing. Simply export the entire Profiles key and then delete it. Can you open the Mail applet now? You can then reconfigure your mail profile from scratch.</p>

            I hadn't before your message (I had just run Certificates) but I did now.
<div><br />
<div>The only thing I wasn't sure about was adding the Service Account, because there were a zillion things to choose from. I picked Microsoft Office Service and then I also did Certificate Propagation only because I wasn't sure what else to pick.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Didn't see anything with menuminder in it anyplace.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Deleting the Profiles tree / key, then trying to run the Mail applet didn't help. Still can't run it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other strange bit is that after deleting the Profiles key, I decided to try to run Outlook without importing it back in first.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Outlook opened...with a bunch of my e-mail accounts already set up...including old versions of some e-mail addresses that have changed servers more recently. Not sure where it got that info., but when I went back into the Registry, all of those 80+ keys
 are back in there again. (and again, I did NOT import it after deleting it)</div>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Hi,<br />
<br />
The error 'The connection to the server was interrupted.' is usually received when there is block/interruption to connectivity due to firewall or anti-virus.<br />
<br />
How are you connected to the internet/domain? Is it through router?<br />
<br />
Let's try the following and then try configuring the email account and verify the result:<br />
<br />
1) Start the computer in clean boot following instructions mentioned in the below article and see if it helps:<br />
</font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<font><b>Note</b>: After the troubleshooting, restart the computer in the normal mode.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then
 tap or click to clear the check box for the problem item.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<font>2) If issue still persists, disable the firewall then try configuring the email account and verify the result.<br />
</font><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</font></a><br />
<font>Note: Ensure to enable firewall after troubleshooting process.<br />
<br />
3) You may also create new windows user account and check if it works. Refer to the following article for instructions on how to create new user account:<br />
</font><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7</font></a><font>
<br />
Note: Instruction applies to Windows 8 as well.<br />
<br />
4) If all the above methods fail, m</font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">anually uninstall and reinstall Outlook. Following the instructions mentioned below and verify the status,<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<font><strong><span>Important</span></strong>: Uninstalling Outlook manually involves deleting registry entries. Hence make sure to back up the registry before you modify it following below mentioned steps:

<h2>            How to make a footnote custom style default&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
Hi guys. Here's the problem. I'm writing a thesis, and thus I'm using a LOT of footnotes. However, every time I make a new footnote it has an automatic 8 spacing after it (not sure what the word for this is - paragraph? alinea?). I would wish that to become
 0. I know that I can manually adjust that everytime by right-clicking, then going to paragraph (? I'm not using English word). I also know I can ctrl+A all of my footnotes and do that for all of them, but I'd really like to just do it ONCE while I'm still
 writing the thesis and not afterwards.</p>
<p>
Any help? I realise I can modify the "Style" of my footnote and change the paragraph distance to 0; but even then, everytime I make a new footnote it's automatically issued in the default style for footnotes, not in my newly created style. So I guess my question
 could be: how do I make my new style the default style (in this document and any others)</p>
<p>
Help greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
I'm a layman in these things so please if you're going to point me out what to do, also point me out&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;to do it.</p>
<p>

            <p>The only way to make the change permanent is to modify the Footnote Text style, and to make that change apply to the Normal template or whatever other template your thesis documents are based on. Here are the steps (there are several ways, but this is the
 quickest):</p>
<ul>
<li>Click in the text of any footnote.</li><li>Press Ctrl+Shift+S to open the Apply Style box. The name of the Footnote Text style should appear in the box; if some other name appears, then open the dropdown and select Footnote Text.</li><li>Click the Modify button to open the Modify Style dialog.</li><li>At the bottom of the dialog, click the "New documents based on this template" option.</li><li>Click the Format button and choose Paragraph in the menu.</li><li>In the Paragraph dialog, set the spacing Before and After to 0 (zero).</li><li>Click OK in both open dialogs. You can close the Apply Style box or leave it open; it won't affect how you work.</li><li>The next time you shut down Word, if you're prompted to save changes to the template, click Yes.</li></ul>
<p>If you start a new document based on the same template and the spacing is still wrong, you'll have to open the template itself for editing (use the Open command instead of New) and make the same change there. Sometimes the "New documents..." option fails
 to save the settings to the template, maybe because the template is damaged or marked read-only.</p>

<h2>            OUtlook 2013 new mail notification sound does not always play</h2>
                    The outlook 2013 new mail notification sound works fine &nbsp;with outlook open while doing nothing or minimized and at desktop, but does not sound if i am replying to, etc., creating a new email, have another windows open full-scren and/or working an rdp session.
 &nbsp;Any thoughts. &nbsp;This was not an issue with Outlook 2003. &nbsp;Also, I have installed all Office Sounds and when tested in Sounds, they play, but do not work in Outlook 2013. &nbsp;BTW, I am Win 7 Pro 64-bit. &nbsp;Thanks for any help.

<p>Office 2007 Pro has: Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Publisher, Outlook with Business Contact Manager﻿</p>
<p>Office 2007 Enterprise has Pro apps plus: <strong>Accounting Express 2008</strong> ,<strong>InfoPath 2007</strong>,
<strong>Communicator 2007,</strong> <strong>Groove 2007,</strong><strong>OneNote 2007</strong></p>
<p>Before doing uninstall <strong>!!!DO A FULL IMAGE COPY BACKUP!!! to something other than your C: drive</strong>Just in case there is a problem, you will be able to recover to your starting point.</p>
<p>When you uninstall pro trial that is what will be uninstalled, it shouldn't touch the "other stuff". Before you uninstall, run each of the apps&nbsp;that overlap and confirm that the ones you are running are not part of trial version so that when trial is uninstalled
 you will not be affected.</p>
<p>process is same for 2007 as 2010, here is 2010 process:</p>
<p><span>Remove or Uninstall Office 2010 Trial -<a href="https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/remove-or-uninstall-office-2010-trial-HA101972584.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/remove-or-uninstall-office-2010-trial-HA101972584.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>After you get rid of trial, you can use the same process to uninstall any of the other apps that you do not use and do not want to keep</span></p>

<p>Basically a image backup is a "photocopy" of your HD, one that you can "paste" back to the drive to restore it to current condition in case something you do makes you "unhappy".</p>
<p>I haven't played with the Win7 backup tool, but it sounds like is finally&nbsp;adequate. You can also get freeware backup programs to do the same thing. I use Macrium Backup and DriveImage XML. Backup to DVDs or an external USB Drive.</p>
