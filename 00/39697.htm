            <p>Hi Hugh,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your response with the current status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><br />
Refer to the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong>: I suggest you to temporarily disable the&nbsp;antivirus and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disable Anti virus:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it
 to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>If you the issue still persist, refer to the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: I&nbsp;recommend you to temporarily&nbsp;turn on&nbsp;Windows Firewall and check if you are able to switch user account.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows Firewall Disclaimer</strong>: &nbsp;</p>
<p>A firewall is software or hardware that helps prevent hackers and some types of malware from getting to your PC through a network or the Internet. It does this by checking the info that’s coming from the Internet or a network and then either blocking it
 or allowing it to pass through to your PC.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall turned on. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your PC (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.
</p>
<p>If you have turn off Windows Firewall, then you need to turn&nbsp;it on as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Access denied to the &#8220;My Documents and Settings&#8221; folder </h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p>I can't open the “My documents and settings” folder, it says I don't have permission.&nbsp; I've tried to change the security settings to allow me full control, but despite being an administrator I still 'don't
 have permission'.&nbsp; I am the only user account on the computer. No other user accounts are visible so why can't I change things on my own computer? Do you have any ideas that might help me?</p>

<p>The “My Documents and Settings” is not a folder used by Windows Vista.&nbsp; It is what is called a junction point.&nbsp; If you note, the folder itself is shaded out with a shortcut overlay.&nbsp; If you have "Hide protected
 operating system files" unchecked, then you will see these junction points. It is intended that users have no access to these junction points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows Vista, the “My Documents and Settings“, has been replaced by "Users".&nbsp; Each user account will then have Documents, Pictures, videos etc.&nbsp; Note the "My" designation is no longer used.&nbsp; These junction
 points exist to provide backwards compatibility for older programs that are unaware of the new folder structure in Windows Vista.&nbsp; A program that is hardcoded to install files in the old Documents and Settings will be silently redirected to the new location.</p>

            Failure to install an operating system is usually caused by (in order of probability):<br />
<br />
1. You are attempting to install with other devices connected to the computer. Disconnect them before trying to do an installation.<br />
<br />
2. Faulty installation media. Check the installation CD/DVD for scratches, smudges. Test in another machine.<br />
<br />
3. Faulty optical drive. Test with another bootable CD/DVD or swap it out for a known-working one.<br />
<br />
Since you have a Mac and presumably OS X works, I doubt the following reasons are applicable in your case but I include them to be thorough:<br />
<br />
4. Faulty RAM. Test with Memtest86+ from <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.memtest.org</a> . You will download the .iso to make a bootable cd. Burn the file with third-party burning software - as an image, not as data. Then boot with the media you made
 (you may need to change the boot priority in your BIOS so that the optical drive is the first boot device). The test will run immediately. Let the test run for an hour or two - unless errors are seen immediately. If you get any errors, replace the RAM.<br />
<br />
5. Faulty hard drive. Test with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive mftr.'s website. You will create a bootable CD with the file you download. Burn the file with third-party burning software - as an image, not as data. Boot with the CD you made and
 do a thorough test of the drive. If it fails any physical tests, replace it.<br />
<br />
6. Other hardware components are faulty.

<p>What the hell is up with people boosting and cheating.. Now I can see cheating is like a easy way out... You get all the cool stuff, get to higher level, unlock everything... blah blah.. -.- Why make a game, not have a patch for it, to where you cannot boost
 and cheat.</p>

<p>I mean seriously, whoever boosts and cheats, I hope karma bites them in the *** Really hard and have their *** ban. -.-;</p>

<p>I have xbox 360 version. No cheating yet from what I can tell, hate that I was told when preordering that I would get Nuk3town map. Also was never told or did not know, no campaign mode, you cannot play splitscreen at home with others or multiplayer splitscreen
 online. Terrible, the price should of been much lower for the game value. If I had known this was the case, I would not of pre ordered, &nbsp;would simply wait till the price drops and maybe buy it. Now I love your comments about cheaters, it would be great if
 Microsoft would fix/end this problem. See alot of this on black ops 2, since complaining online does nothing, I just back out of the game, why continue if all that happens is being demolished by hackers &amp; cheaters. The reason cheaters &amp; hackers exist is because
 they suck at the game, don't have any real friends, just the hacker/cheater friends, because losers are a**h*l*s with a controller who control the game by hacking or cheating. It's a shame because doing what they do will continue through their life, ultimately
 going to prison someday (if not already). Without real friends, they will someday look back where it all started, taking the easy way out, by hacking or cheating. I hope some hacker or cheater is reading this, or maybe their pinhead self will reply to this,
 either way when you get down to it hacker or cheater, you will always be a true loser in our hearts, even when you win in a game you hacked or cheated in, idiot. I gave you a like, you made my day. And last but not least, wouldn't it be nice since xbox does
 nothing to stop hackers, that on black ops 2 when it shows how many are online, maybe the least that xbox can do is make a catergory for how many hackers are online, this way I don't have to waste time playing a cheaters game and backing out all together.
 Playstation is looking better and better, instead of wasting my money on xbox one (I'm sure the hackers &amp; cheaters are there as well).</p>

<p>Look at the mantality of your player base. There is a map where there is an object you can get yourself glitched into (keeping this a vague as possible), well 3/4 into anyways.</p>
<p>While not well known, every time I'm on this map you always alhave a few people trying their hardest to get into it.</p>
<p>The Xbox community consists of 90% kids who care more about ticking people off and putting it on youthbe more then enjoying the game.</p>
<p>You need more proof of this, look for the trolls who attack any post criticizing the game.</p>

<p>Also how is it that modded xbox controllers are sold legally online at Amazon.com, Microsoft isn't this a licensing permission issue you can stop, or is it that you receive royalties from each sale. Because if that's true, the very problem with the cheaters
 itself, is Microsoft. I mean really, they advertise the modded controllers as BAN PROOF, NOT DETECTABLE by Xbox (Microsoft). Makes you wonder, money money money. Where does our money for paying monthly Xbox live service go.

<p>The issue with this is the COD coding system. They have run a vary similar system on all the CODs witch makes it vary easy to hack them. Like hey here's a new game with similar codes that of the last game you exploited so don't do it but here they are. Sadly
 its just how people are they will do anything and everything to get on top and get everything because they don't want to put any work into it. Honestly the Best thing you can do is just report people you think are using mods or are blatantly modding. The issues
 might not get resolved quickly but it can slow it down and maybe make the game more fun for every one.
</p>
<p>Sadly Skuff style controllers are not Something that's bad as a lot of comps do allow them, Modded controllers like rapid shot those are fixed by limiting the speed at witch in game weapons can be fired. &nbsp;

<p>Yea they're a waste of time for everyone actually. I don't understand how people can just "have fun" with that. I usually report it when I catch it. Hopefully you don't run into a lot of people who do that.

<p>yes it is very frustrating, and Im sure they will come up with some motioning ware to catch this people</p>
<p>just a recap on what this boosters are doing:</p>
<p>reverse boosting is where a teammate goes in a corner and repeatedly keeps killing themselves to lessen their team's score and ability to win. It's like giving the other team free experience points.
</p>
<p>Normal boosting is where you purposefully feed yourself or your team to opponents. You just stand there while they get headshots or whatnot. This allows the opposing team to advance without putting in any of the work or effort. It's essentially throwing
 the match. </p>
<p>All we ask ids for you to please repot this games, and im sure they will be stepping in to put an end to this kind of behavior in</p>

<p>The ranking system and prestige creates cheating. It needs to go and just be like the good ol days where the only thing different were player skins and guns. No ranks or stupid micro transactions and awards, your skill was your bragging right, not some stupid
 logo.</p>

<p>I think you are right, getting rid of the ranking system, especially the Leaderboards are a way to get rid of the idiots hacking to become top scorer. The leaderboards go, probably will eliminate the majority of losers/hackers that invade the games and ruin
 them. Losers seem to come come out of the woodwork due to ranking and leaderboards, like flys on s***. Plus the losers/hackers must really suck at the game when playing regular, to have to resort to hacking games. Poor things, it's a shame they didn't come
 out with a baby's version of COD Black Ops 2 for them to play with there loser friends, the can rate the game on the cover with A, for A**h*l*. That way they know the game is for them, and they can buy it and play with their, well you know, no reason to identify
 the losers/hackers of the world again, poor bast***s.</p>

<h3> inayatullah bin mohammed al bhatti  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 can&#39;t customise folder thumbnail image</h2>
                    Ok so I want a thumbnail that I select to be the thumbnail for a particular folder. I browse and select the image via customize and click ok, but the image or in most cases the two images that are displayed as thumbnails do not change. What do I need to
 do? This is not an icon vs thumbnail issue btw.<br />

<h3> choon srimanut  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation glitch&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One day windows just randomly said that my windows license was going to expire, and that I needed to go activate it in the settings. I checked if my windows was activated or not, and it was activated, and so I went into the settings, and there was not button
 or anything that says "activate" or anything along those lines. I was really confused and still am because, first off my windows was already activated, and it said that my windows license was going to expire, which I don't think can happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just left it like that thinking that it was a glitch&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days later, which is the now, it says that my windows isn't activated at all, and it says that I need to go to settings and activate it, just like last time&nbsp;<br />
So I go into settings, there was still no "Activate" button.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>What's even worst is that now it says that:<br />
</p>
<p>"We can't activate Windows on this device we can't connect to your organization's activation server." Error code: 0xC004f074</p>
<p>To summarize the whole thing, it's point was that it couldn't activate my windows because I was apparently not connected to the internet, even though I was, so I tried restarting my computer a few times, and nothing changes.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching up solutions, but all of the methods required a product key, which I had forgotten, so that's that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really confused on what's happening right now, if there's anyone out there who can help me, please do&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for background information, I got windows 10 pro by "Upgrading to Windows 10 for free from an eligible device running a genuine copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1."</p>

<h3> antontkach  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Account with money is stolen by Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a skype account I was using for years. I was using gmail&nbsp;mailbox for this skype account. &nbsp;At some point&nbsp;in time I was working for some company and I&nbsp;have created Microsoft account to pass Microsoft exams. My skype account was added there as well. I
 quit the company 4 years ago but still was using skype, calling, and putting some money on it to call on the static phones. All the time all confirmation emails went to my gmail mailbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I haven't logged more than half a year and Microsoft send me an email that my account and the money on it would be deactivated and in order to reactivate them I need to re-login. But when I tried to Loggin I've got an error: "It looks like someone else
 might be using your account" though the password was correct. So I had to recover my account, BUT all of a sudden&nbsp;Microsoft want to use my email for the company, I was working years ago to restore the password! I cannot do it now and why should I? All my payments
 confirmation other emails regarding skype and email regarding deactivation were sent on my gmail account! Why do you even need my&nbsp;old legacy email address? I know why you have connected&nbsp;Microsoft account to my skype account after you have bought it and changed
 the primary email without asking me! But! You were still using my first mailbox!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok. I can restore it, I thought and started this stupid and time-consuming process of account restore. I have entered all the information&nbsp;Microsoft has asked me including</p>
<p>3 skype logins - I am 100% sure they are correct because I remember them and can easily find in skype contacts search.</p>
<p>I have entered the information regarding the last time I paid for the skype&nbsp;and the sum!</p>
<p>I have entered even last 4 digits of the credit card I was using! No way! Microsoft stupid algorithm cannot restore it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Microsoft recommends me to create a new account and forget the one with my money on it!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this unacceptable behavior and asking for Microsoft tech support to fix it and restore my own skype account access!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Marites,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This URL that you have sent doesn't work for me.&nbsp;</span><span>When I fill all the info I can, including the 3 contacts and the last dialed numbers and confirm my personality - an automatic
 email from Microsoft is sent - your account restore is not possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Looks like this restore request is closed already - according to the small message at the bottom of the email.</span></p>
<p><span>That's why it is not very clear what to do now and how to restore it.</span></p>
<p><span>Can I call tech support maybe where I can confirm my personality?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To increase the font size of the letters in the address bar, you can check out the answer of
<strong>Ramesh Kumar</strong> from this thread:<span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-desktop/font-size-problems-in-windows-10/2f0ddb9e-079b-4efd-93de-17e83ca4e6e5"><strong>Font size problems in Windows 10.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>The above options may be available only to older versions of Windows 10 though. If you are unable to follow the steps because the options are not available on your screen then you can try these steps as a workaround. Doing the below steps however,
 will not only increase the fonts in the address bar but will basically make everything appear bigger on the screen.<span>
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong> and type<strong> Settings</strong> on the <strong>
Search bar.</strong></li><li>Click on<strong> System </strong>and click on <strong>Display. </strong></li><li>Under the<strong> Scale and layout option</strong>, click on the drop down arrow and choose
<strong>125%</strong> or whatever your preference is.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We are just here for your feedback. If you are unable to do any of the above, kindly include the build and version of your computer in your reply, so we can replicate the scenario from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>Guys,</p>
<p>Bought today a Xbox One console and Titanfall. I first attempted to insert the 2-days free membership code that came with the game and it was accepted but didn't work. Then i've tried the 12-days code that came with the console and it won't work either!
 What should i do!? Now the codes seems to be waisted and i can't play! So frustrating...</p>

<p>No, i did not receive any error code and the code was right cause when i try to reinsert Xbox says it's already been used. Bottom line: code was inserted, recognized, but won't activate.</p>

<h2>            Battery Charging Problem &#47; Acer Iconia W510 running Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My Acer Ionia W510 tablet will not charge through keyboard unit, but will charge through screen unit when it is separated from keyboard.&nbsp; Also, error tones sound and usb malfunctions if charger is connected to keyboard at same time as thumb drive is plugged
 into keyboard's usb port.&nbsp; A year or so back the tablet bricked after initially displaying keyboard/charging/USB port problems.&nbsp; I did a clean install of Windows&nbsp;10 recently and tablet now works again, but continues to have same keyboard/charging/USB port
 problems.&nbsp;Does this sound like a hardware problem, an OS problem, a corrupt driver problem, other?&nbsp; Any ideas on solution?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any thoughts/feedback you may be able to provide.&nbsp; I appreciate the assist.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 settings not opening</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Recently I noticed the settings on the start menu does not open. To get to settings I have to type control panel in Cortana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read over the posts for this issue which fix in the lastest post on: http://windowsreport.com/updates-settings-not-opening-windows-10/</p>
<p>&nbsp;gave 3 solutions but I have tried all and none has worked.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Firstly I downloaded updates but the update kb3036140 was not shown. I then searched online to download it but the link for it in the Microsoft catalogue was broken.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I notice also some keys such as pressing &nbsp;x and windows do not work as mentioned in the 1st step (maybe to safe boot mode).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>Second, I downloaded the microsoft safety scanner and ran a quick scan, nothing was found. In the third step I was unable to create a new user as nothing happened when in user accounts, I pressed the "Create new user for this PC".&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I noticed the issue after I had installed software (which included Arcsoft MediaImpression) that came with an A3 Mustek 2400s scanner I recently bought. After finding the software was no help I uninstalled it. But now I also get an error msg pops up on my
 screen all the time I cannot get rid of. It says </p>
<p>
</p><p>"The procedure entry point "ARCCON_GetConnectVersion could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Program Files (x86)\ Common Files\ArcSoft\Connection Service\Bin\ArcCon.ac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support to fix this would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Gemma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be due to some corrupted files on your system. We suggest placing your PC on a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode
</a></strong>to start your PC using a limited set of files and drivers. After placing your PC on a safe mode, we recommend that you perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong> on your PC to eliminate software conflicts that might have occurred when you installed a program
 or an update on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us if you need further assistance. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, however the Clean boot did not fix the Settings issue.&nbsp; There are some other things that have recently occurred with the computer such as sometimes it will not turn on to the sign in screen, and it has to be restarted multiple times,
 other recent issues are drives not working and I had to replace the keyboard even though there is nothing wrong with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>other software I have used to try to fix the issues are Driver updater and Speedy PC Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I'll have to re-install the OS? Any other advice would be appreciated.</p>
