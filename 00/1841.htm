<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me&nbsp;assist you with related to the confirmation prompt while deleting images using Microsoft Picture Manager.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Are you facing this issue only while deleting the image using picture manager?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Do you receive the prompt when you try to delete any other information from Windows Explorer?</p>
<p><br />
Disable '<span>Display delete confirmation dialog' by doing the following and see if it helps:<br />
<br />
<span>a. </span></span><span>Right-click on <b>Recycle Bin</b> and choose
<b>Properties</b> from the menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span><span>Now you’ll see the<b> Trash Properties</b> dialog, and notice the “<b>Display delete confirmation dialog</b>” at the bottom.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span><span>Uncheck the box, and close the dialog and try deleting and verify the result.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result for further assistance.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Thank you.<br />

<h2>            Why do presence icons not appear in outlook 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Our 3,000 users are slowly migrating to Office 2016 from various apps including Jabber.&nbsp; New hires Outlook will show presence for themselves, but all other users do not get any presence other than a blue open circle. How can we activate the presence icon
 for all users in Outlook?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Contact setting for presence is turned on in Options. Jabber shows presence for all users.&nbsp; No other Microsoft app shows presence for any users other than the new hires. Here is what most users see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Rob M,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the screenshot you shared, we can see the Microsoft Lync or Microsoft Skype for Business presence icons for recipients is unknown. Generally, the presence icon will be Presence unknown, Available and Away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the following steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Add the email account as a contact in the Outlook client.</p>
<p>2. Sign in Skype for Business client and check if the affected user is online.
</p>
<p>3. Set Skype for Business and Outlook as default application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem still persists, please give us the following information:</p>
<p>a. The detailed version of the Outlook client and Skype for Business client.</p>
<p>b. About migrating to Outlook 2016, do you mean that the users are switching to using Outlook 2016 clients or the user accounts are migrated to Office 365 for Business?</p>
<p>c. About the blue open circle, could you give us a screenshot for a better understanding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, if your concern is that your users are not able to see the presence icons, please try the steps in this article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; While I myself am using Skype for Business, the client refuses to implement it until finishing a 60 day study. It is scheduled for July implementation in all 3300 machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The client uses Cisco's Jabber at this time and Cisco insists it works with Outlook. No other users among the 3300 are using Skype for Business.</p>

<p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, if you are using Skype for Business with Outlook client, you will not encounter this presence issue. As you are using Jabber and the presence icon shows normally in the Outlook client, we recommend that you seek help from Cisco support.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Outlook side, please verify that the online status is enabled in Microsoft Outlook. Make sure “Display online status next to name” and “Show user photographs when available (requires restarting Outlook)” are enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you want to test Microsoft Office 365 features before performing the deployment, you can try a free trial Office 365 for Business subscription from this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-business</a></p>

<p>I am sorry that you misunderstand. It is clear in the screenshot that the presence icon does NOT appear correctly in Outlook. It DOES appear correctly in Jabber.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, your suggestion of "trying Office 365 for Business" is ridiculous as the client already has E3 licenses for their 3300 users.&nbsp; They just choose to implement each component like Skype for Business under a very careful 1 year deployment schedule.&nbsp;
 OneDrive has already proven to be problematic over it's 3 month deployment causing hundreds of hours of changes to Excel &amp; OneNote files among others, which strongly reinforces the customer's belief in a slow, careful deployment of the product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, once again I ask you:&nbsp; Why does the presence icon NOT WORK when logged into Office 365?</p>

<p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my understanding, the Outlook client doesn’t detect the presence status in the Jabber. As Outlook client can show the presence status with Skype for Business, the problem could be related to Jabber. As Jabber is a third party application and we
 are not familiar with it, we highy recommend that you seek help from Jabber’s support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your users are using Skype for Business application and Outlook client, please tell us whether they can see the presence status in the Skype for Business applications. Some screenshots will be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about the Excel &amp; OneNote issue, please create a new thred and we will continue to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

<p>Again, this company does use Outlook but they do&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;use Skype at this time! Corporate policy is&nbsp;<strong>NO SKYPE UNTIL ROLLOUT IN JULY or August.</strong>&nbsp; However, I activated Skype for myself. I asked two other Help Desk staff to also
 activate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>PRESENCE DOES NOT APPEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>See the attached screenshot of the other two users in my Skype. Both users are
<strong>ALWAYS </strong>blue!&nbsp; EVEN when they are logged in to Office 365!&nbsp; I would think that is a user is logged into Office 365, a
<strong>GREEN </strong>presence indicator would appear.</p>

<p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the screenshot, we can see the status of these two Help Desk staff’s Skype for Business are offline. It’s an expected behavior that you will see the white presence icon if they are offline.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you mentioned that they are logged in to Office 365, you should be able to send instant message to these two Skype for Business users. Could you right click on one of these users, select
<strong>Send an IM</strong> and then send messages to them? Give us a screenshot of the test chat interface. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

            I have another Skype for Business, but it will not accept either of his corporate logins (email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or his XID *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).&nbsp; I thought anyone with an O365 login could use Skype for business.

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. To use Skype for Business application, you need to assign Skype for Business online license to the Office 365 for Business account. Please sign in
<a href="https://portal.office365.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Admin Portal</a> to check the license in the affected user’s account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your cooperation.</p>

            I do not have access to the Admin Center, but I do know my license is part of the corporate E3 volume license. By signing in using my assigned XID, I have access to O365, Office 2016 apps, OneDrive and Skype for Business.&nbsp; I tried to have another user
 install Skype for Business, but it will not accept either his email or XID.&nbsp; The company refuses to allow 3,000 users to get Microsoft accounts feeling that they should be able to use all MSFT apps using their corporate subscription.&nbsp; This is precisely why
 they are holding off on Skype for Business until questions like these are answered.&nbsp; Your inability to clarify the presence issue (and now how to install it without a Microsoft account) is making them consider delaying the Skype for Business implementation
 until more clarity is provided.&nbsp;

<h2>            E7 Belle upgrade - change of email behaviour</h2>
                    
<p>(Note - use native email direct to ISP, not via Nokia Mail or other intermediary; will not use cloud based services eg. Google/AOL/Yahoo, so don't suggest them to me as a "fix".)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to Belle (ie pre Anna and Anna releases) "delete" of an email only deleted it from the phone, not from the server. Now, under Belle, "delete" does just that and removes from the server as well. Annoying, as it has meant I have deleted a few emails
 I intended to keep on my "master" version on my PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else having the same experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to E7 it was possible to configure email delete in the phone to either mean "delete from server" or "delete in phone only".&nbsp; It would be nice to get that option back!</p>

<br />First select range in Excel then find on the ribbon the 'Copy' icon, click on small arrow on the right, choose 'Copy as Picture'. Select options as on screen or as printed, and picture or bitmap. 
<br />Experiment to see how you want it to appear in outlook. 
<br />

<h2>            E7 Angry bird &#38;amp&#59; Assasins creed not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I hae updated my phone to belle on 7 th Feb, after that I have seen that all the apps I downloaded in Anna or pre anna release are gone. Upset but again I try to download as Nokia itself said that Apps will be uninstalled if it is in phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I&nbsp; downloaded only two games and that&nbsp; too are not working properly, Angry birds in portrait mode not working , previously whatevr be the mode is it open in landscape mode, but if I put my phone in portrait mode and open Ag it runs in the back ground
 but doesnot pop up. So what's the deal here I don't understand, may be any nokia person can say that, that's why I am here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also downloaded assassins c reed which Nokia proudly offering to us for free, but the thing is it is not working at all, wheevr I try to open it a messag comes with feature not supported. I don't know what feature it is talking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can i get a solution of this two problem from Nokia tech or Nokia enthusiasist?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope I will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I want to say that Nokia belle is&nbsp; superb in terms of UI satisfaction. I love it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How are you doing today?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to look at a couple of factors here&nbsp;that may be affecting your application(s) although you have updated your device to Belle, this doesn't automatically means that your applications compatible with the firmware.<strong> IF</strong>&nbsp;the developer(s)
 haven't kept their apps up to date <em>belle</em>.Then you may have some issues during usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively you can log on&nbsp;<a href="http://store.ovi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia store</a>&nbsp;and to 'My stuff', where you'll find all your previously downloaded items. Install the applications using Nokia suite. If&nbsp;you still have the same underlying issues,
 then you will need to install <em>BELLE</em> again and repeat the steps mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Carltabi</p>
<p>I am doing good here, just sad because my expectations were high from Nokia belle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for your reply, I have downloaded the Angry Bird and Assassins creed after belle update to my phone, because Belle has deleted most of my apps (!). i don't mind though, for a better
 OS I can sacrifice the data and apps. But what I tried to point out is that there are some bugs still present in Belle.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you said that "You need to look at a couple of factors here&nbsp;that may be affecting your application(s)" - but how to be confirmed that it (Apps) supports belle os?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1. take a look at Angry birds. If I put my phone in landscape mode and then open Aingry birds it perfectly works, so supports belle right? But if my phone in portrait mode and then I try
 to open it. It opens but in background, even I turn my phone into Landscape it doesn't work at all, I need to open task manager and close it.So definitely its a bug in belle, because the same application was running smoothly in Anna in landscape mode as well
 as in portarit mode. In portrait mode it automtically opens in landscape modeand play the game. Simple.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2. Assasins creed is not working because "feature not supported", but my question is what feature? And if it is not supported then it should not come in Nokia store for Belle devices or
 if it specific E7 problem, then i don't know what to say.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You are right about the My staff, I have downloaded most of the apps which are relelvent to me, because in Anna, there were many apps which I didn't like at all. Thanks to belle it has removed
 all those.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3. Another example of talking Monkey - Pipa, i have tried many many times to install it in E7, even in Nokia store it is showing that this is for E7, it never gets installed in my E7. I
 don't know what's the issue!</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>4. regarding yahoo mail server, it works fine when I receive any mail, but if I send any mail using my phone, it never gets synchronized with the yahoo mail, this is also I don't know what's
 wrong in it?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Few of the apps like news paper which were smooth in operationin Anna, but not so smooth in Belle. Might be they have not fixed according to belle, but then question remains why it is still
 available in nokia store for belle products? May be it is not well filtered then for belle applicable.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>now as I&nbsp; have few doubts about which apps to install and which should not, because Nokia store is unable to filtered the apps according to Nokia OS's or product's.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in notification bar we should be informaed about mails and how to customize the Notification bar? I don't know. From a forum i come to know that it is not possible in Belle. Customizationof Noti..bar is prohibited. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>So tell me what's the solution we may expect from Nokia, Nokia E7 in Indian Currency was 28000 when I bought it. Should not we expect something extraordinery from Nokia? I heard somewhere
 that Nokia is trying to update E7 firmware very soon, but what's went wrong in Belle in E7?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I am again telling the UI is superb, also the notificaion bar, if it can come up with the never forget My E7 Belle, Can I say that E7 belle will be sucha&nbsp; phone that I won't be wanting any
 other phone fro the next&nbsp; 5-6 years.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Thanks again fro your patience and hoping a positive reply from you.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Nokia we love you, just make us happy.<br />

            I am facing the same problem with assasins creed on an N8. Does not work after belle update. I have downloaded and installed it twice and as soon as I launch it, the phone goes into a loop with black screen and flashing feature not supported. I have no
 option but to reboot the phone after that.

<p>I can now confirm that re installing belle does not solve this problem as some one has suggested above. Neither does resetting the device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact it messed up my wifi connection and I had to re install belle again !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a waste of time.</p>

<p>Then What shall I do? i have seen that in my nokia E7 theft aware 2.0 is nevre getting installed again. in Anna it was installed, but belle formatted the drive and I loose it. Now when I again going to download and install it from Nokia Store, it downloads
 but at the time of installation it fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestion why is this happenning to me, what wrongs with Belle. I checked for s/w update but nothing it says that my device is upto date, so what shall i do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I try to download and install the apps, it fails, not all the time but most of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am totally unhappy with the way belle works for software installations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Unexplained inconsistent formula... Screen shots and extremely simple formula shown.</h2>
                    <p>This excel sheet has been reporting this for ages, but the formula is consistent all the way up and down the column.</p>
<p>It's a very simple "SUM" statement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(C11:N11)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even copied the format and formula from the other cells.</p>
<p>There are no Macros and I guess I could re-create the whole sheet it's not very complex, in fact that column is the ONLY column with a formula on it. There is a Row (2) that has the same simple formula [=SUM(C4:C60)]</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I've had some spare time I've fiddled with this to work out why it's inconsistent lol</p>
<p>

<p>This I know.</p>

</p><p>The reason I posted is to see if anyone had any ideas why this would be happening. To me this is a puzzle and I enjoy puzzles, just wondering if someone had any other ideas as to why Excel would be reporting this even though it's clearly the same as surrounding

<h3> rrdodge  say:</h3>
<h2>            After doing Alt-Tab, have to at times press Alt two times in order to even start an Alt series short cut</h2>
                    <p>I don't know what it is, but after I have done Alt-Tab to switch between workbooks, at times, I only have to press Alt once before I go with my series of keys for the keyboard shortcut route I am going to perform a function.&nbsp; Other times, I have to press
 it two different times to do it.&nbsp; I haven't been able to narrow down the exact pattern other than it can happen when doing the key strokes rather quickly.&nbsp; When doing it slowly, it still has happened, but not nearly as often.&nbsp; My only indicator is that I have
 to look at the ribbon to see if the shortcut keyboard letters pops up or not, which adds in more wasted time as I don't know if it's once or twice I have to do it.&nbsp; Having to do this multiple times per hour, that's adds up to a lot of wasted time that could
 have been avoided by keeping it consistent.&nbsp; This having to hit Alt two times only happens immediately after pressing Alt-Tab as far as I know it to be.&nbsp; Haven't tried it with Win-Tab, but then old habits are hard to die too, when you been doing Alt-Tab for
 so many decades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure which is worse, not knowing if you have to press the alt key once or twice after using the alt-tab without looking up at the ribbon, or having to press Alt-Tab twice to move away from the workbook itself, which I also don't care for the route
 to disable showing all the workbooks in the taskbar, as I want them all to show up in the task bar for other reasons, even if I am working in 20 different workbooks with 15 different applications opened up on my computer, including 20 different windows in
 either FF or IE opened.&nbsp; I do a lot more stuff on the computer than most people do, even though it's not 3-D gaming or video streaming.&nbsp; Yet, the work I do is process and memory intensive, thus why I have a system that uses the iCore 7 and has 32GB of DDR4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted AMD, but AMD evidently expects the room the computer sits in to be at 60F just to have the warranty service done.&nbsp; A friend of mine and I both had the exact same system as far as the motherboard and processor is concerned, though almost entirely
 by coincident except for our needs.&nbsp; The biggest difference, he doing intensive 3-D gaming vs me doing intensive data processing, so the one main difference had to do with video cards.&nbsp; His system failed after 14 months, which he purchased from Best Buy.&nbsp;
 He then asked me to replace the mb and cpu, which I did.&nbsp; Within another 14 months, it failed.&nbsp; My system, which I built also failed within 14 months.&nbsp; After 3 such failures like that (and I build my systems to last for at least 5+ years), I have refused to
 have anything to do with AMD again.&nbsp; I never had any system before or after that fail me in that short of a time span.&nbsp; I just recently rebuilt the system with almost all new components except for the HDDs, which the prior system lasted me 7 years except for
 the HDDs in it, thus one of the reasons why I was able to switch over the HDDs, and it came up just fine other than for the fact I had to reactivate MS products on the system, which was a pain because of the restriction of using product key codes purchased
 from the university when you are a full-time student.&nbsp; I won't even go to the 365 route as that's too much like renting, thus the vendor can dictate way too much with renting as I had too much of that experience with being a renter as a tenant prior to owning
 a home to the point you might as well say I was dealing with slumlords.</p>

<h2>            Trigger Animations Created on PC Not Working on Mac - Alternative&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I created a series of trigger animations on the PC that work fine until viewed on the Mac. I understand triggers aren't supported on the Mac - is there an alternative that will work on both PC and Mac?<br />
<br />
What I need to do is this: click on an icon and a corresponding text box pops up. Click to make the text box go away. I have about 12 icons on the page, and not every icon has corresponding text. If the user clicks on an icon that has no corresponding text,
 I need to keep the user on the slide and not advance.</p>
<p>I'm using PPT 2007 on Windows Vista.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>It's annoying that trigger animations don't work on the Mac side. You seem to have two options: fake and VBA. Writing a VBA script to do what you want to do wouldn't be too difficult, but VBA is absent from Mac PowerPoint 2008. It will work in all other
 versions. The alternative is to fake this with multiple slides. Click on an icon, and it takes you to a separate slide. The separate slide is an identical slide, except the text box is showing. A box covering the entire "duplicate" slide that links back to
 the original will make the text box disappear. If you do this right, the user will never know that there are multiple slides.</p>

                    <br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Hi All I wonder if anybody could assist?<br />
<br />
I’m trying to design a worksheet that automatically updates and populates dependent on certain conditions being met.<br />
<br />
I have a list of students in Colum A<br />
<br />
These students will be assigned a Stage in Colum B.<br />
<br />
They will be allocated on a date (to a Teacher) in Colum C.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>I’m trying to calculate a field in Colum E (Expected Completion Date) and I would like that to be 20 working days from the allocation date in Colum D unless the stage is equal to PSR when it should be 15 working days.</span></p>

<p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />
<br />I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately there is no such feature to add sequential numbers to recurring events and adjust whenever there is a cancellation.
<br />
<br />As a possible workaround would be to use the outlook search on the calendar and search for event by subject, using the subject of the recurring events. 
<br />
<br />Since you've deleted the ones you did not attend, the result of the search will be the events you've attended :-)
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search-your-calendar-in-outlook-com-5bc05289-c84c-4849-95a8-7eac05ed478a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search...</a>
<br />
<br />Would this be an acceptable option for you?
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Maggie

            If you export from your calendar to CSV file, the events will be broken into individual events - but any you deleted will not be included in the list. 
<br />
<br />If you can use VBA, I have code that will create a list of the dates. The macro is here - <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/developer/print-list-recurring-dates-vba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/developer/print-list-...</a>

</p><p>My problem: the first time I brought the .accdb file to them, I was able to open it from my pen-drive onto their computer and it worked just fine. After that, though, I went back home, continued developing the forms and everything and when I went back and
 tried to open the new file (same file as last time but with more forms, reports and vba code) I get an error saying that the file is corrupt or that it can't open some of the data... I don't always get the same error but the end result is always the same:
 I cannot open the database. We tried on their laptop and worked just fine and someone told me if I were to unistall ms office and install it once more it would work (and it did), so I'm guessing office saves some libraries or the vba compilation or whatever
 and when I bring the new file with different code it doesn't mesh up with the old stuff...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what I'm talking about? It cannot be that this only happens to me... what should I do to be able to add code to a database on my computer and then just substitute the old file with the new one on a different computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: be the way, I'm using Ms Office 2013 on a Windows 7 64 bits</p>

            <p>Ah, no, sorry. I guess I didn't explain it well: It doesn't open on any computer where I already opened an older version of the same file: so the first time I run the database on their desktop from my pen-drive. 2 weeks later, a newer version of the same
 file run from the same pen-drive on their desktop wouldn't open, but it opened on their laptop where it had never run before. On my next visit, the yet again newer version of the database wouldn't open either on the desktop OR the laptop and we had to uninstall
 office and install it again to get it to run anywhere...</p>

    <title>Office Installion for students - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertyafele  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Installion for students</h2>
                    In 2017 I successfully installed Office 365 for free as a student via my institution . However, About 3 weeks ago while using Excell, it began to slow up, froze and sometimes even stopped responding. In an attempt to fix this, I executed the online repair
 tool, but it got stuck at the "we're getting ready" stage and all my office apps had been unistalled. I attempted to re-install Office 365 several times but the installation got stuck at the same "we're are getting ready" stage. Thereafter, re-attempted to
 install via the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365, but it gave me an Error instead, Error code 30125-1011 (403) or Error code 30125-1007 (403). I don't know what to do next, Please help me as I need Office 365 everyday to do my work.

<h2>            Warning on argument missing. Unable to turn off warning message for macro</h2>
                    I want to turn off warning message on macro and google for the answears. I found the following link to explain exactly what I want:
<br />
<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/show-or-hide-warning-messages-programmatically-HP005186886.aspx<br />
<br />
However, in step 3 as the link guide, I couldn't find the "Warning on" arguement in Action Arguement to set it as "No"
<br />
<br />
Anyone can show me how to make it visible<br />
<br />

<br />
It seems that there is no effect whether or not I click "Show All Action", only 3 arguement visible under "Action Arguement" bar as follows:<br />
<br />
- Query Name<br />
- View<br />
- Data Mode<br />
<br />
Can you give me more instruction for the above or another solution for turning off warning message in details ( I am just begginer)<br />

    <title>Table formatting automation that affects only specific aspects of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w.m.mitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Table formatting automation that affects only specific aspects of formatting &#40;not via a macro&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the things I haven't been able to figure out in MS Word, period (never mind which version, too - in _all_ versions of MS Word I've ever used) is to apply a table format that with one push of a button I can get the table to&nbsp;do something like alternate
 the colouring in rows without affecting anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The table styles are admittedly pretty neat but they rarely cover what one needs as they affect too many aspects of the table's formatting.&nbsp; Unlike Excel, I haven't found something besides a macro that will _just_ give me automatic alternate row colouring!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this easily without using a macro?&nbsp; Every single attempt I've tried over the years to change table styles have failed abysmally as there doesn't seem to be a way to affect just one single attribute, etc., at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, the table's placement, its borders, the font, font sizing, etc., etc., etc., everything seems to get touched depending on the table style we're talking about.&nbsp; But it doesn't help to build from scratch, either, as there are always unwanted changes/edits
 that I've never been able to track down where they come from.&nbsp; There havent been any good videos to cover this yet, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to create some sort of automation in Word 2010 that works like table styles to make a global automatic change(s) to a table but affecting only _one_ or more specific&nbsp;aspects of a table's formatting without affecting too many?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Table styles allow shading of alternate rows and/or columns. However, for each table, you can choose to 'apply' the setting for alternate rows or not. This setting (along with others for first row, first column etc) can be found when your cursor is in a
 table and you go to Table Tools &gt; Design &gt; Table Style Options &gt; Banded Rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this setting to be obviously active, you need to have applied a table style that has a difference in the odd or even row settings for that style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning the Banded Rows setting on or off will not change the indentation or other table attributes that have already been applied as part of the table style or overridden by local table property settings.</p>

            <p>You can create a custom table style in Word, but there is a learning curve. The setup tool is anything but intuitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a blank table in Word. The <strong>Table Tools</strong> tab appears. Click on
<strong>Design</strong>, then on the Table Style Gallery opener (it has a horizontal line over a down-pointing arrowhead). At the bottom of the dropdown, choose
<strong>New Table Style</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key to using this is to format different parts of the table style by changing the
<em>Apply formatting to:</em> dropdown. Start with the default <em>Whole Table</em> and set the background characteristics that will apply to all cells. Tip: don't expect anything from font formatting here, it's broken. Use the
<strong>Format</strong> button in the lower left corner to set margins for the table as well as most other properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then change the <em>Apply formatting to:</em> dropdown to <strong>Header row</strong> and set the properties for just that row. Color banding is done by formatting the
<strong>Odd banded rows</strong> and <strong>Even banded rows</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take many tries to format your first custom style. After creating the first one, use the
<strong>Modify Custom Style</strong> choice from the Table Styles Gallery dropdown to revise your style. The above is just a rough outline, here is a tutorial with more detail:

            <p>Actually, that is not the case.&nbsp; Not once where I have tried to create or even just edit a table style has it ever worked!&nbsp; Not once.&nbsp; Every single attempt and approach over the years has always failed.&nbsp; It doesn't even seem to matter what I have ticked.&nbsp;
 Right now only Banded Rows are supposedly enabled, but if I apply a table style from the gallery that either I created from scratch or that is available, the table always gets changed drastically and goes out all of whack.&nbsp; And believe me when I tell you that
 I have done this many times and many times with always the same outcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like other aspects of MS Word, one has to be an expert to do this, I'm guessing.&nbsp; Believe me, as&nbsp;a power user I know this.&nbsp; Folks come to me to help them with their Word issues and not the other way around.&nbsp; But this is one of those features that has something
 we need to be doing that is not intuitive or straightforward; that's the only explanation to me for the failures.&nbsp; It.Just. Doesn't. Work!&nbsp; And so far I've found no way to even begin to figure out what I'm doing wrong.&nbsp; Every single video I've looked at online
 covers other things or just the basics.&nbsp; I've not found one yet that covers how to get into the nitty gritty where you are targeting just very specific attributes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what I finally gave up trying to do this time around myself and why I came here for help.&nbsp; A very comprehensive step-by-step guide is obviously needed here as I'm not a dummy when it comes to using MS programs at this level, even with MS Word that
 is the most&nbsp;difficult of the Office applications&nbsp;(VBA ...&nbsp;that's something else entirely, however!&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say that about my abilities in VBA as I don't do well without help with new code - then I take it from there &lt;g&gt;).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if someone could point me in the right direction on affecting _just_ banded row colouring and disabling all other changes Word wants to do to tables when using Tables Styles, I'd be very grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

</p><p>Oh, John, just saw your reply.&nbsp; Thank you so much for putting it in the exact words I would have used if I were good at writing things succinctly and efficiently (1656, Blaise Pascal:&nbsp; "I apologize that this letter is so long -- I lacked the time to make
 it short.")&nbsp; This feature is, indeed, not intuitive at all.&nbsp; Actually, all that is needed is a change in approach, something simple like maybe tick boxes to enable or disable attributes at will, for goodness' sake!&nbsp; So easy rather than trying to guess how
 to use this darn thing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps above are so familiar and I've done them so many times!&nbsp; It sure makes me&nbsp;worry about folks who are regular folks and not power users such as myself (like we are called, that sounds so grand doesn't it ... "power users" ... &lt;sigh&gt;).&nbsp; But you've
 given me hope.&nbsp; I'm going to print this out and I'll try one more time before giving up once and for all.&nbsp; If all I walked away with is alternate banded rows that I then could apply to any table, I'd be happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worrying thing is your line that font formatting is broken (that sure explains so much!!).&nbsp; If that is true in the way I think you mean, then that will be a complete deal-breaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'll report back.&nbsp; I suspected that Tables Styles was too good to be true but since I'd never cracked this nut, I never gave up on it &lt;sigh&gt;.&nbsp; We'll see how it goes.</p>

            <p>Table Styles only cover the formatting of the cells, you still have to apply text styles to the final table to get the font formatting correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest taking a slow methodical approach. Start with formatting everything you can with

            <p>The confusion, I think, arises from the display of "table styles" on the <strong>
Table Tools | Design</strong> tab. I think that applying those "styles" doesn't change the font formatting. They're really color schemes rather than table styles, or rather, those styles don't include any font formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, if I apply Table Heading and Table Text styles in a Table Normal table and then apply one of the other styles, the only things that are changed are the borders and shading. The font and paragraph formatting remains the same.</p>

            <p>I'm sure you are right; I haven't tested the built-in styles systematically. But my point was that it is certainly
<strong>possible</strong> to store font and paragraph formatting in a table style.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The complexity I referred to lies in the hierarchy of text formatting: (1) document defaults, (2) table styles, (3) paragraph styles, (4) character styles, (5) direct font/paragraph formatting. There used to be excellent blog posts on this on the Microsoft
 site, but they appear to be lost now. </p>
