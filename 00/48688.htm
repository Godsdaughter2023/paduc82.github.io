<h2>            Driver missing&#58;Canon MV800 AV&#47;C monitor</h2>
                    I have very strange problem on my computer: when conecting (via firewire)&nbsp;my Canon MV800 camera Windows 7 searches for 2 drivers:Canon DV CamCoder (driver found) and Canon MV800 AV/C monitor (driver not found). I already asked that question to Canon -
 no answer. What's more: on other computer with Windows 7 when connecting same camcoder&nbsp;system asks only for one driver:Canon DV CamCoder. Can somebody help me?

<div>Hi Adam Radz,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
a. Does Canon MV800 camera work without any issue on another computer with asked only Canon DV CamCoder driver?<br />
b. Were you able to use that camera without any issues earlier on your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This device is also not listed in windows 7 compatibility center. <br />
If you have any canon camera disk or vista drivers for it then, i'd suggest you to install those drivers in compatibility&nbsp; mode and check if this works.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Steps to run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter:<br />
1.&nbsp;Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</div>

<div>You may also check in the device manager to see if the fireware device is installed properly and check if there are any yellow bangs. Post back the status so that we can assist you better.</div>

<div>Steps to open device manager:</div>
<div>1. Click on start button, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</div>

<div>Hello Umesh P,<br />
<br />
a. Does Canon MV800 camera work without any issue on another computer with asked only Canon DV CamCoder driver?<br />
&nbsp; Yes, I have checked on laptop with Windows 7 - system asked only for Canon DV CamCoder driver and afer installation I could view recording eg using Movie Maker.<br />
&nbsp; On my computer (HP s7640fr) Windows 7 always look for 2 drivers: Canon DV CamCoder&nbsp; and Canon MV800 AV/C monitor (driver not found). I tried to deactive&nbsp;device Canon MV800 AV/C monitor - but I coudn't still capture anything using Movie Maker<br />
<br />
b. Were you able to use that camera without any issues earlier on your computer?<br />
&nbsp; Yes, on XP it worked&nbsp;without any problems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This device is also not listed in windows 7 compatibility center. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is info from Canon site: <a href="http://www.canon.pl/Support/System/Search.aspx?TcmUri=tcm:125-695839&amp;SearchType=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.canon.pl/Support/System/Search.aspx?TcmUri=tcm:125-695839&amp;SearchType=3</a>&nbsp;that camcoder MV800 is compatible with 7.<br />
I raised ticket to Canon - but they claim that on their computer it also works only with&nbsp;&nbsp;Canon DV CamCoder driver (don't ask for Canon MV800 AV/C monitor). I think I have some special software or hardware configuration on my PC.<br />
<br />
If you have any canon camera disk or vista drivers for it then, i'd suggest you to install those drivers in compatibility&nbsp; mode and check if this works.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Driver&nbsp;is not supplied by Canon or available on website (they are available from Microsoft divers - at least Canon DV CamCoder driver). I have never install camer on Vista. See also my above answer.<br />
<br />
<div>&nbsp;You may also check in the device manager to see if the fireware device is installed properly and check if there are any yellow bangs. Post back the status so that we can assist you better.<br />
&nbsp; Firewire driver is OK - LSI 1394 OHCI driver. I have cheked also with other firewire drivers (eg legacy) - still system asks for 2 driver<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Adam<br />

    <title>Audit Process Creation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bkis1969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audit Process Creation</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows server 2008 R2. Our local security policy requires that we enable Audit Process Creation Success. I need to know if there is a way to exclude a particular process from auditing as it is filling up my logs. I am running an HP6000 EVA
 controller with dual FC fabric. Since I first presented virtual disks to the other host systems I have been inundated with 4688. It looks like this: C:\Progra~2\Hewlet~1\EVAPA\POSTGR~1\bin&nbsp;&nbsp; Token Elevation Type Default (1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be a status or health check message between the controller and the server. However I am getting about 30K per day!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can exclude this one process from auditing without disabling Audit Process Creation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change the default audio device on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've looked on all the threads I could find and none of them solved my problems, so I'm going to start my own. So I got windows 10 with the free update, but didn't like it so( Everything is still fine audio and all). &nbsp;So I try to revert back
 to windows 7 but reformatting my computer, but I still had windows 10...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now this is where the problem starts, I plug in my headphones and my game audio still plays through my main speaker, I thought this as a minor problem so I overlooked it. It's really starting to bug me now... I can only play communication sounds
 through my headphones like skype and such and when I tried setting my headphones to my default audio device, nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>Updating my driver(I use the same driver for every device, this driver being the IDT High Definition default)</p>
<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling the driver</p>
<p>Disabling the speaker</p>
<p>Unchecking the give exclusive control over this device thingy in the properties of all devices</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help...</p>

            <p><strong>Will users who take advantage of the upgrade offer for Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 also be able to obtain recovery media?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;<em>With Windows 10, you can create your own recovery media and back up the pristine state of the operating system and preinstalled software. If things go wrong and you are unable to refresh or reset your device successfully, you
 can boot the device using recovery media and reset to the prior pristine state.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>You can also initiate a clean install by doing the following:</p>
<p>You can do a clean install a couple ways.</p>
<p>Press Windows key + i</p>
<p>Click Update and Security</p>
<p>Click Recovery</p>
<p>Under Remove everything and reinstall Windows, click Get started</p>

</p><p><strong>Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?</strong></p>

<h2>            Xbox doesn&#39;t connect to my PC, missing controller driver in the device manager</h2>
                    Recently my Xbox controller stopped connecting to my PC. I tried connecting it to all the USB ports via an USB cable, but it didn't work. I checked the device manager, the Xbox controller driver seemed to be missing. I've not tried Bluetooth yet. I'm gonna
 buy some batteries tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. But meanwhile, I still hope someone can help me to solve the issue. I prefer to use wired connection.

<p>Hi JoJoMaster,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. You only need an adapter if you are trying to connect wireless without using Bluetooth. You don't need an adapter to connect via Bluetooth, however&nbsp;not all Xbox One controllers support Bluetooth. On Bluetooth-supported controllers,
 the plastic around the Xbox button is part of the face of the controller. On controllers without Bluetooth, the plastic around the Xbox button is part of the top, where the bumpers are. It's a little hard to tell from your picture due to the&nbsp;lighting if your
 controller supports Bluetooth, but upon closer inspection it looks like it may be the older model that doesn't support Bluetooth. It's hard to tell from the picture so I could be wrong. If it's the older model (no 3.5mm port and plastic around the Xbox button)
 then this is the reason your laptop doesn't pick up the controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can confirm you have the controller model that supports Bluetooth, then follow

            <p>Hi Arvadadan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the short description, you are getting OOtag on startup. So, there might be some third party software/application or services is triggering it. Try to boot the computer in
<strong>clean boot state </strong>and see if it helps you to fix&nbsp;the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in
<strong>Clean Boot state </strong>helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click
<strong>‘Ok’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the <strong>‘Boot’</strong> tab and uncheck <strong>‘Safe Boot’</strong> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the <strong>‘General’</strong> tab, click to select the option <strong>
‘Selective startup’</strong>, and then click to clear the option <strong>Load startup items</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the <strong>‘Services’</strong> tab, click to select the <strong>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>‘Disable all’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f) On the <strong>‘StartUp’</strong> tab, click ‘<strong>Open Task Manager’.
</strong>In the<strong> Task Manager window</strong> under<strong> startup tab, </strong>
right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<strong>Disable’.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click <strong>‘OK’</strong>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the <strong>Services</strong> tab, and then click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the <strong>Service</strong> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<strong> Service</strong> list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<strong> Service</strong> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If only one service is selected in the <strong>Service</strong> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items </span></strong></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<strong> Hide all Microsoft services</strong>
 check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<strong> Startup Item</strong> list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<strong> Startup Item</strong> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the <strong>Startup Item</strong> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which
</span><span>Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 7:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click
<strong>‘Ok’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the <strong>‘General’</strong> tab, click the <strong>‘Normal Startup’</strong> option, and then click
<strong>‘OK’</strong>.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>‘Restart’</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Computer crashes when I plug in ethernet cord</h2>
                    I am having an issue with my laptop. It will start up and run just fine without the ethernet cord attached. As soon as I plug it in to the computer a window pops up and tells me that Windows has incurred a critical error and will shut down. If I unplug
 the cord it runs just fine after rebooting. Please help me I am not receiving any other messages or error codes so I don't know where to turn. I have run malware detection and McCaffe with no solution to my problem.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When you plug it in, the network card becomes "in use", loading the necessary supporting software and drivers,&nbsp;and the error occurs. This would probably indicate a problem with the network card drivers. Download a fresh set from the laptop&nbsp;manufacturer and
 install them to see if refreshing them helps.</p>

<h3> benjaminives  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stretched screen resolution</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with stretched screen horizontally.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I go into display settings and can not select 1920x1080 size.&nbsp; It isn't there.&nbsp; No slider or place to manually enter as I have seen in some youtube tutorials.&nbsp;
</p>

</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 a year or so ago.&nbsp; And no problems.&nbsp; But suddenly, my machine, 6 year old HP Desktop screen resolution is out of wack.&nbsp; I thought I had ATI Radeon HD 4600 series graphics, but when I go into it it says Microsoft Basic display driver.&nbsp;
 How can I update that driver, or get my computer to use ATI display driver again?&nbsp; I don't much care which, but need an unstretched screen resolution for my work!&nbsp;

            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a system restore before this problem occurred. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955, KB4048954 (Windows 10 1703)
<br />
<br />Microsoft issued an update for several versions of WIndows 10: KB4048954, KB4048955 that has caused issues with display drivers. If you know the make and model of your computer, you can try manually reinstalling the driver from the manufacturers website for your video driver.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade
<br />

            Hi your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . .

<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Go to: <a href="https://github.com/lostindark/DriverStoreExplorer/releases/tag/v0.8.4.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/lostindark/DriverStoreExplor...</a>
<br />
<br />Download DriverStoreExplorer.v0.8.4.2.zip
<br />
<br />Unzipthe package, then right click Rapr.exe and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Let the list of drivers build
<br />

<br />Option 2. Remove AMD drivers completely and Install the legacy ones from the AMD site:
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of AMD using this: <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Clean-Uninstall-Utility.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/...</a> and reboot
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the legacy driver from here(You might have to do a bit of exercise to locate the driver:
<br /><a href="http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.
<br />Option 3: See if Windows itself has some history of the Older Driver:

<br />Please note all the steps need temporarily disabling of Windows update or driver updates so that newer driver doesn't install automatically.

<h2>            Mouse randomly freezes&#47;lags in games out of no where&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue, in certain games my mouse will freeze/lag after a while, and it happens at random times. The games I've had it happen in are Dying Light and in the Destiny 2 beta. I've had it happen in Osu but I suspect that's something to do with my pen
 and tablet, and I don't see it happen anymore in Osu. This issue started happening about 3 or 4 weeks ago out of no where and I don't know how to fix it. I decided to try another mouse to see if it was specific to my mouse and it happened on the other mouse.
 I uninstalled my mouse driver and reinstalled it and the issue still happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an AMD a10-6800k, a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti and 12gb DDR3 RAM. My mouse is a Redragon M801. Thank you to anyone who can help me fix this issue!</p>

    <title>Post update black screen with loading circles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylerhentschel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Post update black screen with loading circles</h2>
                    <p>Hello I am having an issue with my computer booting after the newest windows update. This morning I wake up to see a black screen with loading circles just spinning. I let it sit for a good 30 minutes with no progress or anything. On this screen I have access
 to the mouse but the keyboard does not respond, so after looking for troubleshooting the ctrl alt del method I found doesn't help.</p>
<p>I then tried booting into the advanced startup menu and tried several things, first I system restored to 9/28 and it booted and did the same thing with the black screen and circles. Then I tried going back to previous build which came across an error so
 nothing was changed. Then I did a system reset with keep files with the same outcome, error nothing was changed.</p>
<p>Then I tried booting into safe mode. It just does the same thing as normal and just boots up to this black screen with the loading circles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at my wits end and have tried just about anything I could find like removing USB devices and everything.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. In the meantime I will just let this thing spin on this "loading screen."</p>
<p>Thank you ahead of time.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Monica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. &nbsp;I don't believe my PC was on Insider Builds, but my tablet was (which I haven't updated in a while).</p>
<p>Anyways, turns out it was unable to repair via various methods, even the ISO via a USB jump drive. &nbsp;So I ended up taking the bullet and deleting/formatting my entire SSD and performing a clean install of Windows 10 Home on it again. &nbsp;After one restart for
 an update last night it seems to be in working order for now.</p>
<p>At least not too much was lost, as I still had backups on another drive, now to just reinstall everything again.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the support!</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth services panel is blank</h2>
                    <p>Hey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought an ACME BH60 bluetooth headphone and a Media-Tech MT5005 bluetooth adapter, since my PC didn't have bluetooth. So I connected the adapter, and used the basic windows driver. I turned on the headphone and it appeared on the bluetooth panel
 on my PC. But when I try to connect them it diyplays an error: Adding this device took too long.(Or something like this, I transletad this from my motherlanguage)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look after this problem on the Internet and i found somthing like that before i try to connect to the device, i have to right click on it and in the properties menu I have to select 'Listening to music' from the Bluetooth-services list. But If i do this,
 nothing appears at the bluetooth-services list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like this:&nbsp;https://imgur.com/gallery/S1eph</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the adapter with it's driver, and tried to reinstall it several times. The PC can see the headphone but cant connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype version 8.25 &#40;Horrible&#33;&#33;&#33;&#41;  I&#39;ve lost all contacts and my profile photo.</h2>
                    <p>I HATE the new Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp; Forced to upgrade, and then find out that all my contacts have been blown away.&nbsp; Before anyone suggests it, I have exactly ONE email address, it has not changed for years, so it isn't because I&nbsp;have ever signed in&nbsp;under a different
 email.&nbsp; I used a Skype name, but this awful new version won't accept that either.&nbsp; So you have really done it to me this time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see the point in trying to revert if I only have a month before the old version is discontinued.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened to testing a product&nbsp;BEFORE it is rolled out to the public? What kind of analyst or programmer&nbsp;DOES that??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have no way to find my contacts again.&nbsp; So many with the same name and there is no further information given. What do I do? Guess? Send invites to every person with that name and
<em>hope </em>one of them is right? Epic FAIL, Microsoft. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You also don't have a category for this problem, so I have to guess at that too.</p>

<p>Hi Joseph&nbsp; </p>
<p>Well, I would have responded sooner, and I DID check off that I wanted to be notified of replies, but sadly that also failed. Sigh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first upgraded to this new version of Skype, it absolutely would not allow me to use my Skype name as it previously existed, which forced me to start a new account under my Microsoft sign in. (and don't tell me I have "finger problems", please, I
 do know how to sign in to an account.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Using your suggestions, I first tried Skype for Web, and it was already signed into the new account. I signed out, and wonder of wonders, I was able to sign into my existing account under my Skype name.&nbsp; Something got fixed, I'm guessing.&nbsp; I then went back
 into the new version of Skype for Desktop and was also able to sign in there using my existing Skype name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW my problem will be deleting the new Skype account without also deleting my Microsoft ID.&nbsp; It's still a case of somebody not doing their job when the new version was coded. I should not have to go through these headaches.</p>
<p>

It worked, I've been both confused AND angry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Joseph's suggestions above, I tried signing in again using my existing Skype name, and this time I was allowed to do so.&nbsp; Something got fixed, I'm guessing.

<p>Sadly I have to agree. </p>
<p>It makes me want to vomit every time I am forced to use&nbsp;Skype version 8.27.0.85 ;(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a couple topics that make everyday desktop user life misserable with current version:</p>
<p>- no more hotkeys to bring various skype actions</p>
<p>- no more in chat search via ctrl-F&nbsp;</p>
<p>- performance... eh? what is it really?</p>
<p>- no more insta contact search when just selecting contacts/recent list</p>
<p>- no more insta copy message/selection. Now you have to feel like an idiot to click miriad times to even be able to copy something.</p>
<p>- no more screen sharing, if you got more than 1 monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why I even bother continuing.....</p>

    <title>Reinstalling a preinstalled version of Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> braddarling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling a preinstalled version of Windows 8</h2>
                    Santa Claus was very generous to my wife this year and brought her a new Lenovo laptop with Windows 8.&nbsp; However, there is an enormous amount of bloatware on the system.&nbsp; I would like to wipe it and reinstall a clean Windows 8.<br />
<br />
I have read that the product key is imbedded into the BIOS.&nbsp; Does this mean that I can reinstall Windows 8 without having to search for a product key?&nbsp; I cannot seem to find an actual, written product key anywhere on the laptop itself or in the documentation.&nbsp;
 If this is the case, how and where would I acquire the files to make a disc for reinstallation?&nbsp; Are they available for download anywhere?<br />
<br />
I have seen it mentioned that I could wipe and reinstall a fresh copy of Windows 8 from within Windows 8 itself.&nbsp; Is this possible, and if so, how do you do it?&nbsp; Would it be any different than installing with a disc?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />
<br />

<p>Unfortunately, your options are limited. Your best option would be to customize the system the way you like by removing all the bundled applications and utilities you don't want then create a recovery image point. Trying to using retail media or other OEM
 media will render your system inoperable requiring that you contact HP for recovery media to reinstall the OS.</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Programs and Features</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Select the application/s you don't want and click Change/Uninstall on the command bar</p>
<p>Follow the on screen instructions to remove it. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After you have customized the system the way you like, create a recovery image point which you can use in the future to reinstall Windows 8 without having to customize it again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</span><font><font><span>
<p>Create a recovery image point:</p>
</span></font></font><span>
<p>From the Start screen, type <font><font>cmd</font></font>, and then right-click the Command Prompt app and click "Run as administrator." Click through the UAC prompt. and at the command prompt type
<font><font>recimg /createimage C:\Recovery</font></font>. The computer will churn for awhile as it writes the image to disk—it's not unusual for this process to take several hours, so give it time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</span><font><font><span>
<p>moving the restore image:</p>
</span></font></font><span>
<p>If in the future you'd like to move the <font><font>C:\Recovery</font></font> directory elsewhere to save space on your main drive, you can; all you have to do after you move it is fire up another administrative
 command prompt window and type recimg /setcurrent [New directory name] to set a new path for the recovery image.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, note that while a refreshed PC will include all desktop applications you had installed at the time you made the image with
<font><font>recimg</font></font>, it will uninstall all desktop applications you've put on there since. If you'd like to update the image with new drivers or applications, just run recimg with the /createimage
 switch again.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 HOME Password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denisejm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 HOME Password</h2>
                    <p>When I was using Windows XP x64, I didn't want to use a password to boot to Windows, so in BIOS, I highlighted "Password" and I just clicked Enter on my keyboard and no password was needed for my computer to boot to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have Windows 10 HOME.&nbsp; I tried to do the same thing by changing my password in BIOS to Enter.&nbsp; When Windows was booting up, it still asked me for my password so I pressed Enter.&nbsp; It told me that I had an incorrect password.&nbsp; So I typed in my original
 password and it told me that my password was incorrect.&nbsp; So I went into BIOS and entered my original password as my password again.&nbsp; When Windows started to boot up, it asked me for my password and I typed in my original password and it told me that my password
 was incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I clicked on the option to boot to Windows using my MS password and Windows booted up.&nbsp; So I went into BIOS and changed my Windows password to be the same as my MS password.&nbsp; However, when I want to do something as the Administrator in Windows, it asks
 me for my password but the password that I entered in BIOS, which is the same as my MS password, doesn't work.&nbsp; I'm told that it's incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change my password for Windows when Windows won't accept the password that I assign to it?&nbsp; Is there another place in Windows where I need to change my Administrator password that will accept the password that I entered in BIOS and is my MS password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide instructions for Windows 10 HOME.&nbsp; HOME doesn't have the same settings/options as other Windows 10 editions.</p>

            Hi Denise
<br />
<br />The first thing to understand is BIOS and Windows are two separate entities, a BIOS password does not affect Windows in any way and vice versa
<br />
<br />If you did set a BIOS password, you should immediately clear that, or you may lock yourself out of your hardware . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />Are you able to get into Windows?
<br />
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign In Options
<br />
<br />From there are you able to see if you are logging in with a Windows account or a local account?
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type netplwiz and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, is your user profile showing as a member of the Administrators group?

</p><p>I found that out the hard way, too.&nbsp; I wound up doing a repair of Windows because I gave DOS a command that wouldn't allow Windows to boot up (long story).&nbsp; I haven't checked yet to see if I can get back into BIOS yet. . .&nbsp; just hoping I can.&nbsp; If not, I'll
 have to wipe the hard drive and install Windows fresh again</p>

            Hi Denise, yes this Administrator bug has been ongoing in Windows 10 for a long time. You are an administrator, but Windows does not see you as an administrator . .. 
<br />
<br />I think it has something to do with signing on with a Microsoft Account, because I never get this and I use a local account instead
<br />
<br />So, if you log in with a Microsoft Account I would suggest changing that to a local account and if that does not resolve this, create a new user account with admin privileges, copy your data over into that account and delete the old account . . .

<p>Right now, my main concern is getting back into BIOS.&nbsp; I know that I gave the password MyBIOS9( because I keep all my passwords simple like that because I have at least 100 of them. . .&nbsp; MyMail9(, MyPassport9(, MyCarLoan9(, etc.&nbsp; I could only think that
 I might have had the caps lock on and typed&nbsp; mYBIOS9(&nbsp; or&nbsp; mYbios9(&nbsp; by mistake by neither of them worked either.&nbsp; Maybe I had my fingers on the wrong keys but I'm usually very careful when I type a password so that doesn't happen.&nbsp; If I did it this time,
 it would have been a first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I get BIOS straightened out, I'll work on the Administrator account again.&nbsp; It was an annoyance but not really a problem.&nbsp; I need to get into BIOS to change AHCI to IDE to see if it would make a difference with my hard drives being recognized by My
 Computer and Disk Management.&nbsp; I have 12 internal hard drives and only 8 of them are recognized but they were all recognized by My Computer and Disk Management the night before when XP x64 was running.&nbsp; As soon as I installed Windows 10 and change IDE to AHCI,
 they were no longer recognized.&nbsp; All 4 drives that aren't being recognized could have broken all at once but that would be a very big coincidence.&nbsp; I didn't have them connected when I installed Win 10.&nbsp; I connected one at a time, rebooting between each connection
 to alleviate the problem of Windows trying to sort them all out at once.&nbsp; While I was working inside my computer, I unplugged it and pressed the reset button for 30 seconds to empty any electricity still inside it and I put the computer on an anti-static mat.&nbsp;
 I was very careful so that nothing would get shorted out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do you know if the BIOS password stays with the motherboard or if I reinstalled Windows on a new drive, BIOS would get reset?&nbsp; It didn't reset when I did the repair reinstall.</strong></p>

            Hi Denise
<br />
<br />Reinstalling Windows will have absolutely no affect on your BIOS Password . . .
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that should be on a sticker on the casing?
<br />
<br />If that is a self build, what is the Make and exact model No. of your motherboard?

<p>This morning, I followed steps 1 and 2 at the addy you provided several times but they didn't work.&nbsp; I really didn't want to try step 3 because my CMOS battery is tucked in behind some metal tubing and it looks locked in and would be very difficult to remove.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I remembered that there are 3 buttons on my motherboard 1. reset, 2. CMOS, 3. power.&nbsp; I decided to press each one of the buttons for 10 seconds, one at a time, when my computer was turned off.&nbsp; When I booted up, I was able to get into BIOS again.&nbsp; I
 also remember reading (9 years ago when I built the pc) that my motherboard has Dual BIOS.&nbsp; I didn't know what that was and I didn't care at the time since I was always going to leave BIOS alone and let it do its own thing, but after I pressed those buttons,
 Dual Bios started my computer and got me to BIOS where I was able to remove the passwords and change the setting from AHCI to IDE.&nbsp; I don't know if that'll fix the problem with the 4 hard drives not being recognized by My Computer/Disk Management.&nbsp; Two of
 the drives were working the night before I installed Win 10 when I had XP x64 running.&nbsp; Two of the drives are brand new.&nbsp; One didn't work from the get-go.&nbsp; The other drive was good.&nbsp; I formatted it, assigned it a drive letter, moved about 1Tb of files onto
 it and, when I rebooted, it was no longer recognized by My Computer/Disk Management.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what I'll be doing today . . .&nbsp; trying to connect those hard drives and if they're not recognized by My Computer/Disk Management, I'll uninstall them and take them to a pc repair shop in town to see if they're dead.&nbsp; The 2 brand new ones are still
 under warranty so I should have no problem getting WD to replace them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; It was much appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have Skype, outlook 365 and access my emails via an IMAP account on outlook. All are linked. I do not have the skype facility on the calender.&nbsp; What do I need to do to see it? I want to be able to schedule a skype meeting via my calender in my IMAP account.</p>
<p>I contacted the Microsoft customer centre this afternoon, who uninstalled outlook and during re-installation terminated the call because it was taking too long to load, telling me this would fix the problem. Outlook is reinstalled now but the problem still
 exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help gratefully received.</p>

<h2>            My Surface Laptop has issues connecting to external monitors</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Surface Laptop to connect to 1080p external monitors through an AmazonBasics HDMI to Minidisplay cable. For both connections I have tried now the Surface Laptop has had major issues trying to configure the proper resolution and Hz optimization
 for the screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point on a Samsung 32 inch TV it could not even manage to find a single configuration that was compatible with the screen. I went into the display properties management and tried individually every configuration of resolution and Hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then proceeded to connect to a Toshiba 47 inch TV and it was able to connect after some playing around with the resolution and Hz but it had looked like I was viewing it through a thin white film. Everything was bleached and I couldn't fix it, and the
 response was horrible, seeing noticeable lag between the mouse moving in my hand and it registering on screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now connected to the Samsung 32 inch TV and it is working, however the same bleaching occurred, which took a tremendous amount of configuration on the TV to counteract this, and on this smaller screen the response seems a bit better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just wondering if there is away to prevent this issue every time I hook up to a different TV or monitor? Is this a resolution scaling problem that if I were to get a 4k or 2k monitor would this solve these issues? Or is there an alternative solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Latency on Windows 10 causing audio buzzing and visual stuttering</h2>
                    <p>
I've been having problems with audio cracking noises and video stutters since I bought my laptop. Its Dell Inspiron 5767 with Windows 10 Pro installed. The configuration is:</p>
<p>
Intel i7 7500</p>
<p>
16 Gb RAM</p>
<p>
4 Gb GRAM AMD Radeon R7 M445.</p>
<p>
I have tried many things but nothing has given any significant results. All hardware diagnostics and with 100% completion and sfc /scannow says everything is okay. I ran LatencyMon and this is the result:</p>

<p>
storport and APCI are causing some trouble. I've seen other people have this problem too, but at least I couldn't find a solution. Not even clean install, it only takes the problem away for a while.</p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. I am a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting. 
<br />
<br />The sounds like a hardware or driver issue Do you have a 3rd party antivirus installed? Have you tried a Clean Boot to see if something loading at startup is causing the issue? See below for full performance checks.
<br />
<br />New computer? If so I would stop and do this :
<br />
<br />Since the computer is new and still under warranty please contact Dell Support and the seller. As OEM Dell is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done.

<br />
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG

<br />
<br />==================================================
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click -Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.
