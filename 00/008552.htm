                    <p>Original title: Microsoft Egde on Build 11802</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use Cortana by right clicking word, Search panel opens at left of screen, Cortana displays various messages that advise searching for answer, however after approx. 45 seconds Cortana comes back with message, "Oops! Looks like we have lost the connection"
 I am on Fibre Ethernet connection and have no problems with my connection. As Edge is running and I am querying a web page on Edge I am connected. Has anyone else had this problem??</p>

<h3> chrispettitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync with iPhone while in cached mode</h2>
                    
<p>On Monday I had a glitch that caused my OST file to become unstable. I had to use the repair app to fix it. However, in doing so, my system has not recovered completely.</p>
<p>Prior to Monday, my iPhone, desktop app of Outlook and my online Office 365 version of Outlook were all talking to one another and syncing with one another.</p>
<p>After my issues on Monday, my iPhone is not receiving any info from either my desktop Outlook or the online version. When I uncheck "Use in Cached Mode" in my account settings, then everything works fine. However, I want to work in cached mode. My setup
 was fine prior to Monday's glitch. I worked in cached mode prior to Monday and everything synced with each other.</p>
<p>I thank you in advance if you have any advice or solution to share!</p>

<p>hi chris,</p>
<p>to better understand the situation, i’d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;regarding “my iphone is not receiving any info from either my desktop outlook or the online version. when i uncheck "use in cached mode" in my account settings, then everything works fine”, do you mean that your iphone can’t receive any new emails (not
 sync with your outlook client and outlook web app) if you use the cached mode in the outlook desktop client?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;does the outlook client sync fine with your outlook web app (owa: <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.office.com/owa</a>) when you use the cached mode?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;can you provide the screenshots of the detailed steps about how you use the repair app to fix the “glitch”? and have you tried to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">re-create the outlook profile</a> to fix the issue?<br />
to upload images, please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and then select the
<strong>insert/edit media</strong> button.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4feecd5a-d911-4188-a258-8905542191c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4feecd5a-d911-4188-a258-8905542191c2" /></a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;which mail app do you use on the iphone?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;does the issue occur to any other users in your organization?</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

                    I wrote a document in no color font (black) and when I copied and pasted it into another document that was also written without red font or color, all of a sudden the pasted paragraphs were all in RED. I have no idea why and I can't get rid of that color.
 I've tried going into "font" no color or Select all, then font, then clicking "automatic" but nothing works. Help. I need the full document in black and no color. Thanks.

            It sounds like you have Track Changes turned on in the document where you pasted. That's all too easy to do by accidentally pressing Ctrl+Shift+E.<br />
<br />
To fix it, click the Review tab of the ribbon, click the down arrow on the Accept button, and click Accept All Changes In Document.<br />
<br />
To prevent any further changes from being tracked, if the Track Changes button on the same tab is turned on (highlighted in orange), click it to turn it off. It may also help to right-click the status bar at the bottom of the Word window and click to check
 the menu item for Track Changes -- then you can see at a glance when Track Changes is turned on or off, and you can click that notification to toggle it.<br />

    <title>Excel Shadow Prints over text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel Shadow Prints over text</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since office 365 update, I have a problem printing an excel sheet. &nbsp;When I insert a shadow under a cell and try to print the sheet, the shadow appears as a black bar or black rectangle in front of the text. &nbsp;I've tried different printer and printing as PDF
 to, so I know it's not a printer problem. &nbsp;I've have tried it on several computers too and I always have the same problem. &nbsp;I think that Excel create a black rectangle, offsets it and send it in the back of the layers so it appears as a Shadow. &nbsp;However, when
 I print the sheet it comes in the front, hiding whatever is under it. &nbsp;Never had problem with this before update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone as encountered this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

 happening in old excel files that we use since a long time. I've tried copying all cells (ctrl+a, ctrl+c) in another sheet and it's working. &nbsp;I have hundreds of them so it would take a while to set all sheets one by one. The file was in .xls at first and I

<p>Hi EBSSJW,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know what cells do you want to select? I tried Shift + Tab in Excel and it did not select multiple cells either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an article about select cells in Excel:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/select-cell-contents-in-excel-23f64223-2b6b-453a-8688-248355f10fa9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Select cell contents in Excel</a>. It introduced several
 shortcuts to select cells in Excel but doesn't mention about Shift + Tab. Could you share more with me so that I can test from my side again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<h2>            Calculating date of birth</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've been using the formula below to calculate age.&nbsp; Works fine but I'm wondering if "TODAY" changes every day.&nbsp; In other words, yesterday I was 28.&nbsp; Today is my birthday, so my age will change to 29.</p>
<p>&nbsp;=INT((TODAY()-DY13)/365.25)</p>

<p>Not clear to me whether the #NAME error persists, or if you have solved the problem somehow.&nbsp; You marked my speculations as "the answer"; but it seems like the error persists.&nbsp; However, I do not see a new thread to initiate (restart) a discussion of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should have suggested the following at the outset....</p>
<p>When faced with a mystifying problem, "divide and conquer".</p>
<p>First, open a new workbook.&nbsp; That is, close all instances of Excel, and double-click the Excel icon on the Desktop.</p>
<p>Enter 2/29/1980 into A1 and 2/28/2010 into A2.&nbsp; Put the following formula into A3:</p>
<p>=DATEDIF(A1,A2,"y")</p>
<p>There should be no error.&nbsp; It should result in 29.&nbsp; Right?</p>
<p>Now put the following formula into A4:</p>
<p>=DAY(A1)</p>
<p>There should be no error.&nbsp; It should result in 29.&nbsp; Right?</p>
<p>Finally, put the following formula into A5:</p>
<p>=EDATE(A1,12)</p>
<p>You should see the date 2/28/1981, but probably only after you format the cell as Date (click Format &gt; Cells &gt; Number, and select Date).</p>
<p>But do you actually see a #NAME error?</p>
<p>If you do, click Tools &gt; Add-ins.&nbsp; Do you see a checkmark next to Analysis ToolPak?&nbsp; (Ignore Analysis ToolPak - VBA.)</p>
<p>If not, checkmark ATP.&nbsp; Then select A5, and press A2, then Enter.&nbsp; You should see 2/28/1981 after you format the cell as Date.</p>
<p>If you still see a #NAME error, you might need to reinstall the ATP from the source of Office 2003 or Excel 2003 -- usually a CD.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am not familiar with the procedure.&nbsp; Excel does provide something to help you (supposedly):&nbsp; click Help &gt; Detect and Repair.&nbsp; Some people suggest using that to repair Excel when it is "broken".</p>
<p>But I must forewarn you:&nbsp; D&amp;R is not for the faint at heart, IMHO.</p>
<p>When I did it, it did require the installation CD.&nbsp; And as a result, I lost much of my customized settings -- which I set over the course of 6 years, with little recollection of what they are.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you can reinstall the ATP from the CD without having to reinstall all of Office or Excel -- that is, without relying on the D&amp;R feature of Excel Help.</p>
<p>Please report your findings in a response in this thread.</p>

<blockquote>Sorry for the confusion.</blockquote>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; There are too many inconsistencies for me to deal with.&nbsp; I'm afraid I will not be able to help you further.</p>
<p>My suggestion:&nbsp; repost the problem, starting a new thread.</p>
<p>Hopefully that will attract fresh blood.&nbsp; I'm not sure anyone else is paying attention to this thread anymore, since it seemed that we had resolved your original problem.&nbsp; Cannot see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>Hint:&nbsp; When you start a new thread, I don't think it's necessary to rehash past history.&nbsp; Stick with the current facts, to wit:&nbsp; (a) you are using "this" formula; (b) when you enter "this" date into AR2, it seems to work fine; and (c) when you enter "that"
 date in AR2, you get "this" error.</p>
<p>Copy-and-paste the contents of AR2, GD2 and any other relevant cells from the Formula Bar into your new posting.</p>
<p>Also make note of whether the calculation mode is automatic or manual; and if the latter, what happens when you press ctrl+alt+F9.</p>
<p>Some final comments....</p>
<p>Kathleen wrote:</p>
<blockquote>I didn't say "another report"</blockquote>
<p>Of course you did.&nbsp; Copy-and-pasting from your posting, you wrote:&nbsp; "its working great - using the date that came over on another report".</p>
<p>Perhaps you meant to write:&nbsp; ``I didn't __mean_to__ say "another report"``.</p>
<p>No problem if you merely misspoke again.&nbsp; If I had a dollar for every time I inadvertently omitted words -- especially important words like "not" -- I'd be richer than Gates, if not Buffett&nbsp; ;-) ;-).</p>
<p>Kathleen wrote:</p>
<blockquote>Cell AR2 held the date of birth&nbsp;7/28/1966.&nbsp; Once your formula was entered into GD2, it accurately calculated the age to be 44.&nbsp; However, the correct date of birth in AR2 should be 7/29/1965.&nbsp; I went back to AR2 and changed the date of birth&nbsp;from
 7/28/1966 to 7/29/1965 -- the result in GD2 should have been&nbsp;45. Instead the GD2 result is the error message #NAME?</blockquote>
<p>Say what?!&nbsp; What is "my formula" doing in GD2?&nbsp; The one you posted is:</p>
<p>=IF(AR2="",0,DATEDIF(AR2,GD2,"y")<br />
+IF(DAY(AR2)=29,EDATE(AR2,12*DATEDIF(AR2,GD2,"y")+12)=GD2,0))</p>
<p>That presumes that GD2 contains a date, namely the "valuation date" -- what used to be TODAY() in your previous formula.</p>
<p>If you truly put that formula into GD2, that would create a circular reference.&nbsp; You should get a warning, unless you set the Iteration calculation option.&nbsp; (Bad idea!)</p>
<p>But even when the Iteration option is set (bad idea!), the eventual cell error is #NUM, not #NAME, if AR2 in non-blank.</p>
<p>(Or #VALUE if AR2 contains text, not a date number.)</p>
<p>Kathleen wrote;</p>
<blockquote>And when you go to Tools &gt; Add-Ins, do you a checkmark next to Analysis ToolPak?<br />
Yes - I'm not familiar with what this does and will learn more</blockquote>
<p>No need to.&nbsp; You __should__ see a checkmark next to Analysis ToolPak.&nbsp; That enables you to use EDATE().&nbsp; I was merely looking for confirmation.</p>
<p>If there were no checkmark next to Analysis ToolPak, we would expect the use of EDATE() to generate a #NAME error.</p>
<p>But....&nbsp; only after you close and restart Excel with Analysis ToolPak uncheckmarked.</p>
<p>And (drum roll!)....&nbsp; only when the birthdate in AR2 is on day 29.</p>
<p>Kathleen wrote:</p>
<blockquote>Well, I went back again to play with the dates, entering new, changing back to old,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the problem is with "29" in the formula.&nbsp; I've been using the date 7/29/1965 and definitely get the error (tried 12/29, 1/29, etc all result
 in error).&nbsp; However,&nbsp;if I use the date 7/1/1965, it accurately shows 45.</blockquote>
<p>The problem is not "with 29 in the formula" per se.&nbsp; But I can believe that the problem is __exposed__ when the birthdate is on day 29.</p>
<p>The IF() function is not a true function.&nbsp; It behaves more like a "conditional operator"; that is, Excel evaluates its arguments only as needed.</p>
<p>So if AR2 is blank, no usage error in the DATEDIF and EDATE expressions would be exposed because Excel evaluates only the first value-if-true part, namely 0.</p>
<p>Similarly, if AR2 contains a birthdate that is not on day 29, no usage error in the EDATE expression would be exposed because Excel evaluates only the first DATEDIF expression and the value-if-false part of the second IF() function, namely 0.</p>
<p>But when AR2 contains a birthdate that is on day 29, Excel would evaluate the EDATE expression and expose any usage error therein, as well as any usage error in the first DATEIF experssion.</p>
<p>So yes, your problem seems to be with the EDATE expression.</p>
<p>But when I copy-and-paste the formula that you posted into a cell other than GD2, I get valid results for all three conditions, namely:&nbsp; when AR2 is empty; when AR2 is the numeric date 7/28/1966; and when AR2 is the numeric date 7/29/1965.</p>
<p>So it seems that something else is going on, something specific to your Excel file or your Excel environment (e.g. workbook event macros, personal.xls, etc).&nbsp; Something "lost in translation" to your posting.</p>
<p>As I noted above, if EDATE is not enabled, you will get a #NAME error if a birthdate in AR2 is a date on day 29.&nbsp; (And only after you close and restart Excel.)</p>
<p>EDATE is not enabled if there is no checkmark next to Analysis ToolPak in the menu when click Tools &gt; Add-ins.</p>
<p>Note that I talking about "Analysis ToolPak" per se, not "Analysis TookPak - VBA".&nbsp; You can checkmark both, if you wish.&nbsp; But you must checkmark at least the non-VBA Analysis ToolPak.</p>
<p>If any of that helps, good.&nbsp; Otherwise, ignore it, and start a new thread to attract fresh blood.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Office Online not opening random documents</h2>
                    I am using a website called Edmodo to post about 10-20 documents each week for my students. &nbsp;They are mostly powerpoints and word documents. &nbsp;Some are pdf's, but they haven't been an issue. &nbsp;The documents that I post come from different sources. &nbsp;Some
 are handed down from other teachers so they are .doc and .ppt, while others that I have created are .docx and .pptx from the newer version. &nbsp;About a month ago, Edmodo added a microsoft office online application to their website, so now, every file that the
 students open is automatically opened in microsoft online. &nbsp;A huge portion of my files aren't working anymore. &nbsp;I have to constantly play with converting them back and forth to different versions and reloading them several times before they work. &nbsp;This is
 becoming impossible because the volume of documents that I am dealing with every week is starting to increase. &nbsp;We have found a few work arounds that work occassionally from the student's des

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please try to open the documents in Word Online (.docx) or Powepoint Online (.pptx). Do you see any error messages when trying to open the documents from Edmodo? If you get an error message and it looks similar to the one shown on the screenshot below, could

<p>
</p><p>If you can't get Edmodo to work properly, as a TEMPORARY work around, you could upload the files to your personal or work OneDrive and provide the students with EDIT links to the files. That way they can download them. Make sure to tell them to NOT edit
 the files before downloading them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory, Office online apps should be able to handle all file formats. While they do not support all features, such as macros. They should be able to open the files with those unsupported features disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That suggests an idea. Is it possible that any of these problem files have macros that run automatically when the file is opened? Not being able to run those macros would cause issues with the file.

            <p>I'm afraid I'm going to have to transfer all my files to another platform over the summer if this isn't resolved, but It's not really plausible in the middle of the semester. &nbsp;It would take so much time to transfer hundreds of files, and it also takes a
 lot of time to re-teach my 100+ freshman how to access the files they need. &nbsp;I also use the website to give open book quizzes and graded replies to posted questions. &nbsp;Regardless of how carefully I give the directions, there is a learning curve, and I would
 never trust all of them not accidentally or intentionally edit my originals on OneDrive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious about your comment on Macros. &nbsp;I don't know what that is? &nbsp;How can I tell if that is happening? &nbsp;The problem files are usually powerpoints and worksheets made on Word, not really any pdfs or jpeg files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for confirming that you are actually seeing the dialog I sent on my original reply!
</p>
<p>As far as I understand, documents hosted in Edmodo are opened in read/view mode by default, and&nbsp;in order to edit the document you need to click the "Edit in Browser" button. Is this consistent with what you are experiencing? If so, you are probably getting
 the error while in view mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know when you have the chance to retrieve a Session ID for a failing session. This information can be really useful for us in helping identifying the root cause of the issue.</p>

                    <p>In Windows 8.1 it was possible to run the original setup wizard to select your OneDrive folder location at any time and move all your files / resync. I don't see how to do this in Windows 10 now. Anyone figure it out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an article which talks about how to do in Windows 8.1 and it states that in older versions you had to unlink your Microsoft account from your windows account and unlink OneDrive to get it to trigger that setup wizard. That sounds like a lot of work
 for such a simple thing.</p>

            <p>Might try turning off onedrive and then move its folder to where you would like it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Pretty sure that's what I did to get the onedrive setup asking&nbsp; &nbsp;where is it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't need to download all again.</p>

<h2>            How to enable java x64 on windows 7 x64&#63;</h2>
                    I have installed JDK 6 update 26 x64 and JRE of the same version on windows 7 ultimate sp1 also x64. But when I open a page in any browser that requires JRE, I get the message that "Please Enable Java". This is same for IE 9, Firefox 5, Safari 5 etc. When
 I check java command at the command prompt it works fine.<br />
<br />
By the way I have tried the solution given in the related thread:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_7/internet-explorer-8-64-bit-on-windows-7-x64-with/a51686b0-6280-4a21-ad2e-fa131d9019dd<br />
<br />
But no use. I still get that message. My Problem is Java and not Javascript.<br />
<br />
How to enable Java x64?<br />

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word / Excel / PW in  Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word / Excel/ PW:
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

<p>Hi Leanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Account requires your date of birth for children’s online safety reasons. If you put the wrong birthdate on your account, you need to correct it on the Microsoft website. The steps on how you can do it is listed on this support page:

    <title>Samsung Focus STILL says no update available &#40;still running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ben rush  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung Focus STILL says no update available &#40;still running 7.7004&#41;</h2>
                    I won a Samsung Focus at a Microsoft Developer's Conference and recently switched over to it from my Android. The OS version on it still says 7.7004, even though that version is far, far behind in its update cycle. Given that I recently purchased a Windows
 Phone Developer's license, I would like to update it to Mango, but cannot given the installer says a minimum version of NoDo is required.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Does anyone still have Samsung Focus phones without updates available? Are people ACTUALLY still running on this outdated version of the Windows Phone 7 OS or am I somehow running on a broken phone?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any advice would be helpful. I called AT&amp;T and was tossed over to Samsung, who promptly tossed me back over to AT&amp;T again. The local AT&amp;T store stared at me as if I had a giant squid on my head the entire time I described to them the problem I was having with
 the phone updating.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help? Please?&nbsp;

            Thank you for your response. It says rev 1.3.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At this point, I am more the willing to provide even a picture of the serial number information, etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would like to add a few more details. I have double-checked (several times) that I am, indeed, running the latest Zune software. Per the recommendation of the Samsung represented with whom I spoke, I uninstalled and reinstalled Zune and rebooted my PC (in
 fact, several times).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regardless of what action I take, the Zune client always reports 7004 as the latest version available for my phone.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2007. Error message Outlook.pst cannot be accessed</h2>
                    I've used Outlook 2007 on the same laptop for several years. Suddenly, when I tried to open up today, I received an error message saying the outlook.pst file couldn't be accessed. I can see the file on my computer and all the right permissions seem to
 be ticked so not sure what to do next.

<h2>            Cannot start Defender on Windows 10 - build 14959</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to get Windows Defender to start for a couple of weeks. &nbsp;I used to have both AVG and SPYBOT installed, but they have been completely removed. &nbsp;I worked with support for like five hours one day, then went to level 2 for another couple of
 hours before they said that because I was on a preview build they could not help me - that I should ask the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read literally dozens of recommendations, and tried them all, to no avail. &nbsp;Obviously defender still thinks something else is running AV, but there is nothing installed - there has to be a registry entry to fix this, but have not found it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told to wait for the next build, which was installed this morning. &nbsp;After rebooting, it appeared that defender was ready to work, but the files were years out of date. &nbsp;No way could I get them to install, and after another reboot I am back to the pictures
 below. &nbsp;Does anyone have a new idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't know if any of the Anti Virus Apps do anything with Group Policy but if they do You can clean it up by going to the Group Policy Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are using the Group Policy Control Panel you can see if anything is configured at the present time by expanding each of the All Settings of Administrative Templates then you can scroll down the list to see if there are any current configured settings.
 By clicking on any thing that is configured or has anything in tat column other than Not configured you can see what it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are using this Control Panel you can click on File at the top left and select Options seen in the image below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if nothing is configured at the present time if the bytes are not 0 zero in the Delete Files then something has made changes your user profile and these changes are&nbsp;maintained on each build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when you delete this file if you made changes like unchecking Fast Start and things like that you will have to reset manually. But it will not disable your computer and will remove anything that is not setup in a standard install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after deleting that file you will have to reboot to see the effects. then you can check if Defender is on or will stay on when you start it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has worked for me when on Updates in Settings had a row of red text saying my Organization was controlling Updates. Even though I do not have an Organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this can remove some setting that is hidden from you and moves from build to build.:)</p>

            <p>You can also use Task manager to find out all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Some of the tabs have other columns available to be displayed by clicking on one of the column heading you will see what is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Details Tab some times to make it easier for me to understand what I'm looking at and it shows mostly things that are running. If I want to make changes like Disabling it I use the PID to find&nbsp;it in the Processes tab to make the changes. While
 there I can see the Command line that starts it that can help in removal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On any of the columns you can click on them to organize things in&nbsp; an up or down set of info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On any Tab you can right click any of the rows of info and search online for information of what it is.</p>
<p>So if you see anything that is related to any of the old AV you have used you can see a description online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can go to the Processes tab and disable it or end it and see if it reactivates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you end a task that causes your system to crash it will reactivate when you reboot.</p>

            <p>As several folks from Microsoft Support had added entries into Group Policy, I thought this idea had a chance. &nbsp;I removed ALL changes and went to a vanilla group policy. &nbsp;Then did the 'clean' which found 370KB... so I thought we might be onto something.
 &nbsp;Rebooted, and the exact same situation pictured below...</p>

<h2>            Attachments converted to .DAT files in Outlook sent from a non-outlook user</h2>
                    <div>We have been having problems with some of the emails we receive from one particular person. Whenever he sends us an attachment (Word, PDF, Excel, etc file) when we receive it in Outlook it shows up as a #####.DAT file. If we check our email through
 Gmail the attachment shows up correctly. We have only had this problem with this specific person, and he has only had this specific problem with us. This is really cumbersome as we prefer to work with Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We use Outlook 2010, but it has also happened to one individual using Outlook 2007. (Windows 7)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The sender DOES NOT use Outlook. (I have seen many solutions to this problem IF the sender uses Outlook.)</div>

            <p>Once cause of attachments with that title is a misconfigured mailscanner, usually on a Sendmail server - it is interfering with TNEF attachments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gmail can decode TNEF (winmail.dat) so that part makes sense. The problem is that&nbsp;TNEF is only generated&nbsp;if
 the sender uses Outlook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if Mcafee does the same thing, but if its scanning incoming email, it could be. That could account for why it works online but not in outlook -only outlook has the corrupt dat file.

FIXED ON SAMSUNG GALAXY S2? <br />
&nbsp;<br />
I had the same problem with hundreds of duplicated emails in my outlook sent mail folder. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I use the native email app (which I prefer after trying many alternatives). I cleared the problem using the native email app on my phone.&nbsp;
 I deleted the outlook account [open app; settings; bin in top right corner; delete] then added it back selecting 'Manual Setup'.&nbsp; When the app then asks 'What type of account?' I selected 'Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync'.
<br />
<br />
The settings needed are as follows... <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Domain\user name: \[Your outlook email address]<br />
Password: [Your outlook password]<br />
Exchange Server: s.outlook.com<br />
Use Secure connection (SSL) [Tick yes]<br />
Use client certificate: [Leave blank]<br />
<br />
All your emails will be back in place on the phone within a few minutes once you have worked through a few more settings which are all ok at their default values.
<br />
<br />
I can now send emails from my Samsung with only one instance appearing in my outlook sent folder :)<br />
<br />
If I get any further problems I will report back.<br />
<br />
I got the Exchange ActiveSync settings from the following <br />

            Sorry, this did not work. I can not even get my email on the phone in the first place in order to have duplicated emails. I have tried the above steps countless times to no avail. Any other suggestions?

            <p>Over the equivalent of TWO days in a three day period I tried resolving this issue and failed. &nbsp;This was after earlier attempts which had driven me to ditch the use of S Planner. &nbsp;It was solved by creating an APP password at outlook.com and applying it in
 S Planner rather than my normal password. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Before carrying on, please be aware that my focus was on outlook calendar, but after resolving this the email worked as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main cause was the fact that I had two step verification setup and to by pass that, the "App Password" from Microsoft was required rather than my usual password. &nbsp;Go &nbsp;to:&nbsp;https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage. &nbsp;Look for "App Password" section. &nbsp;Create
 a new app password for use by Microsoft Exchange Activesync in S Planner.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This url explains it:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification</p>
<p>&nbsp;First in S Planner tap on menu, then calendar. &nbsp;I had deleted outlook calendar so I had to tap "Add account" and then "Microsoft Exchange Activesync".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If manually setting up activesync, try either m.outlook.com or s.outlook.com in the domain section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t my Hotmail password work in Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    I have used Microsoft Outlook for several years to access e-mails in my Hotmail account. However, since yesterday evening Outlook has been unable to access my Hotmail account, telling me my password was incorrect. As I couldn't remember my old password
 I changed it through the main MSN website, verifying my account as required. Nevertheless I still received the same error message in Outlook, with a similar error message in MSN Messenger (Error Code 80048821). Despite repeatedly resetting my password this
 evening, I have still encountered the same basic problem, namely being able to successfully sign in to the main MSN website but being unable to access my Hotmail account through Outlook due to my password being wrong. I have uninstalled MSN Messenger, uninstalled
 and re-installed the Connector, changed my password several times, and am now at the point where I have removed my Hotmail e-mail address from Outlook and am attempting to add it again. However upon repeated attempts I am blocked from completing that process
 as Outlook keeps asking me for the correct password, which I am inputting (I verified this several times by logging into Hotmail and my main Microsoft account online with the same password with no problem at all).&nbsp;
