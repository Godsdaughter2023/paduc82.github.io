<h2>            Windows 10 &#124; Help Restricting CD&#47;Floppy Access to Local Users &#124; Registry Keys &#124; Command Prompt &#40;Batch File&#41; &#124; Still Looking for Help</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, I need help finding the proper registry key to disable CD/Floppy Access for Locally Logged on Users under Security Options (Local Security Policies). I'm currently using the "reg add" command in a batch file, but I am unable to change
 the setting from "Not Defined." Any help finding a more specific key than (MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\AllocateCDRoms) that would work with the "reg add" command, and the parameters that would allow me to change the setting
 will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>These types of restrictions are usually applied with the Policy Editor (gpedit.msc). It is only available on the higher flavours of Windows 10. The downloadable

<p>Sorry, I'm kind of confused. I tried to use the path, but it doesn't seem to change the option from "Not defined." In my batch file, I executed the following command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>reg add&nbsp;<span>HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\RemovableStorageDevices\{53f5630d-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}!Deny_Read.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Adding the /v StorageDevices /t REG_DWORD /d 1 after also doesn't work. I'm not really sure why it's not working since I've been&nbsp;doing a similar thing for other Security Options and it works. But then again, I also don't fully understand
 this yet so feel free to let me know if I'm doing something completely wrong.</span></p>

<p>When you type&nbsp;<em>reg add /? </em>then you will see the correct syntax to be used for reg.exe. In your case it would be</p>
<p>
</p><p>reg add HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\RemovableStorageDevices\{53f5630d-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b} /v Deny_Read /t Reg_SZ /d 1<br />
</p>
<p>In Microsoft's notation, the exclamation mark serves as a delimiter between the registry key and the value name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said this, I admit that I was only partly successful in denying CD drive access on my machine. Using the Policy Editor with these settings did the trick:</p>

 on Windows 10 machines.<br />

<p>I'm so sorry. I should have made it more clear that it was the CD/Floppy Access under Local Security Policies.</p>
<p>I just haven't been able to change it to be Enabled. Thank you so much for the help though. I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>The method I gave you was an example, to be used to restrict access to optical drives. There are methods to block access to USB mass storage devices or floppy disks. You need to look for them with the local policy editor.</p>

<p>Your picture is now visible. You will find the "Removable Storage Access" Branch&nbsp; under the "System" branch. This is where you must apply the restrictions. To let them take effect you must reboot the machine.</p>

<p>It worked, thank you so much!&nbsp;However, is there also a way to specifically&nbsp;enable the "Restrict CD-ROM Access to Locally Logged-on Users" in Control Panel - Administrator Tools - Local Security Policies (the one in the image) through command prompt/batch?
 This is the setting I've been struggling to change. I just don't know why the registry key in the policies spreadsheet isn't working, but works fine for other policies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm so sorry if you have grown tired of responding. I'm relatively new to this&nbsp;and really appreciate the help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            New skype has created a second account which has no contacts and I can&#39;t access the contacts on my new computer&#33;</h2>
                    Could you help me with the new skype. It seems to have set up another skype account which I can only access with my Microsoft password. This new account does not have my contacts in it.&nbsp; And my old Skype password doesn't work. The skype with the contacts
 directs me only to the new microsft account. Can you help me to merge the two accounts as I only want one account and I want to have all the contacts.&nbsp;Thanks

<p>Thank you for replying!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already tried the two methods you suggested after having spent already several hours googling for info!</p>
<p>I tried signing in using Skype username and old password and it won't recognise the old password!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skype user name is the same for both the accounts I think and also the email.</p>
<p>When I tried setting it up on my surface it did say I have two accounts.</p>
<p>I also tried merging the skype account following the link but that doesn't seem to work either!</p>
<p>I only want one account, BUT I want all my contacts too!</p>
<p>So any further ideas?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Thanks Andra for your quick response. Not sure I can adequately answer each of each of your questions.&nbsp; Anyway, here's what I know:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Current web browsers:&nbsp; Google Chrome &amp; Microsoft Edge</p>
<p>2. I have tried both browsers on two home computers, plus the bank app on my Iphone</p>
<p>3. I just noticed it recently (about a week ago); however, I had not logged in to the app for several months prior. In any event, I did not have the problem the last time I logged in, which was probably August, 2017.</p>
<p>4. I am currently using Windows 10, Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.192)</p>
<p>5. I upgraded from (I believe) Windows 7 Home Basic.&nbsp; (Not sure if there is a way to determine this.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for any help you might be able to provide.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>Tried loading using MSN browser without success; that is, I am able to see the banks homepage asking for login ID and password.&nbsp; But I got the same error message after inputting my ID and password, and pressing continue.&nbsp; So, now I am wondering if it might
 be a security or scripting issue on the banks end.&nbsp; What do you think, or what would you suggest I do now?&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>

            This does indeed look like an issue on the banks website. You can contact them or try accessing the website from another device to isolate the problem,

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently ran into a problem because of a driver. i have run driver verifier, but it kept crashing before i could log in without telling me what the faulty driver is. the crash happens when playing video games or watching .gifs on the internet. The
 screen goes black, my pc has a seizure and sometimes it goes back to normal and sometimes it blue screens. anyway, here are my latest minidump files .&nbsp;</p>

            Hi ArturF789 from your mini-dump files, your video card driver is indicated, however the main culprit indicated is cbfs6.sys which is a Callback File System Driver from EldoS Corporation
<br />
<br />Are you using a virtual drive, to load game files, I think this driver is used in the creation of the virtual drive, so possibly upgrade that piece of software .  . .

            Since this happens during graphical related tasks, it would point to your graphics adapter. Are you using onboard graphics such as (Intel HD or a discrete graphics from AMD or nVidia)? 
<br />
<br />You might need to update your drivers to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

<h3> jeff lomax  say:</h3>
<h2>            ADS Tech Mini USB HDTV Tuner install fails</h2>
                    This USB TV Tuner is completely compatible with XP and Vista, but Windows 7 fails and says the device isn't compatible with "this platform".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Obviously "This Platform" is just Vista, and there is no reason for MS to try to force people to re-purchase everything.<br />
<br />
HOW do we get Windows 7 to just INSTALL THE DRIVER?<br />

            Hi Zidaan,
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 3 or 4 times, this can often fix this issue . . . 
<br />
<br />If that does not fix this issue: 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

<h2>            brand new surface book 2 reallyyyyyyy slow</h2>
                    <p>I got my&nbsp;surfacebook2 four months ago. during this last two months, my system got so slow. it's like really slow, I even have to wait ten sec for just opening up my computer. the slowing down happens occasionally, and it's getting slightly better when I
 detach the keyboard. the other problem is that every morning that I want to turn on my computer, it won't work so I have to detach the keyboard and then it would turn on. I tried to reset factory my device and it did not make it any better.&nbsp;I have to add that
 I do not have any heavy software or even gaming with it. I just use it for browsing and writing my&nbsp;thesis. I did not have such a problem with my surface pro3, even after 3 years of using regularly. I am really disappointed&nbsp;with this new device.</p>

<p>Hi farbodsalahi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your Surface device is running slow, we suggest that you run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. The diagnosis and repair takes about 15 minutes as it would check for both Windows and driver updates. It will automatically install
 any missing Windows update or driver and firmware update for your device<span>. </span>
<span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here&nbsp;</a></strong></span>to learn how to run the toolkit.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After running the toolkit, force shutdown your Surface to ensure that the updates are applied.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button until the screen turns off (about 10 seconds), then release the power button.</li><li><span><span><span>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Microsoft logo.</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I</span></span><span><span>f that doesn't work, use this shutdown process to make sure your Surface completely turns off.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Press and hold down the power button until your Surface restarts and you see the Windows logo screen (this takes about 20 seconds), then release the power button.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.

            <p>Try the appropriate number to reactivate Microsoft Office:</p>
<p>
<strong>Activate by using the telephone</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can telephone an Activation Center and activate your product with the help of a customer service representative.
</p><p><strong>Important </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Telephone contact numbers vary by license and country/region. In step 2 of the Activation Wizard, use the number provided to call the Microsoft Activation Center</strong>. Activation Center telephone numbers are not listed
 in this article because the correct number for you is based on several factors. Microsoft software can be obtained under various licenses, including individual retail licenses, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) licenses, and volume licenses, so it is important
 that you use the number indicated by the Activation Wizard. </p>
<p>Telephone activation might take longer than activation through the Internet. You should be at your computer when you call, and you should have your software Product Key available.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Activation Wizard, <strong>select the country/region where you reside and where you plan to use the product</strong>.</p>
<p>The wizard provides one or more telephone numbers appropriate for your selection. Use the number provided on your Activation Wizard screen to call the Microsoft Activation Center.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Call the Activation Center</strong>.</p>
<p>The customer service representative asks you for your installation ID (displayed on your screen) and other relevant information. After your installation ID is verified, you receive a confirmation ID.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Activation Wizard, <strong>type the confirmation ID</strong> in the spaces provided at the bottom of the screen, and then
<strong>press ENTER</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Telephone activation is not available for Trial and Subscription versions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks, have again uninstalled it and then reinstalled it and when I go in and it brings up activation wizard it says I have used the product key the maximum time so looks as though will have to purchase again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if 2010 version is the same as 2007 , or which version would I need to get with the ability to be able to use more than once!&nbsp; and where would I get these older versions.</p>

            <p>The activation wizard for Office 2007 should give you the option to call an activation center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2010 is probably in limited stock since it was succeeded by the latest version, Office 2013. You can still check reputable dealers where computers and hardware products are sold.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://amazon.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://amazon.co.uk</a> would be a good place to start to see if they still have any copies in stock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would still try reactivating your existing Office 2007 license. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the appropriate phone number listed here: Microsoft Activation Centers Worldwide Telephone Numbers:<br />

</p><p>If its a trial, then there is no use attempting phone activation since it has likely expired.</p>
<p>

<h3> chrisbreckenridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t stream video from Onedrive</h2>
                    
<p>Good morning everyone,</p>
<p>For the past week and a half I've been unable to stream any videos from OneDrive to my Xbox One. I can stream them on my PC in both the browser and windows 8 app. But no luck on the Xbox One. This feature was working previously. On the Xbox the app opens
 correctly, I can browse my folders, it even shows the movie files in the folder, but if I select one to watch, it switches to the screen that would normally begin playing, but I just get the spinning circle (as if it is buffering) but it never starts playing.
 I even changed the name of the folder from Videos to Movies, just to confirm that the app was actually syncing correctly and it recognized the change. I can open pictures with no problems at all, just the videos are acting up. I did contact customer support
 and after going through all the steps they said it looks like a problem at their end not mine. I'm just concerned because of the length of time. Being new to Xbox I'm not sure how long it normally takes for issues like this to be cleared up.</p>
<p>Is anyone else experiencing this or is just something up with my account?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help</p>

            Hi Lorrie. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.
<br />
<br />
I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files. These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent
 while performing the steps, so please report back as you go. <br />
<br />
If the mouse or keyboard won't work in Step 1 then skip to Step 2 because bootable media uses different drivers so that they always work.<br />
<br />
1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>. Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br />
<br />
2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> <br />
<br />
Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a> <br />
<br />
Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer. If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.
<br />
<br />
3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />
If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here:
<a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration.
<br />
<br />
4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:
 If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh:
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a> <br />
<br />
Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page. Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3,
 Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />
5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options. Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow, DISM, a full Disk Check, or
 return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC. <br />
<br />
6) Better yet do the vastly superior Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>. You can continue with the other steps there.
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

                    I have a Samsung laptop and had Samsung Easy Software Manager pre-installed along with Windows 7. I upgraded to Windows 10 recently and find the application being blocked. The application is necessary to manage power, network, graphics, display and sound

    <title>Nice idea, pity about the execution. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seb smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nice idea, pity about the execution.</h2>
                    
<p>Having just rebought Alpha Protocol to unlock my final achievements, it only reminded me how great and idea it was but how poorly executed the game was. So it dawned on my as the consumer we always like to think we know what would be best, so what games
 out there have you played which were great ideas but in the end sucked, also what would you have done differently. Please pick games that have only had one game and not&nbsp; saying something like "ME2, better make it like ME1".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpha Protocol -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Being a top soldier you should automatically be efficent with firearms, remove firearms stats and much like ME have different class where certain skills/weapons are only avaliable to them. This could be further introduced through an origin choice i.e did
 you join through the ranks weapon efficent, were you straight out of uni or inteliigence adept with hacking languages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Conversation system should have been more like ME2 where you have a better knowledge of what you character is going to say instead of smug, angry etc. Also the devs said it broke immersion a conversation stopping dead so you have pick what you want to
 say, though this may be true they can't play the realism card with russian, big breasted women walking around with M60's. Also have to ability to stop a conversation straight by killing the enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Remove the romances, guess what people don't constantly "fall in love". They felt forced an awkward in AP from the domminering enemy blonde, to nerdy woman who falls in love over comm chat. They did nothing for the narrative and felt like they were added
 solely to mimick ME.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Set it during the cold war, remove cliched movie characters. Make it gritty from breaking into another spies house and killing them in their sleep and dispoing of the body it doesn't have to be a Roger Moore Bond movie. Or even set it now and put on a
 Bourne, Bauer edge, there doesn't have to be on clear enemy just a fraction or threat. If you are on the run don't have fancy appartments set up everywhere, also make choices less black and white sometimes the good guys do die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Character needs to be agile Fisher style you needed to able to turn the tides of the combat quickly. Instead you spent the majority of the game waiting behind cover to hit a focus shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Less face/face time with the villans its unrealistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Better character customisation and a choice of VA. Its a role playing game and I hate the character from the off, the great things about Shep or Hawke is you can create your own. Thorton felt forced and was likeable, give people an option.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Set it in one large living city or several living cities, not small maps. Also allow the game to distinguish between civilian clothes and combat gear.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically I wanted a gritty, cold war RPG where to lines were blurred. Instead I got a poor cliched RPG which was really about nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpha Protocol -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Being a top soldier you should automatically be efficent with firearms, remove firearms stats and much like ME have different class where certain skills/weapons are only avaliable to them. This could be further introduced through an origin choice i.e did
 you join through the ranks weapon efficent, were you straight out of uni or inteliigence adept with hacking languages.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Conversation system should have been more like ME2 where you have a better knowledge of what you character is going to say instead of smug, angry etc. Also the devs said it broke immersion a conversation stopping dead so you have pick what you want to
 say, though this may be true they can't play the realism card with russian, big breasted women walking around with M60's. Also have to ability to stop a conversation straight by killing the enemy.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Remove the romances, guess what people don't constantly "fall in love". They felt forced an awkward in AP from the domminering enemy blonde, to nerdy woman who falls in love over comm chat. They did nothing for the narrative and felt like they were added
 solely to mimick ME.I idsagree with you o n this too. They added good moments to the game .
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Set it during the cold war, remove cliched movie characters. Make it gritty from breaking into another spies house and killing them in their sleep and dispoing of the body it doesn't have to be a Roger Moore Bond movie. Or even set it now and put on a
 Bourne, Bauer edge, there doesn't have to be on clear enemy just a fraction or threat. If you are on the run don't have fancy appartments set up everywhere, also make choices less black and white sometimes the good guys do die.<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
 Some gamers are so hard to please.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Character needs to be agile Fisher style you needed to able to turn the tides of the combat quickly. Instead you spent the majority of the game waiting behind cover to hit a focus shot.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Less face/face time with the villans its unrealistic. <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
All games are unsrealistic.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Better character customisation and a choice of VA. Its a role playing game and I hate the character from the off, the great things about Shep or Hawke is you can create your own. Thorton felt forced and was likeable, give people an option.<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I
 agree with you on this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Set it in one large living city or several living cities, not small maps. Also allow the game to distinguish between civilian clothes and combat gear.<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Bioware make almost the same with their games but nobody says s**** about
 it.<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically I wanted a gritty, cold war RPG where to lines were blurred. Instead I got a poor cliched RPG which was really about nothing.&nbsp;

<p>- I don't see this as a main attribute of RPG's, I see RPG's as role playing games where you make the descions for a character, choose how you interact with the world and how your choices unfold. With different classes etc. I don't see it as being unable
 to do anything untill you invest in points. He should have efficent in weaponary from the go they could have added different skills/abilities to level up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- As soon as you place firearms in the game its going to be an action RPG and not a turn based one. As such the character needs to be as intutive to respond to your actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The romances were linked to achievements and had nothing to be like being like Bond, Bourne or Bauer as all experience romances. To me it was forced an attempt to mimick bioware, they weren't need. As for playing like Bond the failed catergorically in
 capturing his essesence, as the did with Bourne and Bauer. The should have focused on making their own character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Some gamers are never happy is irrevelant, this topic isn't solely about Alpha Protocol, its about games you though were good ideas but were poorly made in your opinion, and also how you would improve it. Personally making a spy game, set it in the era
 when spying was at its highest level would have improved the game for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Of course games are unrealistic, but many unrealism are there strictly for gameplay reasons. For instance Chris Redfield will get bitten playing a zombie game, but in canon he is never bitten. &nbsp;There is unrealism for game mechanics, and there is unrealism
 breaking the suspension of belief, what I mentioned did this. The devs used realism when referring to their conversation system and other elements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Most bioware have cities etc, as do Bethesda games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- This isn't a hating thread just me acknowledging a great concept but poor execution and how I think it could improved. Also was wondering if people have had other idea for different games. (Don't know how to quote on new forums.

<div>'If you love stealth/action/C&amp;C games i highly recommend it. Obsidian did a great job. The game isn't mediocre like said the unfair reviews and haters impressions. If you take time to learn how the gunplay/weapons/skills/armor
 works in the game your understand that AP was well developed. This game is very different ; so don't expect it to be a simply TPS ; because it isn't. . The char isn't an expert like Sam Fisher when hacking/lockpicking/shooting; that's why you have a skill
 tree to develop/upgrade and made Mike Thornton an expert spy. AP is a game where you need think before act/shoot and that is why some gamers exaggerate about "flaws" in the gameplay . The game have some glitches but that are not a real deal to not enjoy the
 game. ME and RDR had worst glitches but the reviewers and gamers swallowed it. In fact , if you want to enjoy a game that isn't a clone and that is really different to others RPG/action games give a chance to AP and you will not regret it."</div>

<p>Just reiterate this isn't bashing Alpha Protocol, yes it was a unique idea this is just how it would have improved.</p>
<p>- You were meant to have the choice on how you wish to play the game. There for the option for stealth, aggresion should be there. Just like in other RPG's you don't have to play in a single mold. &nbsp;As I said as soon as the combat happens in real time, and
 you place a firearm in the gamers hands expect your game to become and action-rpg. Devs should realise how a game is oing to play out and not force gamers to play the way they want them to, notice how the Gears series adapted to suit the gamers style of playing.</p>
<p>- Of course I didn't read the devs comments post release, I bought game the date it launched for £40, completed was unsatisfied and moved on. &nbsp;In the build up the kept comparing it to Bourne, Bond and Bauer and its realism, and why the decided to incorporate
 certain mechanics. I didn't like the story and am stating how I tihnk it could have been improved.</p>
<p>- As I said I didn't like the conversation system, mainly because you had no real knowledge of how your character would reply only the tone and most of the time it didn't fit. I don't see why you keep mentioning Bioware it's irrelevant t the topic, personally
 I've only really like Mass Effect and Dragon Age of theirs. Though I enjoyed Dragon Age 2 I felt it was rushed, used repetetive enviroments, removed alot of freedom the gamer had in origin and didn't even give use the 10 years we were promised. I enjoyed it
 but Bioware forced a rushed product and it suffered because of it, I place most blame at EA's door.</p>
<p>- Like I said I've &nbsp;played and beat it ages ago, I am listing improvements I would have made. I enjoy stealth games like Splinter Cell, Metal Gear and Thief but the stealth mechanics in this game were flawed. Again this opinion just because you think its
 a good game doesn't make you a coniseur of RPG/Stealth games and me less so. Its all subjective.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 will not update nor allow access to email</h2>
                    <p>When I updated Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10, the computer booted into the 'backup' user name on the system. The name for administrator was Dave. The backup name was used a long time ago by a tech trying to fix an issue. It wasn't deleted.</p>
<p>I eventually figured out how to change the user and viola, I had all of my programs and the ones I checked, including my Microsoft Outlook email account worked. &nbsp;But Cortana wanted me to use a Microsoft email account and unfortunately I did. It erased my
 user name and administrator status, giving the new email name that privilege. &nbsp;Worse, I was unable to access my Microsoft Office Outlook email account, that I have been using since it came out so many years ago. This was Outlook 2010.
</p>
<p>As I explored options, I found that I could right click on the 'Microsoft outlook 2010' link in the start menu, run as administrator, and my email will open. When I left click on the program icon, it states that I do not have permission to access the email
 account. My original user name is nowhere to be found and more distressing is that in the windows update section, it says the there are windows updates and it is at 73 percent, with two updates, KB3074686 and KB3081704, 'waiting for install' but there is no
 link to click to install them. There are two other updates KB3081424 and KB3074678 waiting for download but no way to download them.
</p>
<p>After hours of trying to figure this out and no answers from Microsoft, I thought I'd revert back to Windows 7. Nope. Can't do that either. The message I get is that those files were removed from this machine.
</p>
<p>Dam it. Can anyone help?</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>I am running windows 7 64bit with 8gb ram and I am using calculix, which is a 32 bit program.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the calculations that are involved are rather memory intensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Is there a way to allocate more of the theoretically available 4gb that would be available for 32 bit program to the program itself? (Especially since the OS should, in theory, be able to run on the other 4gb) I remember
 that before windows 7 on the 32 bit os you could set a 3gb switch in the boot.ini file to up the limit somewhat, but don't know how that can be accomplished under the compatibility mode. I assume that no such flag exists in the 64 bit os as a whole as that
 would make no sense.</span></strong></p>

            Hi Linda.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Ensure you have the latest working Display driver.  Manually upgrade your display driver from: 
<br />
<br />1) the PC's Support Downloads webpage.  While there check also that you have the latest Chipset, BIOS, sound, network and other drivers by comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager.  
<br />
<br />2) AMD auto-detect:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>.
<br />
<br />You can also System Restore to before the driver update was attempted:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>I do not see where being on a Domain will affect the start menu not working, but I will post there anyway.&nbsp; I did finally give up and did a clean re-install, now the start menu and edge work but I still get the remote procedure call error on several other
 apps, like picture viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really surprised at the sheer number of posts regarding this problem from many other users and the fact the Microsoft has not released a fix yet.
