            <p>I don't see how this answer is helpful. &nbsp;The question is 100% valid if the tone is a bit antagonistic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I quote Sangeeta Sarkar "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can disable Cortana but you wont be able to remove it completely as it a part of Windows 10."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Having followed the steps outlined, Cortana is still running as a process. &nbsp;Therefore, the FIRST question HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Thus my question to Microsoft tech support: &nbsp;Why is Cortana still running after it has SUPPOSEDLY been disabled? &nbsp;You have written and ADVERTISED that Cortana
 can be turned off "completely". &nbsp;OR &nbsp;If Cortana itself is NOT running within the process labeled "Cortana", then why is it&nbsp;mislabeled? &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>It's my computer, with Microsoft's OS, but if Cortana cannot be turned off then there is quite a bit of false advertising circulated by Microsoft, OR perhaps
 the search functionality is ALL running under the heading of the "Cortana" process in which case the process is mislabeled.</span></span></span></p>

If you use EasyBCD, make sure it is set for 7.<br />
<br />
As long as you follow well and don't say anything like "nothing there can help" like before, your machine will be fine.<br />

<br />
<span>Go to \Windows\Minidump on it then copy the latest 5 files from there to the desktop.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Upload them to Sky Drive then give us a link to it.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Leave the hard drive in the other machine because if it is not a hardware issue, we will fix it like that from there.</span><br />
<br />
<span>You can also use EasyBCD on it to rewrite the MBR on the BCD Deployment tab.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Just make sure you select the correct partition first and use the XP radio button as well.</span><br />

Yes. Hire the services of a local repair shop and they will be able to set it well. Make sure they are reputable and as professionals, they will be able to handle the problem with ease.<br />

<h2>            &#33;&#47;3 of my memory is &#34;driver locked&#34;</h2>
                    My Windows 7 PC has been really slow for the past few weeks. &nbsp;Downloaded RAMMap and it says that almost 1 Gig of my 3 gig memory is "Driver Locked". &nbsp;Checked hardware, startup and ran through all Microsoft's Mr Fix It pages with no change.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have any other ideas on&nbsp;things&nbsp;to check? &nbsp;Strange, system s only using about 15% of CPU resources, but running at nearly 90% memory used.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks, Rick</div>

<h2>            Bliss Wallpaper Windows XP</h2>
                    <div>
I have a question about the default wallpaper for Windows XP called 'Bliss'. I've included the image below.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this the same default wallpaper regardless of where the computers are sold around the world or does it change? For example, in the Middle East or Africa do users still see this lush green field and blue sky with fluffy clouds? If so, I wonder what they
 make of it...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would be great to get comments from people in those parts of the world.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for the help!</div>

<p>Assuming you did not schedule a chkdsk to run on the next reboot of your system...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows starts it checks all volumes (hard drives) for consistency and if any volume is found to be "dirty" a chkdsk with error correction will run automatically on the volume to attempt to fix any problems before things get worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of time it takes for that to complete depends on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume, the speed of your system and what the chkdsk finds to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is best to not interrupt the chkdsk and to let it complete and that could take a long time...&nbsp; many to several hours.&nbsp; It will finish sooner or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A volume can be marked dirty from things like an aborted restart, improper shutdown, power interruption, using the reset or power button, battery pulling, etc.&nbsp; Have any of those events occurred?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can query the dirty bit on a volume from the command prompt window with Administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
Click the Start orb/button and in the box enter the following:<br />
<br />
cmd.exe<br />
<br />
Right click cmd.exe and choose to Run as Administrator:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=20382857-f809-49f2-8783-1488b77717f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed050d98-e946-4103-acd4-0cdafc9898f9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To query the dirty bit on drive C, in the Command Prompt window enter the following command:<br />
<br />
fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; query&nbsp; C:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f67c5518-76e1-4579-9c31-45983f113f09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd14ffe9-cbe0-4d5f-b4ff-553b413894f4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sample output should be one or the other of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C is NOT dirty<br />
<br />
You should check each of your volumes or each of your hard drives (C, D, E, etc.).</p>
<p><br />
Enter 'exit' to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a volume is dirty the only thing that can clear it is a chkdsk with error correction and you might need to run it more than one time.&nbsp; If the drive is failing, you might not ever be able to clear the dirty bit so chkdsk will always run on a restart.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the dirty bit will never clear you should consider replacing the drive but in the meantime you can tell Windows to NOT check the dirty bit on a volume by issuing a command like this example for the C drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkntfs &nbsp; /x&nbsp;&nbsp; c:</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would tell Windows to never check the dirty bit on volume C but that is risky behavior because if the dirty bit will not clear, something is wrong with that drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can undo that command and reset the automatic error checking back to the default value with this command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkntfs &nbsp; /d</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think will be a good overall write-up.&nbsp;It should apply as a buying guide for&nbsp;smaller sized cards as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which factor matters most to you?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Factors: </strong>Cost, Speed, Capacity</p>
<p>
</p><p>The higher the read / write the better in my opinion.</p>
<p>Go for a Class 10 (most good ones are)</p>
<p>The UHS Speed will vary on higher speed cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example of the cost of 3 similar cards weighing in on each factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Price: </strong>I bought the fastest 64GB&nbsp;card for the price at the time.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I have a feeling this will play 4K videos fine. I am not sure if it will&nbsp; record them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Update: see speed class chart below</em></p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>A couple Notes</strong>:&nbsp; Unrelated to performance </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I suggest using bit locker to encrypt the external card. This way sensitive information can be safeguarded if the tablet is lost or stolen. Or the card is removed without your knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you want to Use Hyper-V you are not able to use this storage for VHDs. So install as much as possible on the XSD and leave the main storage for the virtual machines.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you make a good decision. I wish I had bought the SHC in retrospect for 10 dollars more as the GO Pro I am buying shoots in 4K. I suspect the write times will factor in.</p>

<p>1. Are you trying to copy offline files from OneDrive?</p>

            <p>What is the advantage of cloud storage, if you have to clog your local drive with the same content?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onedrive (Microsoft) stored files should, accounting for bandwidth, be readily, continuously available. Especially for users paying to store files.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>It is only in Windows 8.1 that you see all files, available online and offline, in Explorer.</p>
<p>I marked my working folder with "make available offline" and have same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click properties of files and you can see Size on Disk, which is most probably 0 bytes, though it show as "available offline". That means set up, synchronisation is not complete. I hope that once set us is complete, files can be opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I search files and download directly as if it were somebody else's files, in zip to Downloads folder.</p>
<p>As I understand, the only way to best use OneDrive is to upgrade to Win 10 but in Win 10 OneDrive works differently. All files you need must be on hard drive, you select which folder to synchronise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you rent 1 TB space and have only 120 GB hard drive that is YOUR issue. Buy another hard drive or select which folders you really need.&nbsp;</p>

            When you cannot open Word, Excel files in OneDrive in Explorer (may be because setup is not complete), you can open them through Open File dialog of Word or Excel. I did it. But I could not open pdf files through Open File dialog of Adobe Reader.&nbsp;

                    Ok. I recently had an issue with a program called PAV ( Personal AntiVirus) I looked it up and found out it was a rogue program. It took me three days to get it off my computer. However, my computer is still running slow. My friend told me to download
 SpyHunter 3. It lists all viruses and stuff. If you don't buy it, it tells you were to go so you can still delete the stuff. Only problem is, I've gottent the files out of my registry editor and all. But it gives a long list of files in the Users\My Computer\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\Low
 I can't find this in my computer to remove the files it says. Please help!

            Hi Colin
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started. 
<br />

            Hi Colin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for headset problems so at least something will work.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by here to help:
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sounds Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected and Connected for both Playback and Recording Default Devices.
<br />
<br />If not again right click Volume icon in System Tray to choose Troubleshoot sound problems.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>The request deposit button is only available when you have at least 1,000 credits pending, but less than 5,000. It's just so you can have credits deposited before needing to have 5,000 credits pending first. Once you reach 5,000, they are automatically scheduled to be deposited by the following 15th or 30th of the month. So if you get to 5,000 between the 1st and 15th, they are deposited by the 30th. If you get to 5,000 between the 15th and 30th, they are deposited by the 15th of the next month.</p>

    <title>Multiple skype accounts linked to same email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xy uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple skype accounts linked to same email address</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have 2 skype profiles linked to one email address, such that when i log in I get pushed to one profile.&nbsp; &nbsp;When logged in with the first skype profile I can see the second profile in the directory, and indeed can send it messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that I cannot access the profile- and anyone looking for me to call me will find the inaccessible profile and when people call I never have access to those calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All i need is to delete the second profile but there appears no way to do this - anyone know how I can resolve this situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I express my regret to inform you that deleting the duplicate Skype account is not possible if you don't have access to it. As another alternative, you may want to advise your contacts to report that Skype account as Spam instead in order for our system
 to automatically block the account. You may also advise your contacts to use your Skype Name instead of using your email address. This is to make sure that they will be adding your active Skype account.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes you would be able to delete the 2nd Skype account which is connected to the email address. However, doing so will also close the Microsoft account that email is connected to. If you are using any Microsoft Services with that email address, I would recommend
 that you turn off the Discoverability of the 2nd Skype account instead of deleting it. This would prevent any data loss if you are still using the email address in other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive, Outlook.com or Office 365.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To close the Microsoft Account, you just have to sign in using the email address you want to close in this link and follow the prompts presented to you:&nbsp;
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative, you can turn off the Discoverability of the 2nd Skype account. This would disable&nbsp;the&nbsp;Skype account to be searched in Skype and add it as their contact. To do this, sign in to this link with the email address connected to the 2nd account:
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the Discoverability section, uncheck the two boxes which will indicate that the Skype account will appear on searches and suggestions. After unchecking the boxes, you are good to go.
</p>

<h2>            my window update won&#39;t stop updating&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I got this dell dimension E530 since a year and today I install the framework 4.0 (on microsoft website) and when I restart the window repair show up so I let it go then when it finally boot up there another window update and after this one the window repair
 show up again and it repeat itself again, again and again until i shutdown the computer.<br />
<br />
I try the following: <br />
• I try to update in the safe mode and safe mode with networking.<br />
• I try to reset to a point of saving.<br />
• I try to boot the system mechanic Drive medic: emergency rescue CD without success.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of the hardware have bug in the testing, however the test for the repair mode say with an error code 0x0.<br />
<br />
as my final solution is to reset to the manifacturer point (everything will be delete, reset and unrestoreable).<br />
<br />
please find another solution.<br />
<br />
OS: Vista Home Basic<br />
<br />
P.S. my computer work perfectly before I install the framework.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a recent window repair log checking i found something that might help my solution, "ntoskrnl.exe is corrupted".</p>
<p>I check around a little bit and I asume that another solution is to reinstall the OS with the install (insert OS here) CD, but the problem is I don't have this CD and I don't think i have the "Dell CD" thing that come with the computer when I got it.</p>
<p>My brother say I might get an free OS (like Linux) and to transfer in my computer, however i don't have any blank CD to put an OS on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so if anyone have a better idea let me know.</p>

<h2>            Something keeps turning Password Protected Sharing back on -- how to keep it turned off&#63;</h2>
                    I've got a new Win 8.1 computer (Surface Pro 3), and on that computer, as an adiministrator, I turn off Password Protected Sharing for my network (Control Panel -&gt; Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Advanced sharing settings -&gt; All networks). Once this is done,
 the other computers on the LAN have good access to the disks I have shared. However, when my new computer sleeps and wakes up, or even sometimes if I merely close the cover and open it, something has reset the password protected sharing option and turned it
 back on. The other computers no longer can access the shared data. I have to open up the control panel (as above) and turn password protected sharing off. Again. Many times a day.<br />
<br />
How do I get this option to stick the way I set it?

            <p>Hello,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As per the description, I understand that your password protection sharing gets automatically turn on.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to try the following method:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot the computer in a <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state and check the status. A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application service or startup item is causing this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to the following link for <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you restart the computer after Clean Boot I suggest you to re configure the sharing from our support article based on
<strong>Windows 8.1 Share files and folders</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the following link: </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/share-files-folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/share-files-folders</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please expand <strong>Share files over a home network or on a shared PC</strong> to do the sharing configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This issue can be caused even if you set the network adapter to sleep, and breaking the network connection of the shares. You may follow the steps below to change this setting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the list. </li><li>Now <strong>Right Click</strong> on your <strong>Network Adapter. </strong>Click on
<strong>Properties. </strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Power Management. </strong></li><li>Uncheck the box, <strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.
</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Apply/OK. </strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Thanks everybody :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that you need to say "join the domain", and the installer will say "OK, let's go on, you will join the domain later when the OS will be fully installed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, after this, surely you can continue without joining the domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was always good with MS is usability. Now even this sucks.</p>

<h2>            Windows phone companion cannot connect to my phone.</h2>
                    So I am trying to get videos off of my iPhone&nbsp;onto my computer, but when connecting my phone the window pops up trying to import my photos and videos on to my&nbsp;computer. However, it can't find my&nbsp;phone. Eventually, If I refresh it enough It will find my
 phone but as soon as try to import my videos I can only import maybe one video before it fails and loses connection to my phone. I've tried different USB&nbsp;ports I haven't&nbsp;tried a different&nbsp;cable because I don't have one.

<h2>            How to backup Windows 10 to separate internal hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">separate </span>internal hard drive several months ago while still using Windows 7.&nbsp; I had Win7 Backup and Restore set up to automatically backup key files every week using the program's scheduler.&nbsp; When
 I upgraded to Windows 10 today and tried to us the File History program in the Control Panel, it says that no drive was detected.&nbsp; My Windows instance is on one hard drive only for Windows 10 (partitioned to C and D drives).&nbsp; The other hard drive is completely
 separate (labeled as E drive) and currently contains my old Win7 backup files and some other music and video backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I use this second, separate drive to do my backup?&nbsp; I do not want to purchase yet another external hard drive just to do the backups...that's what this "E" drive is for!&nbsp; Please help.</p>

            Tom - such a simple request .... I've spent hours on this so far, why can't the Microsoft engineers (can I call them that considering how restricted Windows 10 really is) allow internal drives to be selected. Do I hate Windows 10? Time to change to a Mac.

            <p>I totally agree with the OP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is stupid not to be able to back up to another internal hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have for years maintained a separate internal drive to back up daily any changes to my documents and personal files. Some items I do not want sitting on the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't want the mess of keeping an external hard drive connected to my pc - which to be honest is way more risky than my internal which is SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always back up to an internal drive daily and the cloud (for non sensitive data) monthly and every few months an external hard drive. And for this reason I have never lost my files!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running a separate internal backup drive (it is a separate piece of hardware and partition) is an elegant solution - convenient and hassle free - only Win 10 wont allow me to do it - that is hopeless</p>

            <p>That is strange. I have File History set up to an extra internal drive on my Windows 8 system with no problem. You are using separate physical drives, not a separate partition on the drive containing your OS, and you have no Windows system folders (Documents,
 Pictures, etc.) assigned to this second drive?</p>

            <p>Yes it is a physically separate internal hard drive. Windows backup won't allow me to use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have resorted to using using a free program called AOMEI to do this task now. There seem to be some subtle difference between win 10 and 8. And even a clean install of 10 vs an upgrade. I am using a clean install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try assigning a different drive letter for the internal drive and checked if the issue persists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R to open the run command.</p>
<p>2. Type diskmgmt.msc and press enter to open disk management. </p>
<p>3. Right click on the internal drive and select "assign different drive letter and paths".</p>
<p>4. Click "change" and choose a different drive letter from the drop down list.</p>
<p>5. Save the changes and check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. </p>

            <p>Changing the drive letter of the second internal drive was one of the first things I tried after upgrading to Win10. &nbsp;It did no good. &nbsp;The primary issue is that the BACKUP feature in Win10 does not recognize the internal drive regardless of the drive letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to one of the previous posters, creating a separate partition on the drive that has Win10 installed does you no good if that drive crashes...which is what I'm trying to prevent against by using a different internal hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I had Win7, I could save an entire system image (docs, drivers, and all) without issue. &nbsp;But now, there is NO ONE stepping up from Microsoft to explain why we cannot backup to a second internal drive.</p>

            <p>Just to confirm. The above person is right. I tried this initially on drive h and I. Both are physically different hard disks from what I am trying to backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put you CANNOT backup to an internal hard drive even though it is a separate drive name and a separate &nbsp; physical hard disk. I need to explain I am a fully competent IT &nbsp;user with a masters in the subject and I have been using self build computers
 without issue since the days if Windows 98. I am not missing a simple trick here. It is just not currently allowed within win 10 and I believe this is in error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will just keep using a 3rd party software until someone catches onto this glitch.&nbsp;</p>
