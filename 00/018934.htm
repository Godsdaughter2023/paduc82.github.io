<h2>            Creating Events on Shared Calendar in New Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I'm no longer able to create an event on a calendar that is not my default calendar.&nbsp; With the new Outlook.com, I'm not given the option to select a calendar other than "My Calendar" when creating an event.&nbsp; How can I add events to a shared calendar in the
 new Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Dear Heather,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This looks, like a bug. I also had this option and it disappeared. I have tried different browsers, but it does not work.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you contact Outlook In-App support <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-get-outlook-com-support-f5482a98-616c-4d44-b7c5-8aaaadf5c11a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to...</a> so they could look at this problem. They can investigate this further as they have the means and tools and are able to check your account. Additionally, this may influence on their interest in this problem, so it may get fixed sooner.       
        </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Did the problem go away for everyone else?</p>
<p>I am still seeing the issue with "Microsoft Office 365 Business", &nbsp;connecting to Office 365 on Sharepoint.com.</p>
<p>My One Drive personal folders sync OK, but SharePoint sites don't, with the dreaded "Please enter your credentials", but no opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>Hi Colin,<br />
<br />
Have you tried Daizy’s suggestion to reboot your computer in 
this thread?<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Check the login account of your Office applications. Open an Office application like Word, click
<strong>File &gt; Account</strong>, then check the account under <strong>User Information</strong>. If it’s different from the one in OneDrive for Business, switch to the same account.<br />
2. Use the “Fix it” tool in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to remove the OneDrive for Business cache, then restart your computer.<br />
<strong>Warning</strong>: This tool can cause data loss. To reduce this risk, read this article in its entirety before you use this tool.<br />
3. By “One Drive personal folders sync OK”, do you mean your OneDrive for Business library or the personal OneDrive (with a Microsoft account)?<br />
4. The version of your OneDrive for Business. To find the version, open <strong>Task Manager</strong>, right click
<strong>Microsoft OneDrive for Business</strong> under <strong>Processes</strong> tab and select
<strong>Properties</strong>, then switch the tab to <strong>Details</strong>.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing Bian</p>

<h2>            Stuck on Windows 10 Build 10074, Can&#39;t Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm stuck on Windows 10 build 10074, and I can't update. I get error code &nbsp;(0x80080005) whenever I try.</p>
<p>Can anybody help?</p>
<p>I've posted this before, and was told to do a few methods, and none worked. People stopped replying on that one, so I &nbsp;made this one.</p>
<p>Here's a list of the things I've done:</p>
<p>1: Troubleshooting Windows Update, came up with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2:This fixit: "support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us" It said it found an error, but couldn't automatically fix it.</p>
<p>The problem was:</p>
<p>Service registration is missing or corrupt</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3:This:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ctl,Alt, Delete at the same time takes you to Task Manager, when it opens click on Services in the upper list, when it opens click on Description and it gives you an alphabetical list starting with "A" click again the list starts with "X" look down
 about half way on the screen and you will find Windows Update, Read the Status,&nbsp; right click and it brings up a menu, click on Start or Restart.&nbsp; Go to the top and get out.&nbsp; If you started in Update it should take you back there. When I clicked start, within
 a fraction of a second if switched back to stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4:This</p>
<p>Right click the Windows button and go to Command Prompt (Admin).</p>
<p>Type in net start msiserver and hit Enter.</p>
<p>Then x out of the screen and try Update again.</p>
<p>Didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, has anybody got some more methods?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try unhooking your internet....</p>
<p>The newer drivers will install later after you hook it back up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That&nbsp; should cause it to continue using the drivers from 10074 which seem to be working...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a significant problem with the graphics drivers, it may reappear after the installation is complete, and they get updated.</p>

<h2>            Is an upgrade from W7 to W10 a permanent one way trip&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have asked this a couple ways in a couple different threads and so far have not seen an answer so I thought I'd try again in my own thread. &nbsp;Gabe? &nbsp;Anyone in the know??</p>
<p>
</p><p>After being an insider since last year, I find Windows 10 acceptable enough that I might be willing to upgrade. &nbsp;But I have some reservations. &nbsp;I also hate one way streets so I have two related scenarios / questions.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I install W10TP as an upgrade install to a working Windows 7 Pro installation (yes, I do save images as backups). &nbsp;I then elect to remain IN &nbsp;the Insider Preview program after July. &nbsp;Is my Windows 7 license key still valid? &nbsp;Can I restore my original
 Windows 7 installation on another partition and run it side by side with Windows 10TP? &nbsp;I am the cautious type when it comes to Windows 10 and I would like to evaluate it on my main PC as if I had accepted the upgrade invitation but I DO NOT want to commit
 to keeping W10 permanently.... at least not yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;I accept the W10 upgrade invitation and upgrade my main Windows 7 installation to Windows 10 RTM. &nbsp;I then find one or more issues and decide I want to revert to Windows 7 by restoring my Windows 7 image to the Windows 10 partition. &nbsp;Is my license key
 still valid for Windows 7 or if not, can I switch it back to Windows 7? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no way to switch the license FROM Windows 10 BACK TO Windows 7 after RTM, then I am in no way ready to commit to Windows 10. &nbsp;I have been using TP since last year and while I find it acceptable in many ways (note that I did not say BETTER), none
 of my TP installations have been done as upgrades to my everyday systems. &nbsp;Who knows what subtle issues might surface. &nbsp;For example, one of my two desktops uses a USB dongle with alternate drivers loaded. &nbsp;Windows 10 keeps trying to install the official ones
 because I have no control over Windows Update. &nbsp;If this behavior continues after RTM, Windows 10 will not be acceptable on that machine. &nbsp;So far, it is still unclear exactly how Windows Update will function on the RTM version of W10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a perfect world, I would just buy a copy of W10. &nbsp;But at $199, that is more than I want to spend on Windows 10. &nbsp;When Windows 8 was released, MS offered testers a copy for about $30. &nbsp;That was reasonable for an OS I wasn't totally in love with and I bought
 a copy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, I will not even try to answer the question of the route back from W10 Final to the prior O/S.&nbsp; Hopefully Gabe will out soon with some confusing answers of this subject - just kidding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I think you are confusing issues in #1&nbsp; paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you opt to end Insiders on July 29th, then you are married to the W10 license just like the folk who were never Insiders and are going from qualifying W7 or W8.1 to W10.&nbsp; This consumes the prior&nbsp; license.&nbsp; You then need Gabe to answer if there is a buyer
 remorse route to get from W10 Final back to prior O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you read the Gabe June 22 release very carefully, Gabe will say that if you do nothing, you will just remain in Insiders and continue to get new Builds the same as you do now.&nbsp; The new Build will provide the activation for W1, just like it is now.&nbsp;
 In other words, you can get further down the trail with testing and seeing if W10 is for you.&nbsp; While using Insiders, you have not consumed your qualifying W7 or W8.1 license.&nbsp; Read this part carefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One can likely anticipate that Insiders will end sometime.&nbsp; You, as the holder of a qualifying W7 or W8.1 license can then go to W10&nbsp; Final or not.&nbsp; The remaining Insiders who will likely be XP, Vista or new built PC owners, will get free membership in the
 new Outsiders Club.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in small part and that you flush Gabe out.</p>

            <p>Look, you don't lose your Win7 license (or install disk/files, etc.) when you upgrade to Win10.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't come to your house and yank away your copy of Win7...;)&nbsp; The only "catch" is that you can only use one of the two OSes at any given time, legally.&nbsp;
 If you ever decide you can't live without Win7 then just pop in the DVD and boot to it and clean install Win7 with your key--and save Win10 for a rainy day.&nbsp; But, imo, Win10 is so much better than Win7 it's difficult to imagine why you might want to do that.&nbsp;
 Legally, it's an either/or proposition, seems to me--the Win7 license you own is only subsumed by the Win10 upgrade license when you install &amp; run Win10.&nbsp; Otherwise, your Win7 license remains valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you mean about the price of Win10...?&nbsp; It's free if you own a qualifying OS, and that's $39.99 less than Microsoft sold Win8 for at its introduction....also remember that the $39.99 price was only good for the first ~4 months of Win8 availability.&nbsp;
 I think you need to simply wait on RTM to see how things shake out--that's the proper time to make this sort of decision, imo...</p>

<p>No, of course I don't lose any physical media. &nbsp;But how certain are you that I don't lose my Windows 7 LICENSE KEY if I upgrade my Windows 7 install to Windows 10? &nbsp;It is my understanding that my W7 key gets converted to a W10 key (on my machine AND on the
 MS server) upon upgrading. &nbsp;That says to me that if I subsequently use a restored image of my pre-upgrade W7, it will deactivate because its license is no longer valid for that OS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The price of W10 is only free if I use up a license from a qualified W7 or W8 installation. &nbsp;If I don't want to do that (so I can for example continue to use W7 on my desktop until I am SURE that W10 is stable and compatible with all that I use it for) I
 need to purchase a copy of W10. &nbsp;At $199, that is danged pricey for an OS that can only be used on one PC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my initial post, I have been evaluating W10 all along with an eye to eventually using it as a daily driver, but I have yet to use it to upgrade one of my functional W7 installations. &nbsp;I am reluctant to do that because I don't want to inadvertently
 invalidate my W7 license. &nbsp;But unless I do that, I don't know for sure how it will act with all my many programs and tweeks. &nbsp;Hence the need to know if there is a path back to W7 if it all goes pear shaped. &nbsp;I am surprised that MS has not made any statements
 on this scenario since I assume it will be pretty common. &nbsp;Not that they want to admit it......</p>

            Simple. If you have Win 10 TP on a separate partition then keep it there keep your Win 7 partition &nbsp;and stay an Insider and keep getting insider build until you feel you're ready to switch. Then upgrade the Win 7 partition and as long as it's within the
 first year it will be a free upgrade.

            <p>It'll work like it did when I went from Win7 to Win8...I had to have Win7 installed &amp; activated to upgrade to Win8 initially...with my Win8.1 .iso I got my own key, IIRC.&nbsp; But it doesn't invalidate my Win7 license--as I know because I tried it on another
 machine I have at home...;)&nbsp; Still works.&nbsp; Win 8.1 still works, too.&nbsp; Looks to me as if the Win7 key will work for Win10 provided you aren't simultaneously trying to use it for a separate Win7
<em>installation at the same time.&nbsp; </em>Remember that Microsoft already sold you a Win7 license...they can't take it back as they'd be liable for damages, but the Win7 license can be
<em>subsumed</em> by the Win10 license...but <em>only</em> if you're <em>running a Win10 installation you activated with your Win7 installation/key</em>.&nbsp; IE, should you decide to revert to Win7 you'll have no problem...why should you? If you don't use that
 Win7 license to install Win10 then you aren't upgrading, are you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see what you're asking...but possessing an upgrade copy of Win10 doesn't automatically invalidate your Win7 license; and neither does using it to upgrade to Win10 if you decide to revert to Win7.&nbsp; Microsoft isn't going to stop you from doing that...no
 way...;)&nbsp; Why should they even try?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think Win10 is so much better than Win7 that very few would want to revert, and I think those folks who are worried about letting go of Win7 should set up a dual-boot scenario with Win10 until they are comfortable...you have a year to upgrade,
 and since you are in the Insider program you can take your time if it worries you and just stay in the program...that way you won't even have to use your Win7 key until you are sure you want to.</p>

<p>Nobody from Microsoft have confirmed that you DO NOT lose your key. The links provided by ms reps are to sites by NON MS personnel .&nbsp; MS wants (needs!) as many people as possible to use win 10, that is why reserve app is so misleading and has no 'NO - DONT
 SHOW ME THIS AGAIN' button.</p>
<p>I would wait and see for the next year. Win 10 , as it is, is not in a fit state to install on a working machine. Wait for the dust to settle - and the truth to come out instead of ambiguous twitter statements and links to non MS sites. Wait for something
 official !!!. Win 10 will probably not exist in 12 months - not in it's current form and model. - I urge severe caution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, nothing is FREE if it costs you a license you paid for.</p>

 because I have no control over Windows Update. &nbsp;If this behavior continues after RTM, Windows 10 will not be acceptable on that machine. &nbsp;So far, it is still unclear exactly how Windows Update will function on the RTM version of W10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a perfect world, I would just buy a copy of W10. &nbsp;But at $199, that is more than I want to spend on Windows 10. &nbsp;When Windows 8 was released, MS offered testers a copy for about $30. &nbsp;That was reasonable for an OS I wasn't totally in love with and I bought
 a copy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I am in exactly the same situation and cannot find any definitive answers either. I have seen already that someone reported having problems. In this instance the person removed his original Win 8.1 disc and installed the Preview on a substitute disc. At
 a later date when he removed the preview disc and replaced the original licensed copy of 8.1 he found that it could not be activated.</p>
<p>I've also read somewhere that the option to roll back the Win 10 upgrade to the previous version would only be available for 1 month after upgrade. All very confusing.</p>

<p><span>That,&nbsp;after the&nbsp;final release of Windows 10 on 29th July, and accepting the upgrade, then after installation&nbsp;he decides that,
 he does not like Windows 10 and wishes to return "<em><strong>permanently</strong></em>"&nbsp;to his previous operating system. Will he be allowed to downgrade or&nbsp;will Microsoft refuse to allow this, and be forced to remain with Windows 10?</span></p>

<p>Look, you don't lose your Win7 license (or install disk/files, etc.) when you upgrade to Win10.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't come to your house and yank away your copy of Win7...;)&nbsp; The only "catch" is that you can only use one of the two OSes at any given time, legally.&nbsp;
 If you ever decide you can't live without Win7 then just pop in the DVD and boot to it and clean install Win7 with your key--and save Win10 for a rainy day.&nbsp; But, imo, Win10 is so much better than Win7 it's difficult to imagine why you might want to do that.&nbsp;
 Legally, it's an either/or proposition, seems to me--the Win7 license you own is only subsumed by the Win10 upgrade license when you install &amp; run Win10.&nbsp; Otherwise, your Win7 license remains valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you mean about the price of Win10...?&nbsp; It's free if you own a qualifying OS, and that's $39.99 less than Microsoft sold Win8 for at its introduction....also remember that the $39.99 price was only good for the first ~4 months of Win8 availability.&nbsp;
 I think you need to simply wait on RTM to see how things shake out--that's the proper time to make this sort of decision, imo...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, of course I don't lose any physical media. &nbsp;But how certain are you that I don't lose my Windows 7 LICENSE KEY if I upgrade my Windows 7 install to Windows 10? &nbsp;It is my understanding that my W7 key gets converted to a W10 key (on my machine AND on the
 MS server) upon upgrading. &nbsp;That says to me that if I subsequently use a restored image of my pre-upgrade W7, it will deactivate because its license is no longer valid for that OS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The price of W10 is only free if I use up a license from a qualified W7 or W8 installation. &nbsp;If I don't want to do that (so I can for example continue to use W7 on my desktop until I am SURE that W10 is stable and compatible with all that I use it for) I
 need to purchase a copy of W10. &nbsp;At $199, that is danged pricey for an OS that can only be used on one PC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my initial post, I have been evaluating W10 all along with an eye to eventually using it as a daily driver, but I have yet to use it to upgrade one of my functional W7 installations. &nbsp;I am reluctant to do that because I don't want to inadvertently
 invalidate my W7 license. &nbsp;But unless I do that, I don't know for sure how it will act with all my many programs and tweeks. &nbsp;Hence the need to know if there is a path back to W7 if it all goes pear shaped. &nbsp;I am surprised that MS has not made any statements
 on this scenario since I assume it will be pretty common. &nbsp;Not that they want to admit it......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p>Nobody from Microsoft have confirmed that you DO NOT lose your key. The links provided by ms reps are to sites by NON MS personnel .&nbsp; MS wants (needs!) as many people as possible to use win 10, that is why reserve app is so misleading and has no 'NO - DONT
 SHOW ME THIS AGAIN' button.</p>
<p>I would wait and see for the next year. Win 10 , as it is, is not in a fit state to install on a working machine. Wait for the dust to settle - and the truth to come out instead of ambiguous twitter statements and links to non MS sites. Wait for something
 official !!!. Win 10 will probably not exist in 12 months - not in it's current form and model. - I urge severe caution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, nothing is FREE if it costs you a license you paid for.</p>

<h2>            Word crashes on exit</h2>
                    I've seen hundreds of people all reporting Word crashes upon closing, doesn't matter which verson of Windows. I've seen DOZENS of "fixes"; so many it's obviously just superstitious nonsense. Removing printer drivers; don't let HP be default printer; take
 out data key from registry; open in safe mode; disable add-ins; I've done it all (what are we supposed to do w/out a printer???) Posts say Word 2010 has same problem AND it crashes opening documents created in other versions of Office. This isn't an improvement,
 it's an expensive worsening of the trouble. Who is working to fix this? Microsoft is getting richer by the second and by now, FIVE YEARS later, they should be able to admit the bug and FIX the problem! Has anyone had any luck with anything NOT listed above?

            <p>This is a suggested answer to my own question, which is posted above. I cannot vouch for its accuracy, but I've been experimenting and logging the circumstances under which this occurs. Here's what I notice: Even with a quite powerful computer (Windows 7
 64 bit, Intel 3.16/3.17GHz dual processor, 8 RAM), Word takes an inordinate amount of time to save any document. If you attempt to close a file before your own save is complete, or while the auto-save is being executed, it will crash without having saved your
 most recent changes. I tend to be impatient and work very quickly to accomplish a lot of multitasking with several files simultaneously. Thus, I forget to wait, and it will crash. Consistently. What annoys me more than the absurd behavior of the program is
 the nonsensical "recovery" process it has obstinately retained: e.g. making us review "repairs" that are completely irrelevant [numbered styles is most common when there are no numbered styles in the document); the save-as, and then close procedure that's
 cumbersome at best; etc.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

                    <p>I'm setting up SMTP for outlook and office365 for my clients. But kept getting
<strong>535 5.7.3 Authentication unsuccessful</strong> errors, which are driving me mad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails are delivered with a background service built with Java, not an email app. When I'm trying with my office365 developer account or my outlook account, SMTP works well and I can send emails. But my clients always fail, end up in 535 5.7.3 errors.
 How could I debug this error? What exactly does it mean? Wrong username/password or some incorrect setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched and got quite a few web pages on this, but I'm more confused. Is there a document or something on the possible causes of this error? Is there any hidden restrictions on SMTP? Should I preferred the outlook REST API, and forget about the SMTP service?</p>

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, the settings now work for our last client, although I'm not sure how it's fixed. lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe our client made some change to his office365 account. I'm worried if a future client get this authentication unsuccessful error and yelling at us, we can't give him some helpful advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are building a Saas service and have little knowledge on a client's exchange/outlook account. We can't tell if it's simply a wrong password or some restriction on the account. All we get is a message like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; <span>535&nbsp;5.7.3 Authentication unsuccessful [<a href="http://sn4pr0501ca0127.namprd05.prod.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SN4PR0501CA0127.namprd05.prod.outlook.com</a>]</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We have seen such errors for several clients, so it's unlikely they all typed the wrong password. I know it can be tricky, the client may be on cloud or on-premise, but could we get
<span>a list of all possible causes for this error? Any guide on how to troubleshoot it?</span></p>

<p>Hi jopa66(2),<br />
<br />
<br />
There must be something in your Internet Explorer settings that is causing this kind of view when visiting the Microsoft Support website.<br />
<br />
We're there any recent changes made on your PC, specifically on your Internet Explorer, before this issue started to happen? If yes, what were those changes?<br />
<br />
Have you tried resetting your Internet Explorer settings? This will remove all the saved settings on your Internet Explorer to see if there are some settings that's hindering from opening the Microsoft Support page completely. Here's how to
<strong>reset the Internet Explorer settings</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong> dialog box. To do this, use the following methods:</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">1. Close all Internet Explorer and Explorer windows that are currently open.<br />
2. Start Internet Explorer.<br />
3. On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, tap or click <strong>Internet options</strong>. If you don't see the
<strong>Tools </strong>menu, press <strong>Alt</strong>.<br />
4. In the <strong>Internet Options </strong>window, tap or click the<strong> Advanced</strong> tab.<br />
5. Tap or click<strong> Reset</strong>.</p>
<br />
<p>2. In the <strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong>Reset</strong>.<br />
<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Select the Delete personal settings check box if you also want to remove browsing history, search providers, Accelerators, home pages, Tracking Protection, and ActiveX Filtering data.</em></p>
<p><br />
3. When Internet Explorer finishes applying the default settings, tap or click <strong>
Close</strong>, and then tap or click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Exit and then start Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you close all visible windows, but still get an error message when trying to reset, you might have processes running that are not visible. Restart Windows, start Internet Explorer, and try resetting again.<br />
</li><li>If you cannot start Internet Explorer, you can open the settings window by pressing
<strong>Windows</strong> Key + <strong>R</strong>, typing <strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong> in the
<strong>Run</strong> box, and then pressing<strong> Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Disclaimer: </em></strong><em>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Also re-enable the add-ons.</em><br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<h3> cherylb61  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel for Mac2011 version 14.7 - Re. freezing panes</h2>
                    How do I freeze a pane so that it scrolls down as I complete a worksheet? I have looked online and am told to go to View and then Freeze Pane - however freeze pane is not an option on my toolbar. I have limited need for excel and so would prefer to avoid
 upgrading. Looking forward to hearing from someone. Thank you in advance.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can send them one by one, or mark them all to&nbsp;send, or mark them all but delete those you dont want on the car memory. They go in alphabetical order, are assigned location numbers that correspond to that order, and you can select on screen in the usual

    <title>Cellular connectivity not improving after entering an area of good - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mkbenigma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cellular connectivity not improving after entering an area of good reception.</h2>
                    After the latest update, I have noticed cellular connectivity issues on my Nokia Lumia 900. After I go in an area of low reception (subway,&nbsp;elevator&nbsp;etc.) and move back to an area of good reception, I cannot regain connectivity unless I activate plane
 mode and de-activate it, or restart the phone. The connectivity issue is not limited to internet but also cellular calls and messages. This wasn't happening before the update.

            Hi Tim,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the past few days, I haven't noticed the problem cropping up again. I am still keeping a close eye out and will try reverting to a previous version (as you suggested). I will let you know if I face any more issues.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for the prompt response.

<h3> s mallett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product key for Visual Studio 2012</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Our company need a license and key for Visual Studio 2012 to be able to edit forms we’ve previously created with InfoPath. (Later versions of Visual Studio are incompatible.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Our Microsoft account manager sold us Visual Studio Professional with MSDN which comes
 with Software Assurance. She said that you can use earlier versions of the product with the Software Assurance.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So I installed VS 2015 and it is licenced through my email login - not with a product
 key. I have spent hours on the phone with Microsoft and still waiting for an answer as to how I use this to licence my Visual Studio 2012 trial version. They don't seem to know and neither does our Microsoft Account Manager? As you can imagine this is very
 frustrating.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So how do I get a product key to licence Visual Studio 2012? All links to purchase
 the product through the Microsoft websites, take you to the </span></span><span>Visual Studio Professional with MSDN product which we have purchased.</span></p>
<p><span>Please help.</span></p>

<p>hi mika,</p>
<p>could you first go to <strong>settings</strong> in the <strong>sharepoint admin center</strong> and check if the
<strong>custom script</strong> is set as below? if not, please enable the feature as the screenshot shows:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ff985bc7-8d59-4489-9675-9790c4346ed0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6e664da4-6777-4be3-a313-4f66de7672ba" /></a></p>
<p><br />
for reference: <br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-scripting-capabilities-on-or-off-1f2c515f-5d7e-448a-9fd7-835da935584f?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">turn scripting capabilities on or off</a></p>
<p>if this feature has been enabled, could you use the following methods to check if you have enabled<strong> sharepoint server publishing</strong> features?<br />
1. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enable-publishing-features-479677a6-8b33-4ac7-907d-071c1c7e4518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enable publishing features</a><br />
2. input the following url in the browsers to check if you will meet a similar error:<br />
https://<strong>contoso</strong>.sharepoint.com/sites/<strong>marrage</strong>/_layouts/15/savetmpl.aspx? (replace
<strong>contoso</strong>, <strong>marrage</strong> with your own contoso name and site name)
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a1729b26-f638-4bc5-9bd7-9b7169ff7758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd0be29d1-b7b9-449b-95de-b4aaf53eddc5" /></a></p>
<p>if you have enabled sharepoint server publishing feature, that’s the reason why you can’t see the “save document library as template” option. just as this kb article mentions, when the sharepoint server publishing feature is enabled,
<strong>save site as template</strong> option will not be available. may as workaround, you can refer to the app model to customize the provisioning process in sharepoint online to enable specific features as the article says:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2492356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2492356</a></p>
<p>meanwhile, if you just want to move the data in the library to another library, you can also use the following methods for a check:<br />
1. use <strong>open with explorer</strong> feature to move bulk folders and files from one document library to another.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-copy-or-move-library-files-by-using-open-with-explorer-c27bc6f3-7b38-4c29-b947-5d00c7153384?ctt=1&amp;correlationid=578d858b-9c34-43c8-b2a8-d1e5706d247f&amp;ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">video: copy or move library
 files by using open with explorer</a><br />
2. use <strong>content and structure feature</strong> to move the files.<br />
you can go to <strong>site settings</strong> &gt; under <strong>site administration &gt; content and structure</strong>, select the files in the library, and move to another library:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6bd69e28-1d9d-49f7-ba5f-662ad3b41505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7df2569c-608e-4e16-be05-f55be60c54da" /></a><br />
3. use onedrive for business sync app<br />
we can sync both the library 1 and library 2 to our computer and we will have two corresponding synced folders (folder 1 and folder 2) in the computer. and if we want to move files or folders in library 1 to library 2, we can cut the files or folders in folder
 1 and then paste them in folder 2.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
kerwin</p>

<h2>            Lost all of my contacts on my Samsung Jack</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 and using a Samsung Jack with Windows Mobile 6.5. I hooked my phone up to my computer a few hours ago to get a video off it and now it seems that Microsoft Active Sync has deleted almost all of my contacts except ones that I've recently
 added.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what happened. I just had the phone hooked up to my computer the other day to get pictures off it and everything was fine.<br />
<br />
This is all I can get out of the Windows 7 Active Sync program. <br />
<br />
"Your device cannot synchronize with the current Outlook profile on the desktop. This may be because a different profile was used to set up synchronization with your device, or because the profile is password-protected. Please open Outlook using the appropriat"<br />
<br />
I'm using the same user account and I have Microsoft Outlook 2007 installed and none of my contacts are showing up in the phone list like they were before.<br />
<br />
Please help, I have no way of getting my contacts back and no way of getting the phone numbers I had saved in outlook and on my phone.<br />
<br />

            I found a list of my numbers. <br />
I found the Outlook.pst file and opened it with outlook and it loaded a "personal contacts" tab with all of my contacts!<br />
Somehow outlook made a new database named Outlook1.pst. Yet again another reason for me to be angry towards Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Glad the Microsoft forums were such a help. NOT.

            That sounds like the same issue we had a few months ago. &nbsp;You can research the forum and you might come across the thread that discusses it. &nbsp;The problem was a missing file which could be copied from a successful x64 upgrade (must be Home, though). &nbsp;This
 time the problem may be different, but probably not. &nbsp;It was fixed in the next flight.

<h2>            unable to verify Outlook email address on LinkedIn profile</h2>
                    I am trying to add my Outlook email address to my LinkedIn profile. Every time I respond to the LinkedIn message to confirm the address, LinkedIn Support tells me the address has bounced and the problem is on the Microsoft side, not theirs.

    <title>Powershell command to get a list of delegates for Resources - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amyherold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powershell command to get a list of delegates for Resources</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, this seems like it should be a really easy answer but I cannot get the results I want. I want to run a powershell script that will loop through all of our Resources and list them and list which users are delegates for those resources. I also want to
 run a script that will go through the resources and show me who has full access permission.</p>
<p><br />
The Get-MailboxPermission -Identiy "resource" name will give me the FullAccess information however I would have to list them 1 by 1 which I can do as we maybe only have like 30-40 resources...but it would save time in the future if I could have a script saved.
</p>
<p><br />
And the Get-MailboxPermission is not giving me delegate information. I tried Get-MailboxFolderPermission and that is not working either.
</p>

<p>I tried this script but it errors (I am running from Exchange 2010 server Powershell prompt and connecting to our Office365 server. We are hybrid):</p>
<p>[Array]$resourcedelegates=$null<br />
$users = get-mailbox -ResultSize unlimited<br />
Foreach ($user in $users){<br />
$Delegates = (get-mailbox $user | Get-CalendarProcessing).resourcedelegates<br />
$i=0<br />
do {$Delegate=$Delegates[$i].Name<br />
$i++<br />
if($Delegate)<br />
{$resourcedelegates += New-Object Psobject -Property @{"UserName"=$user;"Delegate Name"=$Delegate}<br />
Write-host $User $Delegate}<br />
}Until ($Delegate -eq $Null)</p>
