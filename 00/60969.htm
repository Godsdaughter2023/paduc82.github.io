<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Right-click the speaker icon in the Notification area of the Taskbar &gt; Playback devices &gt; click on "Speakers" under the Playback tab &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; then remove the checkmark in front of "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device"
 &gt; OK</p>

<h2>            Activating Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    Hello.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've recently bought the Windows 8 Pro student upgrade pack from Microsoft stores hoping to install it in my new hybrid hard drive. I already have Windows Vista on my older hard drive but I've taken that hard drive out after downloading and burning Windows
 8 onto a DVD. I installed Windows 8 on the new hybrid hard drive and after installation, I noticed that it says "Product ID not available" in My Computer's Properties.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Noticing this, I went to control panel to activate my Windows 8 Pro but after entering the product in the Activate Windows section, my product key doesn't seem to work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do activate Windows 8 if that's the case? Do I need my previous hard drive that contains Vista plugged into the computer's 2nd partition or switch it with the one currently running Windows 8 Pro?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

Hello and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to install a full version of Windows 8 now by installing over the hard disk containing Vista. I also cloned the drive with Seagate's DiskWizard to make my hybrid hard drive containing my Windows 8 system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I noticed that when I enter device manager, the previous hard drive containing Vista is still listed with these properties: System, Boot, Page File, Active etc). I'm thinking of formatting this drive in order to use it as an additional partitition
 but the format option is disabled in device manager. What can I do to format it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: seems like&nbsp;I was wrong. When I entered the hybrid drive (the drive I cloned to) the Windows can't be activated (this copy of windows is used by another computer). Hmmm, should I use the ugprade disk and reinstall?</p>

Boot into Windows Vista and start the upgrade from there or try the following method:</p>

    <title>Windows 7 from Mac Mini via DVI-to_HDMI &#43; cat5 ethernet balun - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rpmm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 from Mac Mini via DVI-to_HDMI &#43; cat5 ethernet balun</h2>
                    I know my setup may be a bit crazy, but here is what I have:<br />
<br />
1. Intel Mac Mini running Windows 7 Enterprise on bootcamp<br />
2. DVI to HDMI cable connected to my Denon AVR 2310CI A/V receiver<br />
3. From Denon I have HDMI output connected to a cat5 ethernet balun<br />
4. The other end of the balun outputs HDMI to my TV<br />
<br />
Now, when I log in to the mac OS X on my mac mini, the display shows just fine. <br />
<br />
When I log in to Win7 I only see the display showing "Starting Windows" and then the display goes blank.
<br />
<br />
I connected the mac mini directly via the dvi-to-HDMI cable to the other HDMI port on my TV, all is well.
<br />
<br />
Is there something in Windows 7 (HDCP or some such restriction, maybe??) that is not allowing Windows to be displayed via the balun?
<br />
<br />
The fact that I see "Starting Windows" tells me that it may have something to do with Windows 7 after it boots, like some checks that are performed after the appropriate drivers are loaded?
<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.

            I tried connecting the mac mini directly to the balun and the display worked just fine.<br />
<br />
So it seems there is a problem with windows not understanding that the computer has been connected to the Denon AVR 2310CI.
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on what can be done next?

            One more crazy update. In trying to experiment with what may be going on, I tried pressing F8 at startup and I chose the option "low resolution mode". To my surprise, I did see the desktop ultimately. I was also able to log in, and just after logging in,
 the screen went blank. <br />
<br />
Not sure if this gives any more insight into what may be going on, but the fact that I was able to see the desktop momentarily tells me that there is something quite minor that needs to be tweaked somewhere, somehow to make it work.

            Another update. After the earlier experience with the low resolution startup, I have not been able to see even the "Starting Windows" screen.&nbsp;

<div>Its amazing that there is no documented cause and/or resolution of this type of issue.&nbsp;</div>

            Another update after talking with Denon Customer Support. They asked me to uninstall the graphics driver and see how it goes.<br />
<br />
So I went to remote desktop from another computer, and uninstalled the Intel 945 driver and as it was done removing the driver, my TV started showing the desktop! Granted, it was a low resolution version (perhaps 800x600 - standard VGA?) but it was the farthest
 I had been! <br />
<br />
The uninstall required me to restart and I did. After the restart I was able to see the screen in the same low res mode. I logged in and Windows detected new device and started installing the software. I needed a new restart. I did and the screen went blank
 again.<br />
<br />
So, I guess it is the Intel driver that may giving the problem. Anyone have any pointers on what can be done to get this going?<br />
<br />
Just fyi, I did get the latest driver from the intel site earlier and had installed the latest driver and that never showed the screen on the TV.

<br />
Thanks, Keith. I appreciate your input. <br />
<br />
I tried the Basic theme (removing Aero) and it did not help.<br />
<br />
I also could not change the screen refresh from the 60Hz that is currently set. <br />
<br />
I have yet to try the clean boot (wanted to leave it as the last resort). I will try it today and see what happens.
<br />
<br />
I got the latest drivers from Intel (maker of the chipset I currently have - 945M) for the graphics. I have not reached out to Apple for the drivers. I guess those drivers would be part of the Windows 7 Support Boot Camp update. I was aware of the fact that
 the update would be available by the end of the year but since I was able to install Windows 7 I thought there were no incompatibilities.
<br />
<br />
I will try finding someone with Win 7 laptop and HDMI output, to see if Boot Camp is the problem. I will also try the clean boot option and let you know if anything is different.
<br />
<br />
Thanks once again Keith, I appreciate it. <br />

            I tried clean booting and no difference. The problem seems to be that the picture is not taking up the whole screen and instead seems to be limited to a smaller box within the screen. Within that box, it looks like you cannot go more than 1280x960 (that
 is what I am able to get as resolution now). <br />
<br />
Any idea how I can make the picture display on the entire screen? (maybe that is the answer to the problem?)<br />

    <title>ntoskrnl.exe BSOD at least once a day - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ntoskrnl.exe BSOD at least once a day</h2>
                    <p>In the last months I am experiencing always more frequent Blue Screen of Deaths, all related to ntoskrnl.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This latest happened while printing from another computer to a printer connected to this pc:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd1f29a2-c485-402c-9d55-08df7594434f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This happened while uninstalling Malwarebytes with Revo Uninstaller:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5eef9eb6-df40-4836-9188-1f2269b1da4f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And several others happened in various occasions, all with the following crash address:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ntoskrnl.exe+4f1a0</p>
<p>
</p><p>And caused by the following drivers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ntoskrnl.exe (BAD_POOL_HEADER)</p>
<p>win32k.sys&nbsp;(BAD_POOL_HEADER)</p>
<p>WdFilter.sys (SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following three were caused while launching driver verifier:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dxgmms1.sys&nbsp;(SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION)</p>
<p>VerifierExt.sys&nbsp;(BAD_POOL_HEADER)</p>
<p>ntoskrnl.exe (KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried several things suggested in this and other forums, which seemed to have improved the situation, but really not solved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- totally removed avast (now I have windows defender)</p>
<p>- freed hard disk memory</p>
<p>- fixed registry problems</p>
<p>- run driver verify (but was only source of terrifying performance drop and new bluescreens)</p>
<p>- performed clean boot</p>
<p>- complete antivirus scan</p>
<p>- complete malware scan with Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please tell me if you need further information in order to help me solve this problem.</p>

            <p>I finally solved the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the crashes continued, I decided to do a fresh install. Result was nothing: still crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I discovered that <strong>the problem was the RAM</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 used RAM slots:</p>
<p>- 2x 512 MB original RAMs</p>
<p>- 1x 2 GB new RAM that I added</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was to remove the old RAMs and crashes stopped! Also I re-inserted one of the old RAMs and still no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think the problem was that windows didn't manage very well both the old RAMs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have to point out that I had performed RAM tests at least twice and no problems were found. Therefore I think that
<strong>the problem is not the RAM itself but the way it is managed</strong>: when it comes to switch between two RAMs everything is OK but with 3... no!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Thank you for help anyway!)</p>

            <p>Hi Bhavesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the information you have provided. Based on your issue description, the possible reason for this could be a corrupted file or program in your system. For us to isolate this, let us perform the following method below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the System File Checker</strong></p>
<p>This method will help us identify what's causing this error and troubleshoot it. For the steps, you may refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run the System Update Readiness tool</strong></p>
<p>Another possible reason why you might be experiencing this is an error within your computer's update. For us to be sure that it's not the update, let us perform this method. Kindly refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>for the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Perform a clean boot on your computer</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Clean Boot temporarily disables all third party applications as well as all Microsoft non-essential services so only basic drivers will run. This will help us find any third-party software
 which can be the cause of this issue. </em>Here is the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> william g balke  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get the Administrative shares to work 0n a windows 7 machine in awork group</h2>
                    I have tried it on 2 windows 7 professional 64 bit machines with identical user names and passwords in a workgroup administrator accts.<br />
I have edited the registry as follows <br />
<br />
<p><span>1) Open registry.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System</span></p>
<p><span>3) Add a new value DWORD ( 32 Bit or 64 Bit, depends on OS version), name it<b>LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy
</b>and give value 1. Restart the machine and check the share now. It must work.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I was unable to add a DWORD in 64 bit only a QWORD is offered in 64 bit so that is what I put in<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I have made the changes on both win 7 machines and I still get the access denied error when I attempt to log to a C$ share</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>the win 7 machines can see admin shares on XP macines in the same workgroup but can not map to each other nor can the XP machines map to them</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas<br />

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To set up Network Sharing between XP and Windows 7, please look over the following information. File and Printer Sharing is different in Windows 7 than from the setup in Windows XP.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) First, make sure the Workgroup name is the same on all of the computers in the network. On Windows 7, the default workgroup name is "WORKGROUP". On Windows XP, the default workgroup name on Windows XP home computers is "MSHOME". On all other versions
 of XP Professional, it is "WORKGROUP". </div>
<div>On Windows 7 computers, Go to Control Panel, then Network and Sharing Center:<br />
b) Network Discovery: ON<br />
c) Network set to: Private<br />
d) File Sharing is: On<br />
e) Public Folder Sharing: ON<br />
f) Password Protected: OFF</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you set up duplicate (the same) user accounts and passwords on All computers in your Network, you can turn Password Protected to ON. If you have the Password Protect set to On, you will be prompted for a user name and password every time you try to
 access a Windows 7 computer from a Windows XP computer. If you encounter difficulties accessing computers that are visible on the network map, make sure the computer being accessed has an account with the same name/password as the system connecting to it uses
 to login.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>File &amp; Print Sharing has to be enabled on any computer you wish to share files or printers from. You also need to actually share the resource in question, right click on the drive/printer/folder, and select sharing. In Windows 7, the Public Folder Sharing
 is the same as Windows XP's Shared Docs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If&nbsp; you are still having problems after setting up for File and Printer Sharing, then check to see if your Anti-Virus is enabled for File and Printer sharing on their firewall or make sure your rules or exceptions allow file and printer sharing.
<div>On the Windows XP computers, please verify the following:<br />
<div>a) Look at the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for information about having the Network Map display. On the Windows XP computer, you will need to install the software component that implement the Link Layer Topology Discovery protocol (LLTD)
 so the XP will show up in the network map on Windows 7. </div>
<div><br />
<strong>KB 922120 </strong>- Network Map in Windows 7 does not display computer that are running Windows XP<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922120</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Run the update on the Windows XP computer that you want to appear on the Network Map.<br />
On the Software Update Installation Wizard, click Next.<br />
On the License Agreement page, read the license agreement, click I Agree, and then click Next.<br />
On the final page of the wizard, click Finish.<br />
If you are prompted to do so, restart your computer.</div>
<div>To verify the LLTD Responder is installed and running:<br />
On a computer running Windows XP, click Start, click Control Panel, and then click Network Connections.<br />
Click Local Area Network Connection, click Properties, and then view the list of items used by the network connection.<br />
Ensure that the Link-Layer Topology Discovery Responder check box is selected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b) It is helpful to run the Home or Small Office Network File and Printer Sharing Wizard, even if it was setup prior to adding a Windows 7 computer to the network.
<br />
<div>i) In “My Network Places”: “Set up a Home or Small Office Network”</div>
<div><br />
ii) Go to Start, Accessories -&gt; Communications -&gt; Network Setup Wizard -&gt; Allow File and Printer Sharing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information on File and Printer sharing, look over the technet website:<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx</strong></a>
<div><br />
Please reply back and let us know if this helped with your sharing issues or if you still need further assistance.</div>
<div>Sincerely,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps,</div>

 an admin acct should make these shares available but access is denied<br />

<p>Hello, I've been trying to change the Microsoft account for this gamertag. I have tried to do this both on xbox.com and on my console. On Xbox.com I get a message saying "The email address associated with your Microsoft account can't be changed" and on Xbox
 it says "Sorry, we can't change your Microsoft account right now. For more info, go to Xbox.com/AccountSwap". Is there something wrong with my account? Will I be able to change the email address or am I stuck with my old one?</p>

<p>The web page to change the Microsoft Account has been broken for months. You must do that on the Xbox only.</p>
<p>What is the last part of the email address you wish to change to?</p>
<p>1) Is your new email at MSN, Hotmail or Live? If so, it's a Microsoft Account. (We used to call that the Windows Live ID) and you can change the Xbox account to use it now.</p>
<p>2) If not, please make your email into a Microsoft Account (which is free) at <a href="http://signup.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://signup.live.com</a> or create a new Hotmail or Live email there.</p>
<p>3) Once you have a Microsoft Account, using your old account, sign in at <a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.live.com</a></p>
<p>4) Go to Update email address and enter that new Microsoft Account email address, and save the change.</p>

<p>The last part of the email address is @hotmail.com, I enter my old email address and password on the Xbox where it asks, then the new email/password and signs me in. I then get to the part where it asks me "Do you want to change the Microsoft account associated
 with your Xbox LIVE profile?" which has the current ID, new ID, Microsoft points will be transferred to the new Microsoft account on the right hand side of the screen. I click "Yes, change" then it gives me the "Sorry, we can't change your Microsoft account
 right now. For more info, go to Xbox.com/AccountSwap" message and doesn't allow me to change it.</p>

<p>Same here, this is horse crap. The email address on my account literally doesn't exist anymore, it's just some stupid one I made like 7 years ago in highschool, and it needs to be changed. Only service in the world where you can't change your account info.

<p><span><strong>Hi TiaHayes,</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I see that many users have come across similar kind of issue you are experiencing and they have fixed it by disabling firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you disable the Antivirus\Firewall temporarily and then disabling firewall then try to install Java.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Please make sure that you enable the Antivirus\Firewall software after performing the test to keep your computer protected.</span></p>

<h2>            Computer will not wake up from sleep mode. Windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    I recently re-installed my OS for Windows 7 64 bit on my pc. My pc will not wake up from sleep mode properly. When I try move my mouse, press a &nbsp;button on my keyboard, the pc powers on like its going to wake up then shuts down completely after 2-3 seconds.
 Then I have to press the power button to start it up again. Each time, it gives me the windows did not shut down properly screen when it comes on again. I didn't have this issue before, but now I get it every time. I don't even put my pc to sleep mode anymore,
 I just shut it down now. I would like to be able to fix this problem. Any suggestions?

            My pc is not a big brand maker. It's a custom built water cooled pc that I built myself.
<br />
I updated all the drivers myself from each companies website. I re-installed the OS because my pc started hiccuping. I ran virus scan, restore points, and I though it was a corrupted DLL file. I troubleshooted the hardware and nothing. When I came to the SSD
 and HDD, I wasn't sure if it was my SSD, since some SSD have a failure rate and I thought my SDD was dying. I&nbsp;
<div>re-installed my OS the mechanical drive, and it was doing the same thing. So it couldn't have been my SSD or HDD. I tell my friend about my problem, and he later informs me that it was my 4 year old mouse short circuiting that was causing the hiccup. He
 had experience the same issue with 3 of his mouses a couple years ago from the same company my mouse was from.&nbsp;

            You are not alone with this problem. &nbsp;I have Dell Inspiron 15r N5110 and have been having the exact same problem. &nbsp;I was able to temporarily get rid of this problem by re-installing Windows 7 65-bit version, with service pack 1. &nbsp;During the process of
 installation my computer was able to sleep and wake up. &nbsp;However once I installed the Window's updates the sleep problem came back again. &nbsp;I had done a complete, back to factory settings, system restore. &nbsp;Obviously the problem is caused by an update. &nbsp;I am
 now deleting updates to try to remedy the problem. &nbsp;I think the problem is a software issue with one or more of the windows updates. &nbsp;It is likely that in the future Windows will create a Hotfix to address this problem. &nbsp;However at this moment, none of the
 Hotfixes fix my computer's sleep problem. &nbsp;I suggest that you try removing recent Windows updates if possible, and make sure they don't re-installed. &nbsp;Eventually you'll want the windows updates, but not until windows has fixed the issue with the software incompatibility.
<div><br />
<div>Best of luck with your problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just don't force shut down your computer too many times, it can really create a lot of problems.</div>

            I agree with you that the problem is most likely related to an update. &nbsp;My HP PC was working fine as a DVR via USB TV tuner, I would put it in sleep mode and Media Center would wake it a few minutes before the program to be recorded started. &nbsp;Media Center
 would finish recording the program and the PC would return to sleep according to the settings in Power Options. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Then one day I noticed that the PC was frozen - black screen on the monitor, PC power light was ON but there was no response to keyboard. &nbsp;Pressing the power on / off button on the PC forever did nothing. &nbsp;Turned PC off at power supply, then turned it
 back on again and got 'Resuming Windows' screen. &nbsp;Hung up a few seconds after that, but power on / off
<u>did</u>&nbsp;work now. &nbsp;Power on gave screen with option to delete the recovery data and do a normal boot, so I chose that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Did a lot of hunting for answer to the problem, in the meantime I found out hibernate worked OK so I used that. &nbsp;Finally went to the HP drivers / download page and found a BIOS update that said it was for a problem with sleep mode on PCs with MORE THAN
 4GB of RAM. &nbsp;I have exactly 4GB, so I had ignored that BIOS update in the past. &nbsp;Gave it a try and it solved the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Therefore, I do believe that something Microsoft changed in one of their updates caused the sleep mode freeze ups on my PC. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, Windows 8 had the same problem. &nbsp;BIOS update fixed it too.</div>

</p><p>I have had a problem for a few weeks now. I let my computer go to sleep then leave it for a day or night. I press the keyboard or press power and nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unplug the computer, press the power on, press the power on, plug the computer back in, then with your hand on top recite in your mind "okay, This Time It Will Work, then..." :) sorry got side swiped there, but yes I have had power issues since the last
 Windows upgrade...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May be not all the services that run Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) are enabled. I'd suggest you to strat from the begining and make sure the below dependency servies are enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><div>a. Click Start, Run, type <strong>services.msc </strong>and click OK.</div>
<div>b. To enable a service, find it in the right pane and double-click its entry.</div>
<div>
<p>c. Be sure its Startup Type is set to Automatic and click OK.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>All the following services must be thus configured in order to use ICS:</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Application Layer Gateway Service<br />
Network Connections<br />
Network Location Awareness (NLA)<br />
Plug And Play<br />
Remote Access Auto Connection Manager<br />
Remote Access Connection Manager<br />
Remote Procedure Call (RPC)<br />
Telephony</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>After verifying and/or configuring Automatic startup for each of these services, close the Services window and restart the computer before attempting again to enable ICS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            How to get your Call of Duty ELITE title and emblem instantly&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>If you haven't got these already. This will get you them in about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Log onto the CoD: Elite site.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline"> DELINK</span></strong></em></span>
your gamertag from the account.</p>
<p>Then <span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 1)"><em><strong>RELINK</strong></em></span> the gamertag to the account.</p>
<p>Go onto the xbox application for Elite and have a quick browse around career stats or whatever floats your boat.</p>
<p>Go online to the main menu on MW3. And go to your callsign.</p>
<p>Give it a few seconds and you will get the notification saying "NEW" beside your call sign.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

    <title>Unable To Login To OneDrive On Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable To Login To OneDrive On Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I can't log in my onedrive accounts, both my personal account and my school account.</p>
<p>I've tried reinstalling onedrive, resetting the Internet Explorer, restarting my computer, resetting the network, and reset winsock, but the problem remains.</p>
<p>The system is win10. Everything worked fine until I logged on to my account on a computer with win7. And now I can't log in win7, either.</p>
<p>Reinstalling system would be the last thing I want to do because I do have a lot of work in my computer.</p>
<p>Every help will be appreciated. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: When I use a new win10 account, onedrive works normally.</p>

<h2>            Windows activation blocked</h2>
                    <p>I put in a phone request to support over 3 hours ago. At that time was told wait time about 1 min.
</p>
<p>I just installed a new hard drive. The other died. Re-installed win10 from disk I made from ISO I was given by Microsoft in July last year. As part of insider program. Once installed and at desktop I signed in to my Microsoft account. But am not getting
 the activated message. Error says key is blocked. Since Microsoft can't bother to call. Can someone tell me how to get this fixed?</p>

            If you had Windows 10 installed and activated prior to installing the new hard drive, activation should be automatic.&nbsp; Why would you use an ISO that's a year and a half old?&nbsp; Where did the key come from?&nbsp; Use the

            <p>Try using your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key to activate. Microsoft did not give Insiders a free copy of Windows 10. The company said, if you want to maintain your activation you will either have to take advantage of the free upgrade from Windows 7
 or Windows 8 or purchase a Windows 10 license. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the same case for being a part of the Windows Insider Program now, you must have upgraded from a qualifying license (activated) or purchase a full license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option, you can try activation troubleshooter to see if it will resolve the problem.</p>

<p>The win 10 version I have installed is the retail version released on July 29 2015. The final build</p>
<p>that was also released publicly.</p>
<p>I was running an insider build (Windows10_InsiderPreview_x64_EN-US_10162) when windows update</p>
<p>automatically installed "Windows10Pro" on 7/30/2015 @ 9:48am. This was the final build. And the first</p>
<p>public release. Then after that I created an ISO of same using windows media creator. Then</p>
<p>burned it to DVD. Still have the ISO (as well as all the Insider builds) on a back up drive. That's how I know</p>
<p>the date and time of update.</p>
<p>And yes it was free at that time. Not just for insiders, but for everyone.</p>

            <p>The hard drive I had windows on was dead. Had a new blank SD&nbsp; drive installed. So had to boot and install from a DVD. As there was no OS installed. The only DVD I had was the original windows 10pro install. Did not do any other DVD burns after that.
</p>
<p>What's more confusing is that I'm signed in to my Microsoft account and it still has me listed as a member</p>
<p>of insider program since 5/2/2015. Yet it can't see that the installed version is what they installed on July 30</p>
<p>2015 by windows update.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you want to <strong>continue as a Windows Insider</strong> and keep getting preview builds after 7/29?</li><li>Or do you want to upgrade your Genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 system that has been getting Windows 10 Insider Preview builds to the 7/29 release and
<strong>stop</strong> being an Insider?
<p>
</p><p><strong>“I want to continue as a Windows Insider!”</strong> If you want to continue as a Windows Insider past 7/29 there is nothing you need to do. You’re already opted in and receiving builds in the Fast or Slow ring depending upon your selection. This
 is prerelease software and is activated with a prerelease key. Each individual build will expire after a time, but you’ll continue to receive new builds so by the time an older prerelease build expires you’ll have received a new one. Since we’re continuing
 the Windows Insider Program you’ll be able to continue receiving builds and those builds will continue to be activated under the terms of the Windows Insider Program. We provide ISOs for these builds for recovery from any significant problems, but they are
 still pre-release software. As part of the program we’ll upgrade Insiders to what is for all intents and purposes the same build as what other customers will get on 7/29, but that will be just another build for Insiders, and those who stay in the program will
 simply get the next build after as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>“I want to opt out of the Windows Insider Program on 7/29.”</strong> If you decide to opt-out of the program and upgrade to the 7/29 build you will be subject to exactly the same terms and conditions that govern
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/about?ocid=WIN10_0_WOL_Hero_Home_Windows-10_Null_01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 it will remain activated, but if not, you will be required to roll back to your previous OS version or acquire a new Windows 10 license. If you do not roll back or acquire a new license the build will eventually expire.</p>

            <p>Here's the email from Gabe Aul of the windows 10 public release. Which clearly states Windows 10 will be given FREE to those that are upgrading from 7 or 8. This includes insiders who had already upgraded through the preview builds.</p>
<p>If you wish I will gladly forward that email to you. It's still in my Outlook inbox. I am also going to upload the ISO that I received from Microsoft of the first public release. I received Windows 10 pro because I was running Windows 7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, this issue has been resolved by Microsoft techs. They said a major update occured in April 2016.
</p>
<p>Windows10_InsiderPreview_EnterpriseVL_x64_en-us_14295.1000". They gave me a link to download it. Haven't installed it yet though. They said the original key for 10Pro was removed and attached to the newer build. Said I shouldn't have any problems with activation
 once I install it.</p>

            I'm not a tech person. So all I can say is up to Nov 19 2016 I was using my Windows 10. And it was still updating and was still activated. Also, if there was to be a cost for me after 1 year. Then the Microsoft tech would not have given me a download link.
 Plus said after install should not have a problem with activation. If there were a cost after 1 year, I think he would of said so, since we're now well over a year.<br />

            <p>Reading your posts you reinstalled a build that had expired.</p>
<p>Use the Media Creation Tool and burn a new DVD.&nbsp; Install that and check if it is activated as it seems that your computer should be activated.&nbsp; This tool should give you 14393.xxx.</p>

<h2>            ROOT&#92;&#42;6TO4MP&#92;0002 and ROOT&#92;&#42;ISATAP&#92;0000</h2>
                    My laptop just decided to get very jumpy. typing lag, jerky cursor movement, very slow refreshes etc. When I run a systems scan it tells me I have issues with device drivers ROOT\*6TO4MP\0002 and ROOT\*ISATAP\0000. Can't locate these for updating in the
 windows downloads. What's a guy to do?

<p><span>Hello tlcbw,</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Ø</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since when are you having performance issues, issues on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Ø</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you remember making any changes to your computer prior to having the performance issues?</span></p>
<p><span>If the ISATAP adapter is the only issue that you have then this is not related to your slow performance. You can check out the below article that will give you information on
 this: </span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932520</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>For the performance issue you are having on your computer, here are a few steps that you can try.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>How to perform clean boot on the computer running Windows Vista</span></span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. After the computer starts, check if the issue is fixed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can isolate one service that is selected when the problem occurs, that service is the one that causes the problem. If you determine
 that a service is causing the problem</span><span> Normal startup mode following the steps under ‘<span>Reset the computer to start as usual’.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also suggest that you update the drivers for your Video card. You can check out the below article that will give you information on how to update drivers:

<p>I use Windows 10 Home Single Language in my Laptop and I have recently got the Licensed version installed in my Laptop.</p>
<p>But I'm facing an error in&nbsp;<strong>Settings </strong><strong>--&gt; Devices --&gt; Typing --&gt; Advanced keyboard Settings
</strong>saying <strong><em>Some settings are hidden or managed by the organization
</em></strong>and I have almost tried every single way out of it, even contacted Microsoft customer care but no solution.</p>
<p>Please fine one solution or is it that there isn't any solution to it or the solution itself is unknown.</p>
<p>Its really getting on my nerves as its been really long...n that's seriously too much of Wait Time.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>I tried all you said to, and from that i now know that my computer(Laptop Dell Inspiron 15 3543 Windows 10) is not a part of any Domain.</p>
<p>I currently am not using any third party Anti-Virus Software.</p>
<p>Yes, I have tried everything what you asked to plus some of the things were already tried by microsoft customer care before asking it here.</p>
<p>But i feel im not going to get any solution from the customer care, so if you can help me out with this then please do as im really frustrated because of it...its literally since months.</p>
