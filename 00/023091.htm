    <title>N-Series Spares &#40;Sim Gate&#41; Need to find a replacement&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N-Series Spares &#40;Sim Gate&#41; Need to find a replacement&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought an N80 from eBay that needed a replacement LCD which was nice and easy. The phone also needs a new sim gate/ holder which is impossible to find, and no one seems to know if any of the ones that are available on the market which include
 (6100/6610/6680/3200/7200/7210) will fit the N80<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help?...

            You shouldn't attempt any repairs like this yourself...<br />
<br />
If you've done the LCD replacement yourself, chances are you've voided the warranty (which was probably intact when you got it, as it remains with the phone and is irrelevant of the owner)<br />
<br />
I would suggest taking it to your nearest <a href="http://www.nokia.com/repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Service Centre</a> and see if they can help.

<p>Hi Colin, Hula, et all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Colin, I thought I might as well continue our 'discussion', re the FCU version number,&nbsp; here. Hope you don't mind. You said:</p>
 to the general public.&nbsp; This is one of the perks of the Insider Program.&nbsp; This time the new version is the FCU.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
 How else would that happen other than both branches be upgraded to a common build?&nbsp; That common build has to be numbered higher than the highest Skip Ahead Fast Ring build for that all to work.&nbsp; Therefore the FCU release build will greater than at least 16353
 or whatever the last Skippy build turns out to be and everyone will be upgraded to it."</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Well, if you are going to hold MS to what they once 'promised' to do...all I can say is LOL |--)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
But more seriously, I hope nobody, currently in the Skippy-Ring, is hoping that this will actually be the case. In other words, I doubt they will have that 'grace-full-opt-out-period'. I won't go into my reasoning (unless somebody expresses an interest |--),
 for it does not really matter any more (if I'm right |--), and given the state of the current 'Skippy'-Ring).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Anyway, yes, let's hope for a couple of new builds on Tuesday and thanks for posting those 'Current Canary' threads.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Regards,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Stephen</p>

<p>What I hope is happening is that someone at #windowsinsiders is following this thread and wakes up in time to the question that is on the back of both our minds; is the new code in the new RS4 builds irreconcilable with some code in the FCU release?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp;
 Almost certainly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the FCU build number is high enough anyone at a lower build number should be able to upgrade to it transparently.&nbsp; What should happen is that will produce a step-back effect for Skippers without requiring a clean reinstallation since upgrades in place
 replace Windows with new files.&nbsp; But this is a unique situation.&nbsp; The next Fast Ring flight after the FCU roll out will restore anything deleted at roll out so it should work.&nbsp; I hope it works that way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I don't care because I have absolutely nothing needed for personal use on any of my Insider devices, including the Release Preview devices so if a clean install is needed on any of them I am still OK.&nbsp; But you know as well as I do that a lot
 of Insiders have carelessly upgraded their primary devices to Insider previews and a lot of those haven't made backups. &nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;You know I see these folks who've gone to insider builds on their primary and sometimes only PC, didn't make backups, then post sad stories here. &nbsp;I tried to help one, and got accused of trying to be "holier than thou". &nbsp;I used to work with a guy whose
 favorite expression was "<em>nothing is so formidable as ignorance in action</em>". &nbsp;When I read the posts here, I often think about that.

<p>Oh, I am sure MS knows exactly what it is going to do, they just haven't made it that clear to us as yet. Perhaps they are thinking that it is obvious, and to me, as a software engineer, it is: There is no way you put code into production that reverts code
 that has never been in production! It would go against all that I know about the subject. But then, what do I know about it&nbsp;<span>|--).</span></p>

<p>Stephen, in response to your statement, <em>"...any Insider that doesn't know how/when to install an OS/make backups is not worthy to be an Insider...</em>", Microsoft develops software for the masses, not just for the elites.&nbsp; If the unwashed were not to
 be Insiders, MS would have made sure only those in the IT world would be invited to participate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, yes, I'm aware of Microsoft's advisory about using beta software.&nbsp; So are all the other millions of Insiders.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can log-in to OneDrive.com and on the left side select "devices". It will show one or more backups in progress, cancel it and proceed with a hard reset, and repeat process. Much better if SD card is removed before any resets.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This email account is several years old.&nbsp; It was an msn.com account, not hotmail.&nbsp; Several old contacts have emailed me that they are getting spam concerning russian women.&nbsp;&nbsp;I emailed them to not open the emails. &nbsp;I can't find any info on the msn website
 about their old email system, so I don't know how I can even get into it the old msn email acct.&nbsp;disable it.&nbsp;&nbsp; MSN no longer provides any live chat for this topic and I haven't found anything on their website about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily, many of the email addresses
 are no longer working, but some of them are active.&nbsp; I'd like delete the account and all the contacts ASAP.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; I am not very tech savvy (as you can probably see.)&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to freeze the data in my excel cell when a date passes.</p>
<p>Currently I have a function that checks which week we're in. According to that check it will run another formula to give a certain value.</p>
<p>If the week passes, the data in the cell is gone again (logic of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I would like to keep the data in the cell after passing the week. Only, how?</p>
<p>I'm using it in my planning sheet where I can track the current status of that issue, but I would also like to keep the status it was in from previous weeks as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formula used</p>
<p>=IF(AE8=CO40;IF(B42="";"";VLOOKUP(B42;'Jira Reported'!A:H;3;FALSE));"")</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi Bouden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing the sample Excel file to us and sorry for delay response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per our test, requirement you’re looking for is not possible using a formula. We guess that using VBA could meet your requirement and we request you post your query in Excel/ Microsoft Office Programming/ Office 365 Home to get a dedicated help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: When the comparing weeks are not equal, it should input the value used for False (which means, freeze the data as per requirement). Where it is not possible to freeze the data using formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chitrahaas</p>

<p>I am thrilled Tina, to receive a reply to my problem.</p>
<p>My fault, I should have mentioned the unmentionable&nbsp;word Macintosh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>A, &nbsp;2018, 27" iMac 38 ghz with 24 megs of Memory. &nbsp;Latest Mac IOS Mojave, 10.14.2. &nbsp;The same problem occurs with my&nbsp;2017 MacBookPro</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Word document of 698 KBs, keeps freezing. Occasionally it freezes with the document displayed but without me editing, after 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Compared to other Applications, all the Office, applications are much slower and difficult to close than others.</p>

<p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A moderator moved your question from the WIndows Word forum to the Mac Word forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are very few freezes and crashes in Word for Mac. It's been so long since someone posted a freeze issue in Word for Mac I'm a not exactly sure what troubleshooting steps will result in a quick fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start with a simple troubleshooting technique that sometimes fixes corruption in a Word document. This technique is called doing a "Maggie" after the woman who invented it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open your troubled document and then use File &gt; New Document to open a new document window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the troubled document, turn paragraph marks on by clicking this button on the Home tab of the Ribbon</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f44d28f0-423c-476a-a2fc-b1382a77d2d6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f44d28f0-423c-476a-a2fc-b1382a77d2d6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy everything except for the final paragraph mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then switch to the blank document and paste. Use File &gt; Save As and save the new document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quit Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now open the fresh document. Is it fixed?</p>

    <title>Dark Keyboard in Dark High Contrast on Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theivinpgh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dark Keyboard in Dark High Contrast on Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>I would love to switch back to a Windows Phone device, and woul dlikely get the Lumia 950.&nbsp; However, there's one major accessibility issue that seems to have been overlooked.&nbsp; When you are using a dark theme, with high contrast enabled, everything shows
 as white text on a black background, which is what I prefer and, honestly, need, in order to be able to use the device, being legally (not totally) blind.&nbsp; However, the keyboard is the one oddity here, as it is almost a solid white key.&nbsp; I believe the letters
 are shown, but they are almos timpossible for me to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here's the question.&nbsp; Is it possible to either have the keyboard look the same under high contrast as it does normally, with white letters and dark keys, or, even better, is it possible to have the keyboard, too, be white text, with black key backgrounds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really the one big thing that holds me back from jumping back to Windows Phone.&nbsp; The only other is having any kind of quick shortcut to invert colors, in order that apps that don't conform to the high contrast, white on black color scheme can still
 be used by inverting the colors, similar to how I can on iOS, with the triple-tap of the home button being the quick shortcut to switch this on and off, as necessary.</p>

 to uninstalling and re-installing again. &nbsp;However, now I can't find my podcasts on my actual phone. &nbsp;I've synced everything as per usual, it all works fine, but they don't appear in my podcast app list on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the desktop app I can see that they're on my phone; from Windows Explorer I can see that they're on my phone; but when I try to access them via my phone's podcast app - they're not there and I can't find them. &nbsp;I've tried everything I can think of
 - including resetting my phone back to factory settings, updating everything, re-syncing, even deleting the folder sources for my podcast and re-adding them again. &nbsp;It's like they're there (I can see them!) but my phone's podcast app seems oblivious to their
 existence! &nbsp;I've tried different podcast apps (I was using the original windows podcast app - because I only use the phone's music/podcasts like an MP3 player really!). &nbsp;I've tried putting them on the phone's memory as well as the SD card - I can move them
 about, delete them, reinstall them etc - it's just that on my phone - I can't find them to play them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the hell is wrong with it?! &nbsp;My music is transferring and playing fine (played via the xbox music app) but my podcasts, although transferred onto my phone, are just not listed. &nbsp;They're not even being tagged as music and appearing in the music files
 rather than podcastsf- I've checked! &nbsp;They're source and tagged correctly - the windows phone desktop app is finding them and syncing them - they appear to be there - but I have no way of accessing them from the phone - seriously, what is up with this?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me - I'm so frustrated now - and my head hurts!</p>

<p>hi stubee9720,</p>
<p>to better understand the current situation, i’d like to confirm the following information first:<br />
1. i have sent you a private message to collect the affected email account for further check. please access the message via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations<br />
2. which kind of permission do you have on these affected public folders? also, do all the users who have access to the public folders have the same issue?<br />
3. when did you notice this issue? did it just occur suddenly?<br />
4. what’s the detailed version of your outlook client? (in <strong>file</strong>&gt;
<strong>office account</strong>&gt; <strong>update options</strong>.) i’d like to check if we can reproduce the issue from our side.<br />
5. do you have many subfolders in these public folders? if so, could you try creating a brand new public folder with just few subfolders and test if the issue persists in it.<br />
6. are you using cached mode and select to<strong> download public folder favorites</strong> like the screenshot below? if yes, please temporarily untick it and check if there is any improvement.</p>

<h3> wbtym  say:</h3>
<h2>            Critical Error - forced log off in one minute</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The problem I'm having currently is that no matter how I start my computer (Windows 7 - 64 bit),&nbsp; I get the message that there is a critical error and I will be logged off within one minute. It happens within seconds of my desktop loading. It does this whether
 I start in safe mode or not. I have hit F8 and chosen for it to not automatically reboot when it crashes and I've tried the recommendation of creating a shortcut with the command of "shutdown -a" and immediately clicking that if the error window comes up.
 But neither of those have worked.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Earlier today I had some virus trouble. I got the "Live Security Platinum" virus but used Malware Bytes to get rid of that. There were just under 20 items that Malware Bytes found after I scanned - I deleted them all. I rebooted and scanned again and got
 a clean report. My firewall wouldn't turn back on though.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I found that my Windows Security Essentials wasn't working. So I uninstalled and redownloaded it. After a few failed attempts at updating because of network/connectivity issues, it finally did. Hours later (with the computer working fine), I began a quick
 scan of the computer. The scan was interrupted by the forced log off.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I should note that I was on a public network when the forced log offs began. <br />
<br />
&nbsp; I've read that it could be a shutdown trojan or simply a Windows update that I haven't addressed (which would be a coincidence!)<br />
<br />
Thank you to anybody who can provide information. I put this in the Security forum despite a possible solution being an update.
<br />
<br />

<p>The WDO update issue is odd, but we've seen many reports of this. I believe that WDO is booting the system and then not seeing its own definitions, but looks for them on your system drive or drive that it thinks is the system drive. It cannot update due
 to not having drivers for your network card.</p>
<p>You might try a different rescue scanner:</p>

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

<p><span>Unfortunately, these type of malware attacks are difficult to keep up with because they trick you into letting them install. They usually come from an infected
 web site, and usually through an advertisement. You get a pop-up from the infection and you click&nbsp;it to close the pop-up - which allows the infection to install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They can also be delivered in a "drive-by" fashion with no action needed by the user due to the system being unpatched, no matter what security software is running.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When you encounter one of these fake virus pop-ups while browsing, immediately do the following:<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">-Do not touch any browser window to close it or browse further</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>-Use the key combination &lt;ALT&gt;+&lt;F4&gt; to close all running programs, especially the web browser</span></p>
<p><span>--or--</span></p>
<p><span>-Immediately press Ctrl-Alt-Del and bring up Task Manager and forcibly end all instances of iexplore.exe, if using Internet Explorer, or the executable for
 your browser for any other web browser.<br />
--or--<br />
-Go to Start/Shut Down and restart the PC without touching any browser windows.<br />
-If you used task manager to close browser instances, reboot the machine.<br />
-Then go to Control Panel/Internet Options and delete all temporary Internet Files and cookies. If you are using an alternate web browser, open the browser settings to do the same - delete the local cached files and cookies.<br />
-Perform a full scan with MSE.<br />
<br />
The above steps should prevent the infection from taking hold.</span></p>
<p><span>Start here -
</span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</a></p>
<p><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.answerdesk.com/</a>)<span style="font-weight: bold">
 in the US at this time.</span> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This web site - <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com</a> -<span>&nbsp; </span>contains details for many of these common infections, often immediately after they began to appear in the wild, and instructions are provided for how to remove the infections using their malware removal
 guides. They also have forums where you can seek help from people who specialize in malware removal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides MSE, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:</p>
<p>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</p>
<p>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON<span>&nbsp;
</span>and not running with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible
 after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p>-<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many
 vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</span></p>
<p>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</p>
<p>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.</p>
<p>-Practice safe web browsing.</p>

<h2>            Create a contact with just a phone &#35;</h2>
                    How can I create a contact with just a phone #? I used to be able to do that with older versions of Skype. It seems the new version allows only public Skype contacts.

<p>I noticed that I can create a contact out of an existing conversion that consists of a phone # (i.e., I made a call to the person before hand). This is an awkward way to create a contact of someone you will invite to join a meeting. Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for clarity, the steps I took were:</p>
<p>1. Call someone with a phone #</p>
<p>2. Click on the conversion (i.e., the phone # on the left pane)</p>
<p>3. Click on the same phone # on the right pane (i.e., big characters show as title)</p>
<p>4. Select Add Contact on the popup</p>
<p>5. Dismiss popup</p>
<p>6. Now the phone # on the right pane (i.e., title) should show a pencil on the right</p>
<p>7. Click on the pencil to enter a name</p>
<p>8. The name should show up on the left pane now</p>
<p>9. Done</p>

            Hi Andy
<br />
<br />Where did you purchase Office 2016 Pro from, was that from the Microsoft website or some 3rd party seller?
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of the previous Office H&amp;S Installation:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Then install Office 2016 Pro again and see if that remains as your version of Office . . .

    <title>Excel 2016 Keeps on changing fonts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesparker2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Keeps on changing fonts</h2>
                    <p>This week when working in an excel file that I've worked in for months a weird font issue occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened one of my commonly used excel files and many of the cells that contain text suddenly changed font size and from bold to not bold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I change one of these affected cells to it's normal size, save the file, and reopen it can often open with the same small font problem.</p>
<p>Your Microsoft technicians have worked hard to find a solution. Five of them have tried to understand and fix the problem. They've sen it happen with their own eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's more. Over these past two days they've tried starting a new excel file and copy and paste the content from the affected file onto this new file.</p>
<p>It held until the next day then that new file had the same problem.</p>
<p>Oddly, it can fix itself on that new file temporarily and then develop the same small font problem again.</p>
<p>Oddly, not all text in all cells are affected. Many are, but some are not affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as I had two days to experience this problem myself and with your technicians:</p>
<p>The font problem has only been seen in excel files.</p>
<p>It is getting worse, in that many excel files open at the same time can contact this problem. I'm fairly sure about that, including an excel file that is totally unrelated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know the new file can fix itself temporarily and then go back to the problem.</p>
<p>It's unpredictable when the fonts will change. But they all change the same way. In other words, when the fonts change they always change to the same small font.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are important files I work every day.</p>
<p>Some excel files with the same work are unaffected, files I've backed up and I'm not working in show how the worksheets looked before this problem.</p>
<p>Thank You for your help.</p>

<p>When you first opened those infected Excel files and discovered the font issue, did you accidentally save the file when exiting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the issue did not occur with my first infected file when I had Excel already opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try changing the font back to its original font, saving and closing it, reopening it again and see if it reverts back to the "infected" font.</p>

    <title>How to Batch Print MSG to PDF with Attachments &#38; several helpful - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Batch Print MSG to PDF with Attachments &#38; several helpful options</h2>
                    
<p><b>Brief description on MS Outlook….</b></p>
<p>Email has become one the corporate process for communicating with one another. It helps in exchanging mails with each other. Despite there are number of varieties available to users, the market is clearly led by Microsoft products i.e., Mail, Outlook Express
 and mainly Outlook.</p>
<p>MS Outlook is one of the leading component of the Microsoft office package as it is one and only which is popular and at the same time it is marked as a versatile application. Microsoft Outlook can be used for managing daily tasks, scheduling business meetings
 and personal appointments, keeping notes as well as thousands of contacts. That’s the reason why MS Outlook is so widely held among the users. They have marked it as number one after trying their luck with alternative solutions.</p>
<p><b>What is MSG files? </b></p>
<p>MS Outlook helps in storing mails in two different file layouts i.e. MSG and PST. MSG stands for messages, which categorises particular email message whereas PST file stands for Personal Storage Table; it detect both emails and the attachments which are
 stored by one particular individual user. Another main difference is, files which are stored individually is marked as MSG files and files which are stored in group are marked as PST files.</p>
<p><b>What is PDF?</b></p>
<p>PDF refers to the Portable Document Format, has gained widespread popularity all over the world since its creation by Adobe Systems in the early 1990s, and is now used by a multitude of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>PDFs are also portable, meaning that PDF files exist separately from the operating system or hardware that a computer may use. This means that they can be viewed or converted on computers simultaneously all over the world. Importantly, because the software
 that is required to view PDFs is free and available to download online, they become accessible to a huge range of people from students to top business professionals. In addition, PDFs are also universal in their use and efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Ways for converting MSG files into PDF format manually…</b></p>
<p>There are two methods for converting MSG files into PDF:</p>
<p>First is manual method and second is third party tool, both ways are simple to convert MSG files to PDF but manual method is not successful for saving attachments from MSG to PDF and
<strong><a href="http://www.pcvare.com/msg-to-pdf-converter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">batch print MSG to PDF</a></strong> whereas the third party tool is perfect for complete, quick way to convert batch msg files to pdf with attachments.</p>
<p><b>Ways for converting MSG files to PDF by taking help of third party software.
</b></p>
<p>MSG to PDF Convertor helps to convert MSG mails to PDF so that mails are kept on the safer side. It’s not possible to take the mails all over the places that we go. Sometimes we need to give presentations through our mails so in that case we convert these
 mails into PDF as it is convenient to use and easy to understand. Therefore this software helps in conversion.</p>
<p>There are numerous features offered by MSG to PDF Cnverter. Some of them are discussed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>For converting MSG files into PDF, the foremost thing one should keep in mind while purchasing this software is systems should be installed with Adobe Acrobat. Without this our software will not work.
</li><li>This transformation of files will only be performed on the windows machineries. Windows like 10, 8.1, 8.0, 7, Vista, XP and many more.
</li><li>This software simply supports all the up-to-date MS Outlook editions. A user can convert MSG files from both 32 and 64 bit version.&nbsp;
</li><li>If there is a single MSG file to be converted into a PDF it will do but at the same time if there is a group of MSG files that needs to be converted, it will be done too.
</li><li>While converting these MSG files into PDF, user gets two possibilities listed with them to save the attachments that are there in the files.
</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Attachments Embedded in PDF files: In this the attachments gets save in the same PDF where the conversion takes place.
</li><li>Save Attachments in Different Folder: In this a different folder is setup for saving the attachments.
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Users have multiple choices in saving their file names so that it is convenient for them to search their files. For instance, date (YYYY-MM-DD) + from + subject, from + subject + date (DD-MM-YYYY) and so on. These were some of the options in which we can
 save our file’s name with where the conversion takes place attachments. </li></ul>
<p><b>Demo version’s benefit </b></p>
<p>Licensed version tool is a reasonably priced tool and doesn’t disturb the budget of its users but if you have any doubt regarding this tool then trying trial before buying is never a bad idea. Through this demo version users get to know about its working
 procedure and its graphical interface.</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 scrolling bounces - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimenaar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 scrolling bounces</h2>
                    <p>HI! I just bought Office 2016 for my also brand new Dell XPS 13 and started my FIRST spreadsheet on this computer only to come with the annoying and productivity affecting problem that both the vertical and horizontal scroll bar bounce back every couple
 of seconds. It´s not even a big database yet and this problem is already affecting my productivity. This happens with the trackpad but only on this program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel is really slow to load cells when scrolling both with the touch screen and trackpad. I can´t really afford to lose so much time waiting for it to response. How can I fix this? This is all just making me regret ever migrating from Apple and buying office.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing the same problem the OP was and I followed your instructions with no success.</p>
<p>The problem is indeed pretty annoying, specially if there are frozen cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you give further assistance on this?</p>
<p>I've tried running safe mode and the problem still exists, and I haven´t been able to find the ad-in that is causing this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only occurs when scrolling with the trackpad and my laptop it is also a DELL XPS 13.</p>

            How can I get in touch with&nbsp;Microsoft Sender Support Team?
<div><br />
<div>Email does not work as I have logged about 20 tickets and none has got back to me part from automated emails!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft is complaining that we are namespace mining, we sent only emails, nothing more and we can sent up to 2000+ emails a day to communicate to our 1500+ students.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can someone please advise how I can escalate this, as I am now on day five and no contact and are still blocked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kind Regards</div>
<div><br />
