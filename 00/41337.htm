<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might happen due to not updated Display drivers. I suggest you to follow　the below given methods.　</p>
<strong>
<p>Method 1:</p>
</strong>
<p>You may update the Display driver from Device Manager manually and check if this helps.</p>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>Press (Windows key + X) and click on "Device Manager".
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Expand "Display Adaptor".
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Right click on the video driver and select "Update Driver Software". Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<strong>
<p>Method 2:</p>
</strong>
<p>If there no updated drivers available on the computer manufacturer’s website, then try installing it in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. Follow these steps to
 install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</p>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <strong>‘Properties’</strong>.
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Click on the <strong>‘Compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box <strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart
 the computer and check if the issue persists.
<p>
</p></li></ul>

<p>Method 3:</p>
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>
<p>If issue persist, I suggest you to try the following steps to run DISM scan to check and restore system file corruption:　</p>
</span></span>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>Open command prompt by pressing Windows key + X and selecting 　　　　 "Command prompt admin".
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>In command prompt, type the following commands and press Enter 　　　　 after each command:
<p>
</p></li></span></span></span></ul>
<ol>
<strong><span><span>
<li>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</li></span></span></strong></ol><li><span><span><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></span></span>
<ul>
<span><span>
<li>Close the command prompt and restart the PC and check if it works.</li></span></span></ul></li>

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that your controller is not staying&nbsp;connected to the Xbox One X when you play and has even dropped connection while connected with a USB cable. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the console as the radio signal may need to be reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, lets <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hard reset and power cycle </a>your Xbox.</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button&nbsp;on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait&nbsp;5&nbsp;minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in</li><li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button&nbsp;on your console to turn on the Xbox One.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try that first and let us know the results.</p>

    <title>My keyboard is only typing numbers in certain instances. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jadedo  say:</h3>
<h2>            My keyboard is only typing numbers in certain instances.</h2>
                    <p>As the title suggests, I am having trouble. I am on a windows 10 tower pc. Whenever I try to type something in the start menu's search bar, it only types numbers. No matter what key I type, this always happens. I tried typing the word "keyboard" in there,
 and I get "12345678." Heck, I can try to type AAAAAAA and get 1234567. This also happens when trying to play flash games, Steam games, or even Minecraft. The difference is, I can hold ctrl or alt to play normally. Numlock isn't even on. I have tried a multitude
 of things to fix this. Such as, using a different keyboard, trying all of these keyboard combinations, for example, "ctrl + alt + numlock" and many others, checked to see if I have anti-keylogging software (I don't.), and tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 keyboard drivers. Nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this? It's driving me to my wits end.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Several possible reasons such as virus or malware, outdated keyboard driver, etc. can cause your keyboard to malfunction. We would like to know if you have made any recent changes to your device prior to this issue. If so, can you tell us what are those changes?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we suggest scanning your PC using Windows Defender. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17466/windows-defender-offline-help-protect-my-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to run Windows Defender. If there's no virus found, please update your keyboard driver.<br />
<br />
Kindly get back to us with the outcome.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't think there were any recent changes I made to it. I used to be able to play games on this no problem, but now It just doesn't work.</p>

    <title>Corrupted rendering of web pages with Edge and Chrome - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grass68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted rendering of web pages  with Edge and Chrome</h2>
                    <p>Experiencing problem with Edge and Chrome browsers at Win10. Both are rendering pages in unreadable manner (examples below - 2 screens).</p>
<p>No hardware changes. Problem came up couple weeks ago. First i identified that at Edge and now 2 days ago at Chrome.
</p>
<p>Everything else works at PC normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried:</p>
<p>- virus scan: no problems identified</p>
<p>- removing and reinstalling Chrome: no improvement</p>
<p>- installed Firefox: rendering normally (example below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can somebody point me to the right track as I am lost.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi &nbsp; CarlDavis87
<br />
<br />Select the Start  button, then Settings  &gt; Time &amp; language &gt; Region &amp; language.
<br />Select Add a language.
<br />
<br />Choose the language you want to use from the list, and then select Next. 
<br />
<br />Review any language features you want to set or install, and select Install. 
<br />
<br />Note: To switch the input language you're using in Windows 10, select the language abbreviation on the far right of the taskbar, and then select the language or input method you want to use. You can also press and hold the Windows logo key  and then repeatedly press the Spacebar to cycle through all your languages.

            Hi Carl
<br />
<br />When you receive a second hand PC your best option is to Reset Windows, this will be like a clean install, but you would not need the installation media. Choose to delete everything you will then get the opportunity to set the system language . .. 
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<div>If I acquired a used computer, no matter how I got it or who previously owned it--even if it was&nbsp; a relative or close friend--the first thing I would do with it would be to reinstall the operating system cleanly. You have no idea how the computer has been
 maintained,</div>
<div>what has been installed incorrectly, what is missing, what viruses andspyware there may be, etc. I wouldn't want to live with somebodyelse's mistakes and problems, possibility of kiddy p00rn, etc., and I wouldn't recommend that anyone else do so either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your choice of course, but in my view, you're playing with fire if you don't reinstall Windows cleanly.</div>

Sounds like a hardware issue. It's possible that <br />
your burner requires service or replacement.<br />

</p><p>You can't use the product key from the broken laptop on the new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No; you can not use it on another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the <strong>Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell</strong>, HP, Acer, etc) or is an OEM System Builders License, that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for

<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines) and OEM System Builders
<strong>License&nbsp;are tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Only Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>And Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want to install Windows 7 on your new laptop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check that the laptop manufacturer supports and supplies Windows 7 drivers for your new laptop model number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Microsoft no longer sells Windows 7.</p>
<p>Try amazon.com.</p>

<br />
<br />There is no real manual way to add your device to the list of devices on the Store - strange I know . .. 
<br />
<br />To add a device to your Microsoft Account, please follow the steps shown on this page:

<br />
<br />Sometimes, when adding a device it can take time for that device to be added, it will happen, but can take time, I don't understand why they just don't have an 'Add Device button . . .
<br />
<br />Try logging in and out of your Microsoft Account online from that device a few times, to see if you can prompt the device to be added straight away . . .

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After this step try installing the update and if you get an error and then try installing in Safe Mode</span></p>
<p><span>To enter into safe mode follow the steps below:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            System hangs on shutdown with eventual Blue Screen</h2>
                    
<p><span>original title: System hangs on shutdown with eventual BSOD</span></p>
<p><span>Office Version:Office 2007; </span><span>Operating System:Windows 7</span></p>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;I've had a series of problems that all seem to boil down to the system hanging on shutdown with a BSOD, every time.&nbsp; I have to force the shutdown if I don't wait 10-15 min waiting for the eventual BSOD.</div>
<div>I ran BlueScreenView for the multitude of BSOD log files and the&nbsp;offending files always seem to be ntoskrnl.exe and wdf01000.sys.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T410s so I don't have a Windows 7 separate disk.&nbsp; Not sure if that's an issue if these individual
 files have to be repaired or replaced.</div>
<div>I'm not sure this is related, but I'll set it out anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't install&nbsp;Outlook 2007 Business Contact Manager into my Outlook 2007.&nbsp; It stops with a message that says "setup&nbsp;failed to install"&nbsp;and directs me to a log file in my AppData file.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly,&nbsp;I
 wanted to uninstall my Blackberry desktop sync program.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried, but it tells me I don't have permission to access certain&nbsp;registry keys.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Thanks for any thoughts.</p>
</div>

<p>The minidump files show a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f) stop error that is being caused by the Apsx64.sys.</p>
<p>The error is similar to what is reported in the following link:</p>

<p>Do you have the program mentioned (Shockprf) installed, and if so, can you uninstall it and see if the issue resolves?</p>

            Okay, thanks auggy.&nbsp; This is a little weird as&nbsp;it appears I don't have a program called Shockprf on my computer and the file apsx64.sys does not reside on my computer.&nbsp; I have an indexing program called x1 that indexes all files and emails on my system.&nbsp;
 Neither the file "apsx64" nor any program or similar files like "shockprf" appear.&nbsp; Just out of curiosity, how is it possible for my "driver power state failure" to be caused by a file that doesn't exist on my system?

<p>The program may not be called "shockprf", it may be called something else. It would be a program from Lenova that would be related to the hard drive.</p>
<p>The apsx64.sys should be located in the C:\Windows\System32\drivers folder if you want to take another look.</p>
<p>Can you provide some more info on the computer?:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; type <em>msinfo32 </em>in the "Search programs and files" box and press "Enter" &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file<br />
<br />
Then make the resulting .nfo file&nbsp;available via Windows Live SkyDrive.</p>

<p>Woo, hooo.&nbsp; I found the apsx64.sys file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The properties of the file do not say what program it is assocaited with.&nbsp; How do I determine this?&nbsp; I have a hunch it might be related to the ThinkVantage Active Protection System which says it monitors my hard drive for an "shocks" and will stabalize or
 shut it down if there are any such "shocks."&nbsp; Should I try to remove that program?&nbsp; How?&nbsp; It's not listed, as such, in the Programs and Features list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I try to rename the apsx64.sys file something like "oldapsx64.sys" and see if I can shut down?&nbsp; Or is that a waste of time without removing the entire program?</p>

<p>As the .nfo file appears to be corrupted I could only open it&nbsp;with Notepad so couldn't get much information from it.</p>
<p>The ThinkVantage Active Protection does sound like the program in question.</p>
<p>Rather than renaming the apsx64.sys file it may be better to uninstall the ThinkVantage Active Protection program and see if that resolves the hang on shutdown problem.</p>
<p>Here's another link to similar problem on Vista&nbsp;32-bit system (driver is Apsx86.sys):</p>

<p>Uninstalling ThinkVantage Active Protection did work in that case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Edit:</p>
<p>There are instructions on uninstalling the program here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-67046#uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-67046#uninstall</a></p>
<p>Do you not have an entry for "ThinkVantage Active Protection System" in "Uninstall a program"?</p>

<p>Okay, I haven't lost my sense of humor.&nbsp; I unintalled the program and that took care of the problem.&nbsp; I shut down with no problems at all.&nbsp; However . . . . the very next day, after several successful and consecutive shutdowns without incident, another issue
 (I assume unrelated) arose that would not let me boot up!&nbsp; I didn't add or delete any other programs and did nothing unusual as far as this machine is concerned.&nbsp; I couldn't even boot up in safe mode.&nbsp; I kept getting a a BSOD that flashed so fast I couldn't
 read it, although I tried to a zillion times.&nbsp; But without being able to access the hard drive, I couldn't see the log file.</p>
<p>So, the bottom line was I tried to save some data using the ThinkVantage Recovery utilities and was able to do so, some was lost.&nbsp; Overall, it forced me to do what I probably should have done long before:&nbsp; reformat the drive and start anew.</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone's help.</p>

<p><em>I have</em> a new Lenovo flex 3 with windows 10. I set up my gmail and it worked great at first. After a few weeks it became painfully slow. Change download to "as items arrive" but that didn't do anything. Any help would be appreciated</p>

            <p><span>Hi Robert,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This seems to be some glitch, it will be fine. However, I suggest you to run app troubleshooter once for that matter.</span></p>

<h2>            Missing drivers in new Windows 7 installation</h2>
                    <p>Just installed a full version of Win7 Pro on "Bootcamp" on a MacBook Pro (late 2011 version, Intel i7 processor) and I have no internet capability, can't find networks that are there and functioning.</p>
<p>Missing drivers for Ethernet controller, Network controller, PCI simple commications controller, FaceTime HD camera (built in) and SM bus controller.</p>
<p>I am unable to find which drivers I need 'cause I can't ID the manufacturer of the items listed and I am not sure how to install them once I find them. I do have the original Win7 disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I boot to the Mac OS side I do have internet so it is not a hardware problem (?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance will be appreciated!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to enable the inbuilt admin account and try installing Corel Painter from there and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>You can </span></b><b><span>try to Enable Built-in Administrator Account</span></b><span>
<br />
First you’ll need to open a command prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and choosing “Run as administrator” (or use the Ctrl+Shift+Enter shortcut from the search box)<br />
Now type the following command:</span></p>
<p><span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You should see a message that the command completed successfully. Log out, and you’ll now see the Administrator account as a choice<br />
<br />
You’ll note that there’s no password for this account, so if you want to leave it enabled you should change the password.<br />
<br />
Let us know the status inorder to assist you better.</span></p>

<h2>            Update Failed - Error Code C1900204 &#42;FIXED</h2>
                    <p><strong>EDIT: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">THIS IS NOW SOLVED, CHECK MY POST BELOW FOR THE CAUSE AND SOLUTION</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So the time is currently 3 AM and I've tried installing Windows 10 for the 4th time. It all started when my friend sent me a text message that he Windows 10 was setting up for him. I immediately sought out to see why I was never prompted to install it (we
 live in the same State/Time Zone). It said I was eligible for the upgrade and that it was reserved, but still nothing about it being ready to be downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my PC and long-behold, it was downloading! It was fairly quick and took about 15 minutes. After it was complete, it suddenly said that the update failed and gave me an error code of&nbsp;<strong>C1900204</strong>. I was upset by this and started searching
 around, and no luck what-so-ever. I went ahead and tried to re-install it, and it downloaded fine, but once again came up with that error. I restarted my PC and tried again, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began to think that maybe one of my system files was corrupt and so I went ahead and started to scan the system files via CMD&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>. After it ran through, luckily with
<strong>no </strong>errors found, I tried to install it once more. Once again, it failed with the same error!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why this is occurring. Also, here is a picture of my System. I blurred out the Computer name and product ID due to safety concerns.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for showing interest in installing Windows 10</p>

            <p>I've been trying to update to Windows 10 since I started getting the ready to install popup on the 29th of July. At least 2 dozen attempts later I'm still sitting here going nowhere.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; This is a&nbsp; new Asus laptop (a month old) running Windows 8.1 64 bit, with SSD and HDD.&nbsp; The OS is on the SSD.&nbsp; I've done as instructed in the above FIX.&nbsp; I've also deleted ALL of my AV and anti malware programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've returned the program file paths
 back to the C Drive (SSD) .&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb169f95-9189-4eb6-baa2-eacb0f639c63" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the updater again...and again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep getting this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5bf4c1d-5f74-466b-a882-d852535a9306" /></p>
<p>I've checked my SSD to see if there is enough space. &nbsp; It looks fine to me.&nbsp; It only holds the OS and&nbsp; Arma 3.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/45d92812-2cb8-4a66-9adc-c4cb15acb8d7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've tried to do it via the upload tool.&nbsp; (saved to a USB drive).&nbsp; When I get to the "Choose what to keep", it won't allow me to choose Keep personal files and apps.&nbsp; I only have the NOTHING setting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I DO NOT want to clean install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/386027a9-cfd2-48ca-8754-cf0d5e618ff2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It says, "You can't keep Windows settings, personal files, and apps because your current version of Windosw might be installed in an unsupported directory."&nbsp;&nbsp; What does that mean???&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'm ready to give up on Windows 10.&nbsp; If there isn't a solution...at least post how I can stop the pop ups and auto update attempts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thing is going to cost me a fortune in download fees.&nbsp; <br />

                    <p>Windows 10, Mcafee Firewall, Ethernet Broadband, Dell XPS User trying to use Win10 Hotspot for Ipad and Iphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have setup the win10 hotspot through settings, found it with my iphone and connected with my password but the iphone connection reads in red "no internet access."&nbsp; Tried following the Mcafee firewall instructions using my ipaddress and that did not help.&nbsp;
 I have read 20 solutions online and followed many steps and none help and most want to reverse the issue to connecting to the iphone/verizon cellular hotspot...which has always worked so easily for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, only offer a simple, tested solution to this very very specific question if your past situation matches my description in the subject line.&nbsp; I am not being rude, only trying to surface a problem statement that should have a very succinct solution
 given thousands of people must have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, I have ethernet running direct broadband between my modem and Dell/Win10/Mcafee and want to avoid the $5.00 monthly fee to turn the wireless on in my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

 (indicated by the locked lock icon) but again in red reads "No Internet Connection."&nbsp; Clicking IPhone info, the suggestion was to reboot my modem, which I did and then reboot my pc (because doing that 3 times fast in the 90s worked magic) but to no avail.</span></li></ul>

 sounds to superuserish to me.&nbsp; However, my windows defender firewall is off and mcafee firewall is on...to complete the scenario.&nbsp;

            <p>So as it turns out, I finally called the my broadband&nbsp;and modem company and had the wireless turned on.&nbsp; However, the tech and I were troubleshooting for over an our to figure out that for some reason the modem box was "bridging" by default on each startup
 which he thinks caused the problem.&nbsp; It runs now but only with their wireless.&nbsp; Thanks for all the suggestions.</p>

                    <p>I am trying to delete an application in windows 10 from my desktop, but when I try to delete it, a notification comes up saying, “You’ll need to provide administrator permission to delete this file” After I hit Continue, I get another pop up that says, “You’ll
 need permissiol from [My account, the only one on the computer] to make changes to this file” I need to give myself permission to delete the file, but it doesn’t give me a way to do that. Is there a way I can fix this?</p>

                    Why does microsoft have to compare devices with apple? I mean others dont compare to show that theirs are the best device. If microsoft knows it is best they should keep it to themselves without bragging about it.&nbsp;

            <p>Both Apple and Microsoft have had rivalries since the 1970s.&nbsp; Both are the only companies that now make the hardware and the operating system/software used on them.&nbsp; The other companies only make the hardware and install somebody else operating system/software
 onto them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the coming years, there may be a third.&nbsp; Canonical (makers of Ubuntu) have been working on making their version of Linux into a robust, commercial grade product.&nbsp; They have a ways to go but when they get it finished, probably expect hardware to be built
 just for it, by them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everybody has their favorite and in today's world, a lot of people have all three systems.&nbsp; I run all three myself.&nbsp; The great thing about it is that you have a choice to work with and work with it the way you want to.</p>

            Yes, I knew that but, does apple or android cmpare their devices with other products? No they don't. They will just make a statement their product is the best. Why can't microsoft do the same? I mean they make the best Desktop OS right? When you advertise
 some thing you can promote your product by telling their specifications and comparing it with an anonymouse product. (for example brand X) Why does microsoft compare devices? Because they know that the people like the compared device better than theirs.

            <p>Well back in the mid 80's, Steve Jobs did hit on the PC market when it was starting up. &nbsp;That is around the time the rivalry actually started. &nbsp;There was nothing else to compare to when it came to computing because the closest thing to a 'personal PC' was
 a WANG terminal hooked up to a $35,000 unit that acted as a CPU and storage unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the IBM PC came out, Bill Gates and Paul Allen created BASIC for Apple along with TRS-DOS for Radio Shack to be used with the Model I. &nbsp;A lot of people didn't know that and Jobs and Gates where actually friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The public took it up from there and when the personal computers hit like wildfire, then people started to migrate to their favorite (Apple or PC) and it picked up from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually means nothing. &nbsp;I use all three systems myself and I like all three. &nbsp;Linux, of course, has no company behind it because it is public created and supported with a few companies creating distributions of it for markets. &nbsp;That system is developed
 to work with both Apple and PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People and companies will always compare one product with something else. &nbsp;The auto industry does it, airplane industry, home appliances, furniture, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is that as long as it works and it works the way you want and you want to use it, that is the way it is supposed to be. &nbsp;Doing comparisons also keeps quality control high as well. &nbsp;Competition! &nbsp;That forces companies to keep doing better
 or they go out of business.</p>

            When the iPad mini came out, they did a very large part of the presentation detailing it against "leading android tablets". So they surely do compare their devices.

<p>My guess is because Apple compared it's products against Microsoft long time ago and for long time, making fun of Microsoft users.</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I had the awful issue with the power cable not being recognised on my laptop. This has happened before and a restore worked.
 This time it didn't, so I uninstalled the drivers for the charger, and restarted the computer as they will then reinstall. It stated to shut down and then press down the power button. I have an internal battery (my computer is ASUS ROG G751JT-WH71(WX) )</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">But as soon as I pressed it it wanted to start so I made the mistake of releasing my finger and pressing it and holding it again
 which basically forced a shutdown again.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">When I had held it down for a minute I released and plugged in my cable and restarted my computer but got the BSOD.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">No automatic repair is working. Have tried fixboot etc. in CMD.&nbsp;</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I can choose the option under the advanced/troubleshoot options to 'use the usb drive'. When I click on this it asks for my system
 country etc. then says 'install now'. There is a smaller optiion of 'repair computer' but I have tried this and it doesn't work.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">As far as I know if I click install now, it will give me the option to install and keep apps, settings etc.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">But I was hoping not to do this until I could back up my hard drive.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I have google drive and I have many files backed up, but there was a glitch so I had paused it for a couple of weeks. Also, I
 regret now not having more folders backed up.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">So, I looked at the hard drive and I have a case whcih fits it.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Should I remove and read the file and copy as much as I can?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">The issue is I have files on both the c and D partitions and also have heard that sometimes you have to change the access permissions
 and driver letters so am worried about doing this as I would then wish it to be once again functional in the computer.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I am not sure what my next step should be. Risk install, but it may not work. Or try reset and keep my personal files?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">If anyone has any fix then that would be amazing.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Just to note, when in CMD I get the X:/windows/system32</span><br />

<p>While in the Windows Repair Environment (WRE), you could use console commands to copy your personal files (Drives C: and/or D:) to an external backup device. Since you won't have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) you will have to do a fair amount of typing.
 Post again for detailed instructions if you wish to go down this path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can remove the disk and connect it to a machine that runs Windows then you could back up your files in a GUI environment. As a further option you could install the free version of Macrium Reflect on that machine, then create
 images of the problem partitions and store them on a separate disk. This is the low-risk option because it really backs up everything. Restoration is a breeze under Macrium Reflect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note also that drive X: is a virtual drive that exists in Repair Mode only. It disappears as soon as you turn the machine off.</p>

            Frederik,<br />
Thank you so much for getting back to me.<br />
<br />
I had heard of two ways I could back up the files:<br />
1. using xcopy command in the command prompt<br />
2. opening up notepad.exe from the command prompt and then 'save as' opens up access to the files<br />
I tried the latter to just see if it would open and it did, and it looks like all my files are intact on the C drive so that is good news.<br />
<br />
Saying that, if there it is easier using xcopy rather than going through all the files and copying them one by one then that of course would be amazing.<br />
I have an external hard drive which has a lot of space on it and I was hoping to create a folder on it just to put everything into, so not to risk overwriting anything else that I currently have on that drive if that makes sense.<br />
If you are giving me a code to type, would it be okay if you do it as if I have created a folder on my external hard drive called ASUS?<br />
<br />
I could also take out the hard drive too.<br />
I did so yesterday to make sure a case I used for another HD would fit with the correct pins and it did.<br />
My worry is that by doing this it would relabel the partitions, or I may have to change the permissions in order to copy over and then they would not work when I put them back in the laptop again.<br />
So again, I would need to know how to do it step-by-step so as not to mess anything up.<br />
<br />
Technically, once I have all my files backed up I wouldn't mind a clean install except for the fact that Adobe is now preventing me from using my product key (it took them six years of using it,m including installing it on this new laptop two years ago to tell
 me that it wasn't a valid key, and they tell me I should take it up with the person I bought it from even though they are well gone as far as I can see). So this is why I would very much like to fix the issue without removing apps if at all possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you mentioned Macrium Reflect. Would I do this when plugging in the hdd to another computer? If I make an image wouldn't it just have the same problem as I am having now or can you restore all programmes and files without restoring the operating system
 back to its current problematic state?<br />
<br />
Of course, before doing any of this I would back up as much as possible.<br />
<br />
One more thing. Is there a way of finding out which registry files and other files I could save and reinstall after any clean install to ensure my Adobe Software is accepted again without going through the registration process?<br />
<br />
If you or anyone else has insight on these issues then that would be amazing.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for taking the time.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><span><em>1. using xcopy command in the command prompt</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; Robocopy.exe would be a much better choice. Watch out - different syntax!</span></p>
<p><br />
<span><em>2. opening up notepad.exe from the command prompt and then 'save as' opens up access to the files.</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; Bad choice. It will corrupt numerous files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Saying that, if there it is easier using xcopy rather than going through all the files and copying them one by one then that of course would be amazing.</em></span>-&gt; Indeed, e.g. like so:</p>
<p>robocopy&nbsp; "c:\users\Dragons\Documents"&nbsp; &nbsp;"f:\Documents"&nbsp; /e&nbsp; /w:1&nbsp; /r:1</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>I could also take out the hard drive too.&nbsp;</em></span><em><span>My worry is that by doing this it would relabel the partitions, or I may have to change the permissions.</span></em></p>
<p><span>-&gt; Drive letter details are held in the registry of your problem machine, not on the disk itself.</span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; Depending on the account names you use, you might have to grant access to the group called "Everyone". All machines recognise this group.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>When you mentioned Macrium Reflect. Would I do this when plugging in the hdd to another computer?</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; Yes</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>If I make an image wouldn't it just have the same problem as I am having now</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; The purpose of this image would be to give you a full back-up of everything that's on the disk: Personal files, favorites, E-Mail but NOT applications nor settings. In other words, you could not possibly lose any
 personal data. This method saves you the trouble of manually copying files or modifying access permissions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Is there a way of finding out which registry files and other files I could save and reinstall after any clean install to ensure my Adobe Software is accepted again without going through the registration process?</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; None. Software houses hide their registration keys extremely well in order to thwart copy attempts.</span></p>

<p>Thank you so much again.<br />
<br />
So just a few more questions from what you have been telling me if you don't mind.<br />
<br />
1. You stated that using the 'save as' from the notepad.exe could corrupt files.</p>
<p>Is this only when transferring files, or could I have done harm just going into it as I did yesterday to see if my files were there (I clicked on a few folders)?<br />
<br />
The reason why I ask is if I wish to use the command prompt to save files, I would need to be able to access them to see the address of the folders I wished to copy over and I thought that this would be a good way to ensure I am copying all the files I hope
 to. As well as seeing which letter my external hard drive has been given.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Also, when giving me the code to copy the files, your example for the external drive was:<br />
<br />
<span>f:\Documents"&nbsp; /e&nbsp; /w:1&nbsp; /r:1<br />
<br />
Would I have to set up this folder before or does that command line actually create a new documents folder&gt;<br />
Could I write something like:<br />
<br />
f:\ASUS\Documents to keep everything completely separate to the files I already have on this drive (I have already used it to keep extra copies of files from this and other computers before as I don't trust google drive alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;</span>It seems the best way may be to just pull the hard drive temporarily after all.<br />
It seems that once I were to put it back in the laptop then the partitions would be put back to the way they were, so no harm done, but I have also read that some people cannot see all their partitions when reading the disk from an external casing. Right now
 I have most of my recent files in by D drive, some sitting straight in it as I accidentally saved some outside a folder.<br />
Will different partitions be visible or only what was c? If I cannot see another how do I access it?<br />
Also the current E partition on it is a recovery area. Should I copy that too for safe keeping?<br />
<br />
(In terms of plugging it into my friends computer, I would plan on also plugging in my Seagate and transfer from the removed HDD and then transfer directly over to the other external hard drive. Does this sound okay?).<br />
<br />
Not sure an image at this time is overly necessary as I am not too worried about my settings, but was more hopeful that it would help with being able to keep the apps.<br />
Saying that, I may go ahead just to have it as it can't do any harm, but would still like to transfer files over manually also.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much and I hope that you don't mind if I end up having to ask more questions.<br />
You are the only one who has really taken the time to answer thoroughly and I greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

-&gt; The commannd I gave you is a much more reliable way to ensure that all files are copied.<br />
<br />
<em>2. Also, when giving me the code to copy the files, your example for the external drive was:</em><br />
<span><em>f:\Documents"&nbsp; /e&nbsp; /w:1&nbsp; /r:1</em><br />
<em>Would I have to set up this folder before or does that command line actually create a new documents folder&gt;</em><br />
<em>Could I write something like:</em><br />
<em>f:\ASUS\Documents to keep everything completely separate to the files I already have on this drive (I have already used it to keep extra copies of files from this and other computers before as I don't trust google drive alone.</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; You can specify any target folder you like. The command I gave you will create the target folder unless it already exists. Why not experiment a little?<br />
<br />
<em>3.&nbsp;</em></span><em>It seems the best way may be to just pull the hard drive temporarily after all.</em><br />
<em>It seems that once I were to put it back in the laptop then the partitions would be put back to the way they were, so no harm done, but I have also read that some people cannot see all their partitions when reading the disk from an external casing. Right
 now I have most of my recent files in by D drive, some sitting straight in it as I accidentally saved some outside a folder.</em><br />
<em>Will different partitions be visible or only what was c? If I cannot see another how do I access it?</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Macrium Reflect will display&nbsp;<strong>all </strong>partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Also the current E partition on it is a recovery area. Should I copy that too for safe keeping?</em><br />
-&gt; The recovery area does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> contain personal data. Leave it alone!</p>
<p><br />
<em>(In terms of plugging it into my friends computer, I would plan on also plugging in my Seagate and transfer from the removed HDD and then transfer directly over to the other external hard drive. Does this sound okay?).</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Sure does.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Not sure an image at this time is overly necessary as I am not too worried about my settings, but was more hopeful that it would help with being able to keep the apps.</em><br />
<em>Saying that, I may go ahead just to have it as it can't do any harm, but would still like to transfer files over manually also.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; I wrote before that my method will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> transfer settings and apps.</p>

            Thank you so much. You are amazing.<br />
I think I will be using the method of pulling my hard drive out as I think it will be the quickest and easiest way.<br />
Yes, I understood that the Macrium Reflect would not copy apps etc. I was just mentioning it as a possibility to do it anyway as it won't do any harm. Sorry about the confusion.<br />
<br />
I hope you have a safe and happy New Year.

<p>I assume you are referring to the forum account. This happens when you log on at the forum under a different account instead of the one you used before. If you had not mentioned it then I would not have responded because I will not deal with two posters
 in the one thread.</p>

            <p>Hello Savannah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the exact model number of your HP 2000 laptop?<br />
2. Do you receive any error message or code while playing movies from DVD, when you say, " i can't play dvd movies on it anymore"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 Pro don't come with DVD movie playback capability. If you're running Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 Pro, you can search for a DVD player app in the Windows Store.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>DVD playback options for Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/dvd-playback-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/dvd-playback-help</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you really want to perform factory reset, you may refer to suggestions from Rohit Siddegowda replied on May 15, 2013.<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/reset-your-pc-not-working-insert-media-some-files/f816ff4e-cd1c-45b6-b146-824127af9103">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/reset-your-pc-not-working-insert-media-some-files/f816ff4e-cd1c-45b6-b146-824127af9103</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I highly recommend backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device before attempting any type of operating system repair, upgrade or reinstallation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
