<h2>            Instant On XBS and XB1 wifi disconnects</h2>
                    <p>So... with the original Xbox One, I had NO issues with the Instant On mode.&nbsp; I moved to and S and began experiencing an issue where while under "instant on" and turning it on, I&nbsp;had no internet connection... and I would have to completely reboot the console.&nbsp; I thought it was my connections and eventually found the console just wouldnt stay connected while in the Instant On mode... maybe I just had a dud...&nbsp; So, naturally when I upgraded to the Xbox One X, I felt that&nbsp;peskey issue would be bannished to xbox hell, but NO!&nbsp; I have the same issue.&nbsp; If I turn on the Xb1X while&nbsp;in "instant on" mode... tada! there's no internet connection... EVEN THOUGH the internet is FINE... and what do I have to do to fix it you ask?&nbsp; Well, I have to reboot the console, and thus completely, and effectively eliminate the benefit of the INSTANT ON FEATURE!!!!&nbsp; WTH??&nbsp; So, since I've read this issue just about everywhere on the internet... WHAT IS THE SOLU

<h2>            FIle Explorer keeps opening with no action</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1 Pro with all Windows updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting 28/8/2014 (Australia) File Explorer keeps randomly opening. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes focus and any typing or work I am doing is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it opens it has focus on my 3TB Seagate USB3 external Hard Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disconnected the Seagate USB hard drive and the popup is no longer occurring. Not very useful as it is a backup drive.</p>
<p>Reconnect drive and popup starts occurring again.</p>

            <p>Hi LanceGreen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try creating a new user account and check if the issue persists. This is to check if the issue is caused due to any user profile corruption or not. If the issue does not persist in new user account, then proceed with Step 2 and 3. This is
 to copy the files from old user account to new one and then to delete the old user account.</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong>Create a new Microsoft Account.<br />
<strong><span>Create a user account:</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the new user profile works properly, then copy and paste the data files to the new user profile.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to copy the files from the old Microsoft account to the new Microsoft account:
<br />
</span>a) Press/tap <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows
</span></strong>and <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">x</span></strong> together and select
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Explorer</span></strong>.<br />
b) Click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View
</span></strong>tab and click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Options</span></strong> at the top right corner.<br />
c) Click/tap the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View</span></strong> tab, and then click/tap
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Show hidden files</span></strong>, folders, and drives.<br />
d) Uncheck the box which states <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hide protected operating system files</span></strong>.<br />
e) Click <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Yes
</span></strong>to confirm, and then click<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">OK</span></strong>.
<br />
f) Locate the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Users\Old_Username folder</span></strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile
 you want to copy files from.<br />
g) Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:<br />
•<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ntuser.dat</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.dat.log</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.ini</span></strong></p>
<p>h) Right click/tap and Select <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Copy</span></strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 3</span></strong>: If the new user profile is working fine, then delete the old user.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to delete the corrupted user account profile:<br />
</span>a) Login to your new User Profile.<br />
b) Click/tap on the “<strong>Windows logo</strong>” and type “<strong>User Accounts</strong>”.<br />
c) Now, select “<strong>Settings</strong>” and then select the “<strong>User Accounts</strong>” icon.<br />
d) Click/tap on “<strong>Manage another account</strong>” and then select the user account that you want to delete.<br />
e) Click/tap on “<strong>delete the account</strong>”.<br />
f) Depending on whether you want to “<strong>Keep the files</strong>” or “<strong>delete the files</strong>” choose the appropriate option.<br />
g) You can delete the other accounts similarly.</p>

<h2>            Win10 PC crashes randomly.</h2>
                    <p>Ok so randomly, mostly after startup my win10 pc crashes and auto-restarts (because I have enabled autoreboot on critical failure).</p>
<p>These are the logs starting from 10:05:49 when it crashed:</p>
<p>Log name: security</p>
<p>Source:eventlog</p>
<p>Event ID: 1101</p>
<p>Level: 2</p>
<p>Then some unknown</p>
<p>Task category: event processing</p>
<p>Keywords: Audit Success</p>
<p>"Audit events have been dropped by transport, 0"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following logs talk about unexpected shutdown, dump file creation failed and finally, critical error:</p>
<p>Log name: system</p>
<p>Source: Kernel-power</p>
<p>Event ID: 41</p>
<p>LEVEL: Critical</p>
<p>User: SYSTEM</p>
<p>Keywords: (70368744177664), (2)</p>
<p>"The System has been rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This errror could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed or lost power unexpectedly.</p>
<p>This happens pretty frequently.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

            I am going to recommend you go back to that and stick with it. 
<br />
<br />Don't fall for the trap that you need Windows 10 to make your life better.
<br />
<br />Step 1: You need to download the install files for Windows 7 if you are reinstalling it on a system where it was previously installed. You can use the following resources:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Windows and Office ISO Download Tool – HeiDoc.net
<br /><a href="http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science...</a>

<br />
<br />Step 2: Make a bootable copy:
<br />
<br />How to Prepare Bootable Install Media for Windows - DVD, USB or SD Card
<br />Step 3: Download any necessary drivers you might need for Windows 7 from the manufacturers website. 
<br />
<br />Step 4: Perform a custom install - see the Windows 7 section of the following article how to do that:
<br />
<br />How to: Perform a custom installation of Windows
<br />     <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 5: how find your product key and reactivate:
<br />
<br />Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer, how do I find the product key?
<br />
<br />The product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:
<br />
<br />Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer
<br />
<br />If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.
<br />If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need to use the product key also.
<br />
<br />I bought a retail box copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Windows 8.1; where do I find the product key?
<br />
<br />For Windows 7, the product key can be located on a pamphlet in inside the Windows 7 box.

<h2>            Windows 8 is getting my computer location wrong on all apps</h2>
                    I just purchased a Lenovo and an HP with Windows 8. Both are desktop computers. Both are located in the same room. Both use the same wireless router. Both use the same cable/Internet provider. How come the HP shows the correct location on all apps and
 Lenovo's Windows 8 shows that I am in Barrington, IL - 25 miles away from where the computers are located? I have tried EVERYTHING you can imagine and I am pulling my hair out at this point. The Lenovo is basically useless because 90% of the apps I use have
 to do with my computer location. PLEASE HELP!!!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think you gave Lenovo a wrong location.... I think more likely you somehow gave the HP the CORRECT location...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you connect to the internet through service provider, you are usually connected by them, to a router.... It is the location of the router that shows up as your location.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because this is where your IP Address is being sent to the rest of the world from...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My address also shows up as a location 50+ miles away... My actual town only shows up after I enter it, or my Zip Code into a website, or a map service like Google, Bing, MapQuest, or etc....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your HP either has found a way around this, or you have entered your location at sometime, and it was stored on your HP in the "Cookies" file, or elsewhere...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, Lenovo may be able to help... Maybe HP as well.....</p>
<p>Just fib a little and tell them you are getting the wrong location, and see what they suggest...</p>

    <title>Some icons randomly switching back to their small version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaedelyia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some icons randomly switching back to their small version</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there's this old bug driving me crazy. Custom icons tend to randomly change size every now and then. I have a folder full of games shortcuts. Because I have a tons of them, I feel it's more easy to browse through with big icon, because I recognize picture
 of the game I want to play immediately. Plus, it looks nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All games on bought on GoG.com have by default a high-resolution icon, but some old game from disk and some game coming from steam don't have that. Thanks to the miracle of the Internet, you can find custom icon for nearly every game, even the most old and/or
 obscure ones. So changing these (right click --&gt; properties --&gt; change icon and so on) works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, every now and then, when explorer restart, some icon switch back to their small version randomly. It's not always the same game, and if you let that sit for a while, after another restart, it will shuffle again and these game might recover the proper
 icon while other will be all messed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say a picture is worth a thousand word :&nbsp;http://i.imgur.com/g5OrXWH.png</p>
<p>(Funny thing : It nearly only happens with customized icon, but it did happens with Wasteland 2, which have two very distinct icon ; A sheriff badge for the small and a Square icon for the big. Sometime it switch to the badge for no reason.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's apparently not a new bug, I find trace of it here and then on the internet. Most notably on these forums, the Windows 7 sections :</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/some-icons-get-their-small-version-even-when/cf3de64b-06d5-4ac0-9b23-6cd9f8e1d88e?page=2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried what's suggested in this link. Increase the max icon cache's size, delete and recreate Icon cache, and so on. Nothing work in a permanent way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I wanted to ask : Since Windows 7 is not exactly new, do we know what's the problem, now ? I mean it's weird that kind of stuff is still there in Windows 10, considering all the time that have passed since Windows 10. I know it's not a major broken feature
 that require an hotfix, but one can wonder how reported bug stay unfixed for such a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any idea ? Thanks a lot !</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help. The suggested solution didn't work, but it's still nice to see people spending time to help to resolve such "not-really-important" issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first command ("<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth")&nbsp;</span>went without trouble. Second one did find some error and said that Windows was able to fix them, and save that
 into a log that is long like the nile, most of which being</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Primitive installers committed for repair"</p>
<p>It repaired 3 files&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Repairing corrupted file [ml:60{30},l:58{29}]"\??\C:\Windows\SysWOW64\en-US"\[l:68{34}]"Windows.Media.Speech.UXRes.dll.mui" from store</li><li>Repairing corrupted file [ml:60{30},l:58{29}]"\??\C:\Windows\SysWOW64\en-US"\[l:30{15}]"msprivs.dll.mui" from store</li><li>&nbsp;Repairing corrupted file [ml:60{30},l:58{29}]"\??\C:\Windows\SysWOW64\en-US"\[l:26{13}]"mlang.dll.mui" from store</li></ul>
<p>The 3 of them probably being unrelated to my problem but hey, it's always good to fix, so thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some icon are still going small, though. I will try to fix them manually once again and will keep this thread updated, but I'm afraid the manual will be temporary as usual.</p>

<p>There are policies, and then there are practices.</p>
<p>While the system says no refunds, whatsoever, ever, there are a few exceptions. If you had a 3 month or 12 month, and it is within 30 days, you can get a refund of a purchase or a replacement code if it was by prepaid code.</p>
<p>It doesn't hurt to reach out to the billing support. Sometimes they can find ways to work with you to find a resolution that makes everyone happy.</p>

            While transferring Xbox Live Gold Memberships to other accounts can not be done (to the best of my knowledge) you could use the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-AU/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Home Xbox setting</a> to use up the remainder of the Xbox Live Gold member ship on that account, and next time, just be sure to redeem/purchase Xbox Live Gold on the correct account.

<h2>            Files suddenly, unexpectedly permanently deleted</h2>
                    <p>I had two folders and a file I wanted to copy. I selected them, brought up the contextual menu, then decided I wanted to copy them while they were in their containing folder. So I dismissed the menu and went up to the address bar to back out a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pulled down the arrow to the left of the folder, got a little confused because that's not what that's for...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And suddenly, without any warning, the menu disappeared, a dialog appeared right under my mouse reading something that included 'permanently delete?' and before I could even react, 'yes' had been clicked, and the files were gone. Incidentally, no recovery
 utilities were able to find the files and they were worth roughly $700.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay. I can understand if the mouse button stuttering is a hardware problem or something. That ha been happening a little recently, so given that the dialog appeared, the ill luck that it happened to occur right in front of the 'yes' isn't so astounding.
 Very poor, but believable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why was that dialog box raised in the first place? I haven't been able to even bring it up again as I repeat a variety of things similar to what I did that time (on a safe-to-delete empty folder). I had my hands nowhere near the shift key, or any other
 key on the keyboard (the mouse and keyboard are fairly widely separated).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened, and how can I avoid it in the future?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just a guess but it sounds like the files were too large to fit in the recycle bin and that would prompt of "do you want to permanently delete them"&gt;yes.&nbsp; It also would explain why you have been unable to replicate this with empty folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the recycle bin to see what size it is set at&gt;make a folder with a larger amount&gt;use the pull down&gt;choose delete and see what happens.</p>

<h2>            Download speed cut in half since downloading the Holiday update.</h2>
                    <p>I'm on the Xbox One S and since I've downloaded the Holiday update about a week ago,&nbsp;my download speed seems to be cut in half. Before the update I always had 80 to 100/Mbps but now they're always at 40 to 50/Mbps. When I test my network stats on Xbox 360 they're still normal. Is it just something with this update? Also my console didn't automatically update, I had to go in and manually update it for the Holiday update, I don't know if that would have anything to do with it.</p>

            <p>I tried power cycling my Xbox one and it's still telling me anywhere from 30 to 50 Mbps. I'll probably give it a couple days to see if it corrects itself before power cycling my router.&nbsp;I'm thinking it's a bug with the Holiday update because it only started happening right&nbsp;after that and the update notes says they tweaked it for better download speeds. I don't think it's my network because&nbsp;my download speed on 360 isn't doing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br /></p><p> 
 </p></blockquote>&nbsp;<p /><p>So I decided to power cycle my router when I tested my stats and was getting download speeds of 13mbps and I also power cycled my console during that time&nbsp;just to cover all bases and it still hasn't seemed to help. At&nbsp;the moment of writing this I'm getting 21mbps download speed, all other stats are normal.&nbsp;I also tried downloading Far Cry 3&nbsp;Blood Dragon (2.2GB)&nbsp;and got speeds in the 20 to 30 Mbps range for the majority of the download. It honestly sounds like the bug with the Xbox One S early on where everyone was saying&nbsp;if you had it set to instant on your download speeds would be in the 15 to 20mbps range, but mine is set to power saving mode though. I even tried factory resetting (before power cycling my router) in hopes that it would solve it but no luck.</p>

<h2>            HDMI issues on Lenovo y410p</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;
<div>I spent all day yesterday trying to figure this out to no avail. &nbsp;I bought an HDMI cable so that I could watch movies on my laptop on my TV. &nbsp;I plugged it in, changed the display to the TV rather than the laptop, and that all worked fine, no problem. &nbsp;The
 issues began when I noticed that there was no sound coming from the TV, but only from my computer. &nbsp;I read online that I had to go to the playback device settings and change it to the HDMI output, but I do not have that option. &nbsp;All that I have to choose from
 is "Speakers", and "Realtek Digital Output", neither of which produced any sound from my TV. &nbsp;Help?</div>

            <p>Hi Bruce, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure that there is volume on the TV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can also make sure that the connections are appropriate. Try connecting to a different HDMI port as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the section:<strong> 'Check if the cables are connected properly' </strong>
and also set the HDMI audio device as the default. </p>

            Jessen,
<div>Thank you very much for your reply, but I am still having problems. &nbsp;I understand that I must change the sound preference to the Digital HDMI output, but when I go into my playback device options, I do not have that choice. &nbsp;Even after checking that hidden
 and disabled devices are shown, my only choices are Speakers and Realtek Digital Audio, and neither of them work for the HDMI sound apparently. &nbsp;Maybe there is a driver or something that I have to download so that I have the option of HDMI sound, but I have
 yet to find it.</div>

<h2>            Xbox 720 and 360</h2>
                    
<p>I didn't know what else to put this under. sorry if its in the wrong category.</p>
<p><br />
I have a question to ask about the 360 after the 720 is released</p>
<p>Once the 720 is releases&nbsp;or&nbsp;a while after (several years)&nbsp;could I still use my Xbox 360, play games, and get achievements like normal? or will it be discontinued?<br />
Thanks, nosmotem</p>

<p>I doubt you will get any answers at this time. You should watch out for the official announcement of the next Xbox and see if that addresses your concerns.</p>
<p>If not, then I would recommend returning.</p>

<p>CISphil is correct that nobody will know (or share if they do) the answers to your questions until after the 5/21 announcement. That being said, I would find it highly surprising if we couldn't play our games after the next generation of consoles launches
 as they do not require an online connection (other than the multiplayer components of course). Even achievements don't require you to be online except to sync to your profile in the cloud.</p>

<p>I am sure they will still be playable, even most online components but expect microsoft to stop making games for the 360 almost immediately after the release of the new system just like the xbox1. &nbsp;When my first 360 broke I played a Halo 2 and Madden 08
 with my live account on my old xbox. That was about 3 years after they discontinued the xbox1 getting new games.</p>

<p>I'm sure it will be like what they did with the xbox when the xbox 360 came out. No matter what you can use it offline but there will be no quarentee about online playability. I highly doubt they will discontinue xbox live for the 360 all at once. It will
 probably be a gradual decline. This is all guessing though, but thats what they did for the original xbox</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The network map is a graphical view of the computers and devices on your network, showing how they are connected. Sometimes
<span>Windows</span> can't detect all of the computers and devices on a network, or can't place all of the computers and devices in the right location on the map. Here are some reasons for network map problems and related solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>The first time that you connect to a network, you must choose a
<span><em>network location</em></span>. This automatically sets the appropriate firewall and security settings for the type of network that you connect to. If you connect to networks in different locations (for example, a network at your home, at a local coffee
 shop, or at work), choosing a network location can help ensure that your computer is always set to an appropriate security level.</span></p>
<p><span>Personal information and files on your wireless network can sometimes be seen by people who pick up your network signal. This can lead to identity
 theft and other malicious acts. A network security key or passphrase can help protect your wireless network from this type of unauthorized access.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, I would suggest you to refer these links:</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Boot Problems after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alieneila  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Boot Problems after update</h2>
                    <p>I had upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 just fine. Earlier yesterday I started up my computer and was presented with 3 boxes, I can't remember what they said, but it led me to repairing the Windows boot through that screen. PC rebooted and loaded just fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later in the day my PC rebooted for a Windows update, and it came up to a black screen that says "Reboot and select proper boot device, or Insert Boot Media in selected boot device and press a key".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was disturbing and I thought maybe my hard drive failed. So I ran my Alienware/Dell diagnostics from the boot menu, and it returned passed results for everything. I even did a test a second time on my hard drive just to verify. It passed again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I came across a post that said to use... <strong><span>x<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:</span>\&gt;chkdsk
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">/</span>f <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">/</span>v <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
/</span>r <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">/</span>b <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">/</span>offlinescanandfix c<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:</span></span></strong><span><br />
</span>which I did, and then went to sleep because it said it had 6 hours until completion. I woke up this morning, everything seemed to run fine and I was at the command prompt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I rebooted and again, same error as above. I then attempted some other things that people suggested for bootrec /fixmbr, bootrec /fixboot, and bootrec /rebuildBCD. The first two completed successfully, the last one showed me which drive Windows was installed
 on "C:\Windows", and came up with a Y, N, A option. I did Y, did it again and tried A, both times it returned "The requested system device cannot be found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went into repair mode using my flash drive, and repairing the boot from that returned a failed message. At this point I figured that the only thing I could do is repair or reinstall. Unfortunately, attempting to do either of those results in... "the
 drive where windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, at this point I am at a loss. Can anyone suggest any other fixes?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family. I would&nbsp;like to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are receiving the error "the drive where windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the following commands and check&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth<br />
<br />
2. DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above recommendation did not work, you may need to do a "Clean Install" instead of the upgrade option and by using the "Clean Install" method you can completely wipe the drive and start afresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information was helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            Neither of those commands will run, it says that /Online is not a flag supported in Windows PE and without the flag it wont run either. I think it is a little messed up that a Windows Update messes up my boot and I have to reinstall and lose all of my

            These suggestions have not helped my problem either. Bad thing is the Windows level 2 team did the updates from remote access on my computer. But when I called back about the problem, they&nbsp;told me I would have to pay a local vendor to restore my windows
 from the black screen before they could look at the problem!

    <title>Slow bootup with blinking cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diannesilver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow bootup with blinking cursor</h2>
                    
<p>Recently my windows 7 startup has become really slow. I went as far as restoring my computer to factory settings without any success. I started it up today in the morning with no problems. Then during the afternoon I turned it off and turned it on after
 a few hours. That's when the problems started.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;takes five times as long to boot up. Just before the Windows&nbsp;7 startup screen appears, I see a cursor blinking twice in the top left hand corner.&nbsp;Then the welcome screen hangs for a bit. Nothing like this has happened since I purchased my Dell Inspiron
 1440 laptop last year.</p>
<p>I ran anti-virus, defrag...yada, yada, yada and nothing helped. That's when I decided to just save my data and restore it to factory settings. That didn't help either. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One entry in the list of processes starting could be a trojan or a genuine Microsoft process. If it is a trojan it seems to be one that Avast was not detecting as
 of 8 January 2011. The situation could have changed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before you run SuperAntiSpyware it helps to clean your computer first.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk CleanUp to empty your Recycle Bin, remove Temporary Internet Files and other selected
 options. I also recommend you click on the More Options tab, System Restore and remove all but the latest System Restore point. Run Disk Defragmenter.</span></p>
<p><span>Using the System restore option is most appropriate when your system is running slow and you need to increase free disk space on your C partition.
 If you have errors which might be resolved using System Restore to put your system settings back to before the error first occurred do not use this option.</span></p>
<p><span>If more than one person uses the computer and they have their own user Log on you need to run Disk CleanUp in each user profile to remove all unwanted
 files.</span></p>
<p><span>A better programme than Disk CleanUp is cCleaner but note that cCleaner will not handle System Restore points. Removing older restore points can
 be important if you have limited free disk space. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors.</span></p>

<h3> ceabax  say:</h3>
<h2>            So I can no longer leave unfinished work open on my PC&#63;</h2>
                    So Windows has decided that not only can I not delay or postpone updates, I can't even delay or postpone an restart? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can't find any such option in my update settings. My computer just restarts after an update, and if there is any unsaved work open, it's lost.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is that really the case, or am I missing something here?&nbsp;

            <p>The latest stable build of Windows 10 has a feature named active hours. This is what windows says about active hours:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa69b537-7927-4a2e-8b67-c471dc9fb351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa69b537-7927-4a2e-8b67-c471dc9fb351" /></a></p>
<p>A maximum of 9 hours can be set as an active hours-the same is present on the update settings page. To prevent restarts, you can also enforce some group policies so that Windows asks you before restarting or downloading an update as well.</p>

            Ridiculous. &nbsp;You can't even edit group policy by default on Windows 10. gpedit.msc doesn't work. By default on my Windows 10 version, there is no group policy editing feature.&nbsp;<br />

This is so user unfriendly to the average person.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Actually, the Fn thing is quite old and has more to do with the hardware you have than the software. &nbsp;;-)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connect a full size keyboard up (usb, Bluetooth, etc.) and you'll note the Fn requirement does not apply to the device at the same time it does for the built-in one.</p>

                    <p>OK this is the problem I have been having. I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate x86 on a Dell Inspion 1100 that I just upgraded fom XP Pro I downloaded service pack 1 manually yet still I can't update I download and ran the System Update readiness tool the results
 are listed below. I ran the Mr Fix IT solution it says it corrected an error but I still can't update. I ran troubleshooter, I turned off my firewall and my anti-virus and I still can't install downloads. This is not good I am used to having minor problems
 with my systems but they always are fixable this seems to not be. Where can I download the updates manually and then install on my PC I can't go without getting updates. Also I installed two different codec packs that always fix any video problems I come across
 yet I still can't play MP4's either C00D11B1 error code help tells you to look for updates but once again I can't get any (thats hiw a discovered the updates problem)</p>

            I don't know what I did but it is now working. First I downloaded some security updates from MS site and then I installed Microsoft updates for other MS products and after that updates started working I"m downloading around a 100 of them right now

            I'm not sure I went to the MS sight and went to Windows 7 Downloads I started with whatever security updates they were offering to start and it fixed everything. I originally went there to manually download every update they had available for Windows 7
 but after the first reboot all was fixed. Try allowing MS updates for other products also like I said I don't know what I did but that was one of the things I did

<p>
</p><p>Also, where are you seeing this error? Is it through the Xbox app? I believe it's just a bug, and I've seen it happening dew times. You can still change the custom image, just ignore the message, or try changing on console. You can copy the custom image
 on a USB drive or a pen drive.</p>

            You don't have to be currently suspended for this to happen, as it says it's "past" behaviour that has caused it.

                    I have a transaction add-on from Kaspersky which I paid for. This add-on helps me create a list of my trusted websites. The add-on functions by directing to the website I want while all activities protected by Kaspersky. I used this for years and feel
 safe. However this week, this add-on cannot direct me to any website on the trusted list. Every time I click on a website on the list, a message pops up "The instruction at "0xXXXXXXXX" referenced memory at "0xXXXXXXXX", The memory could not be written. Click
 on OK to terminate that program". Any member can help? Thanks. P.S.: I have contacted Kaspersky Tech Support but they could not help me although I have sent them a complete report and system log. Probably this is a system error.

<h2>            xbox 360 &#38;quot&#59;unable to retrieve credit card info&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Bought my Xbox 360 Blue, Open box, Powering up OK</strong><br />

<strong>Problem #2: When try download any Free/Demo games</strong><br />
- Systems shows “Your credit card info couldn't be retrieved. Buy this <br />
&nbsp; item with money in your Microsoft account or try again later."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong><br />
- My xbox/microsoft account is working on Xbox One (which i bought few weeks<br />
&nbsp; earlier), but not on Xbox360.&nbsp; I could download free/demo games on Xbox One.<br />

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;GoldRyukin! I'm sorry to hear about trouble getting demos and adding a payment option! Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br /><strong>Reading over this thread, it sounds like the profile on your Xbox 360 console may be corrupt. So to start, let's try redownloading the profile. To do that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you have all of the login information for the GoldRyukin account.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/delete-xbox-live-profile-from-xbox-360-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete your profile</a> ONLY (do NOT delete profile and items).</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your system cache</a>.</li>
<li>Restart your console.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/download-your-xbox-live-profile-to-another-360-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download your profile</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Let us know how that goes for you and what happens each step of the way! ^_^</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Reload profile (Does not work)</strong></p>
<p>Followed your instruction:</p>
<p>- Delete My Profile</p>
<p>- Clear my system cache on HDD</p>
<p>- Download my profile again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Profile, GamerTag, Avatar all reloaded properly</p>
<p>=&gt; But I'm still having same problem of "unable to retrieve credit card info"</p>
<p>(Did the same three times, also on/off Xbox360 before reload profile)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Perform Factory Reset</strong></p>
<p>Unlike XboxOne, the Xbox360 is unable to perform factory reset. So I did the "Initial Setup" again.</p>
<p>I entered my Microsoft account #1 (Same as my XboxOne), the xbox360 rejected it and said
<em>"The Microsoft account is associated with a different Xbox Live Profile, Try a different account"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create new Microsoft account #2</strong></p>
<p>I went to my PC and created a second Microsoft account #2.</p>
<p>Re-entered onto Xbox360 through 'Initial Setup" process again, the xbox360 accepted it and I could download demo games, or add/delete credit cards.</p>
<p>=&gt; Could get it working but I need a different Microsoft Account. (May be it will be OK if single account is associated with XBox360 first then with XboxOne in that sequence. I have no idea)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Some questions here (Can someone please help? I'm new to Xbox):</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question: XBox Live Gold</strong></p>
<p>- I'm OK with different accounts/profiles for Xbox360 and XboxOne</p>
<p>- But does that mean I need to purchase separate/2-licenses of Xbox Live Gold for the XboxOne and Xbox360?</p>
<p>- I did not accept the 1-month Xbox Live Gold free offer from Microsoft on both the Xbox360 and XboxOne (During initial power up and registration, Microsoft offered 1-month free Xbox Live Gold)</p>
<p>- I've not used my 1-month Xbox Live Gold came with My Xbox360 blue Package.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have not used my another 12-month Xbox live Gold came with&nbsp;an 'Xbox One Essentials" Package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question: Putting Cash in Microsoft Account</strong></p>
<p>- Leaving credit card or paypal in the microsoft account might not be as safe.&nbsp; Account could be hacked (Sony PSN was hacked before), and small kids might perform purchases without knowing it.</p>
<p>- Could I just leave a few hundred dollars inside my Microsoft account and delete all paypal/Credit-cards? Xbox Live or all download will still be functioning, right?</p>
<p>- What's the easiest way to transfer cash to my microsoft account? Buy some "Xbox Digital Gift Card" and enter to Microsoft a/c?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question: DNS For Xbox360, XboxOne</strong></p>
<p>- My Internet Service provider does not provide very stable DNS.&nbsp; My Sony Playstation TV will not work unless DNS changed to Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).&nbsp; Is there any stable/safe public DNS from Xbox Live or Microsoft that I could use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<li><strong>Xbox Live Gold:</strong> For Xbox 360, each Gamertag/Account that you would like to have access to Xbox Live Gold Membership features will need to have its own Gold Membership. However, for Xbox One, you can take advantage of a cool feature called Xbox One Home Gold. There's tons of information over on the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/xbox-live/xbox-live-gold-sharing-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Gold Sharing Features on Xbox One</a> support article, so check it out!</li>
<li><strong>Putting Cash in Microsoft Account:</strong> I can certainly understand wanting to keep your information safe! If you'd like to just put money on your Microsoft Account, you can do that by purchasing gift cards, etc and redeeming them on your account. Then, you can use the currency on your account to purchase things like Games, DLC, etc. Keep in mind however, that the currency on your account cannot be used to purchase Xbox Live Gold Memberships.</li>
<li><strong>DNS for Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles:</strong> For DNS questions like this, I would suggest making a separate post (just about the networking questions) over in forum 02- Connecting to Xbox Live on Xbox 360. That way, our networking gurus can attempt to assist. I would suggest getting in touch with your Internet Service Provider to see if they have any suggestions for you as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />I hope that helped to answer all of your questions, and I truly apologize if I missed any. Please let us know if you have any more questions and we'll do our best to assist! ^_^</p>

<p>I have this same problem with both symptoms described. If I create a new account using initial setup I do not get either error. I have spent multiple hours with phone and chat support with no fix. Any resolution?</p>
