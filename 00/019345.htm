<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Windows 10 - 4K Monitors - Unreliable</h2>
                    <p>I'm sending this on the back of more than 2 years of frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has been out for maybe 2 1/2 years now?&nbsp; Office 2016 not much less than this, certainly over 2 years, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, why haven't Microsoft been able to get Outlook to the point that it just works when running on 4K monitors?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the whole Outlook window turns white and stops responding.&nbsp; Sometimes, the text squashes up to half its size (width) and there are large black blocks on the screen.&nbsp; Sometimes you can gracefully close (well, sort of by pressing Alt-F-X when you
 can't use Outlook) Outlook, other times you have to kill it as it doesn't wake up.&nbsp; Sometimes it flickers/flashes white on and off - luckily I'm not epileptic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does generate an error report to Microsoft.&nbsp; I don't think a lot is done with these error reports though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of another thread with similar problems is below.&nbsp; I've found dozens of these thread over the last couple of years.&nbsp; The suggestions to resolve are consistently useless.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have recreated Outlook profiles, I have disable hardware acceleration in Office, I have even gone to the trouble of reformatting my PC and installing Windows from scratch.&nbsp; Nothing makes a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a DELL Optiplex 9020 i7, 24GB RAM, W4100 graphics card, 3 x 4K Monitors.&nbsp; Drivers/BIOS etc. are all up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have about 5 or 6 shared mailboxes open in my Outlook progfile, and I do have 2 x Outlook windows (usually Inbox &amp; Sent) open at any given time.&nbsp; I used to have about 6 individual Outlook windows (Inbox, Sent, Calendar, Contacts, Tasks and PFs) open
 when running 2013 on Win8.1 with 1920x1200 monitors.&nbsp; Never had a problem like this.&nbsp; Once I went to 4K, it all turned to sh*t.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never (that's right, NEVER) had Outlook run reliably on this configuration.&nbsp; The unreliability varies from one Windows and/or Office update to the next.&nbsp; At its worse, I have had to restart Outlook up to 10 times a day.&nbsp; Sometimes I get lucky and
 an update/patch will leave me with a system that can run Outlook for maybe 2-3 days without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present, I am restarting Outlook once or twice a day.&nbsp; One thing that accelerates the likelihood of Outlook crapping itself is opening the Calendar.&nbsp; There's something different about how the Calendar is displayed and this causes the failure very quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really expecting a solution (that would be nice though), but wanted to have a bit of a vent/rant on the back of a couple of years+ of frustration.</p>

<p>Hello Veronica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your post, you are trying to copy or import videos from your phone to PC. Possible causes of this issue can occur if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not have permissions to the file or the file location.</li><li>The file is on a location that is not currently accessible.</li><li>The file has been moved or deleted.</li><li>The file or shortcut is corrupt.</li><li>The file may be blocked by Windows.</li><li>Your antivirus software may be blocking the file.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to know if your using a Windows Phone. If so, have you tried the alternative way to import or copy videos wirelessly by using the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/11689/windows-phone-sync-your-windows-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Phone app for desktop</a></strong> or by using

                    <p>I created a file using publisher 2013 on system with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While working on the file an error came up and the system automatically attempted to repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reopened the file I was unable to edit any of the existing&nbsp;information on the flyer but I was able to add new things.</p>

<h3> stacy davidson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repetative Page numbers.</h2>
                    I am creating a large Word document in MS Word 2007, and I have section breraks throughout the document. The sections breaks seperating my Cover page and TOC from the information within, and then a section break seperating my information from my exhibits
 so the page numbers stop. However, for some reason, after page 6 in the middle section, my page numbers start over again at the number 2, which repeats on two pages then begins counting up again. How can I fix this when it says the footers are "Linked to the
 previous"?

            A section break must be "hiding" somewhere, because page numbers can only restart after a section break. Switch to Draft view and display nonprinting marks, for example by clicking the ¶ button on the Home tab. Once you have found the location where the
 section begins, do the following: Place the insertion point where the number restarts. On the Insert tab, click Page Number | Format Page Numbers. Select "Continue from previous section" and click OK.

            <p>When Microsoft was offering consumer trials of Office 2010 from its website that you could download, the site would display the trial product key on the screen and also email it to you as part of the download process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since MS has discontinued Office 2010 and moved on to Office 2013, consumer trial product keys for 2010 are no longer available.</p>

<h3> bear_99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 - create contact in address book without email address</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I have been trying to use my Outlook address book to create and save contact information for people where I might have their mailing address, phone number, or both, but no email address.&nbsp; I select New Entry and enter, for example,
 their phone number in the phone number box and their name in the "Full name" box, then select "Save and Close".&nbsp; The window closes and appears to have saved the information as a Contact.&nbsp; However, this does not appear on the list of contacts and apparently
 is not actually saved at all.&nbsp; When I do a search of the address book for the person they cannot be found.&nbsp; If the software requires an email address entry to actually save the person as a contact then I would expect a prompt prior to saving to indicate this,
 or perhaps even mention of it in the software manual.&nbsp; These are situations where I might only have a phone number for someone and I expect to contact them later for an email address.&nbsp; I don't have a cell phone so I cannot use that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions are:</p>
<p>a) is this normal?&nbsp; Must you enter an email address in order for Outlook to actually save a New Contact in your address book?&nbsp; If so, then I may work around the problem by entering their phone number in the email panel.</p>
<p>b) If Outlook actually has saved these contacts I have created and they simply are not showing in my address book, what I can do to access these "phone number only" contacts?&nbsp; Or are all those phone numbers I saved there lost forever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any assistance anyone can provide.&nbsp; I tried searches by Google and on the Microsoft site but failed to find anything addressing this specific problem as all comments are based on the assumption that one has an email address.</p>

<p>
</p><p>#1 - Only contacts that have a valid email address or fax#ax# appear in the AB which is a specialized view of the contact folder(s) designated to be a member of it. This is normal and works the same in all versions of Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Your contacts are saved in a contact folder and if you didn't select one prior to creating your contact, it will be located in the "default contact folder" for your profile. In the Outlook navigation pane - you can see all your contact folders in your
 profile in one of the following ways</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) click on the people tab at the bottom of the navigation pane or</p>
<p>b) press CTRL+3 in the Nav Pane or</p>
<p>c) press CTRL+6 in the Nav pane to show all folders of all types</p>

    <title>Accessing the raw hyperlink from a cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> euan garden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accessing the raw hyperlink from a cell</h2>
                    <p>I have an excel spreadsheet that is an exported report, there are a ton of cells that contain data like
</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://admin.livelabs.xboxlive.com/Telemetry?sessionId=deee2e90-c9b4-4b82-a591-315ebc1d4164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0563c1">deee2e90...</font></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cell actually contains a GUID, but underneath it is a hyperlink to a site where the GUID is part of the URL. When I read this column in code, or export to CSV what you see above including the ... is what I get. I really want to the GUID although the
 URL would be fine as well because the part of the URL before the GUID is the same for all the cells in the report. I tried adding a new derived column but without using VBA I can't think of a way to get the actual data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>-Euan</p>

<p>You can do this as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you must open your document in your desktop copy of Word, because you can't do the necessary steps in Word Online. Assuming the document is stored in OneDrive: click the little circle on the file's icon, click the Open command in the top banner, and
 choose "Open in Word".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In desktop Word, click Review &gt; Restrict Editing. In the pane that opens, check the box under "Editing restrictions" and then choose "Comments" in the dropdown below it.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0669b249-8355-47c9-a050-d04587910b90?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0669b249-8355-47c9-a050-d04587910b90?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Then click the "Yes, Start Enforcing Protection" button at the bottom of the pane. If you want to apply a password that will be required in order to turn off the restriction, enter it twice in the next dialog; otherwise just leave it blank and click OK.
 Save the document back to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in OneDrive you can get a link that allows editing. Because of the restriction, though, the only kind of editing that's possible -- in Word Online or in desktop Word -- will be comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that you must use an allow-editing link once the document is restricted, because the restriction prevents a non-editing link from opening (there's an error message instead). Direct download will still work, though.</p>

 looks to be an archaic exchange address, upon opening the email. &nbsp;It appears as if the Exchange Administrative Group is somehow auto generating emails to themselves, and placing them directly into user's deleted email folder. &nbsp;I searched our systems for this
 group and did not find it. &nbsp;How do we find what is causing this and stop it? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Mouran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have found the issue. &nbsp;These temporary emails can create themselves in the deleted folder when we compose a draft email, then close without saving. &nbsp;Although this does not happen all the time, I cannot conclude the exact conditions as to when this happens.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that some companies that use DirDync have a similar issue. &nbsp;We do use&nbsp;Azure AD connect, which is the successor to DirSync. &nbsp;Our company did have in-house exchange years ago, but has long been disconnected. &nbsp;Maybe Azure AD connect introduced some
 lingering legacyExchangeDN config?</p>

            Hi Anthony,<br />
<br />
Regarding “Maybe Azure AD connect introduced some lingering legacyExchangeDN config”, yes, perhaps, the LegacyExchangeDN is used for every "Exchange activated" (mail-enabled users, public folders, and Exchange system configuration objects) object in Exchange
 200x server. The Exchange Recipient Update Service (RUS) is responsible for filling the LegacyExchangeDN attribute.<br />
<br />
For more information, please refer to the following article:<br />

<h2>            Xbox Music on Surface RT Error 0xc00d36b2 &#40;0x80070035&#41; when attemtping to download album</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox Music app and have Xbox Music running on my Surface RT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I tried to download an album (Moonshine Bandits - Calicountry - don't judge, my mate asked me to listen to it).&nbsp; Anyway, when I look up the album in the search results Full Catalogue, and&nbsp;tap (...) --&gt; Download, I get the error 0xc00d36b2 0x80070035..
 Can't download.&nbsp; The item is missing or we can't get to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can stream it fine and I can also download the entire album on my Windows Phone 7.8 device without problems.&nbsp; The "For help on this" link doesn't really tell me anything/&nbsp; It says there are no results for both numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing happens for other albums.&nbsp; My subscription is up-to-date and I have restarted the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it so hard for Microsoft to make a proper music application?</p>

            <p>Hello Plettza:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having downloading music via the Xbox Music application.&nbsp; I have looked into this error a bit and it seems this most often an issue with the storage and device and not the music application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the U.S. and have a Music Pass.&nbsp; I have a Surface RT and was able to successfully download this album to my device.&nbsp; With that said, if you continue to have this issue after doing the below steps please provide us details regarding where you are
 located and how you are getting this music (Via the Music Pass or by purchasing this from the marketplace).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would suggest you do is clear your devices temp folder and delete the application from your device.&nbsp; Clear the temp folder by pressing and holding the Windows key + R and typing %temp% in the search field.&nbsp; Press enter and then highlight
 all the folders and files here.&nbsp; Delete all the content in this folder.&nbsp; If anything refuses to delete, skip it.&nbsp; Once you have done this, uninstall the application from your device.&nbsp; Once it is removed, reboot the device and reinstall the application.&nbsp; Try
 downloading the content one more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have issues with the downloads the next thing to do is go to your Windows Music Library and copy all the music files you have copied in the music folder.&nbsp; Once you have done this, create a new folder and paste the content into this folder.&nbsp;
 Once that is done, delete the original folder from your Windows libraries.&nbsp; Once you have done all of this, go back to the Music application and try downloading the albums that are giving you issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I would suggest you check your device for updates and then refresh your device.&nbsp; You can check for updates by opening your charms &gt; selecting settings &gt; change PC settings &gt; update and recovery &gt; Windows Update &gt; check now.&nbsp; Once you run any updates
 that are available, reboot the device and then try downloading again.&nbsp; If the issue continues, go to your charms &gt; settings &gt; change PC settings &gt; update and recovery &gt; recovery &gt; Get started in the "Refresh your PC without affecting your files".&nbsp; After the
 device has been refreshed, try the download one more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how this goes and what you find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

            I ended up doing a recovery on my tablet electing to remove everything and reinstall.&nbsp; This has solved the problem on my tablet to this point.&nbsp; I didn't let Xbox Music download my music.&nbsp; Instead, I am just going to select the albums and playlist to download
 when I need.

<h2>            Defender will only do periodic scanning, no real time protection</h2>
                    <p>Defender says I have another antivirus program installed, and won't turn on.</p>
<p>There was a problem with an update a few months ago, but I think it's caught up now.</p>

<p>I use both Edge and Chrome browsers, with Chrome as the default</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may happen if other security software, such as antivirus, anti-spyware, or anti-malware programs, are fully or partially installed on the computer. Windows Defender automatically turns off if you install another antivirus app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us uncheck security messages for Virus Protection and Spyware, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the<strong> Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong>, then select<strong> Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Security and Maintenance</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Change Security and Maintenance Settings</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Spyware and unwanted software protection</strong> and<strong> Virus Protection</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart the device for the changes to take effect.</li></ol>
<p>After the device restarted, make a full system scan using Windows defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn on real-time protection, do the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, then select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Defender</strong>.</li><li>Turn on <strong>Real-time protection</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>It could be that MfE doesn't like self-signed certificates for SSL but technically it should just warn you that it is self-signed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to have that problem when I was on MfE 2.7 connecting to an Exchange server with a self-signed certificate, it was a PitA and I just went an bought a real certificate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums. We are here to assist you with your Windows related issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that you are unable to connect to the Internet using Internet Explorer 10 on your Windows 8 computer, when there are no issues with Google Chrome browser. It would be great if you can provide me with some information
 regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you getting any error message while trying to connect to the Internet using the Internet Explorer 10?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From when, you have been facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen with both the versions (Modern User Interface and Desktop Interface) of Internet Explorer 10?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This might be due to some Internet Explorer performance issues. So, in order to resolve this, let’s run the Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 1: Run the automated troubleshooters</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Run Internet Explorer Performance Troubleshooter.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Internet Explorer Performance Troubleshooter is an automated tool which will check for any performance issues which are common with the Internet Explorer on the computer and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps
 and run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on “Internet Explorer Performance”.</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Run Internet Explorer Safety Troubleshooter.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This troubleshooter will check for the issues with the safety and privacy features and settings of the Internet Explorer 10. It checks for any changes to the default settings and will try to revert the changes back to default. Follow
 these steps and run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on “Internet Explorer Safety”.</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn’t help, then try the next method and check the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Check if the Add-on is causing the issue.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s check if the Add-ons are causing the issue. For this try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press the “Win Logo Key” + “R”</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type: iexplore.exe –extoff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will open the Internet Explorer with all the Add-on disabled. So now, try to access the web pages that caused the Internet Explorer to crash. If you are able to access those web pages without any issues, then you may check which
 browser add-on has caused this issue by referring the article: “Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer” from this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, then try the next method to reset the Internet Explorer Settings.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3: Reset Internet Explorer Settings</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem is caused by incorrect or incompatible Internet Explorer settings, it can be resolved by resetting the Internet Explorer settings. Click on this link and follow the instructions given in it to reset the Internet Explorer
 settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
By selecting the item, and by clicking delete normally you should be able to delete.. else there could be two reasons you can delete a file or folder..<br />
<br />
one is it is running in and used as a process or service<br />
<br />
you can use <a href="http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">unlock </a>
to kill such thing<br />
<br />
else you dont have permission or lack of permission..<br />

<div><br />

<div>I have done numerous System Restore's and keep receiving an error message telling me "'unspecified error occurred during System Restore (0x80070005)" and to disable my anitvirus software; this I have done and completely removed it from my computer. I have
 also disabled my firewalls and it still wont work.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Any suggestions????

            <p>The only "remote" chance you're going to have to recover the PST file after it's been removed from the recycle bin is by using 3rd party file recovery software assuming&nbsp;any deleted files have not already been over-written. One thing you really need to stop
 doing is write anything to your hard drive.</p>
<p>There are endless&nbsp;3rd party file recovery programs&nbsp;which can be found by doing a simple search&nbsp;using the phrase "file recovery software" (or any variation&nbsp;thereof)</p>

<p>Since this is no longer an&nbsp;Outlook specific question - any follow-up questions related to file recovery should be posted in the applicable Windows forum</p>

    <title>Upgrading to HTC 8525 to WM6 Crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kat-kane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading to HTC 8525 to WM6 Crashes</h2>
                    I recently had to replace parts of my HTC 8525, and ended up with an old version of Windows Mobile 5 ( 5.1.195 Build 14955.2.3.0) on my phone. I'm trying to upgrade to WM6, but keep having the exact same problem on three different PCs (two laptops on wireless
 connections and one desktop on a cable modem). <br />
<br />
I hook the PDA to my computer, ActiveSync runs (on the Vista laptops it's Windows Mobile Device Center obviously). I get the sync to register, and it stays connected for a long period of time. Nothing seems to interrupt the connection between the PDA and the
 computer, no matter how long I have it sit. But the second I try to run the RUU program to upgrade to WM6, it disconnects the sync relationship. It's happening as soon as I click the button to upgrade the ROM.
<br />
<br />
Not only has this been three different computers, it's been on three different USB cables, so clearly the problem has to be on the PDA itself. Also, when I switched to the older hard drive, we did a hard reset and cleared everything out. So the only software
 on the PDA is what comes with the ROM.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas? <br />
<br />
I know that the 8525's aren't optimal for running WM6, but my sister installed WM6 on her 8125, so I don't see why it shouldn't work. If I'm wrong, does anyone know where I can get the last released version of WM5, so I'm at least as upgraded as possible?
<br />
<br />
Thanks - CT<br />
<br />
Addition: I've also tried this, (rebooting every time I've changed it), with "Enable advanced network functionality" checked and unchecked in USB to PC Connections.

<div>If you're getting connection errors,&nbsp;change the USB port where your USB cable is plugged into.&nbsp; The front ports are notorious for losing the connection and/or "timing out" since they go through a hub.&nbsp; Move the cable to a rear port that connects directly
 into the motherboard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, it's normal for the Active Sync connection to "drop" and the screen go dark just before the RUU kicks in.&nbsp; It will take about 5 - 10 seconds from that point until you see the RGB screen indicating that your phone is now in bootloader mode ready to
 accept the ROM flash.</div>

<h2>            Editing text in formula bar annoyance</h2>
                    <p>When I select some text in the formula bar, and then hover over the selection, a popup font formatting dialog appears.&nbsp; Sometimes this popup gets in the way when I am trying to right click over the selection to bring up a context menu for cut, copy, paste,

<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to prevent the font formatting dialog from appearing?</p>

<h2>            Print Preview closes window, in both normal Access 2010 and its runtime</h2>
                    
<p>If the user selects file--&gt;Print --&gt; preview, for a form that is active and displayed,</p>
<p>On completion of the preview [via a close], the form is gone.&nbsp; This behavior exists for both normal and runtime execution.</p>
<p>I would expect that when the preview is done, the underlying status would be returned; it is not.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not just simply closing the form window, as when I have a invisible underlying window which<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">would</span>
</em>return if the overlying window is close, nothing returns.</p>
<p>What is the work around?</p>
<p>Do I have to manipulate the ribbon to end the access to the file menu item?&nbsp; In the runtime version, can I, as the balance of all std menu items are completely gone, already.</p>
<p>Is this a bug?</p>
<p>This unexpected behavior exists for forms opened via VBA, and for non modal windows opened manually.</p>

<p><span><span>Not only is what you're experiencing unusual behavior, but I'm actually unable to reproduce that behavior.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This is occurring for all forms, or just some?<span>&nbsp;</span>And is this occurring in all of your applications, or just some?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As we work towards troubleshooting this, I should point out as a general rule forms don't print very well and you don't have a whole lot of control as to how they will
 print. So it's generally a bad idea to try and use forms for printing as it often will wind up costing you a lot of time as you attempt to get the layout and formatting correct. The simple things such as page numbers and text boxes that can grow etc work&nbsp;in
 a far better and far superior fashion when you use a report. So, advoid this if you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However regardless of the issue of forms actually never really were that good at printer stuff, I am freely able to pull up any form in my applications and simply use
 the print preview option. When I print, and or just close the preview, the the&nbsp;form itself remains in display and available for further use.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You might want t expand on this. Is this occurring on for all forms and for all of your applications?&nbsp; Are you used tabbed windows, or overlapping windows?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I'm wondering if this is some kind of printer issue or printer driver is causing something else to not work correctly here as mentioned not only am I not seeing this
 issue and un-able to re-produce the this issue, and I have not seen any posts anywhere in any of the Access community that's also mentioned this issue .</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Another issue I would check in this case is if you have any form or code running with a timer event active.<span>&nbsp;</span>In that case you have to be careful,
 because if you have any custom code that attempts to print out the active form (such as custom menu bar or custom ribbon code), then it will often fail since a quick focus change occurs.<span>&nbsp;</span>However you seem to be hinting this occurs for
 all of your applications and all of your forms, so this is more of a long shot than anything.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this is occurring for all of your forms and all of your applications for everything that you're doing, then I would test is on a different computer, there's something
 here that is definitely different and not normal behavior.</span></span></p>

<p>Good Morning Albert:</p>
<p>I wasn't using it [and wouldn't] in Acc2010 as a functional tool, rather, I was concerned that someone would call up a preview , and that the project would then appear bugged.&nbsp; The discovery of this was connected to my bug hunting.</p>
<p>After your email, I just created [in Access 2010] a new database, designed a blank form, saved it as Form1, opened that form manually [into tabbed views], selected Preview, closed the preview, and was greeted by a "blank".</p>
<p>Curious, I created events, Load, Activate, Deactivate, Unload, Open and Close, with msgbox's.</p>
<p>This is the manual open/close sequence, without the preview, as expected:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Manually Open] --&gt; Open --&gt; Load --&gt; Activate--&gt; [Form Appears]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; [Manually Close, with, say "X"] --&gt; Unload --&gt; Deactivate</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Close --&gt; [form Disappears]</p>
<p>This is the sequence when I use print preview</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Manually Open] --&gt; Open --&gt; Load --&gt; Activate--&gt; [Form Appears] --&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; [Select Print Preview] --&gt; [Print Preview Appears]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; [concurrently, Form has "Disappeared" behind it]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; [Manually Close Print Preview with "X"] --&gt; Unload --&gt; Deactivate --&gt; Close</p>
<p>As you can see, the form becomes "hidden", to the user's perspective, and to the user is closed with the execution of the manual close of the print preview window.</p>
<p>This behavior occurs for both Tabbed and Windowed environments.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Do note that that I can manually return to "Form View" by right clicking on the tab or title bar, and then selecting Form View, instead of closing it.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Which makes me think that the print preview "view" is treated like a view internally in the access code</span></em>, except that the view is not excludable on the Form Properties, like, say, Datasheet View can
 be.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the runtime version, the print preview remains as a sole functioning element in the File menu; which is why I asked about the ribbon issues in getting rid of it.</p>
<p>This is not friendly to errant users.</p>
<p>I would have expected that a print preview would be just that; and on completion [or print] return the access window to its prior state.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would be consistent with the "Preview" modes in, say, Word 2000 or Word 2010, that a user would be accustomed
 to, [ and best I can recall, now, the mechanism in Acc2000]</p>
<p>Are you trying this in 2010?</p>

<p>Still curious, I hunted down a database I created a while back, that fires <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>Ah!&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are using the Ribbon close, and I was attempting to idiot proof the operational structure, and used the form's "X".&nbsp; There is a difference in closing the preview using the Ribbon's "X" and "closing the preview" using the FormWindow's "X".&nbsp; I was using
 the "X" on the form, itself.</p>
<p>Originally, I was using the windowed display for the database, which places the FormWindow's "X" in view of the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Obviously, if the window is only a few inches across, an "X" that is "Right There In Front of the User" becomes a potential for mischief.</em></p>
<p>(In window mode, the Preview's view of the form is the same window, however sized.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I still think that the behavior for the preview mode should be same, regardless --&nbsp; i.e., closing the preview with either "X" should return the state to that which was in place just before the preview.&nbsp; This would
 be consistent with the general user interface in Office Products.</span></p>
<p>Instead, to eliminate the closure of the Form, via the "X" on the preview window, we have to do one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>disable the Ribbon, for File/Preview in all cases </li><li>Disable the form "X" button in all Forms </li><li>Trap the form's "X" button in code, test for the "PreviewMode" [how?], and insert in lieu the Preview Close Command</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I wonder now if a preview of a report behaves in the same fashion, and whether the trapping would be a wise but not mandatory design choice iin that case</li></ul>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>[and thank you for looking at this]</p>

<p><span><span>Ok, now at least I can see your problem! And, at least now you know you're not crazy nor dreaming!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>I was trying to figure what possibly could be different between our machines, and it seems like your computer is just fine and everything is
 in fine working order.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I'm not really sure you can do a lot about this subtle UI issue. If you look close at the tool tip help when you hover over the X, it does not suggest the report will
 be closed but does show close form.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I do think I think this issue really much centers around the fact that if you want a separate window, then use overlapping windows, or better yet simply just build
 a report laid out like the form. So you do have some choices here.<span>&nbsp;</span>And that close report button on the ribbon is rather large and a easy target to hit as opposed to the small harder to see small x target. In fact, it was so small as to
 it preventing me a long time Access user from even reproducing your problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At the end of the day the general consensus is that for printing you get such better luck and results when you print a report.<span>&nbsp;</span>I actually recommend
 against trying to print forms and there's always several additional other issues that come up. This is also likely why so few people have encountered this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The best advice I have here is to lay out a report in the same layout as the form and use that. This approach is not only more reliable but solves your issue and gives
 far control of the printer in the process. (so, in a report the x closes the report).</span></span></p>

<p>Albert.....&nbsp;&nbsp; I -always- use reports !.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This whole thing comes up in the context of idiot proofing the application, with the numbers of forms all over the place, now and then, in its execution . . .</p>
<p>What I want to avoid is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">user mischief</span> , with that darned "X" on the "Preview Form"</p>
<p>[When I hover over the "X" on a previewed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
form</span> , it says "close"]</p>
<p>[The dummy report I just created, has me realizing that there is no really functional difference between a report, and a "previewed" report....so I am not worried if someone "closes" the preview.&nbsp; Though, on principled grounds, I think MS should correct
 this anomaly for both forms and reports, indeed anything that could be previewed....]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think what I hear you saying is that to idiot proof the application, the only choice is to remove the "X" on the form in the first place, and rely only on a close button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still curious about the "FILE" menu item, in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a permanent member of the Ribbon? [in standard Access, or with the RunTime version?]&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, in either version, can it be removed [and therefore replaced with a UserRibbon that includes the same
 functionality....].&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the "fix" I indicate above, I would -have- to gain RibbonX fluency to make ribbons, to avoid this subtle UI problem.</p>

<p><span><span>Actually, I am not suggesting to remove the X at all. What I am saying is you don't have anything to really worry about here as long as you provide a nice BIG button
 on the form or even the above ribbon called print. The users will choose this 9 out of 10 times and that button can thus launch the needed report in print preview.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The above is certainly quite a few less steps then file-&gt;print-&gt;print print view (that is quite a few steps). So, you users will rare choose the long file print path
 if you provide the easy way above.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think this comes down to how much control you looking to have over your users.<span>&nbsp;</span>You can hide the ribbon on startup also with one line of code as:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>DoCmd.ShowToolbar "Ribbon", acToolbarNo</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Of course the above one line of code hides everything and that might be too much hiding here. However, if it important to control this to such a fine degree then you
 most certainly can hide the print option in the back stage file menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a nice example on how do this here:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.accessribbon.de/en/index.php?Access_-_Ribbons:Ribbon_XML___Controls:Backstage_View" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.accessribbon.de/en/index.php?Access_-_Ribbons:Ribbon_XML___Controls:Backstage_View</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For the most part users will quickly learn to use the big close button on the report ribbon or the form print preview ribbon. Throw in that printing of forms occurs
 quite rare, then this becomes a manageable issue if not a minor one.<span>&nbsp; Hide the X etc. is likey too much medicine for the problem kind of thing here.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For a custom application, my choice would be to hide the file-&gt;print. And, if File-&gt;print was necessary for familiar users, then I would re-purpose the print button
 to run my own custom code that checks what form is open and launch the appropriate report. So there is lots of workarounds if such control of this issue is required here.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>At the end of the day, I not really seen this issue brought up and I most certainly learned something new here (this is new to me, but that could be just my lack of
 experince).&nbsp;This UI issue certainly does add another good reason as to why I never print forms.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Please help&#33; My incoming email no longer goes into my inbox...it now goes into a sub folder and all marked as SPAM.</h2>
                    I am using MSOutlook 2007 and have been for years...I have two email accounts set up in it and NEVER had an issue..EVER!!!..I have sub folderd with rules...as I always have and never had an issue..ever.....I do not know how this started happening but it
 started happening. One day about 3 moths ago I open up msoutlook (2007) and all of my incoming email for both accounts began doing these 2 things:<br />
<br />
1 - Going into a sub folder of one of the accounts<br />
2 - EVERYTHING marked as SPAM.<br />
<br />
For the first issue..all emails going into a sub folder: The sub folder all of my incoming emails are going into, I moved all of the emails in that sub folder to the Inbox...so now that sub folder is empty. I deleted the sub folder. I verified in account settings
 (Tools/Account Settings/bottom of "email" tab) that incoming emails are going into the Inbox....which is has ALWAYS been this way since the day I began using MSOutlook years ago. Once all of this was done, I went to another pc and emailed test emails to both
 accounts I have set up in outlook. My thinking being now that the sub folder is completely deleted those new incoming emails will have to go some where and hopefully will go in to the Inbox. When the first email arrived the strangest thing happened....in my
 Deleted folder that sub folder magically appeared, with the same name of the folder, and the 1st test email went to it.......and a few seconds later the 2nd email went to it.<br />
<br />
How can this be happening?!?!?!?!?!?! That sub folder did have a rule set for it...the rule was set to accept emails from a certain business organization....thats it..a very typical rule....and the rule worked perfectly..I never went in and changed anything
 in the rules........so not only did the subfolder re-create itself...it is still getting ALL of the incoming emails...not just the ones set up for the rules<br />
<br />
For the 2nd issue: which I believe i have corrected, I went into my McAfee virus protection, clicked on Web &amp; Email protection and turned off my Anti Spam option......the two test emails I sent myself from another computer, they did not show up as SPAM in the
 subject line...so hopefully that problem is mitigated.<br />

            I figured it out....I had a rule created (I dont know how) that was simply set to "this machine only" and the specified folder was the sub folder in question.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I went to Tools/Rules and Alerts<br />
<br />
scrolled thru all of the rules I had set and noticed one titled "this machine only".. looked in the settings for it and that sub folder for the company was the "Specified folder"....some how this rule was created ..I KNOW fr a fact i did not do it...and NO
 ONE is on my laptop..I live alone and I know my dog doesnt know how to use MSOutlook (she uses gmail...haha).....anyway, I simply deleted this rule and it fixed everything!<br />
