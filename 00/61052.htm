<h2>            Red light at the centre of xbox 360 power button</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>As I was playing a game on my Xbox the screen and console froze. When I re-start it, I started seeing a red light in the centre of the metallic console power button. Xbox has not worked since then. Here are my console details: Xbox 360 S 250GB, Serial Number:
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>This console is bought in US and is in use in India now. I have talked over chat few times (<span>chat reference:<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>), twitter and also over phone
<span>. The response so far is, the red light error needs hardware replacement and can only be serviced if the console is in US. India has no service centre to repair/replace it. When I try calling the local contact,&nbsp;</span></span>Service center: Ensure Services,&nbsp;Contact

 number: <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>, no one answers the phone.</p>
<p>I am writing here as well, to find out if there is any way to get this console fixed. Can microsoft help with the ideal situation for a customer, i.e. door pickup from India address, repair and return it. (international shipping etc.) without it costing
 me a new xbox !</p>
<p>Alternately, what is the part that needs to be replaced ? I don't see the fan running any more, so does it mean fan or its cable needs to be replaced ? Is it an IC or a board ? or is it firmware upgrade ? Can microsoft send me email with steps to fix this
 and what tools are needed to open the console with a non-disclosure clause in email ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;Discussion of self repair of consoles is against the ToU of the forums and cannot be discussed. &nbsp;Also, if you have previously opened up your console you will not be able to send it in for repairs as they will not touch it.</p>
<p>If phone support cannot set up the repair for you then you can set it up for yourself at the following link.</p>
<p><a href="http://myservice.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myservice.xbox.com/</a></p>
<p>Please be aware that if the console is out of warranty you will need to pay for the repairs.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. I have never attempted to open the xbox.</p>
<p>When I try to create a service request, I get the message: Out of region warranty warning. So this module has to be sent to US for repair and in India it cannot be repaired or replaced. Although, I bought this unit in US, if someone buys it from India and
 in case it starts showing the red dot error once the warranty expires, pretty much the user cannot do anything to fix his xbox. How will that work for anyone? Its a comment for microsoft xbox unit.</p>

<p>We can't discuss you fixing the console yourself here. Though, go through the troubleshooters on Xbox's Support website to see if anything works there. If not, you can't really do too much. Google might help, but an error like that, it could be anything.</p>

    <title>Controller only works when holding the power button. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boondock iv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller only works when holding the power button.</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing with my own controller at a friend's house the other day and everything was going fine. Suddenly my controller shuts off and when i press the button to turn it back on, the light comes on for an instant behind the "home" (power) button before
 turning off. I replaced my charge pack with full batteries thinking it was an issue there and the same thing happened. My friend had a kindle cable that happens to fit the controller, and while plugged in, the controller behaves normally, so we just plugged
 it into the xbox one and I sat close to the TV for the rest of the game. After taking it home I've made some observations, the controller turns on and will stay on (inlcuding navigating through the menu, etc.) if and only if I hold the "home" (power) button,
 the entire time. The moment I pull my thumb off the button, the controller instantly turns off. It's fairly bizarre since the controller MUST be getting power, and yet it seems to require a cable or me holding down the power button. Seeing as my xbox one didn't
 come with a cable to connect to the xbox one. I cant even temporarily fix this problem. Any advice or familiarity with this problem?</p>

<p>not really but my guess is that your controller has some issue with the batterys. tro to get some padding between the batteries and the casing could be that your batteryes are losing connection causing that issue.</p>
<p>while you have the controller plugged with a microusb cable to the xbox it will act as a wired controller &nbsp;getting its power from the console, thats why it worked at your friend's place.</p>
<p>IF anything else you should replace that controller.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue after accidentally dropping it on hard wood floor. Stays on only when holding the power button but turns immediately off when let go. Changed the batteries but only works when plugged in. Another weird note is when trying to update
 the firmware, it does not recognize a controller is even plugged in, even when swapping the cables. I am at a lost. &nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA
</strong>error<strong> </strong>indicates<strong> </strong>that an invalid memory has been referenced. Typically, the memory address is wrong or the memory address is pointing at freed memory.
</span></p>
<p><span>The error can occur after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually defective RAM, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM). Other possible causes include faulty
 system service or faulty driver code, antivirus software and corrupted NTFS volume.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest to try with the steps mentioned as under.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>Reboot the computer into safe mode with networking and check if you get the same error while accessing Google Chrome. Please refer to the steps mentioned in the link below to start computer in safe
 mode.</span></p>

    <title>External Hard Drive Recognized but not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External Hard Drive Recognized but not working</h2>
                    
<p>Alright, I have been working on this problem for some 12 hours now with no luck. The problem is, I just bought a 320GB External Hard Drive yesterday but there is a problem. I plugged it in just like any other USB device goes and it installed the drivers
 like it was supposed to. Only to then find out that windows is not assigning it to a drive letter.It shows up in device manager, however under disk manager it shows Disk 1 (the external) as a basic, 298.09GB, Online and the only thing it says in the partition
 window is '298.09 GB' and is blue (the color of Primary Paritions).</p>
<p>First thing that came to mind, try to assign a letter to the drive. Opened up disk manager and tried to assign a letter. I recieved the error "Operation failed because disk manager view is not up-to-date". So then I figured I would try to format the drive.
 "An Unexpected error has occured" is what I get.</p>
<p>I then tried to see if my USB flash drive still worked. It still worked. I tried changing the USB port I plugged into, still nothing. I tried to uninstall the driver it had installed to let it fresh install, still same problem.</p>
<p>Moved on to trying to completely reformat the drive by deleteing everything. opened up diskpart, ran the clean command, started up a new partition. In the middle of assigned the partition, it gives a similar error to when I tried using disk management to
 change the drive letter.</p>
<p>My next thought was to test out the drive on another computer to see if it was a bad drive I bought. I booted up an old Windows XP computer that is running 1.1USB. I plug the external into it and what do you know, it installs the device and I immediately
 get a format window for drive E. So I then formatted the drive and added a blank text document named 'Test.txt'. I then took the external and tried to run it back on my main laptop. Still getting the same thing.</p>
<p>I tried alternate methods found online such as deleting certain registry entries, tried external programs such as 'find and mount', 'testdisk', and a few others. Nothing seemed to work. However, while running testdisk, I was able to get testdisk to recognize
 that there was a partition there and that it had the name 'Secondary' assigned to it. I could use it to view the test.txt file inside. However, windows was still failing to assign the partition to a volume.</p>
<p>I tried to check if it was a windows 7 issue by using my grandparents laptop. I plugged it in and it did everything as it was supposed to and gave me access to the drive as intended.</p>
<p>I then decided to try something different to help rule out software issue vs hardware. My laptop has an empty 10GB of unallocated space. I used my USB flash drive that has my windows installation files to install a fresh copy of windows 7 to it. Once it
 was done and I was on my desktop, I proceeded to plug in the external hard drive and it then installed the driver like its supposed to, and then launched auto play, gave the driver a letter, and gave me full access to it under My Computer. This has ruled out
 any possible hardware / power issues. So all I can think of is a driver conflict under the main OS installation.</p>
<p>I am in the middle of running a FULL malware scan to check and see if maybe that could be the cause. But seeing as the drive is some 450GB big, its been running for over 30minutes and is at 4%. I would like to get some possible other solutions to try while
 the malware scan is running.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Please note: the main OS runs windows 7.</p>
<p>And sorry for the long post. But I wanted to make sure I was clear as possible on every thing I have tried thus far. Please note: I didn't include every little thing I attempted, so if it is a basic troubleshooting method for USBs, I have most likely already
 tried it.</p>

<p>Update: well, I seem to have done something I shouldn't have. I attempted to reset all the USB ports on the computer and now windows wont even properly recognize anything I plug into the USBs. Device manager is now filled with a lot of Unknown Devices. I
 think I am just going to reinstall windows completely because at this point things are just broken. I think either windows got corrupted, my drivers are corrupted, or I have some kind of unknown malware hiding about.</p>
<p>I will post back here whether or not the issue has been completely solved</p>

<h2>            Can I take my UK Xbox one to Singapore and play with it &#47; connect to xbox live &#47; play online</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>I live and work in the UK, but my work are sending me to Singapore for 2-3 months (which is totally awesome). &nbsp;Given the lengthy duration, I'd lke to take my xbox one with me so I have something to do. &nbsp;Will my UK xbox one work in Singapore? &nbsp;Will I be able
 to sign in to xbox live? &nbsp;Will I be able to use applications on my xbox like netflix and twitch? Will I be able to play online games like Halo 5? &nbsp;Will I be stuck with offline only or won't that even work?</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>MrTheFish.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The most usual causes are a 3rd party mouse driver and/or something running at StartUp that<br />
causes the issue. Check for any mouse driver updates if 3rd party rodent and use the Clean
<br />
Boot Methods.<br />
<br />
Use the Clean Boot and other methods to try to determine the cause of and/or eliminate the issues.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong></p>
<p>Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            It can solve you with technical support for an online chat. But I think it's insoluble, because once you activate the code, it can not be taken back.

            Thanks for replies, online support still doesn't work. I find xbox so complicated and start thinking to move to ps4. Code my child got was for silly think to get pickaxe and few other bits in game for €25 where game is free anyway and he already had it.
 It didn't let to use code on his account even that he had connection from me to play this game and to redeem code there were no options to ask parent for permission so i thought i will redeem on my acount and pickaxe appears available on game. It was first
 and last time i bought so silly think, my boy is crying and asking to buy it again. I am not expert on xbox and i never play. My account is only to monitor children and it is silly that you cannot exchange something what you haven't used and putted in wrong
 place just by mistake/lack of experience

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern, but as this deals with the licenses that are attached with those codes is related to a security concern as to why an account is unable to transfer its items from one account to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the items also came from a code would mean that the billing history is not on record except for the actual redemption that's present on the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two reasons would be the reason for the current issue that is being experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, in this case a code being redeemed on the wrong account for in-game items would have to be further discussed with the developer, in this case
<strong><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">EPIC Games</a></strong>. We'll be locking this thread due to it being related to an in-game code, but if there are any other inquiries feel free to create
 a new thread detailing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Speakers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenmerican  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Speakers</h2>
                    I have Windows 8.1 and a pretty new Microsoft Surface Pro 3. I have a Plantronics Black Wired 700 Series (bluetooth capable) headset. The headset microphone seems to be working fine. But sound comes through the Surface and not the headset. I'd rather get
 sound through the headset when it is plugged in. The headset is plugged into a USB port on a device called a "Plugable." &nbsp;How do I turn off the Surface speakers and turn on the headset speakers? Thank you.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's follow the steps as below and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure that sound is configured to recognize the headphones as the default device when they are plugged in. To do this:<br />
<br />
a. Go to <strong>“Search”</strong> from the Start page and select <strong>“Settings”</strong> from the drop down.<br />
<br />
b. Type in “<strong>adjust sound</strong>”, and select “<strong>Manage Audio Devices</strong>” from the list. It should be the last one<br />
<br />
c. Select the <strong>“Playback”</strong> tab. You should see an icon for speakers which should be marked
<strong>“Default</strong> <strong>Device”</strong>. Plug in your headphones. A second, headphone icon should appear. If it is marked
<strong>“Default</strong> <strong>Device”</strong>, close the dialog box. If it isn’t, highlight the headphone icon and select
<strong>“Set</strong> <strong>Default”</strong> from the bottom of the dialog box. Click
<strong>“Apply”</strong> and <strong>“OK”</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong>Headphones on the Surface Pro 3 apparently neither automatically disconnect the internal speakers when plugged in, nor reconnect them when unplugged. Before you start the audio playback you want to listen to through your headphone,
 you need to PLUG IN THE HEADPHONES FIRST, then start the audio playback.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3:&nbsp;</strong>If you want to change from headphones to internal speakers during the playback, you need to STOP the playback, unplug the headphones, and then re-start the playback.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong>&nbsp;Easiest thing to do is re-boot. However, if the speakers won’t work, stop the playback, plug in the headphones, start the playback, stop it again, unplug the headphones, and re-start playback.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Hi Harshad, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean exactly. Do you want to limit your internet data usage on Windows?
<br />
<br />What do you mean by "data use to system?"
<br />
<br />It may help me understand what you mean if you're able to provide a screenshot.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

            Hi  Harshad
<br />
<br />It is a little known fact that Windows Update is also uploading the Windows updates from your PC to other PC's all over the world using File Sharing . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Update
<br />
<br />Go to Advanced Options - Delivery Optimization - Advanced Optinos
<br />
<br />Pull the 4 sliders down to minimum
<br />
<br />That will limit the data used by Windows Update

            You may want to set your connection as metered. This will prevent automatic updates from downloading, and will only download when you instruct it to.

<p>Just got the new skylanders giants game. It cannot read the disk. I brought it back for another, and still cannot read disk. We tried other games, and those work fine. We have powered off, and cleaned the new disk. Still no results.&nbsp; Any suggestions would

<p>I am having the exact same problem. at first I would put it in the 360 and it would work fine until getting to a loading screen. then afterwards every time I put it in the system I would get an unrecognizable disc error. Even tried installing it to no avail.
 Thinking it may be my disc drive going bad, I tried installing other games as well as playing them from the CD and they all work fine. Even switched it out for another copy and still having issues. WTF?</p>

<p>Try this...... put the Skylanders Giants disc into the tray, then turn off the Xbox, then boot the Xbox again with the disc in the tray and see if the error goes away. &nbsp;I was having the same issue, but when I did it in this order it seemed to work. &nbsp;If I

<p>I have now swapped out the disc twice, and one time from a different store and it still says can't read disc when trying to play the game. &nbsp;The image of the game never shows up on the play game tile like all my other games do.</p>
<p>If I try to go to game details, there isn't an option to install and I get Status code: 8C230002 or the details show the first game I have in the My Games section. &nbsp;I called Microsoft and Activision and no one can figure this out. &nbsp;Activision want's to swap
 out the disc by mail. &nbsp;Microsoft seems to think it's a bug and said they will open a ticket and escalate to Activision. &nbsp;While on the phone with them, the rep talked to another rep who talked to someone else with the same issue.</p>
<p>Has anyone solved this yet?</p>

<h2>            Update for Windows 7 Pro &#40;KB2891804&#41; Failed With Error Code 800F0902</h2>
                    <p>Having recently installed Windows 7 Professional (64-bit), and spending the entire day downloading updates, rebooting, downloading more updates, rebooting, I get this error message which seems to be saying I have to reboot once again!&nbsp; At one point today,
 Windows Update indicated that everything was as it should be, but I knew it wasn't, because my version of Windows should have enabled me to obtain the Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; I have yet to see this indicated in the lower right of my taskbar.&nbsp; Sure, I may be considered
 by some to be a 'computer geek,' but to spend the inordinate amount of time trying to get my new copy of Windows 7 up to snuff, one needs to be a 'computer fanatic.'</p>
<p>There has also been a noticeable problem with Online Help ceasing to function, so I'm turning to the community for possible solutions, encouragement, etc.</p>

<h2>            Have a huge audio problem, need help</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a massive audio problem. Im using a HP pavilion laptop which has a integrated audio device. However, one day the audio stopped. The audio service is not running and no audio device is detectable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres whats i first stumbled upon:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3395493-7edf-4af4-809a-197c9cfd5c28?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3395493-7edf-4af4-809a-197c9cfd5c28?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright, what now?</p>
<p>I started investigating and attempting to fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ee5849d-06c1-4379-8b06-523e1ed06517?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ee5849d-06c1-4379-8b06-523e1ed06517?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>First i tried fixing the problem here.</p>
<p>The Logon setting was on .\Laptop, so i changed it to Local System via NT Authority. After configuring the file, the change kinda backfired...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d58c5873-0301-4ecf-80df-4f55050cda92?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d58c5873-0301-4ecf-80df-4f55050cda92?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Hmmm, now it stayes like NT AUTHORITY all the time...</p>
<p>I tried starting the system, but this was shown to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efd384b1-c6f2-4dbd-a490-85b17147bf94?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efd384b1-c6f2-4dbd-a490-85b17147bf94?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Regedit directories? All dependable running.</p>
<p>I also checked paths and well, nothing.</p>
<p>Heres Audiorv<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62b4b948-1564-4ee7-8493-64de14c55447?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62b4b948-1564-4ee7-8493-64de14c55447?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>and AudioEndpointBuilder (NOTE: AudioEndpointBuilder is the only one running, Audiosrv is stopped)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64b43187-c1d6-4692-b0a7-bb8192b7016e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64b43187-c1d6-4692-b0a7-bb8192b7016e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Ive even tried bluetooth alternatives: Nothing</p>
<p>Headphones and other audio devices externally connected arent detected.</p>
<p>I also have tried commands in cmds, still failed.</p>
<p>Ive also tried uninstalling and installing - nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was even stuck in a Realtek install loop - dont ask.</p>
<p>Still got my *%$ confused.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8822e32-93d2-45fc-aff3-e7421e0745d0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8822e32-93d2-45fc-aff3-e7421e0745d0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>What now??????</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP ME</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want my Laptop back without reseting or refreshing it. If you at least try, thanks.</p>

            Hi EM. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br /> 
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hey Greg, thanks for your reply. I will update the situation tomorrow (today, 18th), and first im here to provide additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem began on 16th between 3-4 pm. Situation reason is unknown, my brother was using the PC during the audio problem time, and he is a unreliable witness. During this event he was umm... watching Youtube and playing Roblox...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop Model:&nbsp;HP Pavilion 15 Notebook PC (wasnt mine from the beggining, bought it additionally)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleaned my PC with Malwarebytes and Windows Defender, Malwarebytes caught 8 viruses, Windows Defender didnt even notice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Enterprise (activated) if that can help you in any way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used EasyDriver program for a couple of updates (mostly realtek related)</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Personal theory: Maybe the audio device overheated? Could that be an option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and info, looks like i got a lot of things to do. Well, better start the job soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Well, i have an update. Made a huge discovery. The answer was in the images:</p>
<p>The Audiosrv directory had \serviceroot\ before the directory. You cant really change directories from services, but the same person who broke it (my brother) used Process Hacker 2 to edit the directory. This did fix it partially. However, a new problem
 arose. The troubleshooter can register that theres a problem, and "fixes" it but really does nothing... A new error message pops up when i activate the service manually:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error 1067: Process terminated unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also says that it cant start on Local Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i need to fix this thing now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, ill update the situation when new things happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i fixed the NT AUTHORITY to Local Service</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 2: discovered that the display name for Audiosrv in regedit was only Windows Audio, so i fixed it and changed it to the normal directory. Windows troubleshooter is still delusional.</p>

            I see this so rarely that the most logical explanation I've seen so far is the hack that was done.  Do you have a System Restore point or System Image backup to roll back to?  
<br />
<br />If not I'd  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<p>
</p><p>Im worried that backtracking could be very risky for my personal files, but i have no option left. I dont do backups and i will check all of your provided links. I am also going to save my data, because im in fear that something bad could be going on. Hope

            Your files should always be backed up is reckless because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can buy additional space for cheap.
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>

<br /> A better automated file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts: <a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>Tried to system restore one day back, system restore corrupted... I was thinking that only my speakers were dead, but now my mic too. Im getting tired, i cant clean restart Windows, got 150 Gb of information stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im really starting to think ill never fix this, unless i somehow handle regedit commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyways im here to provide additional info:</p>
<p>When i right click on my sound button it says this:</p>
<p>Speaker setup (UNKNOWN)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well i guess that theres a setup, it just cant load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to clean the registry or audiosrv? Noticed that the file rose from 1mb to 1,6 mb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, will keep working.</p>

            If you completed all other steps that I gave in my first post, then I'd do the Repair Install which will reinstall Windows while keeping your files and apps in place.  Takes about an hour and works well normally.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise there are other steps I gave short of that which might help.  We often find later that the skipped step was the fix.

            <p>Hi IdaBaklund,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are getting black screen with Blue screen of death. The issue could be if there&nbsp;is some system file corruption or display drivers either get corrupted or need an update. It could also be if there is some third party conflict.</p>
<p>
I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Boot the computer in Safe Mode </strong>and follow the steps mentioned under
<strong>From the sign-in screen.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>

</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Boot the computer in Clean Boot state.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If computer works fine in safe mode then try to perform clean boot and see if&nbsp;it brings any difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<h2>            Destiny 2 and halo 5 refund</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have received a message telling me it' possible to get a refund for certain games in my library ? I'e bought halo 5 and Destiny 2 and both games disappointed me greatly. The fact I have to pay more money after I've already paid $80 for Destiny just to play with my friends is ridiculous. Also halo 5 was &nbsp;vry short and full of microtransactions. Didn' okay much of either and they just sit in my ready to install. Overall I've spent almost 140 dollars on these games and have been bitterly dissapointed. Please help me get a refund!!</p>
