            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Normally you write at the beginning of a VBA macro<br />
Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = False</p>
<p>and at the end of a macro<br />
Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = True</p>
<p><span>So ScreenUpdating is what you want to set to False.</span></p>
<p><span>Some more advanced technique:</span></p>
<p><span>http://sulprobil.com/html/systemstate.html</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;Select and Delete&#34; in Office for Mac Word 2011</h2>
                    I just downloaded Office for Mac 2011 onto my new MacBook Pro 15" running Lion. &nbsp;I opened a Microsoft Word 2008 document, and it opened fine in Office foe Mac Word. I highlighted a passage of the document to delete it, and hit the delete key. Nothing happened.
 I went to the passage and just held down the delete key and it worked by holding down the delete key. It took forever though. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to delete a selected passage from a 2011 Word document by the good-old-fashion method of selecting it and hitting
 the delete key? &nbsp;Does this work in the new Office for Mac Word?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>

            <p>Hi Pam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume you mean 0x80070005 (typo).&nbsp; It would help to know when it occurs and more of the details, but lacking that, I'll provide a longer more generic response which should cover most possibilities since I have no way to target it more specifically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0x80070005 is an Access is Denied error this is because either an application or executable does not have the necessary elevation to invoke a specific action. One possibility is you are trying to do this or did the update or installation as a standard user
 instead of as an Administrator - especially if you are using XP. Login to an Admininstrator account to proceed. This is not always required and I'm not sure about your circumstances or configuration or operation system, but given that error we should err on
 the side of cautiion and use the Administrator account here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with some possible troubleshooting ideas and solutions from others who also experienced this error code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see if the answer in the following thread helps: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not try the answer and the other suggestion in this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d</a>. It is similar to the above, but includes another link which may apply depending on your version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure where you are or where you got the download or what you've done, so if the above didn't help, let's just start from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>. THIS IS
 A KEY STEP TO RESOLVING THE PROBLEM. RUN APPREMOVER EVEN IF YOU'RE SURE (one "sure" person was finally convinced to do it and found THREE AV programs on her computer she didn't even know existed - and yes, you installed it before so that shouldn't happen,
 but for some reason V4 seems to be more sensitive to that than prior versions and finds things that others let slip by).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To uninstall MSE (since you tried so we must remove that attempt), proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a><span>
 or try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a><span> If you have some problem with uninstalling the prior version, you may need to focus more on the manual procedures
 in the first link or the second link with the Mr Fixit in aggressive mode AND manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed. THIS IS A CRUCIAL STEP AND MAY BE THE KEY TO THE PROBLEM. BE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE STANDARD UNINSTALLATION WITH THE MANUAL
 PROCEDURES IN YOUR CASE IN PARTICULAR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If that doesn't work, the preferred support path is via this entry point:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/ph/15931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/ph/15931</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you choose assisted support, you will be given the choices available for your region. Further MSE assisted support in the US and Canada is no longer available. It *<strong>is</strong>* still available in many other regions of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps. If other support is not available to you, post back with as much information as possible about what happened at every step along the way and how you are trying to do this and we'll see if we can figure it out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are having problems with MSE not updating, is it just MSE or all Windows Updates? If all Windows updates, read on -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution, find and delete the contents (but not the folders themselves) of
<b>ONLY</b> the following two folders: Downloads and DataStore.</span></p>
<p><span>And this MAY help resolve the problem if it is caused by an incomplete or stuck update - but it is not guaranteed to fix the update problem because at this point we don't really know the cause. This is one cause and there are many others that this
 procedure won't resolve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try this: Click start &gt; Run &gt; paste the command below into the run box then press enter. Wait for the success message.<br />

<h2>            Hotmail Won&#39;t Open on my Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason on my laptop, when I sign into Hotmail, after I put my email address and password in, it won't find the page. It says refresh or search for a reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only had this problem recently and have always opened my Hotmail emails on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really need to resolve this asap, so any ideas would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

    <title>Adding a jpg, bmp or tif to a MS Access memo field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> royew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding a jpg, bmp or tif to a MS Access memo field</h2>
                    I have a database that allows users to paste information into a memo field.&nbsp; Sometimes the information submitted to be added to the database includes a graphic (usually a jpg or bmp file) to illustrate the concept being presented.&nbsp; The user then can output
 the submission as a PDF and share it with others for review and approval.&nbsp; However, the memo field will not accommodate the graphic file and it must be added to a Word document and included with the email sharing the information for review.&nbsp; Is there a way
 to include this in the memo field?&nbsp; If not, can this be an enhancement to MS Access?&nbsp; Would make life so much easier.

            Sorry, you can't include it in a memo field.&nbsp; You can, if using 2007 or 2010, have an attachment field where that can be attached to the record.&nbsp; But not directly in the memo field. And not likely to ever become possible due to the way text and images
 are so very different and would require some major work to make them work like that reliablly and without causing corruption.&nbsp; It may be something they would look at, but i do doubt it.

<p>I don't know why, but it seems that Word is cutting off my text in my table. Yes, I did set the row height to be exactly 0,3cm. I want it to be exactly that height. In yellow I've highlighted the cells that I have the problem with. In red, I've highlighted
 a cell where this seems to have worked. I didn't create this table from scratch, I used a template that we have floating around. Now my question is, how come the red one works, but I can't get it to work?</p>

<h2>            Setting up New Outlook Profile</h2>
                    <p>I got an E-mail telling me that I need to set up a new Outlook profile.&nbsp; I just paid for Office 365 February of this year (2016).&nbsp; when trying to set up my new profile (by following the instructions in the E-mail), I login and then a box pops up asking for
 my password.&nbsp; When I put in the password again, it is not accepted.&nbsp; I have even taken out the words, "MicrosoftAccount" before my E-mail address and it still does not work.. I am including a capture of the pop-up box.&nbsp; I have logged in with this password
 several times today and it is accepted everywhere else. &nbsp;</p>

<p>

<h2>            How to make OneNote insert extra space automatically</h2>
                    I constantly find myself manually inserting extra space before pasting or copying information to notebooks.<br />
By default OneNote overlays the new information on top of the existing or merges it.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to make OneNote automatically insert extra space?<br />
I already added a shortcut to "insert extra space" to the Quick Access Toolbar.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<ul>
<li>Select some paragraphs from a web page and drag them to a OneNote page.</li><li>Select some paragraphs from a different web page and try to drag them to the beginning of the OneNote page.</li><li>OneNote does overlay the information. </li></ul>

Did you drop the item into the same or different note container ? <br />
<br />
Can you take:<br />
- a screenshot of the problem, and <br />
- a screenshot of how you want it ?<br />

            The following trick works for me using ON2010.<br />
I see the date and time position on ON2013 page is in one line. Do you still need 3 times down-arrow push to have the first note-container ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d75efbef-bb12-4fd8-b44f-05060cca25c9" /><br />
The second drop and so on are still on the red-box position.<b><br />
<br />
<br />

            Manually inserting space is not what I want. As I wrote in my initial post for that I already added a shortcut to "insert extra space" to the Quick Access Toolbar:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4116453-1d47-4c74-bd0d-5fa4372a0727" /><br />
<br />
I want OnNote to automatically move the existing text to make enough room for the newly inserted text.<br />
When copying lots of snippets to a page it is cumbersome to always have to make space first.<br />

<br />
You are right !&nbsp; That is why I call it "trick" and not solution.<br />
That is also why I asked if you drop the copied item in the same note container or the different ones.<br />
You need the Insert Extra Writing Space command if you drop them in different note containers.<br />
You really need the "option" to make sure that no note container overlaps, but that option is not available (as far as I know)<br />
<br />
In some cases, I need that option too. I hope it can be easily toggled (on/off). However I do not want to ruin my days while waiting for that option. So, I do my trick.&nbsp; :)<br />
<br />
Here is my simpler trick for dropping copied items in the same note container. (Sorry if you feel enough already. I just want to share something works for me)<br />
<br />
<br />
<p># Make a blank page</p>
<p># Type "a" at the top of note container</p>
<p># Push Enter many times</p>
<p># Type "b" at the bottom of note container</p>
<p># If you wish, adjust the width of note container by dragging its right border-line.</p>
<p># Make the rule line appear</p>
<p># Drop the first copied-item above "b" </p>
<p># Drop the second copied-item above the first one and see the Rule-Line as your guide line</p>
Note: you can copy that blank page (having the "a", space, and "b") and keep for next use.

<h2>            &#34;Keep with next&#34; not working with frame</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two paragraphs.</p>
<p>The first is styled as a paragraph with frame, the paragraph formatting is "Line and Page Breaks" &gt; "Keep with next". It only contains a legal number, only one field.</p>
<p>The second is styled as a paragraph without frame, and "Line and Page Breaks", there is no "Widow/Orphan control", no"Keep with next", no "Keep lines together", and no "Page break before".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yet, the first paragraph happens to remain on one page&nbsp;when the second paragraph starts on the next page (as soon as the second paragraph consists of more than one line). According to some other forum discussions, I gathered that unchecking "Widow/Orphan
 control" and "Keep lines together in the second paragraph would do the trick, but it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be the problem? And what could be the solution to the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, kind regards</p>

<p>Hi Nora,<br />
<br />
For some types of documents you may not want your paragraphs to smoothly flow from one page to the next. Instead, you may want to make sure that any given paragraph appears all on one page or another. Word includes a formatting feature that allows you to ensure
 that paragraphs stay together without a page break in the middle of them. For us to assist you, we suggest that you follow the simple guide listed below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the paragraph or paragraphs you want affected by the formatting change. (If you want the change to a single paragraph only, you can simply make sure the insertion point is within that paragraph.)</li><li>Choose <strong>Paragraph</strong> from the Format menu. Word displays the Paragraph dialog box.</li><li>Make sure the <strong>Line and Page Breaks</strong> tab is selected.</li><li>Make sure the <strong>Keep Lines Together</strong> check box is selected.</li><li>Click on the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi Paolo</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to keep one paragraph (styled in a Frame) together with the next paragraph (not styled in a frame). Not the lines within a paragraph. Unfortunately, this does not work with "Keep lines together".</p>

<p>Each frame (just like other objects) has an <strong>anchor</strong> which is tied to a paragraph in the text. To find out which paragraph, first display nonprinting marks and then select the frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The important thing in this context is that each anchored object will <strong>

</p><p>Although the Frame is anchored to the next paragraph, they don't stick together across pages.</p>

<p>Your description suggests that you keep blank paragraphs in the document. Perhaps you press Enter twice to get some vertical spacing. Don't do that, and you'll see that my suggestion works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a69bd612-ddc0-415a-98ff-886205efff8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a69bd612-ddc0-415a-98ff-886205efff8e" /></a></p>
<p>For this example, I have also set the Text Wrapping to "None" for the frame paragraph (style), but the same principle applies even if you let text wrap around the frame.</p>

<p>No, I'm really not using blank paragraphs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your screenshot shows that you are using another version of Word than 2016, and that your second paragraph only contains one line. My problem appears in 2016, and only when the second paragraph contains more than one line.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This is as it should be:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da48710d-32aa-4a13-a3e1-74e38e08465f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da48710d-32aa-4a13-a3e1-74e38e08465f" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>This solution is a bit clumsy, but at least it is one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't reproduce the problem in Word 2016, then I'm wondering what might be the difference(s) in formatting or in options.</p>

<p>It is true that my initial test was in an older version of Word, but the basic idea that a frame appears on the same page as its anchor paragraph still applies. I see nothing peculiar in Word 2016. Apparently, I'm missing something. Perhaps you could share
 your example document as I suggested earlier, with a brief explanation of what you expect to see.</p>

    <title>Lifetime Hacker Insurance - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruthbrownyf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lifetime Hacker Insurance</h2>
                    <p>On Oct 2, 2012 I paid $78 + 1.99 for Lifetime Hacker Ins from a customer representative of Hotmail&nbsp; - his name is Shawn Hall - his support is
</p>
<p>Silverlink *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - reference #646134 - my customer ID 69363156.
</p>
<p>This morning I called customer support and was told by "Marc" that this was a "one time - one day" service and NOT the lifetime support I thought I paid for.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called because I was having issues with the new Outlook - Marc told me that I "needed more protection than I had" because someone had hacked into my account.&nbsp; I told him I had Norton and the above Hacker Insurance so how in the world could such a thing
 have happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He told me I should call 1-866-672-4551 which turned out to be the Billing Dept!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This very nice woman gave me the Answer Desk, who in turn gave me TechSupport.msm.com and I eventually ended up HERE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is going on?&nbsp; Have I been scammed by one of your customer reps?&nbsp; </p>

You have been scammed but not by someone from Hotmail.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<div><b>Currently, Microsoft &nbsp;only provides forum support to help our free customers. &nbsp;Hotmail/Outlook.com "ad free" (PLUS) do have phone support.</b>
<div><b><br />
</b><i><u>We believe that to best serve the needs of all our members, our support system should be universally available through forums.</u></i><br />
<br />
<b>Unfortunately there is no "live", email, chat, or "phone" support for Hotmail, Live.com, or Outlook.com</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>If you have gotten support by live, phone, or email support for Hotmail or Outlook, you may have been scammed.<br />
</b></div>
<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><strong>Its a scam.&nbsp; A well known and long running one.&nbsp; Microsoft will never ask for personal details (they already have them) and will
 never cold call you. &nbsp;Nor do they send out anti virus messages and they wont ask you to connect to your machine. &nbsp;NEVER let anyone connect remotely to your machine.</strong><br />
<br />
<b>Nor does Microsoft charge anything.</b><br />

What should you do if you receive a questionable email?</strong></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>DONT CLICK ON LINKS, Dont go to web sites that are suggested, dont give access, or volunteer information</b></div>
<div><strong><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigate the information.</strong><br />
Take some time and check up on the information. Often sites like snopes.com can provide information on known chain letters and other scams and untruths.&nbsp; Do not click on links within the mail, but do go to that company’s website, and contact their customer
 service reps via phone or online to verify the validity of the email.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Report suspicious activities.</strong><br />
If you think someone has accessed your Hotmail account, that the Live ID sign-in page looks fraudulent, or you receive an email that tries to confirm a password change you didn’t authorize, change your password immediately by going to: http://account.live.com.
 Next, help ensure your PC has not been infected with a virus or malware by running a free full-PC scan.<br />
<strong><br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help the Hotmail team identify new scams.</strong><br />
Click on the Junk button in Hotmail and select “Junk” or “Report phishing scam” to report it to the Hotmail team. Whatever you do, do not reply back to the sender.<br />

<h3> ready reckoners  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dsum Calculation Results in &#34;&#35;Error&#34;</h2>
                    Hi
<div>I am trying to get a running balance of customer accounts using Dsum, but everthing I try results in #Error and I am now tearing my hair out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In a very simplistic Example I have a table called "Testdata", which contains three fields:</div>
<div>Text Field Called "Name" which contains the customer name</div>
<div>A Date Field called "TestDate" which contains a Date (In UK format (dd/mm/yyyy) as that is where I am based)</div>
<div>A Numeric Field call "Value" which contains the value of the transaction</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I am trying to do is for each customer I would like a running sum based on the previous balance plus or minus the current transaction value. So, for Example, I might have Customer A with the following transactions:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Customer A &nbsp;- &nbsp;01/01/2012 = £100</div>
<div>Customer A &nbsp;- &nbsp;28/02/2012 = (£50)</div>
<div>Customer A &nbsp;- &nbsp;31/03/2012 = £75</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like the RunningSum to be shown as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Date &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Value &nbsp; &nbsp; Running Sum</div>
<div>Customer A &nbsp;- &nbsp;01/01/2012 = £100 &nbsp; - &nbsp;£100</div>
<div>Customer A &nbsp;- &nbsp;28/02/2012 = (£50) &nbsp; - &nbsp; £50</div>
<div>Customer A &nbsp;- &nbsp;31/03/2012 = £75 &nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp; £125</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then want to repeat the process for Customer B, &amp; Customer C etc etc</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have found the following SQL code on-line which I have adapted to suit my field and table names, but all I get in the RunningSum Column is "#Error"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>SELECT NAME, TESTDATE, VALUE,&nbsp;</p>
<p>DSum("[VALUE]","TestData","[NAME]=" &amp; [NAME] &amp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>" And [TESTDATE]&lt;=#" &amp; [TESTDATE] &amp; "#") AS RunningSum</p>
<p>FROM TestData</p>
<p>ORDER BY Name, TestDate;</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Any help that anyone can provide would be very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Note that I have tried this on Access 2007 running on an XP machine and also Access 2010 running on a Windows 7 Machine with the same results</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the syntax for both criteria&nbsp;is wrong. In your SQL string try to replace the DSum field by this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DSum("[VALUE]","TestData","[NAME]=" &amp; Chr$(34) &amp; [NAME] &amp; Chr$(34) &amp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>" And [TESTDATE]&lt;=" &amp; clng([TESTDATE])) AS RunningSum</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chr$(34) build quotes arround the string parameter, clng() converts the date to a long that is processible for the query engine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW I hope these field names&nbsp;really&nbsp;only exist in your example. "Value" and "Name" should be avoided as they are keywords in Access and VBA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook keeps asking for a password and I have deleted the profile but it still shows in my email profiles</h2>
                    <p>Since the update of the Office 365 earlier this month, I have had constant problems with the Windows Credential Manager calling for a password repeatedly. I have removed all the retained passwords here. To note that none of the passwords have been changed
 anyway since adding the email profiles so not sure why this should happen as the retained password in the credentials manager is much longer than the one the account has always had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several emails attached to my Outlook, and it was particularly troublesome with the one profile, which I decided to delete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted it via the File&gt;Account Settings and is no longer listed there, however it still appears in the listing in the left panel of&nbsp; Outlook AND it is still receiving mails, although it is nowhere in my account settings lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas for me?<br />

            Do you use 3-factor authorization? Outlook wont ask for the 2nd factor for provides - you need to use the app password instead.

<br />What type of email account was it? POP, IMAP, Outlook.com, or Microsoft Exchange?  
<br />
<br />POP data files are left in the folder list, they need to be removed from the File, Account Settings - under the Data Files tab.

<p>I was advised by the Microsoft help line to add the 2 factor authorisation on my account which was a nightmare but done. It is applicable to my account email and I entered the app password for that email address, but the other email address which is the
 Microsoft Exchange account keeps asking for the password still, even though my other 2 Microsoft Exchange passwords do not. It asks for a password whenever a mail is received on the account which is often. I tried to remove the email address so I can at least
 function but although it removes it in the account settings it does not remove it from Outlook. I have tried right clicking on the email address and saying close the email but it says I can't do that and that I need to remove it via account settings which
 I have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the profile option are you suggesting that I create a new profile and add the email addresses I want there and then can I delete the old profile where this address had been? Will that cause any problems and will I have to download all the emails
 attached to the accounts again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just don't understand how this happened as all was fine up until the update to Office 365 this week.</p>

<p>Since the update of the Office 365 earlier this month, I have had constant problems with the Windows Credential Manager calling for a password repeatedly. I have removed all the retained passwords here. To note that none of the passwords have been changed
 anyway since adding the email profiles so not sure why this should happen as the retained password in the credentials manager is much longer than the one the account has always had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several emails attached to my Outlook, and it was particularly troublesome with the one profile, which I decided to delete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted it via the File&gt;Account Settings and is no longer listed there, however it still appears in the listing in the left panel of&nbsp; Outlook AND it is still receiving mails, although it is nowhere in my account settings lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas for me?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>My issue has been resolved. It appears that there was a historic setting on the Hosted Exchange platform that was creating the problem and the service provider has removed this and I have been able to delete the mailbox.</p>

<br />Regarding the profile option are you suggesting that I create a new profile and add the email addresses I want there and then can I delete the old profile where this address had been? Will that cause any problems and will I have to download all the emails attached to the accounts again?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Yes, create a second profile with the accounts in it and see if the problem recurs. You dont need ot delete the first profile yet, at least until you see if a new one solves the problem.

<p>If you restart Outlook does that issue persist? &nbsp;Sounds like it could be a corrupted view. &nbsp;If you change to a different view (View | Change View) do you see the same behavior?</p>
<p>You could try starting Outlook with the /cleanviews switch, though be aware that any custom views you've created (if any) will be lost. &nbsp;See if this helps -<a href="http://www.officeforlawyers.com/outlook/tsol.htm#CLS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.officeforlawyers.com/outlook/tsol.htm#CLS</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may happen<span> when you have a security suite or a virus scanner installed, which was a bit overly active in protecting the Registry during your installation of Office. One way to resolve this is to uninstall your Office application and then

<h2>            How to delete old data and select new data file for an excel graph in a power point presentation</h2>
                    <p>I know how to select a different data range with in an excel file that I used to create the graph but what I want to do is delete the spreadsheet completely as the data source and replace it with a new spreadsheet that is linked and will update the PP slide
 when I make changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally created the graph in excel, copied it over to PP, pasted with links to the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a multi sheet file for each slide (over 25 slides) and now when I make changes to the data (edit data from PP slide), I need to do it in 25 places!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there is way I can get rid of the worksheet I used, replace it with ONE file and have it update the PP slide when I make changes to the ONE excel file?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Save to PDF Crashes Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catlady03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save to PDF Crashes Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the latest update to Windows 10.&nbsp; I installed that yesterday afternoon after I completed my project that requires the Save to PDF function.&nbsp; This update fixed some other critical problems with my Windows 10.&nbsp; I believe I had a corrupt Windows Explorer
 file and whatever else.&nbsp; Someone suggested that I to a reinstall of Windows 10, but that was just too big of a job and too much of a risk.&nbsp; I decided to wait for another update and that's what I received yesterday.&nbsp; I was very happy when my issues were magically
 fixed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, when I started my Excel project, the first macro I ran that contained the Save to PDF command, it went to the Save As screen and then Excel just crashed and restarted.&nbsp; I have over 100 macros that use this function.&nbsp; It is imperative that I figure
 out why this is suddenly happening.&nbsp; I certainly hope it has nothing to do with the new Windows Update, but that's what I'm afraid of.&nbsp; I don't want to go back to my old Windows problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some background on what I've done today to try to fix the issue.&nbsp; I had Microsoft Office Pro 2016.&nbsp; I uninstalled and reinstalled it and that didn't help.&nbsp; I have enabled and disabled the Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM add-in to no avail.&nbsp; So I went
 to the next option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My boss, ***Personal information deleted for security reasons.***, purchased Office 365, so I uninstalled Office Pro 2016 and I installed Office 365 on my home desktop computer (with his permission, of course).&nbsp; This has not fixed the problem either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed all updates for both products and the problem persists.&nbsp; I'm desperate!&nbsp; I need this function to work or I'm going to have one heck of a time fixing all of my macros and then manually printing them to a PDF file.&nbsp; Just not what I want to
 do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please help! </p>

There are possible reasons why saving to PDF file feature is not working on Excel 2016. To isolate the issue, kindly provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you check if you can save a normal Excel as PDF file if without using macros on it?</li><li>Have you tried to save the file as PDF using another device?</li><li>Does it only happens on a single excel file that you are trying to save as PDF file?</li></ul>
        </p>

<p>I tried to use the function directly on a file and got the same result. I only use the function on one file at a time. I haven't tried it on any other device, because this is the only one that matters. I don't use my macros on any other device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I also discovered that I can't insert pictures into a Word document either. It hangs Word as soon as I click on Insert Picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't wait to find out what else is broken with this new release. Ugh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. I hope you have some ideas about what's wrong. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, I have been using the same macros successfully for years...literally. There's nothing wrong with the language. Remember, too, that it doesn't work when not using a macro either. The function itself is broken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has to come from the Windows update I did the day before this started. It's the only viable explanation. I just have no idea how to repair it. I can't go back to my old issues with File Explorer either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No, I never said that.&nbsp; All of my macros work until they get to the Save to PDF command, at which point Excel crashes.&nbsp; Here is a sample of the language within the macro.&nbsp; This language is at the end of each routine, and the Sub and End Sub commands are
 at the beginning and end of the routine as they are supposed to be.&nbsp; I'm just giving you a snippet of the routine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF, Filename:= _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "B:\My Documents\PDF\EAM\Dashboard\ELROI SC Exp.RR Attribution.pdf", Quality:=xlQualityStandard _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , IncludeDocProperties:=True, IgnorePrintAreas:=False, OpenAfterPublish:= _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this helps or not, but I'm happy to provide the sample.&nbsp; Mind you, I didn't write these routines.&nbsp; I recorded them.</p>
<p>

            So, it turns out the Save to PDF doesn't work in Word either.&nbsp; I haven't tried anywhere else, but my guess is that this will be the case no matter where I try to use the function.&nbsp; The new update to Windows has messed this up bad.&nbsp; I can't even believe
 it... :-(<br />

<p>Firstly I am massively disappointed that after upgrading from 2013 to O365 I have these issues saving to PDF, functionality that has been there for some time but now is apparently broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually resolved this by opening through the Browser version of O365 with the file in One Drive and re-saving it, so now when I open in the desktop version of excel it saves to pdf again without crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note to Microsoft: &nbsp;Users do not have time to troubleshoot basic functionality issues and this should work out of the box</p>

<p>I fixed my problem by reverting back to my previous version of Windows 10.&nbsp; PDF is working fine again.&nbsp; No one answered my question, so I never marked it and solved.&nbsp; I don't intend to mark it as solved either, because IT'S NOT.&nbsp; I just found a way out of
 my problem by dumping the latest Windows 10 update.</p>

                    It appears that .tnl &amp; .thm files in Camera Roll on my Windows Phone are thumbnails and that if I didn't search my phone for any picture I'd taken, the phone wouldn't generate them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I being dense, or isn't that why you have a camera on your phone
 in the first place?&nbsp;&nbsp; My old Nokia didn't generate them, didn't waste the memory on them; so why now.&nbsp;&nbsp; And why do thumbnails take up SO much memory?

            Everyone who has been good enough to reply seems to be missing my point - I&nbsp;DO NOT&nbsp;want these files on my phone!!&nbsp; Each time&nbsp;I take a photo I waste 1.3 megabytes of memory.&nbsp; As&nbsp;I used to write games in less than 16 kilobytes, this seems outrageous to me.&nbsp;
 It is an insult to my intelligence to foist these bloated, badly designed, totally unnecessary files on me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems the only way to avoid them is to use an Android phone.&nbsp; But, thanks for your input everyone who replied especially SoLEiL360.

</p><blockquote>It appears that .tnl &amp; .thm files in Camera Roll on my Windows Phone are thumbnails and that if I didn't search my phone for any picture I'd taken, the phone wouldn't generate them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I being dense, or isn't that why you
 have a camera on your phone in the first place?&nbsp;&nbsp; My old Nokia didn't generate them, didn't waste the memory on them; so why now.&nbsp;&nbsp; And why do thumbnails take up SO much memory?

<p>Yes the files are unwanted for me. I have deleted those files and I the pictures are as good as earlier. I find no difference.<br />
