<h2>            Accidentally changed product Key, need help finding the original</h2>
                    So I bought this brand new laptop at the end of last year and recently got notifications saying that i need to activate Windows although it said "windows is activated using your companys something, but i kept on getting this notification which annoyed
 me so much so in my attempt to stop it I came across a YouTube video which said to write a certain command and the next Thing I know it said product key changed successfully. But this key is invalid and I need to access my old one, so my question is is there
 a way to get my old key? I'd gladly appreciate the help, thank you very much&nbsp;

            First, we need to find out which edition of Windows 10 is installed. If the system originally came with Windows 10 Home and you some how updated to Pro using a key you found on the Internet, you will need downgrade to Home by performing a clean install. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the prompt, type: slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Take a screenshot of the resulting dialog then post in a reply here.

            Yep, you have a Windows 10 Pro Volume License KMS client installed.
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise volume license clients are used by large organizations that deploy Windows 10 in bulk to hundreds or thousands of computers. Sometimes, users will copy these organization keys off the Internet and use them to install Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise, but they are blocked from activating because it can't reach appropriate KMS host (Server computer) which handles the activation request.  
<br />
<br />You need to manually reinstall Windows 10 Home:
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

            Unfortunately, as Andre said you need to do a clean install. It would automatically activate as soon as you Install Windows 10 Home.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groups or users that are granted Full Control permission for a folder can delete files and subfolders within that folder, regardless of the permissions that protect the files and subfolders. If the check boxes under Permissions for &lt;User or Group&gt; are shaded
 or if the Remove button is unavailable, the file or folder has inherited permissions from the parent folder. When adding a new user or group, by default, this user or group will have Read &amp; Execute, List Folder Contents, and Read permissions.</p>
<p>

</li><li>

<p>Hi Coolcid120,</p>
<p>1) Did you have the issue since installing the game on Windows 7?<br />
2) Did you do any recent changes to the computer after which the issue might have occurred?<br />
3) Do you face similar issue when playing any other game?<br />
4) What is the error message or error code, if any?</p>
<p>The system crashes while playing games are usually related to driver issues.</p>
<p>My first suggestion would be to update the display drivers, sound drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>If that does not fix the issue, then you may uninstall and reinstall the game and see if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>And make sure you turn off the User Account Control when you do the installation.</p>
<p>When the installation completes make sure you have the latest update patches installed form the manufacturer.</p>
<p>You need to contact the manufacturer for support regarding the patch and it seems installing the patches can fix most of the crashing issues with Battlefield 2.</p>
<p>Access the link below for Battlefield support.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Page Fault in Nonpaged Area Blue Screen and Won&#39;t System Restore</h2>
                    <p>So, flashback, my laptop was having problems with the hard drive crashed many times a day. Then, I deleted a bunch of stuff and it was working pretty well and it would only crash every once in a while. Then, the day after I installed the update I was trying
 to redownload an app because it had uninstalled incorrectly when it crashed and I got the blue screen "Page Fault in Nonpaged Area Blue Screen." Before I could eventually get into my desktop despite the crashes but with this blue screen I can't even get to
 the advanced options screen to get into safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flash-forward: I made a recovery drive with a usb and I finally got to the Advanced Options screen. I can't get to safe mode because Startup Options isn't showing up.I tried to do a system restore from about a week before the update and I got the error:</p>
<p><em>"System restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.
</em></p>
<p><em>Details: System Restore failed to replace the file (C:\Program Files(x86)\Norton Security Suite\Norton Data\22.5.2.15\Definitions\IPSDefs\NewDef~1\trigger.dat) with its original copy from the restore point.</em></p>
<p><em>An unspecified error occuredduring System Restore. (0x80070002)"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I read this was because Norton has Tamper Protection if I had known that I would have turned it off :/.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to at least get into once so I can quickly turn this off but I can't get in at all.</p>
<p>I've done <strong>chkdsk c: /r /f /v </strong>but I still got an error.</p>

            Seems clean install it the only option left for you as you are not able to get into safe mode even through USB. I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p>Ok I found out how to get to the Safe Mode menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I went to the command prompt and did: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Then, I went out of command prompt and pressed turn off computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Now, this was the part I was confused at, at first. Instead of booting through my recovery usb in the F12 options I just kept pressing F8 while it was loading until it went to the safe mode settings. I tried to get into safe mode except none of the options
 were working and it kept crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. So, I clicked repair computer which took me to the FULL Advanced Options menu. Now, repair computer has all the options that were missing in the Advanced Options recovery drive boot menu. Safe mode doesn't work for me so, now I'm reset my pc but keeping
 my files! Hopefully this works! I'm optimistic! I will update with my results.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I am a math teacher at a high school. I have been using Miracast to wirelessly connect my Surface Pro 4 to my projector, which was working excellently for a few weeks. However, yesterday it just stopped working and I have not been able out to figure out
 why - it simply won't connect, but my computer still recognizes the device.</p>
<p>

<p>I have Version 1703 and OS Build 15063.726. No updates before experiencing this issue. I only got the surface a few weeks ago so I assume its on the latest version but if you tell me how I can check. And I haven’t done much - I tried turning it off and back
 on again and deleting the device but I wasn’t sure what else to do. I read some things online but didn’t want to mess with the settings on my computer too much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Select Primary Graphics Adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michailostrowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Select Primary Graphics Adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a integrated graphics adapter and a dedicated graphics adapter. The integrated and dedicated graphics adapter are both enabled for improved connectivity since I need an extra HDMI port to connect my monitor and my TV at the same time. The image is
 mirrored. This setup works fine except my integrated graphics adapter does all the rendering. I can temporally deactivate my integrated adapter and start my application for it to run on my dedicated graphics adapter. If I then activate my graphics adapter
 again, the application is rendered on both screens by my dedicated graphics adapter. This is why I need an option in Windows to select my primary graphics adapter device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there something I can do?&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Michail, if your dedicated graphics is nVidia, in the nVidia Control Panel, turn off Optimus, this will cause your system to only see the nVidia Graphics card
<br />
<br />Optimus is an nVIdia Technology which when enabled uses the integrated video card when your system is not under a heavy video load and the nVidia card when required . . .

            Hi Michail, try the steps below, depending on the make of your graphics card
<br />
<br />For nVIdia graphics cards:
<br />
<br />Open the Nvidia Control Panel. You can do this by right-clicking on the desktop or you can find the option within the notification area of the Taskbar.
<br />
<br />Select Manage 3D Settings under 3D Settings.
<br />
<br />Click on the Program Settings tab and select the program you want to choose a graphics card for from the drop down list.
<br />
<br />Select the 'preferred graphics processor' in the drop down list (you can see what the automatic option is listed as global setting). If you want to use the dedicated graphics card, select High-performance Nvidia processor
<br />
<br />
<br />For ATI/AMD graphics cards the process varies. 
<br />
<br />Open the control center in the same way as above. 
<br />
<br />You may need to open graphics then PowerPlay and set plugged in and/or battery to maximize performance. You can also try going to graphics then 3D and move the slider to performance. Your computer may also have a switchable graphics tab where you can change the settings for individual programs.

            Hi Michail,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you're experiencing with your graphic adapters might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to a faulty driver.<br />
<br />
It seems that your concern is a complex one that is beyond the Community support scope. That being said, it would be best that you seek the most suitable advice from your PC's driver manufacturer.<br />
<br />
You may also share with us here how you can resolve this issue you're having with your graphic adapter to help those who are having the same issue as this.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

    <title>I CANNOT DELETE A FILE&#47;FOLDER ON MY LAPTOP. WINDOWS POS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yzmichaelzy  say:</h3>
<h2>            I CANNOT DELETE A FILE&#47;FOLDER ON MY LAPTOP. WINDOWS POS 10 PREVENTS IT</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently attempted to back up my entire laptop onto my Seagate backup drive. Whilst I was backing up my data, my Seagate quit. Just stopped. I knew it was the Windows 10 OS that caused this because I was getting strange prompts. As a result, my Seagate
 is destroyed. I have discovered the blame lies with a single folder that I cannot delete from my laptop. I have tried everything under the sun. I should like to delete this file without resorting to formatting my hard-drive via re-installing Windows 8.1. Screw
 Windows 10. It has destroyed 2 hard-drives, the card-reader on my laptop and several programs. Windows 10 is absolute garbage and a danger to computers. I never had a problem with Windows 8.1. I am even considering switching to Apple because NO ONE I KNOW
 has ever had these types of problems with their Apple computers. Not a one. EVERYONE I know has had hard-drives, printers etc. destroyed by Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would appreciate it if anyone had any suggestions as to how I may be rid of this file/folder. I wish to back up my computer via a second backup drive, but not until I get rid of this file/folder since it already destroyed my other hard-drive. I can
 GUARANTEE this file/folder cannot be destroyed without resorting to a reformat of my entire harddrive. Windows 10 has made it impossible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The errors I get are multiple. First, I could not get rid of the file/folder because it was still being used elsewhere. I used 'Unlocker' to no avail. After using this, I now get the 'you need permissions to affect this folder' crap. Obviously, Windows
 10 has made it impossible to delete this file/folder. As such, if I attempt to back up my hard-drive, the constant operation of this folder will prevent the backup drive from working properly, thus corrupting it as it did my previous hard-drive. Naturally,
 I hold Microsoft responsible for the destruction of my hard-drive. This is the second backup drive Windows 10 has destroyed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I challenge ANYONE to show me this particular file/folder can be deleted. I GUARANTEE it cannot, short of a complete hard-drive reformat. I even have doubts a reformat could get rid of this file/folder. Any **** 'knowitall' up to the challenge?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft Support via Chat. A moron, 'Rajesh', had not a clue. He said he needed to look up his 'resources', as in information on how to do the job. And he works for Microsoft? Seriously? I told him he needs to find another job.
</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You all may begin. </p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;That was one of the first things I attempted. Even from SAFE MODE, the file cannot so much as be touched. I attempted it even from the CMD mode. Same thing. The file is utterly indestructible. I have never seen anything like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I do thank you for your attempt to assist me. Alas, you may rest assured this file/folder cannot be deleted without a full reformat of my hard-drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you Microsoft for providing me with further problems with my devices. I have begun informing others to stay as far away not just from Windows 10, which is the most-dangerous OS I have ever seen, but to stay away from Microsoft in general.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;My Download folder. Upon continuing my efforts, the file/folder is now completely off-limits as Windows 10 suggests I have absolutely zero rights to the file/folder. As such, I cannot delete them. Odd, since I clearly have full rights to everything on
 my computer. It seems Microsoft has taken over my laptop. Nice, no?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, why would you delete the downloads folder? This folder is OS built in to store downloaded files. It's like deleting the built-in picture folder, music, and videos folder. Second, this folder did not cause you this issue. You may have downloaded a
 virus infected third-party application. And that virus crashed your drive. It's just like buying a car, crashing it to a tree, and blaming it's dealer. We just want to remind you, PC health is user's responsibility.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to delete contents WITHIN the 'Downloads' folder. I am aware the Downloads folder is an OS-dependent folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Absolutely the OS has caused this problem. Do not blame any third-party application since there are none. I have not downloaded any third-party application. I have scanned the folder many a time. It is clean as a whistle. Windows 10 OS crashed my drive.
 You see, the contents of the folder were backed up onto my Seagate back-up drive when this laptop was running Windows 8.1 OS. I was simply attempting to back up more data since the switch-over from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. I should like to remind you Windows
 10 destroyed my card-reader, which again worked fine with Windows 8.1. Are you going to blame me or a third-party application for that too? I have no third-party applications on my system. &nbsp;The folder in question contains books. That's right... books. Yet,
 it cannot be deleted. It is an impossibility. Windows 10 is the culprit. It is PROTECTING the file, and the folder within which it is contained. My location string is MY DOWNLOADS/DOWNLOADS/ OLD DOWNLOADS/folder/file. I have never attempted to delete the MY
 DOWNLOADS folder, you retard. I singled out the specific folder as above, which is contained WITHIN the folders. It is nested within. First, upon attempts to delete the folder which contains the file in question (every other file within this folder deleted
 just fine), Windows 10 responded that the file is 'busy', that it cannot be deleted. I have now discovered that Windows 10 refuses to allow me to delete the contents of my other back-up drive, claiming I have no permissions to do so. Are you going to continue
 to suggest I am the problem again? A third-party application? Are you so stupid as to believe it is anything other than Windows 10 causing the problem? This suggests Windows 10 has destroyed ANOTHER back-up drive. As such, my data is gone, and I fully blame
 Microsoft for this. Never, ever had any of these problems before upgrading to Windows 10. No wonder Microsoft is losing customers.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had a similar issue with another folder on a secondary drive. I could not delete that folder at all for no good reason. I tried the Safe mode, but still would not allow. Then I tried deleting one file at a time until the folder was empty and still unable
 to delete the empty folder. I then rebooted and tried again but nothing. Then I tried changing the folder's OWNER and security settings and after trying a few changes with the "Group or User names" it finally unlocked. No idea why it got locked in the first
 place. It was a new folder that I had just created. I have noticed however that Explorer crashes once in a while too and "needs to be re-stared"!! Very aggravating for a brand new computer with a fresh install of Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10, for a new OS kinda sucks! Some basic functions have gone back to the dark ages for who knows what reason but MS needs to pick it up and fix bugs that should NOT be there.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I shall describe my entire procedure:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The file string is as follows on my PC: This PC&gt;downloads&gt;OLD DOWNLOADS&gt;OLD DOWNLOADS&gt;file</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the second 'OLD DOWNLOADS' folder I wish to destroy. When I do so, it should also destroy the 'file' within the folder. Every other file within this 'OLD DOWNLOADS' file deleted without any problem. It is the folder itself, and the solitary folder
 located within. The solitary folder contains no programs. Only fonts (.pfb and .pfm files). I checked with my Corel Font Navigator, and the System Fonts. The fonts listed are not showing up in either, therefore they are not being used by the system. So, I
 ruled out that being the cause of the inability to delete the files due to them being 'used by other programs'. First, whenever I attempted to delete the folder 'OLD DOWNLOADS' and everything within, I would get a 'being used by other program' ****. Then,
 I used the 'UNLOCKER' tool. It says it deleted the folder and all files within. Nope. They were all still there. Right after use of this tool, any further attempt to delete the folder and the files within resulted in 'Access Denied: You'll need Administrator
 privileges to delete this folder'. I went into Properties, and checked. I have full control of the folder, yet I cannot delete it. Proof this is a problem with the OS and nothing else. Windows 10 has locked out access to this folder, on my own laptop. Anyone
 who denies this is the case as the individual above is a complete moron.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your entire efforts as stated above clearly prove the Windows 10 OS is the culprit, not anything you did wrong. As you can see, it was not necessary for me to change the OWNER and security settings because I ALREADY HAD FULL CONTROL, yet Windows 10 STILL
 denied me access to a file on my own laptop. Windows 10 needs to be dumped for the garbage OS it is. People wonder why many are switching to MAC? I know a lot of people who own MACs, and none of them have ever experienced anything like this. In fact, they
 laugh at us Windows users as being retards for using such a garbage OS.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Best decks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> black barney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best decks</h2>
                    
<p>So in the previous Magic game, Duels of the Planeswalkers 1, most people seem to agree that the best decks were:</p>
<p>1v1: Vampire deck</p>
<p>multiplayer: Elspeth's White deck (sorry I forget the name)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it too early to figure out what is best so far for Magic 2012? I have NO idea for multiplayer but for 1v1 I suspect it's either:</p>
<p>a) Ancient Depths UG deck (mana ramp leading to 10-12 cost annihaltors, etc )</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b) Wielding Steel (white equipment deck)</p>
<p>what do you guys think?</p>

<p>I've gotten to 10th place playing Vampires. &nbsp; </p>
<p>It doesn't seem to be the most powerful deck, &nbsp;But it has exceptional match-ups against the two decks you just named (which seem to be the 2 most played decks atm.)</p>
<p>The deck is pretty decent against everything else except the Jace and Chandra match-ups are a little weak.</p>

<p>petritis, i agree. Wouldn't random decks be a total blast? I would love that. Have a separate leaderboard and over a few hundred games, i think the dominant players would emerge (out of good deck tuning and better play, they should fare better and get over
 the small speed bumps of impossible occassional match-ups). </p>
<p>I think that Wielding Steel will be the new vampire deck cuz Ancient Depths is trickier to play and too many people will play it incorrectly and sub-optimally</p>

<p>Random decks would be pretty un popular I think. &nbsp;Since a lot of players only unlock all the cards for a few decks. &nbsp;Would be a pretty unfair advantage if you randomized in to a deck you haven't finished.</p>

<p>@Black Barney:&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'm keeping track of my wins and losses just to see where the good match-ups are. &nbsp;Currently I'm 16-4 against G/U, and 15-1 against mono W.&nbsp; Part of that is because most players are pretty bad,&nbsp; but I do feel these are some of Vampires strongest match-ups.
 Granted my version of Vamps is 60 cards and very efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...As for Random Decks&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Getting rid of the deck on the player selection screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd be down for both!</p>

<p>Yeah, I've no doubt that you're tracking well your W/L. I'd just be concerned that your opponents aren't playing optimized G/U or even playing them horribly wrong. Take your optimized vampire deck for a spin against the Revenge Campaign's G/U optimized deck
 on Archmage difficulty. Do a best-of-seven and if you win there, I'll be convinced.
</p>
<p>I think you're right that Vampire deck is probably 3rd strongest deck tho. Man is bloodthirst overrated tho..</p>

<p>I'll give it a shot and let you know. &nbsp;As for Bloodthirst, I have to respectfully disagree. &nbsp;Granted Bloodrage Vampire sux and should be cut. Other than that, Duskhunter Bat and Vampire Outcasts are both Solid creatures. &nbsp;Bloodthirst is extremely easy to
 get. &nbsp;So about 95% the time you play these guys you get the full benefit. &nbsp; Plus they are both exceptional creatures to add additional counters on via &nbsp;Blade/ Spread the Sickness/ Urge to feed. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I forgot about the cards that add counters, you're right about the bloodthirst dudes (I haven't unlocked the entire vamp deck yet so I was unaware of those extra cards). Can't wait to try it out fully-equipped.</p>

            I have folders in my photos that I have used for years as wallpaper with windows 8. &nbsp;When I open the folder from file explorer or from photos, the photos are there. &nbsp;I can set a picture from those picture files as wallpaper. &nbsp;But when I try to use them
 for a slideshow, the folder gives the message "no items match your search", like there's nothing in the folder.

            <p>That is normal when it's working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, the slideshow feature is asking you to choose a folder.&nbsp; So when you go to browse for it, it will only show folders. It's just like if you opened Excel and went to that folder to open something, it would show empty because Excel is only going to
 show you files you can choose from (and pictures aren't useful to Excel).</p>
<p><br />
So anyway, once you have picked the folder, click <strong>Choose This Folder </strong>
button and you're all done.&nbsp; You're not choosing picture files, so it's not going to show them to you.&nbsp; For a slideshow, the only thing you can pick is a folder.</p>

</p><p>Hopefully, I can help you out here. I suggest uninstalling your Xbox app, hard reset the phone (power down completely wait about 30 seconds then turn it back on, re-install the app and see if you are still getting that error code. If it doesn't work, please
 come back and let us know! :)</p>

<p>The only other thing I can suggest, as it seems it is a wide issue, is to add the person you are trying to join as a friend and they would also need to add you as well. Then you should be able to join them in a party. This may be a glitch in the program,
 I would also send feedback to Microsoft through the app as well letting them know about the issue as well.</p>

</p><p><span><span>In Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Updates and drivers are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific driver or update
 might temporarily cause issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic driver or update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You cannot stop Automatic Windows updates on Windows 10 but you can block certain updates for any particular driver. I suggest you to refer the steps provided by

<h2>            Modded Lobbies are in Public Matches, and I have been victimised.</h2>
                    Hey folks, This is a serious warning to everyone who is playing CoD: Ghosts Multiplayer! Modded Lobbies have been leaked online into Public Matches and many people are being infected by these patches and mods, and sadly I have been victimised in this!
 So I need some help, my account has been set to 1st Prestige 60 and I am now getting squad points after every kill I get online, I've tried resetting my Xbox to reinstate my old rank, clearing the system cache, taking the Ethernet cable out, EVERYTHING! I
 want my old rank of 41 back, I am currently wait it in a queue to talk to Activison Support, however does anyone have any support for me? This is general problem and the message needs to spread. Don't get victimised like I did. Iain

<p>Although contacting activision or infinity ward to get your rank reset is your only option.</p>
<p>Maybe you should also post on the official Call of Duty forums as well</p>

<p>only infinity ward can reset your stats and for all the people who doubted the other guy and more or less accused him of taking part in a modded lobby in your face, check out the infinity ward forum there are players on there posting with the same problem,
 are you from the usa or europs etc because im in the uk and have not had a problem with it, ill bet you any money you are from the usa because thats where all the hacks originate from, im glad over here we just play players from europe and not outside it

    <title>battery power drains too quickly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            battery power drains too quickly</h2>
                    I bought my Surface 2 about a month ago, and initially loved it. Especially the battery life - I could play songs on it, listen to the radio, and even watch an hour or two of TV streaming and I would still have a quarter of battery power left by the time
 I went to bed. For the last week, however, I've noticed the battery drains real quick. I might watch 20 mins of TV while eating my breakfast, listen to half an hour of my music collection (non streaming) while I get ready for work, and then maybe listen to
 the radio for a bit to get me through the first couple of hours. Then I notice my battery is already at quarter, and i&nbsp;need to start thinking about plugging it in. I've even noticed the battery depletes pretty quick if I just leave it to stand without doing
 anything. I've also noticed the device gets quite warm now too, both on the screen and at the back, which it never used to do.

            Greetings Firewine,
<div><br />
<div>When you close an app, swipe down from the top to the bottom of the screen, and hold until the app's tile flips over, then release to ensure that the app closes. Ensuring that the app is closed will help with Battery life as well.</div>

<p>but the video makes a fault: when the app is down the screen you have to hold it a little longer, until the app tile flips. then it's closed</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Pro and Lotus 123R5&#47;Lotus123 97 possible compatibility issues</h2>
                    Upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7Pro.&nbsp; Downloaded 123R5 data.&nbsp; Re-installed Lotus123 97 and Lotus 123R5 (w/service pack 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;When data is retrieved using 123R5 it works fine.&nbsp; When retrieved using 123 97&nbsp;it converts spread sheet dates and numbers to
 a different number.&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp;2013 is converted to 1913.&nbsp; I have Exhausted compatability solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure this is a Windows compatibility issue.&nbsp; It may be a Lotus compatibility issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;considering&nbsp;uninstalling the 97 release. but would prefer to
 save it for a second&nbsp;PC if possible.&nbsp; Any known fixes or insights appreciated as this software is no longer supported by IBM.

            Lotus SmartSuite Millennium is compatible with Windows 7 according to IBM. That would suggest that earlier versions are not.. :-(

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f7007a06-4d8f-4cda-8d88-0d29a1f1280f" title="Hong Chuen">Hong Chuen</a><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up to Surface Community. I totally got your point on this. However, checking on the Surface Book 2, we don’t have an option to connect any External monitor on the screen. The only options that we can connect the External monitor
 is using the port of the Surface book 2 keyboard, you can directly connect it there or by using Surface dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Creating an adapter is definitely a possibility, since the tablet can be connected via the "keyboard adapter" to the external monitor. Hope it'll be done in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
