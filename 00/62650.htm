<p>Why didn't they just add nos into the game from the start... and interior/exterior neons... and HYDRAULICS. I would like to take a sip of the potion and hit the 3-wheel motion as I ball down the street in my Voodoo.</p>

<p>@Mafivee, I suppose that is a good, why was it added in san andreas, and then taken away? to be honest, gta4 should not have even been called gta period because it was a downgrade, but gta5 is based off of san andreas with a lot more upgrades, and afew downgrades
 that must have been either forgotten about, or going to be used for a paid DLC. so that lets to some big questions, what was the focus on making this game? rockstar making money off in game money after they already made a ton of money from the game itself?
 was it to be the first developers to make a game and actually bonded with the players some how? because seriously, the newer a game is, I am seeing that more and more stuff is being tookin out, and hydraulics?? why the heck wasn't that added? why would they
 allow us to add all these upgrades to a car, and no nos? or is that going to be a 9.99 dlc package to be upgrading the nos in the game too? they say that the game was based off of midnight club, but every midnight club I ever played had nos in it.

<p>I know I would have had all the good stuff if I was in charge. No doubt it is either greed, laziness or stupidity... or all of them combined. It wouldn't be hard at all to have all that considering all the many other useless extras they added that we don't
 really notice or care about.</p>

<p>It may not be able to restore to the SD disk.&nbsp; Did you&nbsp;check the bin to see if those files are still there?&nbsp; Did you check to see if they are in the camera?&nbsp; Did you check the folder where you were when you were moving or deleting the files?</p>
<p>Do you know the name of any of these lost files (or the extension)?&nbsp; Let's do a complete search of your computer.&nbsp;<span>To search the entire C: drive in Vista go
 to Start / Search Box and type in ‘&lt;filename&gt; or &lt;foldername&gt;’ or EXT:&lt;extension&gt;.&nbsp; As you're typing you'll see two hyperlinks appear just above where you're typing and one will say Search Everywhere.&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; That will do a quick indexed search and
 bring up a dialog box.&nbsp; Click on Advanced Search.&nbsp; Click on the location drop down menu and find Drive C: (or you can also click on Computer for a wider search) and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed, hidden, and system files (may be slow)."&nbsp;
 Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of searching the entire drive for a file but that's how it's done in Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>=========================================================================================================================</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>The following apply to your computer.&nbsp; I don't know if they will work with the camera or the SD disk - I've never tried
 that before.&nbsp; I doubt Shadow copies will work because the files were never actually saved on the computer, but the recovery programs may work with the camera or SD card (I honestly have no idea - but this is the only option I know to find the missing files
 as they are otherwise lost - except perhaps to a data recovery technician mentioned below).</span></p>
<p><span>If you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck.&nbsp; They have what is known as Shadow
 Copies which are saves of deleted or modified files which can be retrieved in case the changes/deletions were done in error.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with

<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium, Shadow Copies is not available; however, there's an alternative that's free and mirrors the functionality of Shadow Copies called Shadow Explorer.</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Though it won't help you this time, it could very well save you in case this happens again.<br />
<br />
In case this doesn't work (not all files are available through Shadow Copies - it occurs periodically), here are some additional free recovery programs which might help:<br />

 Recuva ONLY - do not purchase any products that aren’t free – here or in any of the other links – I’m just suggesting the FREE options and have had problems with some of the commercial ones)</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/diskdigger.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/diskdigger.html</span></span></a><span>(try
 this second - if it doesn’t work either chances of recovery are very slim but you can try the other options if you wish)<br />

<p><span>Files aren't actually deleted until they are overwritten (though they're no longer available through conventional methods).&nbsp;
 If you decide to try these recovery programs, you should stop using your hard drive<strong>immediately</strong> so you don't overwrite the data you are trying to recover.&nbsp; Slave it to another PC and run the recovery from that PC.&nbsp; Even now you may have permanently
 lost some of them if you're using that same PC.&nbsp; If you can't do that (slave to another PC), you run the risk of overwriting the data with every action you do on the PC (but you still may be able to recover some or most or even all of the files - it's a matter
 of luck).<br />
<br />
Only you can decide if the data is important enough to take the PC to a data recovery expert to recover the files (they will have better programs and equipment to do so than any of us do and than I provided above).&nbsp; Do NOT go to Geek Squad or any of those big
 store centers - they mostly don't know what they're doing - take it to a data recovery expert.&nbsp; It will cost quite a bit and they usually offer no guarantees.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck and I hope this helps!</span></p>

Go to the folder where your SD disk was before being deleted.<br />
When files are restored from recycle bin, they automatically get restored to the original location.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Print to PDF &#40;redirect&#41;  prompt to save file name when using Remote Desktop RDP RDC &#63;</h2>
                    <p>When using "Microsoft Print to PDF" on my local laptop, I get the option to "Save Print Output As"&nbsp; -which is great : )</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when using the same thing via Remote Desktop ( RDC/RDP)&nbsp; "Microsoft Print to PDF (redirect n)", I get no choice - it just saves to the local user Documents folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to change the settings so I get the save as prompt over RDP, the same as the local PDF printer ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even better, can the output be sent to my Adobe Acrobat program for viewing&nbsp; first, and then save if it looks ok ? ( this is like export to PDF in web browsers )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the MS Print to PDF&nbsp; printer properties box and created new ports and redirecting ports with no luck.&nbsp; ( eg PRORTPROMPT, FILE, C:\user\desktop\*.pdf&nbsp; etc etc )</p>

            This seems to be a default behavior.

<br />
<br />The work around is to download, install a different PDF printer such as the free Foxit Reader then use that PDF printer to create a PDF:

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Foxit Reader on my local laptop, and it created the "Foxit Reader PDF Printer" in my printers list. It printed a test PDF fine on my local laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then reconnected to the remote desktop connection (RDC) , and watched the local laptop printers refreshed with (redirected n) suffix... except the Foxit Reader PDF Printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the free reader does not work with RDC redirection : (</p>
<br />
<p>I tried this with CutePDF - same result, no redirection either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Adobe PDF printer (redirect n ) did work in Windows 10 ver 1709 , but no longer works after Windows update April 2008 ver 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***To clarify, both my laptop and remote desktop are runnng Windows 10 pro. Win 10 pro allows for one user log in on RDC.&nbsp; It was the update to ver 1803 on the remote desktop computer that broke the PDF redirection feature. I use the RDC method to keep files
 off the laptop, and on a safe remote desktop PC back at the office.</p>

<br />Make sure you send short link to them. They are known to be very responsive and might be able to point it in the right direction.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>Yes, my conclusion as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mind you CutePDF and Foxit reader are free, and may not allow this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe Reader 9( which was also free ), did allow for redirection - but that broke in the last Win 10 update along with my paid for Adobe Acrobat X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my physcial printers redirect fine</p>

</p><p>I pulled out&nbsp; my backup remote desktop computer running Windows 10 ver 1703</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged in with the same laptop, and guess what I found...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe PDF(redirected) and Microsoft Print to PDF (redirected) work perfectly and provide a prompt to save the pdf file name on local the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even CutePDF Witer (redirected) now re-appears in the older version, and provides a file save name prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release.

    <title>Issue with printing using &#8203;Epson Artisan 835 and receive error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j rnewcomer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with printing using &#8203;Epson Artisan 835 and receive error message &#34;Printer could not start print job&#34;.</h2>
                    I have just installed an 835, downloaded software from internet including CD print which is my main use for a printer.&nbsp; Everything downloaded and there is a big checkmark indicating the printer is recognized but whenever I try to print a CD I get the message
 "Printer could not start print job."&nbsp; This is the third or fourth Epson CD/DVD printer I have owned and never had this trouble before.&nbsp; What can I do.&nbsp; I need to print CDs for my job.&nbsp; l see no indicators at all of anything being wrong with the hardware.&nbsp;
 Thanks - JR

            Have you restarted your computer after installing the printer? Try it. It usually does the trick.

    <title>Bluetooth audio choppy on Surface Book, results in bluetooth mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdominicryan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth audio choppy on Surface Book, results in bluetooth mouse freeze</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book (i7/16Gb/512Gb/GPU) and just got a new Bose QC35 ii headphone. I have no trouble pairing. When I play music (google music as an example) it plays well for a few seconds. Then it cuts out severely and the bluetooth mouse (Microsoft Arctouch)
 starts by lagging and then essentially freezes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse lagging started becoming a problem after the Creators update but adding the Bose headphones really killed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft support has tried reloading drivers and reinstalling the update. No fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bose headphones were immediately updated to their latest firmware before even pairing to the machine. I have a hard time believing that the fault is with them. They work wonderfully when paired to my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love my Surface Book, use it for all sorts of things, but this problem is a very big issue. At some point I would be tempted by the Surface Book 2 but not if this still a problem with the new machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pending support ticket with Microsoft but at this point I am skeptical since there was no improvement from what they tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any fixes would be much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            how do you reset logon password when you can&#39;t remember initial password&#63;</h2>
                    My neice had set up a new Lenovo Ideapad 110S laptop really quickly, &amp; unfortunately forgot the initial login password. It has Windows 10 Home loaded. Is there a way to reset it if you can't remember the initial password? Is there an default Admin logon
 account she can try ? If so what is that password?

            Hi JS.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unless one created a Password Reset drive, it depends upon the users simple ability to remember the password.  If not then there is a hidden Built-in Administrator to access to create a new User account, but it also requires booting the WIndows 10 media which is the only method to access the Repair Mode and Command Prompt required without a password.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using Option Five here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode using whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You can also try the option to System Restore.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.   
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to try System Restore, or if that fails the Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin account .  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi JSuozzi
<br />
<br />If your Niece logs into Windows 10 with a Microsoft Account, click the link below to reset that account password:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />If your Niece logs in with a Local Account, depending on the version of Windows 10, on the login screen there may be a 'Forgot My Password' link if Windows 10 is up to date. You will then get the opportunity to answer a couple of security questions
<br />
<br />If neither option is available, I am sorry the only way to get into that Account would be to Reset Windows while keeping her files:
<br />
<br />On the login screen at the bottom right is a Power Button
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep her files and apps
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi JSuozzi ,
<br />My name is Alberto, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />Please be assured that I will do my best to help you fix this issue.
<br />
<br />I would have you enable the default administrator account and try to create a new user account and see if it fixes the issue.
<br />
<br />Use the power button to restart your computer during the boot process three times (do not let it get to the end of the boot process). This should bring up the Windows Recovery Environment.
<br />
<br />a) In the Windows Recovery Environment, select command prompt. In the command prompt window, type the following command and press the “Enter” key on the keyboard:
<br />
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />b) Type net user administrator password, and then press “Enter” key. (You should see a message that the command completed successfully.)
<br />
<br />c) Type “exit”, and then press “Enter” key.
<br />
<br />d) Log off from the current account and then login to the built-in administrator account. (You’ll now see the built-in administrator account as a choice on the login screen).
<br />
<br />After enabling and logging into the built-in administrator account, try creating a new user account.
<br />
<br />Step 2: Create an administrative user account using Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />a) Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard.
<br />
<br />b) Select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu to open the elevated Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />c) In the “Command Prompt”, type the following command and press “Enter” key on the keyboard:
<br />
<br />net user username password /add
<br />
<br />(In the above command, replace “username” with any name that you would like to keep for the new account and “password” with a strong password to secure the new account)
<br />
<br />d) Now, you may logout from the current user account and then log into the new account which you have just created.
<br />

            <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD burn and<br />
CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others&nbsp;do so<br />
properly. <br />
<br />
<strong>Burn Speed used</strong>, the actual brand of disks used, and whether Live File or Mastered all come<br />
into&nbsp;play. A cleaning disk can sometimes help.<br />

<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />

These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />

<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<h2>            Youtube&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you happy it is coming as a new app to the console? I've always wanted either a web browser or YouTube to be on 360. Then I found out&nbsp;Microsoft basically&nbsp;&nbsp;vowed to never create a web browser for the system. Then with&nbsp;NXE update&nbsp;we started seeing
 apps like facebook, twitter, last FM, etc. and I thought&nbsp;a YouTube app&nbsp;was a possibility. So this is good news for me at least&nbsp;but people will complain about having these<strong> optional things.</strong>&nbsp;It just&nbsp;adds more
<strong>functionality </strong>and<strong>convenience</strong> to the <strong>entertainment system</strong>.
<strong>The old "it works better on pc" or "thats is&nbsp;what I have a pc for exuse"</strong> is very silly. Think about it if programers thought the way some of you do, we would never be able to text, surf, or do any other things we love to do on any of our devices.
 Now about the internet browser that people may&nbsp;want I don't think it will come, I don't care for it anymore to be honest, but Microsoft if the people want to surf let em' surf. (Might as well since you gaves Bing)

<p>I have no absolutely no idea how someone could even have the thought that Youtube would be Kinect only...Anyway, Youtube has had an app on PS3 forever. Not to mention youtube has an app on pretty much every phone that comes out these days. Microsoft is pretty
 late to the party. I guess that's because they were too busy pretending Kinect was more than just a gimmick.</p>

                    Ok so i have an old laptop, the Dell Inspiron 15Z with an ATI Radeon 4300 HD card, but hey, it can still pull the latest games with medium to low settings. Now, when i upgraded to windows 8.1, all I could see was the WDDM drivers for the card, and not
 the AMD drivers. SO my question, how do I get my Graphics card to work, since the older drivers that worked on windows 8 wont work on 8.1????????

<p>What do I do?! I made my xbox account when I was 14 or so. So yes, I started with parent controls. I was unable to download M rated games before I was 18. But I still have to use HER password everytime Xbox updates it's terms of service. It's absolutely
 ridiculous!!! I'm 20 years old and I shouldn't have to call my Grandmother every single time to get her password. I haven't talked to her in weeks and she's currently traveling and won't be reachable for 2 more weeks. What am I supposed to do?? Let my Xbox
 time that I PAY FOR to run out because you guys are making an adult require parental approval??</p>

<p>Lol, so I just requested a call from support. Waited on the phone for 30 minutes to talk for something that should take 2 minutes. Ended up accomplishing nothing and had to get off due to frustration. I just want my account to not be a child account anymore.
 You'd think Xbox would be smart enough to change it the day you turn 18. But whatever.
</p>
<p>And the only way I can promote my account is with a credit card. And I use the gold membership cards I buy at convenience stores. I don't own a credit card nor will I ever.</p>
<p>So the only way to promote to a parent account is to sit on the phone for another 30 minutes and hope they actually know what they are doing this time.</p>
<p>I often debated just creating a new account but why? Why do I have to create a new account when microsoft could fix all this with the click of a button??</p>
<p>Dumb stuff like this is exactly why I'm getting a PS4 and not an Xbox One!!!</p>

            <p>Hey there Koala! Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br />When you become a legal adult you're able to promote your own account. All you need is the parental account information one last time for the promotion. <strong>The instructions for how to promote your child account to an adult account can be found on our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/online-privacy-and-safety/online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live and Zune online safety and privacy</a> support article. Just click on the link to "Promote a child account to an adult account in Xbox" at the top of the page and it will take you to the instructions.</strong><br /><br />Let us know if you have any questions. =)</p>

<p>Mister Cerb, you cannot promote yourself until you sign in by accepting the TOU, which we are all unable to do. &nbsp;If it was simply promoting the account none of us would have these issues. &nbsp;We don't have the passwords for the parental controls, OBVIOUSLY.
 &nbsp;That is the issue here: bypassing this ridiculously obsolete parental-control setting. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Cerb, I'm having the exact same problem as Koala, only a little worse. I'm also 20 and I've never been able to promote my account, the reason being that the email and password used for my parent account haven't existed since before I turned 18. My mother
 deleted it at one point without telling me, and she can't remember her old password. Also, I thought I'd try going through the promotion process to see if there was some way to do it without needing the parental info, but every time I try to access my account
 page there's an error in the site and it won't load (code: 1D80187A336E1C6). So even if I had the proper credentials I still woudn't be capable of promoting my account...</p>
<p>Right now I can't use my XBox at all because all of my save games are in the cloud. Kinda irked.</p>

<p>@ Marverick: Unless you just turned 18 yesterday or today then you should of promoted the account earlier when you turned 18. If you just turned 18 then you need to accept the TOU with parents permission, but you cant promote without parents permission anyway
 so you would still need the same info it is asking you for the TOU.</p>
<p>@ Kenny: You can still attempt to reset the password without the email. Try going to account.live.com and follow the can't access your account link. It will give a couple options depending on how they set up the account. If you are unable to use any of the
 listed options you can fill out the ACSR form to attempt a reset. Should that fail you can call support and have them escalate the issue for manual verification.
</p>
<p>Although, if your main problem is your mom deleted the email, you can also just try recreating it. As long as the address is the same it will still work.</p>

If you've already promoted your account from a child to an adult after accepting this Terms of Use, you should not have issues with need a parent account for any future Terms of Use updates.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi JohnMcKay 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; On the right side, Click Printer &gt; Run the troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Clear Spooler
<br />Type Services in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to Print Spooler &gt; Right-click and choose Stop for the Print Spooler service &gt; Go to C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. You can also type %windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS into the address bar in Explorer if the C drive is not the default Windows partition &gt; Delete all the files in this folder &gt; Services console and right-click and choose Start for the Print Spooler service
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Windows 10 Plug and Play Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been struggling with this for weeks now, and no amount of searching or pulling my hair has solved this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple microphones and a Bluetooth receiver that I wish to hook up to my computer via USB ports. My computer has the required specifications for both Windows 10 and the hardware. The hardware, according to manufacturer websites, is compatible with
 Windows 10. The hardware has worked previously on this computer and with Windows 10, though with some minor connection issues that I had previously&nbsp;attuned to hardware issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware is designed to not need a driver before using. They are "plug and play" devices. That said, I downloaded the Windows 8.1 drivers for the Bluetooth receiver and installed them to see if that made a difference. It didn't and the computer failed
 to recognize the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, the computer spits an error that there are no drivers for the (manufacturer told) compatible hardware that does not have drivers in existence for the OS and/or the device itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have unplugged and plugged back in, I have reset my USB ports, I have downloaded and installed backdated drivers, I have updated my existing drivers. Nothing has worked. I am currently speaking to someone on Twitter Windows Support, but they have not gotten
 back to me on a solution for my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other users with a similar problem indicate that an update in '15 caused this issue. The only solution anyone has come up with is "continuously unplug and plug back in until recognized", but I have done that over several weeks and have not found success.
 Is there another way to solve this issue without reverting back to 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any and all responses!</p>
                </div>

            <p>Have your motherboard checked as this might be a hardware related concern or your system (hardware) is not compatible with Windows 10. Though it might have been working before, there were instances that outdated hardware components are no longer supported
 by Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to consider on using your system for the lower Windows versions instead.</p>
<p>If you really want to stick with Windows 10, highly suggested that you upgrade your PC components.</p>

            <p>My version/build is: 10/10240. I am updated to what is current as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bluetooth receiver is a Kinivo USB 3.0. The most updated driver available it Windows 8.1. I installed it, but the computer failed to recognize it for the device itself.&nbsp;On the Kinivo&nbsp;website&nbsp;they claim no driver is necessary for install on Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One microphone is a Blue Yeti (not the pro). The other is a Floureon BM-800. Both are Windows 10 compatible according to the manufacturers. No drivers are needed (nor exist) to run these microphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the microphones and the Bluetooth receiver (all plug-and-play, no driver, compatible with Windows 10 according to manufacturer) give a Code 28 response - or, they say that a driver is needed when there is none in existence and even the manufacturer
 says Windows 10 should not need one. This is not upon plug-in but when checked in Device Manager. Upon plug-in there is no indication that anything is wrong or that the devices are working. Upon searching for the devices it shows that they are not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other instances, users have stated that the manufacturer can't solve the problem because it "must be a Windows 10 issue" and Microsoft says it "must be a hardware problem". I find it unlikely that both those statements are true. I also find it unlikely
 that three plug-and-play devices, unrelated to each other in brand and manufacturing, all have failed at one time.</p>

            <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 my computer has been in the "shop" three times for reformatting and other OS issues. About three months ago they checked my on-board computer hardware and found no issues relating to it that would be causing the issues my computer
 is experiencing. While I acknowledge that, in computer-time, anything can happen in three months, I doubt my motherboard started failing immediately after reformatting my HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reasoning for not wanting to install Windows 8.1 (again) is more due to laziness than anything else. I find it easier to solve a hardware issue than reinstalling a TB worth of data for the third time in nine months. That said, Microsoft seems dead-set
 on making sure everyone is using Windows 10 and much of their backward-compatibility is no longer there. I have no other issues at the moment with my computer than slow startup (which is my own fault for wanting Outlook to start with the OS) and this hardware
 issue. It would seem strange to me to install a previous OS when my computer is functioning fine beyond that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that not all plug-and-play hardware is failing to work, only some of them, which would indicate that my on-board hardware is just fine and there is an issue with how certain devices are handled within the OS itself. However, I have no idea
 if my Bluetooth Reciever is classified as an audio device or not. That might change my mind about upgrading&nbsp;on-board hardware to something more '10 compatible.</p>

            <p>Therefore I can conclude that it's more on about compatibility issues with the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reverting to the previous operating system is one of the workaround for that or you can replace the devices which can be compatible with Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I have to respectfully disagree that it is a compatibility issue. All three devices are listed on their respective manufacturer websites as &nbsp;compatible with Windows 10 without &nbsp;need for any extra software, hardware or drivers. In other cases, the manufacturers
 of &nbsp;the Yeti microphone I have are so perplexed that their microphone doesn't work at they tell consumers that it is a Microsoft issue as everything works fine on their end. In some cases the microphones work after replugging multiple times and in others they
 work fine with no problems. I, unfortunately, have been in the group of people who it doesn't work at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's obviously an issue, but with all the research I have done with the hardware I have, I doubt it's because the devices aren't compatible with my OS. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Becca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you have another PC that you can connect your device? The latest version of Windows 10 is 14393.321. Please refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I also had this problem in trying to connect a plug-and-play DVD that had worked OK before I upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem was solved by going into Settings / Devices / Connected Devices and on this page there is a section "Download over Metered Connections" which is defaulted to "off". I simply switched it on and my plug and play was instantly working - worked also
 for my android phone which was having trouble connecting as well.</p>

<p>Hi All -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me take this one step further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a USB headset with microphone that I have been using for 4-5 years. Never installed any software. It was plug and play all the way. It went from Win 7 to Win 10 with no issues at all.&nbsp; Tonight, after a flash player vulnerability patch yesterday, suddenly
 it's 'malfunctioning' and windows no longer recognizes it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add to that, I also have a Swann surveillance system that I view on my PC via an app that also came from Win 7 to Win 10 on my PC with no problems. Tonight it too stopped working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I killed the flash vulnerability update from Windows. That's the only thing that's changed from 11 Oct 17 to now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded new drivers for my USB headset from the manufacturers webpage and the application won't open. It acts like it is but nothing happens. I went back through the Windows utilities and finally after much struggling and profanity, got the headset
 working again without any apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Swann and they removed the old app and installed a new one. It was working fine until I restarted my machine, now the app opens, it says connected to my cameras (which are connected via ether) but does not "see" them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went back to look at updates and sure enough the flash vulnerability update is in there again. Killed it again and now I have to go back and redo this all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now neither of these things need flash or have anything to do with flash, so why is a flash patch causing this? What clever individual patched vulnerabilities only to kill plug and play? The guys that came up with creator's edition? That was a cluster. Fortunately
 I could set my machine back to a previous save and rescue myself from creator's. This little gem has my machine 'forgetting' all time periods before today and so I can't rescue myself from this patch. Further, there is no more 'troubleshooting' function for
 windows on my machine, as if that ever worked anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone beta or even alpha test these things before you unleash them on us? USB headsets and surveillance systems (and I hope that's all the problems I have. Still not sure) are very commonplace things. If this went live 16 October, surely on 20 October
 you have a patch for the patch?</p>
<p>

    <title>Winddows fails to start after Sysprep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Winddows fails to start after Sysprep</h2>
                    I have been having a tough time getting a Windows 7 64-bit deployment to work on a Dell Optiplex 760. &nbsp;I installed Windows 7, ran it in Audit mode, installed all drivers, installed the basic software (Java, Flash, Shockwave, etc) and Office 2007, and made
 sure Windows and Office updates were installed. &nbsp;I have an unattend file that has worked for me in the past on HP workstations (also 64-bit) so I sysprepped it using that, pushed it up to our WDS but when I bring it back down even to the same Dell 760 it tries
 to boot into Windows, but restarts then says Windows failed to start possibly due to a software or hardware change. &nbsp;I tried pulling all the drivers using Double Driver and including them in a driver group on the WDS but it does the same thing. &nbsp;I tried running
 a Startup repair from the Windows DVD, but it says it cannot fix the problem. &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can try next? &nbsp;

            <p>Hi, I have just purchased a brand new pc with windows 10 pre-installed, however I am experiencing the same problem. There seem to be endless posts regarding this problem, but if anyone can&nbsp;help I would be grateful. Unfortunately I am not very techy and cannot
 really be doing with discs and re-installs. The situation currently seems to be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open Update and Security, and check for updates. Upgrade to Windows 10 Home version 1511, 10586 appears. I then click on details, and it states restart required, so I am assuming it has downloaded. I&nbsp;then download and run the Windows 10 upgrade troubleshooter
 (as administrator).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes changes to Windows update components. It stops and restarts bits service and cryptsvc service. On completion it states Windows update components must be repaired and also fixed (green tick)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then restart the PC, but nothing happens. there is nothing to indicate the&nbsp;download is being configured or installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then receive a notification&nbsp;which just says&nbsp;We couldn't finish installing updates. When I click on the notification it takes me back to the Update and Security window which says my PC is up to date. However when I then search for updates to upgrade simply
 appears again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially had problems with other security updates as well, but these have now been resolved and installed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also spoken to Microsoft tech support who advised me to try disabling my third party antivirus and retry, but this didn't seem to work either.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>i apologize for not addressing you in a timely manner. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to try <strong><span>manually reset the Windows Updates Components</span></strong> once again and then
<strong><span>reinitiate the Windows Update process.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Resetting Windows Update Components&nbsp;will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press <strong><span>Windows Key + X</span></strong> on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Stop the <strong><span>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer </span>
</strong>and the <strong><span>Windows Update Services</span></strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>3. Now rename the <strong><span>SoftwareDistribution</span></strong> and
<strong><span>Catroot2</span></strong> folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong><span>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</span></strong> and the

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>i apologize for not addressing you in a timely manner. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to try <strong><span>manually reset the Windows Updates Components</span></strong> once again and then
<strong><span>reinitiate the Windows Update process.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Resetting Windows Update Components&nbsp;will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press <strong><span>Windows Key + X</span></strong> on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Stop the <strong><span>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer </span>
</strong>and the <strong><span>Windows Update Services</span></strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>3. Now rename the <strong><span>SoftwareDistribution</span></strong> and
<strong><span>Catroot2</span></strong> folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong><span>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</span></strong> and the
<strong><span>Windows Update Services</span></strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong><span>ENTER</span></strong> key after you type each command.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net start bits </span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>5. Type <strong><span>Exit </span></strong>in the <strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong> to close it and then restart the computer.</span></span></p>

</p><p>Hi, really pleased to say this worked and the upgrade&nbsp;has now successfully&nbsp;downloaded and installed&nbsp;on the second attempt. At the first attempt the download appeared to&nbsp;stick at 25% at which point the upgrade&nbsp;title disappeared and it simply said update available,&nbsp;although
 I may possibly have not given it enough time. I would also mention that when I entered the command prompt
<strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old </strong>it said Access denied, however I carried on and followed through with the rest of the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole process&nbsp;must have taken&nbsp;about&nbsp;4 hours, but I'm so pleased to have finally resolved this. Many thanks for your assistance, and apologies&nbsp;to OP for&nbsp;hijacking the thread.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 hibernate only logs me out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sanabalisdragon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 hibernate only logs me out</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I restarted and updated my windows with the following updates: KB4074588 and KB4093112. After that, I upgraded the Windows 10 Home to the Professional version using System settings -&gt; Activation. After reboot, I enabled Hyper-V and restarted again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I found out that my computer won't hibernate anymore. The screen just goes blank for a few seconds, and then login screen is displayed. It doesn't work, regardless if I use the power button or the menu options. The behavior remains the same if
 I try to hibernate from the login screen; it just blanks out for a few seconds, as if trying to hibernate, and goes back to login screen. It does not turn off the computer - no bios boot screen, no windows loading screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the following steps: </p>
<p>1. Switched Fast startup to OFF</p>
<p>2. Removed video card drivers</p>
<p>3. Updated video card drivers</p>
<p>4. Updated the Intel(R) Management Engine Interface</p>
<p>5. Ran Troubleshoot for the Power and also for the Windows Update</p>
<p>6. Disabled hibernate (powercfg -h off), rebooted and then re-enabled it (powercfg -h on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the actions helped at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Configuration:</p>
<p>Alienware 17 R3</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Info (text file) at the following link:</p>
<p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zEO0dD_64QyK8tTUQVzsXWWdawOIArw3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use hibernate daily, please help,</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  I also rely on Hibernate in place of Shutdown.
<br />
<br />Does Sleep not work also?  
<br />
<br />In Power options set Display and Sleep to 1 minute timeout, Hibernate to 2 minutes.  Sit back and observe what happens.  
<br />
<br />Go over these steps for Sleep mode issues  which also govern Hibernate:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />  If this is Fall Creators Update Version 1709, which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About, you can also roll it back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide it using the same tool above until it matures.  
<br />
<br /> If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>

<p><span><span><span>Hi Andy,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may first check if the Volume Shadow Copy service is started and set to automatic.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To check the service</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the start Search box type Services</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Check if the below mentioned services has the mentioned status and start up type.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Volume Shadow Copy Service&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Started&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also check the dependency services that are required for System Restore Service to run.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To check that double click on the service and click on the dependency tab.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the
 file. To do this, follow the link given below.</span></span></span></p>
