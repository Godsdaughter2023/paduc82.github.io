<h2>            WHITE TAB ON EXPLORER IN WINDOWS 10 INSIDER</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I've installed new version on Windows 10, namely windows 10 insider, and I applied on dark theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All things are black except on tab explorer, it is WHITE, I think it is bug on this preview version. Do you guys have the same problem with me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you guys know how to fix it, feel free to respond my question.</p>
<p>Best regards and thanks for concern</p>

    <title>Win 10 TP Alt Tab issues when Ingame - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> warrentrollip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 TP Alt Tab issues when Ingame</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I got issues from all build versions sofar,and even reloaded completely to troubleshoot and still experience this</p>
<p>When im in game and trying to alt tab to desktop it jumps back to the game screen..Need to keep in alt tab and than select the start button while alt tab in still pressed only then it takes me to the desktop.The biggest issue here is that sometimes
 when i try doing this,the screen doesn't swop between desktop but instead giving me black screen(like its not responding),and i then need to force shutdown pc,as not even the ctrl alt delete works.There is big issue with the basic alt &nbsp;tab issue when playing
 games.if someone can please confirm this,or is it something like graphics drivers?</p>
<p>Im using Nvidia 770 gtx card,with latest drivers installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this should be addressed in next build at-least,it will make a big difference for testing out OS for gamers</p>

<h2>            OneNote Notebooks Gone</h2>
                    <p>I appear to have lost 6 months of OneNote notes overnight...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked OneDrive and backup folders, notebook recycle bin, tried searching for the notebook names, and attempted to access the OneNote website (doesn't appear to be working this morning). The notebooks are nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on where else to search for these files?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Karina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No luck with the provided troubleshooting steps. I've spoken with several OneNote customer service folks, who haven't been able to help me. I've spoken to OneDrive folks, who also haven't been able to help me. It doesn't seem possible that all of these notebooks
 have just "disappeared" overnight, but I'm not sure who to talk to next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's helpful, the notebooks went missing when a Microsoft Update was pushed. Is this a clue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. Yes, I have completed the entire checklist on your link. There is only one local notebook file (quick notes) and the rest are hyperlinks to my OneDrive. &nbsp;Below is a screen shot of the documents in one drive. They are not files,
 but URL's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I attempted to download from these URL's, I get the message the files no longer exist or I don't
 have access. I have submitted a ticket to the OneDrive team, but they told me this was a OneNote issue. I disagree, but what can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Eric ~ Welcome to the Community. Rather than "export" the file, you need to "share" the notebook from the PC to OneDrive. Then OneNote for Mac will sync the notebook down from OneDrive. Read more in this old thread:</p>

            <p>Thanks for the fast reply AlancitoXV</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I did on my PC. I went into OneNote on my PC went to </p>
<p>Files&gt;Share&gt;Browse&gt;(Keyed in a Notebook Name)&gt;Move&nbsp;&nbsp; Notebook name = Sample</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few questions </p>
<p>1) I am assuming that I will copy my PC Sample folder and bring it to my MAC?</p>
<p>2) What folder do I put the Sample folder in that is coming from my PC?</p>
<p>3) What if I have a single Page in OneNote on my PC that I would like to bring over to my MAC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not real interested in syncing&nbsp;my PC&nbsp;to my&nbsp;MAC. There will be times that I am writing OneNotes on my PC that I need only on my &nbsp;MAC and then remove the Page from&nbsp;my&nbsp;PC.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Eric ~ You're welcome and it's Mac, not MAC.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><em>1) I am assuming that I will copy my PC Sample folder and bring it to my MAC?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, the "share" to OneDrive you did, followed by the automatic syncing done by OneNote for Mac should be enough. To check the "share" worked, log in to OneDrive:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?gologin=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?gologin=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>...and look to see whether the notebook you "shared" from your PC is now in the Documents folder there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2) What folder do I put the Sample folder in that is coming from my PC?</em></p>
<p>You don't put folders anywhere — the process is automatic following the "share" to OneDrive you did. OneNote for Mac should "see" the notebook in OneDrive's Documents folder and sync it down to OneNote for Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>3) What if I have a single Page in OneNote on my PC that I would like to bring over to my MAC?</em></p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I am not real interested in syncing&nbsp;my PC&nbsp;to my&nbsp;MAC.</em></p>
<p>The syncing is between PC &amp; OneDrive, and Mac &amp; OneDrive. If you don't want the PC &amp; OneDrive sync, I suppose you'll have to sign out of OneNote on your PC. (I'm not a PC user, so I'm not sure.)</p>

            <p>Hi AlancitoXV</p>
<p>&nbsp;don't know how my iMac OneNote folder &nbsp;is going to see my PC OneNote.</p>
<p>My PC is in my office in one town and my iMac is at my home in another. </p>
<p>I can not get access to my PC at work from my iMac at home or vise versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>this is why I&nbsp;started with&nbsp;exporting my folder&nbsp;from my PC then email my file to my iMac.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Eric ~ The link/connection between your PC and Mac is OneDrive — OneDrive being Microsoft's own computers (servers) accessed via the internet. That's why you should first "share" the notebook from your PC to OneDrive. Then your Mac will "see" the notebook
 on OneDrive and sync it down from OneDrive to your Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see the notebook you "shared" from your PC to OneDrive in the Documents folder here?:&nbsp;</p>

    <title>I embedded &#40;&#63;&#41; a chart from Excel into my Word 2016 doc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jschuexj  say:</h3>
<h2>            I embedded &#40;&#63;&#41; a chart from Excel into my Word 2016 doc and now I can&#39;t remove it.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Word 2016 doc with several charts, all copy/pasted from Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one chart in the document I cannot remove. It appears to be embedded. I can't click on it. If I try, nothing happens in the ribbon or elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hovering over the chart with my cursor displays the arrow cross cursor, except I cannot move, select, or do anything with the chart. What I want to do is delete it entirely and replace it with a different chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems I've embedded it as an object. I can actually move the chart by using the enter key to move the text to the right of it. It appears anchored to the text. I can select the object, along with the surrounding text, which does show the anchor symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have already tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Clicking on it and moving it as normal. No go.</li><li>Right clicking on it does nothing.</li><li>Layout options cannot be accessed through the chart since I can't select it.</li><li>Using enter to move the text onto the next page, so I can delete the page and the object. Nope.</li><li>Using Select Special to search for graphics. It does not appear to be a graphic as Word defines that.</li><li>Using the Selection Pane to get at it. It does appear that Word sees this object as Chart 1, however I cannot select it through the pane. I can only hide/unhide the graphic.</li><li>Messing around with find/replace, to no avail.</li><li>Word no longer seems to view it as an actionable object. No contextual actions work. I may as well be be clicking on some random spot in the text.</li></ul>
<p>It would seem that I was experimenting with different ways to put this chart in, likely chose to embed as object, then decided to copy/paste the rest of my charts in a more normal fashion. There has been a lot of fiddling. Whatever I did, I cannot do anything
 with this chart now. But it has to go, to be replaced with an updated chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last ditch option will be to save the entire document as .txt, open that in a new Word doc, and put it all together from scratch again. That seems silly, since it's just one chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the very least I would like to understand what this object has become. I say I embedded it, but I am not certain of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get this chart out of my document?</p>

<p>Typing in the rest of the document is fine/normal. It's only when I'm trying to type (or edit) a comment that the typing slows way, way, way down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a Google search and noticed that this was a big problem with Word 2007, and a lot of people suggested fixes. Not so with Word 2013, as far as I can tell. (That is, I can't find a lot of other people having this problem in Word 2013.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be welcome. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Safe Mode didn't help. I couldn't run the troubleshooter because (I'm guessing), I'm running the cloud-based version of Office 360, so the troubleshooter doesn't recognize that I have Office installed. I deleted the Word data registry subkey, and that improved
 things for about a day, but then they reverted to "normal" or worse.</p>

            OK, thanks for the clarification. I would have thought that the Fixit should work even for click-to-run installations, but it seems as if it doesn't. :-(<br />

            Thanks for taking the time to respond. The workaround I've been using is to work in "Simple Markup" mode (I'm in Word 2013), which means that all comments automatically are generated in comment balloons rather than in the reviewing pane. That speeds things
 up considerably. It's not ideal, but it's better than the alternative.&nbsp;

                    <p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am trying to print double sided postcards, 2 to each page with mail merge on one side. I created a 2 page document in Word - page 1 has 2 identical pictures (I want the front of each
 postcard to be the same) page 2 has my return address and then I used mail merge to add in the addresses of my clients I am sending the postcards to (data source is an Excel file). Mail merge puts the same address for both postcards instead of going to the
 next record for the bottom postcard on the same sheet. I tried to insert Next Record for the bottom postcard but it gives me the error: "You cannot include DATA, NEXT, NEXTIF, or SKIPIF fields in comments, headers, footers, footnotes or endnotes"</span><br />

            <p>I think I figured it out on my own using Publisher instead of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened Publisher I selected postcards and the Avery 8386 template (the template for the paper I am going to print on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the front side of the postcard then inserted a new blank page to create the back side</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on Mailings and selected my recipient list (an Excel file), then inserted an Address block where I needed it in my design</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made sure everything was correct and then clicked Finish &amp; Merge to a new publication</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the new publication I went to Print and changed the settings to say Multiple PAGES per sheet (not copies), kept copies of each page at 1 and then selected Print on both sides - flip sheet along long edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It kept the front of the postcards the same while changing the address for each postcard even the ones printed on the same page.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I have been runing a machine since build 10139.</p>
<p>Today I decided to do a clean install of it and switch it to my native language.</p>
<p>During the install I enter the activation key and everything looks fine.</p>
<p>It installs without errors and when it completed everything worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I turned off the computer to grab some dinner and now when I booted it backup, I wanted to do some changes to the look and feel.</p>
<p>But when I tried to change the background image it complained that the install wasnt activated. Tried to enter the key again, but it couldnt be activated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened a chat with the support and tried to activate in manually, the get the error that I need to purchase&nbsp; a new key although I've been given two thru the insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, can I use the keys I've been given or do I need to purchase a new one (If I do, whats the point with the program then?)</p>
<p>

            <p>Since you started with a preview build 10139 and not from a valid and activated
</p>
<p>windows 7 sp1 or 8.1 system, then yes you need to purchase a license of windows 10</p>
<p>or even a license of windows 7 or 8 and use that product code to activate windows 10.</p>

<h2>            What happens if someone uses my deleted alias, or I use theirs&#63;</h2>
                    <u>If I delete an alias, wait 30 days and someone else chooses it</u>, what happens to all the emails that were being sent to that alias before I deleted it? Does Microsoft tell everyone not to email that alias any more? Could the new user acquire private
 information? <br />
<br />
<u>If I use an alias that someone else has previously used</u>, does that mean that any websites they've signed up for will not accept my new alias as an original account?

<h3> kannyken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening Word 2003 document in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>People send me emails with word documents from older versions, typically 2003. When I try to open the attachment I get an error message saying "Word experienced an error when trying to open the document". If I save the attachment and try to open the saved
 file then the same error occurs. I also tried opening the file with the "Open and Repair" option but still fails. I have no option showing to use compatibility mode. I know there is nothing wrong with the saved file because I also have the open source software
 LibreOffice and that works fine with these old documents</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had Office 2016 a few months and it used to open these files that I receive regularly from the same source as part of committee work. The sender works for a huge public sector organisation who obviously have been running the same version of MS Office
 for years. It is relatively recently I have this problem and as my version of 2016 keeps up to date so I suspect something has changed on my pc. I did try the repair function in control panel as well but nothing changes.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this issue occurs only if you open Word 2003 files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&gt; Right click on the file and select properties. Then,&nbsp;click unblock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; You may also open Word.exe application and open the document which has the issue within Word. Open word, file open and browse for the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue doesn't resolve, you may also try the below option:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click file&gt;options </li><li>Click Trust Center&gt;Trust Center Settings</li><li>Click Protected View</li><li>Uncheck the following boxes</li><li>Enable Protected View for Files originating from the Internet</li><li>Enable Protected View for Files located in potentially unsafe locations</li><li>Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any queries.</p>

                    <p><strong>Huh?</strong> </p>
<p><br />
<br />
I have had this with my Microsoft Office Professional Plus and all of a sudden after all these Microsoft Updates and I hadn't had the need to use VB and now it tells me I have 12 days to register it and to install the key?</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>VB Express for 2010 was FREE and that was why I installed it along with Web Matrix and Visual Studios Express, et al - all in 2010 - and when I checked; nearly half of them are gone (all of them are 2010)?</strong></p>

            <p>I also participated MS Office 365 aka LYNC - and this is part of MS Office Professional Plus and I am also confused as why I have to pay for this service when I own this?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I know MS Office 2010 were coming up with updates and new features and functionalities that we had long been awaiting for and I BETA, RTM, RC the LYNC ... but honestly, I own the MSO PP 2010 PP?<br />
<br />
When I go to MSO's web design page, it clearly shows this product is included ...
</p>
<p><br />
Self-explanation please and why is my MSO 2010 PP being deleted out which I own, plus other programs? I am left hre scratching my head... I have already used the appwiz.cpl to reinstall it; ran via the Win Update's installed Programs - and it seems that you
 guys have taken away everything from what I ahd purchased from dig ..... river ... to give you an idea where it comes from? I was about to proceed in obtaining a CD for the lesser amount because now they cost less than what I paid for in the beginning.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not mad - just confused ....</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay, bad weather bere result outages here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, I had participated in the BETA all the way up to RC ... via MSDN, so the keywas ours to keep, but the issue is if you look in MS OFFICE Proffessional Plus - LYNC is inlcuded, that which I own?<br />
<br />
::: confused :::</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was already announced and I had received email notifications of such "updates" to this. Well,</p>
<p>Windows Update procesded with the updates on everything, but I am left scratching my head as why LYNC was removed when it is part of MS OFFICE Professional Plus 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is part of the illustration and for an example, that which I had purcased is turning around backfiring? Are you seeing the point? If you went to MS OFC 2010 Professional Plus to view what is includied with the OEM?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Visual Studios 2010 - I finally fixed that, had to remove the BETA out of the registry which apparently got "stuck" in there; don't ask - I have not figured out how that would be so considering that one must wipe out to move on to the next ... yadda
 yadda yadda and blah blah blah...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I DO thank you for your remark - but it still does not&nbsp; expound the implication to the MS OFC PP+ 2010 which I am left scratching my head...&nbsp; I have read and re-read the emails,&nbsp; it is just I want it back in the OEM - it idoes not matter if I am going
 to use it, it just the fact that it belongs with the OEM System itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example if you purchase a car; and the Dealership inplied that later, modifications are going to be added to your vehicle, a GPS and a "mini" television, so it was supposed to be but due to technology difficulties it was delayed. So you and your spouse
 went ahead and p urchased the vehicle as expensive as it was. Then you received letters of notification via USPS mail alerting you to contact your Dealership for the GPS and the television to be added. Now your kids are all excited and your spouse ran off
 to the electronic store to buy accessories because you're about to take a 2.5 week vacation and keeping the kids busy and entertained is the only way to keep you and your loved one SANE!&nbsp; Once at the Dealership, you are turned around and ubfirned that, yadda
 yadda yadda this and blah blah blah that .... every though you have it all in writing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevermind the fact that your hubby went a "tad-bit" overboard in which you had agreed on, but he could not resist, had to get the console and some games, along with additional game controllers and then even though it had a built-in CD/DVD player, he did
 not trust it and elected to purchase a separate (designed for vehicles including for RV's) .... with children that excisted and can't wait for the vacation and decisions of which game to play as you already told them ONE NEW GAME every 4 days, no arguments
 (even though the box came with a bonus game plus 2 more but your hubster went out and bought 6 more because it was on sale as if ....)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what happened? You end up having to shell out of your vacation expenses, which hurt the budget itself, singing to the tune of after everything installed; what was supposed to be 'free', your hubster then went on to hire an attorney who reviewed all of
 this already had several clients who had approached to him about this ... especially when you had spent well over $79k for such vehicle in the first place and paid cash (no loans).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While on vacation, because the attorney your "Big Man" hired, had his email address as not to bother you while on vacation, but to touch bases with you while on vacation. Meanwhile, the cases were all theof the same report; coming back to him "Only applies
 to current and new vehicles purchased, not the previous vehicles purchased", so he threatened them with a class action lawsuit with the others (inlcuding you) as the "head" of it all, and would put it into publication against the Dealerships (all of them)
 and against the auto manufacturer for false advertisement, misleading the customers, et al - all that legal mumble jumble. Your hubster who was driving, told you to email him back to agree to it. But instead, they elected NOT to proceed to it, and would settle
 out of court; so he (attorney) is now trying to work a deal to make everyone happy .... "out of court". Being an exceptional attorney, he is letting everyone know what the others are agreeing ot disagreed to; but the settlement offer, everyone was disagreeing
 to which included you and your husband; for you did not even&nbsp; bat an eyelash when you saw that email response, as you considered it an insult. Then you responded to it as "No way Jose, they can take it where the sun doesn't shine". Then you let your steam
 out on your husband about it away from the kids. But like your husband said, it was worth it, not one word had been uttered "Mom, Dad, I gotta pee" or "Mom , Dad, are we there yet?" they had actually wanted to watch the movie or play the game than to be in
 the motel room!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So your husband took a video of this and sent it to the attorney while it was your turn to drive, and emailed a note, nothing can replace or compensate this. Then the attorney wrote back and said it was perfect video; thanks to your eldest child who had
 Zune and was able to put that into the system (as geeky as he was, both of you were left clueless in spite of your rules of only ONE NEW GAMEevery 4 days) .... the video itself was priceless ..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laughter, name calling, excuses, requests for "cheat sheet or codes", and so on with lots of giggles and smiling faces... How can one replace something like that which was, as implied, to be inclluded with such vehicle?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, your eldest geeky son, managed to turn that television into a Zune Music Box; while you had to have him knock it off with that EEEK! (if they called that music, but of course that is their generation music), but the fact was, your husband
 had a big mouth who was paying for songs for Zune to download, and suddenly you hear the same music the very day on the first date where ou cried, and you gazed upon your husband which he looks at you and says "Hon, I love you more now than I did back then."
 You had to shield you face so that your kids wouldn't see your tears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you wrote on piece of garbage paper, your hubby's favorite childhood song .... "Puff the Magic Dragon" ... and your geeky son downlioaded it from Zune and played it and worse, you just found out your Hubster CANNOT SING! LOL! Everyone was singing it,
 you were too busy laughing...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the vacation? Priceless - but on the return back home, the kids didn't even want out, they wanted to stay in there and play more games even though they had plenty in the house At least everyone finally got the settlement agreed upon and with all due
 respect; because of the seizable sum, the attorney was gracious to reduce the fees down as it was a lump sum, distributed evenly to all. the only difference was; his office eld on to your check until you returned and your husband went to pick it up rather
 than having it mailed certified for both of you worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;the irony of it all - few months later to both of your surprise from various States, Class Action suits were being combined into one; against the manfucater for the very same reason which yours (plus others) were already resolved only it was in
 the newspaper!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this make any sense in an illustrative manner? (This is only a make-believe, nothing genuine just for a purpose for figurative but implications of factual facts that can be based up the past historical issues with various manufacturers - the above has
 nothing to do with the facs, I left the genuine facts out to protect the genuine manufacters and their products / makes / models /. software / hardware / yadda yadda yadda - OUT...)</p>

            <p>Sorry it took so long to reply and NO I do not own a VS 2010 Express, I own the full version that came with it and likewise the 365 .... as per the Microsoft Office email notification; especially when we BETA to RC, it was ours to keep for as long as we
 had the product keys - that I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yes, it works, but not fully as it should be - I am aware that the newer version of VS and 365 Users are differing now than that of those who owned it earlier. I guess I will have to contact MS Office Support ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Barry, </p>
<p>I'm getting precisely the same error, 0xC1900101 - 0x20017,&nbsp;on a Dell workstation with 32Gb RAM and many TBs of free disk space.&nbsp; I'm currently running build 9841 in an apparently more than ample &nbsp;Hyper-V partition (wow, what an improvement over Win 8.1!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I tried to install the&nbsp;9860 build twice, the 2nd time with the max&nbsp;RAM allocation and memory buffering allowable&nbsp;in Hyper-V.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both times the install appeared to work but I&nbsp;did not reboot successfully and had to regress by pressing F9 (boot
 to other O/S) when I got&nbsp;the BSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to be a USB or RAM disk space problem based on the message content I got after the 2nd attempt (same error codes)&nbsp;, though I have neither device configured.&nbsp; Oh hold on, my router has a small&nbsp;(8 GB partially filled) RAM disk and Win10P is seeing it.
 That might be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll attach&nbsp;an empty&nbsp;3TB USB drive&nbsp;instead and try the install again.&nbsp; This will take a reboot of the Hyper-V host so it will have to be later though when I have more time to play.&nbsp; If I do not reply again in 24 hours here then this didn't make any difference.</p>

</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to update all the latest device drivers through Device Manager. Also make sure all the Windows Updates are installed.</span></span></span><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>You may also try to disable all&nbsp;devices in the BIOS. You only need CPU memory HDD DVD to install.<br />

<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
NOTE: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can resolved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and then try to upgrade.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></span><span><br />

<p>Dear Winston,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span>this posting is not sent for bashing or hurting or whatever may be not discourteous.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It shall illustrate my belief.</span></p>
<p>I'm using windows since 3.1. Since that time I experienced again and again that Windows may be an OS that is made by top class software technicians for more or lesse also top class software technicians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every new version grew up to a more complicated system with more chances to fail at any time if not anticipated circumstances occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are too many flags and if-then-else's and too many open rat runs where so called 3rd party tools may come in to the stage and trouble the show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you (Microsoft) are the master.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why shall users try all the "methods" and consider "notes" for getting the changes that updates shall apply to a system?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why isn't the updater at first disabling all the stuff that you mentioned, then rebooting the system followed by the planned update, then enabling the disabled stuff and rebboting the system?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system is a system is a system. There should be a backbone that isn't allow to touch. Never. Only Microsoft should be allowed<em> (and be able)
</em>to touch the backbone and to make changes. Then it would be easy to apply updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem may be the registry. Every tomfool may write a "tool" or an "application" or some of these 3rd party bombs and mess around with the registry.
</p>
<p>The worst sometimes may be the so called "regitsry cleaners". Do you imagine what this means: "Registry cleaner"? There is someone winnowing in your (Microsofts) living room!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should protect the registry against all attacks except the accesses by <em>
Microsoft</em>. And you should also protect all your&nbsp;<em>Dynamic
 Link Libraries</em><span>. All tools or applications should be installed in own environments. They should be allowed to access "common" DLL's, and if they can't use one out of your collection they may create their own libraries.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That said I predict that I'll ban the Windows 10 TP at once if I get any error of that kind that so often is reported. I then would fall in&nbsp;</span>teariness because the Windows 10 (even in this present stage of
 "alpha") is the best Windows that I ever used.&nbsp;<br />
<span><em>(If the test period would not end I would hold it for my daily use with all those applications that I installed. I don't need more than that.)</em><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Pls separate the registry for the system itself. It never-never may be touched by any installing of applications or tools. Discard the need of a "system configuration" or similar setting tools.&nbsp;<br />
This kind of "system" is forcing "users" </span>in some respects<span> to become "programmers".</span></p>
<p>Sincerely your,&nbsp;<br />
Manfred<br />

            <p>I enjoyed reading your post very much and was suspicious before you said so that you might be German. &nbsp;&lt;smile&gt; While I did detect an "accent", your message came through loud and clear. &nbsp;I think your English is just fine..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I frankly agree (strongly) with your opinion concerning the Windows Registry, as well as the Common DLLs Library and have felt this very same way for years. &nbsp;Thank you very much for speaking out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>An aside, I too have used every single version of Windows as my primary O/S except Vista. &nbsp;That included Windows 1.0, 1.1, 1,2, 2.0, 2.1... as I recall. &nbsp;The version numbers are getting a bit fuzzy after all these years. &nbsp;Though to be precisely accurate,
 prior to version 3.1, Windows was not my primary O/S. &nbsp;(Remember IBM's O/S 2? Loved it!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my finger crossed that Microsoft will hear the logic of your recommendations.
<span>"Ich&nbsp;druecke&nbsp;meine&nbsp;Daumen"&nbsp;</span>as a German friend has said to me more than once. &nbsp;(I think this means literally "I push my thumbs". - Funny how some idioms don't translate while
 others do!) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft followed your recommendations I believe they would gain the same benefits that Apple brags about with the MAC O/S. &nbsp;More important to the Microsoft Marketing Team, us Microsoft fanboys would be as strident as the Apple Fanboys, maybe MORE strident
 and with good reason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest I have many times considered making the switch to the MAC ecosystem for the reasons you note. &nbsp;I have the skill set to spend on solving corruption problems but not the time, nor the patience anymore frankly. &nbsp;Millenium Edition was simply a debacle
 for me. &nbsp;I should add that Windows 8 is also, but to a much lesser extent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I too value the many other major benefits of the Windows O/S for desktop use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, don't get me started on Windows 8 and "Mobile First"! &nbsp;The Windows 10 Preview, regardless of issues on this forum is already a SIGNIFICANTLY better user experience than Windows 8.1, which I struggle with every day at the office trying to do enterprise
 application development while pawing through all the Windows phone crap. &nbsp;As I said, I'm a Microsoft fanboy but I have 8 different active Android devices in my household. &nbsp;(I just counted and this really shocked me!) &nbsp;Windows phone? Notta!</p>

<strong>Windows Phone?</strong>&nbsp;<br />
I use a NOKIA Lumia 630 Dual-SIM with Windows 8.1 Phone.&nbsp;<br />
It's my favorite smartphone. - I use it for phoning, reading MS mails (only reading<strong>!!!</strong>) and for browsing the BING news. &nbsp;Sometimes I play MS Mahjong or MS Solitaire.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And for a "camera always at-hand". The images are good enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thats's all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And for these uses it is the best phone I ever had.&nbsp;<br />

            I had this same issue, my startup amount of RAM allowed to the system(not the minimum,) was set at 512 MB, increasing it to 1024 fixed it.

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>Thanks for reply.</p>
<p>I have been writing about "Junk Mail/s" since Jan, 16, 2016.</p>
<p>Email I sent to a Support Engineer at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Got back email about "Sweep" and 15 other emails from ppls about the Same.</p>
<p>I wrote about "Junk Email/s" mid March 2018. April 2018 after </p>
<p>"BETA Outlook.com, last time was about a month ago and got replies from you and Betty etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can check with someone about the New Junk Mail page and advise the New procedure, as i have No Clue. AGTM.</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>Thanks for reply, </p>
<p>No, That/the &nbsp;Page you sent is Not&nbsp; the "new" BETA aka Bad Experience Trouble Ahead "Outlook.com"&nbsp;"Junk' mail page, That page is about Nothing Much of Value about Junk mail.</p>
<p>The Page web address is the Page I sent.</p>
<p><a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/layout</span></a></p>
<p>I am very surprised you are not aware of the Junk mail page.</p>
<p>I know, you do not get "Junk Mail". &nbsp;Neither do any of the "Moderators" in Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>In the Last 3 weeks I have sent over 300 Junk emails to Microsoft.</p>
<p>In March, April, May, June of 2018 I wrote about Junk Mail and got replies that didn't work.</p>
<p>Also: about Posting Junk mail.</p>
<p>PS, about your first reply, I really don't Know "URL" and "Screen Shot",</p>
<p>my experience is a Blurry Blurrd Blur.</p>
<p>Happy Full Moon,</p>
<p>Please advise,</p>

            No, you do no loose the license. 
<br />
<br />Step 1: uninstall the Office University license:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />After uninstall is complete, restart.
<br />
<br />Step 2: Deactivate Office:
<br />
<br />Log into your schools Office 365 portal
<br />
<br />From the homepage, click on the gear on the top bar.
<br />gear
<br />Select Office 365 settings under the My app settings heading in the panel that pops up.
<br />Click Install status on the left hand sidebar.
<br />All of your current installations of the Office suite will be listed on this page. Click Deactivate on the install you are no longer using.
<br />
<br />Step 3: reinstall Office on the new computer:
<br />
<br />Sign into your schools Office 365 portal:
<br />
<br />Select the install option, which may appear as a red Install now button or a smaller blue link, and follow further instructions for downloading.
<br />
<br />install now
<br />
<br />Once Office 365 has downloaded, a beginner tutorial will appear, offering helpful tips on how it functions. You will also be able to access all the applications included with Office without further downloads. All of the programs will download together, and you can later delete the short-cuts to the programs you don't need.

    <title>Windows Live Synchronization failed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Synchronization failed</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’m using a HTC PocketPC with Windows Mobile 6.0. When I purchased it, I synchronized my Hotmail and Messenger contacts and emails without any problem. I was then
 able to view my emails and IM with Messenger. I then added a different email account in Outlook. Since then, I can get my email messages for both my Hotmail account and the other one I synchronized with Outlook but when I’m using Messenger, all my contacts
 are showing as offline. I can still receive IM from them (I tested with another hotmail account) but I cannot start an IM conversation as my contacts do not show as online.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I go to Windows Live and click on Sync, it synch the folders list and stops at Synchronizing Personal settings. Then I get the message “Synchronization failed
 – Connected”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, when I add a new Windows Live contact to my list, I can enter the information but when I get to the screen that asks me whether I want to add this contact
 to Windows Live Messenger, everything freezes. I click on Yes or No but nothing moves. I have to reboot the system (the contact is still saved in my list afterward).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know my connectivity is good as I can receive/send emails and browse the web without problem. I cleared the password and re-entered it.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I first thought it was a server problem but I tried for the past 10 days through wi-fi or normal. What should I do next?
