    <title>Can&#39;t play Xbox Live &#34;Teredo is unable to qualify&#34; , - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdkj30433  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t play Xbox Live &#34;Teredo is unable to qualify&#34; , &#34;Can&#39;t get Teredo IP addresss&#34; and &#34;High Packet Loss&#34; type errors</h2>
                    Basically been getting errors for 5 years and cannot play XBL anymore. No hardware changes have been made. It just happened. I don't know how to fix this, because port forwarding and DMZ does not work. I don't know if this is relevant, but IPV6 test gave
 me a 0/10. I have a very basic and cheap ISP with what I assume is a $40 router. Any help or ideas towards a resolution would be very much appreciated. A new ISP is not an option for me. Maybe a new router, but I would like to investigate this issue without
 changing hardware for now if possible. Thanks!&nbsp;

            Try changing the firewall settings to low on the internet router/modem. If it's set to high, that can block Xbox live and other online services. If you are not sure how to change the settings, then the manufacturers website should have the manual and more
 info on how to change the setting.

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply. I'm not sure if anything related to my Xbox One will solve this issue. Is that what you're referring to when you give me these steps? I actually first noticed I couldn't play Xbox Live on my Xbox 360, bought an Xbox One thinking
 it would fix my problem, still doesn't work. Since, I have not hooked up either because I also get errors about Teredo and connection blocked on my Windows 10 PC when I go to Settings &gt; Gaming &gt; Xbox Networking. I'm pretty sure this means I cannot do anything
 simply on one device to fix the problem, and rather has to be done in the Network itself. I have been through the Xbox support pages multiple times, but I think my problem is even more complex than what these tips offer. It may be a rare problem, I don't know,
 but I appreciate your help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been into my routers configuration page many many times, and there is definitely no option to put my firewall on low. I just went through the manual which is from 2009, and I searched the keyword "firewall" for only 22 results. It's really long, so
 that was my best bet. I can quote what I think sounds most important relating to firewall on my router, but in reality its all way too vague for me to understand. It almost looks intentional that i'm left with no options to fix my problem based on the design.
 Like it's trying to tell me to port forward, which I definitely tried in the past to no avail. Maybe I did it wrong, who knows!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you mind if I linked you the pdf? I don't know if links are allowed on here or if you're up for the task, but I wouldn't know whether or not i'm capable of fixing this problem on my own after what I just read! It also won't let me copy text from the
 pdf. Alternatively I can just say the brand and model, I found the pdf download instantly. I really don't know. Earlier I read an amazon review of the same exact router/modem combo stating that they cannot play Xbox with it. So same boat it seems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply!&nbsp;</p>

            yeah, you should be able to put the link on here, we use links all the time for other users, so giving me a link shouldn't cause any issues, or you can just give me the manufacturer &amp; model number of the router, and I can find the pdf myself.

<p>Thanks a lot!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the link to the router's page:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.zyxel.com/support/SupportLandingSR.shtml?c=gb&amp;l=en&amp;kbid=MD09012&amp;md=P-663HN-51<br />
</p>
<p>Here is another link to where someone else had this issue, and seemed to have had it solved with help:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r27456096-P-663-and-Xbox-live (I just found this minutes ago, but haven't tried it yet because I don't know if all these same numbers would be used in my case) Maybe this link would better help me, I just probably need confirmation
 on what numbers to put :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just googling the model with xbox live next to it shows a couple results, so I think the router just ain't that compatible for Xbox Live by default!&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>then is the best, you search for the teredo ip settings four your router or contact your isp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>when you try the port forwarding and dmz and this didn't help and you have the same problem with the xbox 360.</p>
<p>maybe your isp can help you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>yeah, it certainly looks cheap. I would try the dslreports.com link with everything they say (including the numbers), except make sure the port forwarding is turned on, then try connecting to Xbox live on the console, and see if that works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try and get a more up to date router either from your isp or you purchase one yourself. At least then you will know that it will work with Xbox Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it all works out for you. If you still have issues, then feel free to post on here again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Setup won&#39;t accept the Default Key</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Hi, I have a couple old Dells from 2008 that were bought running XP. I upgraded one of them to Vista Ultimate only; the other
 to Vista Ultimate, then to Window 7 Ultimate with an .iso I had around but no key. I couldn't get a definitive answer beforehand about the upgrade path and whether I could get to Windows 10 Pro with an unactivated Windows 7 Ultimate. I read somewhere that
 it was possible with the November 2015 build of Win 10, but that build had been deleted from the Media Creation Tool days after it came out so we're back to the last build before the November rollout using the Media Creation Tool. I did find what appears to
 be dated as a November Build on Technet, but sadly it still stops my install with the Product Key prompt at the start. Even using the published single Default Keys (Home Or Pro) won't pass.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I really don't know if these old Dells could handle Windows 10, and I was working on one to see if it worked and if it did I'd
 try the other. Seems I have 1 day left on my activation of Windows 7, and I don't know if that will revert back to 27 Days Left after tomorrow; I only got 3 Days Left to start with.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I could wait for the Anniversary Edition of Windows 10 to come out next month and see if that helps. If I could install Windows
 10 successfully and try it out for a couple weeks, I'd be willing to go to the Windows store and pay $200 for it, but I'm not motivated to buy a license at Best Buy until I'm sure they are carrying an Anniversary Edition of Windows 10 at the store, and I can
 get past this unactivated Windows 7 problem. I am trying to keep all my files and programs and getting to Windows 7 has not been a problem so far from Windows XP.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">The Task Manager in Windows 7 seems to not work in the unactivated state though. I can bring it up but the clock and CPU stats
 won't advance, so I have to use Rainmeter.</span>

            Hi Wm
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail, you have transferred Windows 10 to the new SSD, do you now want to dual boot the SSD and HDD both with Windows 10?
<br />
<br />What method did you use to transfer Windows 10 to that SSD, did you clone the HDD or perform a a full clean install using bootable Windows 10 media . . .
        </p>

            Hi Wm
<br />
<br />Did that utility actually remove Windows 10 from that drive in the transfer process?
<br />
<br />If so, you can clean install Windows 10 onto that HDD, or use a utility like Macrium Reflect, to clone that SSD back onto the HDD, which would result in Windows 10 being on both drives (settings intact)
<br />
<br />If your do want to clean install Windows onto the HDD, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            Hi WmJohnson
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You can create a system image and restore it back to the SSD or you can perform a direct reinstall.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />How to: Create a system image in Windows 10
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />How to restore a Windows 10 system image to an existing or larger storage device
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/how-to-restore-a-windows-10-system-image-to-an/e20992ca-5641-4f7c-bb09-3895d0732162">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />		Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Depending on what country/region your account is located in, that's the language you'd get the game in. If your account is located in the United States and you purchased the digital copy of the game you'd get the English version of the game.<br />
<br />
You can see if the country your account is set to has multiple language options selectable in your billing history page by following the directions

<p>Well, if there's French DLC, then yes, you would see it in French. I don't quite know how you'd get that to work if your account is in the United States. The United States only has English DLC available. You would only see French DLC from the marketplace
 if you were either from Canada, or France (your account region of course).</p>

            Hi Douglas I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a> 
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:

<h2>            Windows 7 doesn&#39;t connect to any network&#33; Error&#58; You are currently not connected to any network</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 7 doesn't connect to any network!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Windows 7 Ultimate PC Shows "You are currently not connected to any network" though it is connected to my net router and i can access the internet.....
</p>
<div>The images there are all connected, i mean, there is NO RED cross on the connections (It shows that i am connected to multiple networks, as i am connected to the router as well as the Oracle VM Virtual Box)</div>
<div>But under the "View Your Active Networks", it shows "You are currently not connected to any network"..... &nbsp;But yet, i can access the other systems in the network (by connecting my laptop to the router via wireless").... &nbsp;The problem, due to this, is that
 when ever i try to play a game in the Multiplayer Mode via LAN, this sytem is not detected and i guess, this "You are currently not connected to any network" has got something to do with that.....</div>
<div>So, anyone please help me with this!!! :/&nbsp;</div>

    <title>BSOD randomly on OneNote&#58; Possible Windows 10 Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liz dxg  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD randomly on OneNote&#58; Possible Windows 10 Creators Update bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I use OneNote heavily to take notes. It worked fine on my old computer, but I never got the Creator's Update with it. When that laptop bit the dust, I got a new one for Christmas, a Lenovoa yoga 720. Using Onenote will cause a BSOD at various times.
 It can work fine for a time, but then suddenly crash. I used a digital pen with the yoga 720 and it was often associated with that, but sometimes I would simply open onenote and it would crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fearing something wrong with the new computer, I promptly returned it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now working on a lenovo latitude courtesy of my university. I plan on getting another Lenovo yoga 720 because further research suggests it is not associated with the specific model or the bamboo ink pen I was using. Actually, the same BSOD with the
 same code occurred on this computer!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This suggests to me that this is a software incompatibility occurring with Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a patch that will fix this issue coming out? Am I doing something wrong in Onenote 2016 to cause this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop code: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>What failed: win32kbase.sys</p>

            Hello Synthya017,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; It seems that some of your startup files might have been damaged or corrupted.&nbsp; You can correct this by using system File Checker to scan and repair them.&nbsp; I've included the steps below to do a SFC.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.<br />
<br />
The System File Checker tool
To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista, run the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files
 by using the correct versions. <br />
<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
, and then type <span>cmd</span> in the <strong>
Start Search</strong> box. </li><li>Right-click <strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>
Programs</strong> list, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.
<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong> </li><li>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
</li></ol>
When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved. If the issue that you are experiencing is not resolved, use the procedure that is described in the "The System Restore tool" section.
The System Restore tool
Other troubleshooting methods, such as using the System File Checker tool, may not resolve the issue. If they do not resolve the issue, and the issue that you are experiencing started occurring recently, you can use the System Restore tool. By using this tool,
 you can restore the computer to an earlier point in time. <br />
<br />
Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in
 which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.
<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
, type <span>system restore</span> in the <strong>
Start Search</strong> box, and then click <strong>System Restore</strong> in the
<strong>Programs</strong> list.<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </li><li>In the <strong>System Restore</strong> dialog box, click <strong>
Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click <strong>
Next</strong>. </li><li>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.
</li></ol>

<h2>            I accidentally turned off the driver on my primary monitor, and now my monitor doesn&#39;t display anything&#33; How do I turn it back on&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    While trying to change the resolution, I noticed that my primary monitor could not achieve the desired resolution, but my secondary monitor could achieve it. What I did was to disable the driver for my primary monitor, so it asked me to restart my notebook.
 I restarted it and all I got was a black screen! After pressing buttons randomly, I noticed that the speakers, settings, etc. were all OK except for the monitor itself! I need help turning it back on without having a monitor on. Thank you for reading through
 all of this.

            Hey, you will have to start your computer up in VGA Mode. What this does is forces your computer to boot up in 640 x 480 and all basic settings on your primary monitor.
<div>From here you will be able to see what you're doing when you get into windows, then you can change your resolution and solve your problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To do this, restart your machine and start pressing F8 for boot options (It's rarely different but I'm sure you will know the key for your computer). This will take you to the screen where you normally see the likes of "Safe Mode", "Safe Mode with Networking",
 "Last Known Good Configuration", etc. If you select VGA Mode that should allow you to solve it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good Luck</div>

            Try booting your computer in safe mode. <br />
<br />
once you are in safe mode, try uninstalling the video driver and reboot your computer.<br />
<br />
Please post info about the make and model of your notebook for further troubleshooting tips.<br />

    <title>Xbox account connecting to the internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dye young2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox account connecting to the internet</h2>
                    <p>I have been having connectivity issues with my xbox one x. The past few days my account disconnects from xbox live. Once it does that I have to reconnect to the internet by disconnecting and reconnecting to the wifi. I did the restart, hard restart, and
 the unplugging the router trick and it didn't work. I thought it could be the wifi chip going bad in my xbox. So I backed everything up in my hard drive and exchanged my xbox one x for a different one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for the first hour or two and then it disconnected and I tried everything over again. Right now my one roommate is playing on his xbox one with no problem and my other roommate plays his PS4/PC with no connectivity issues. I think it might be my
 account or my external hard drive. Is there anything I can do to see if my account is at risk for anything?</p>

<p>Hey there Dye Young2, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this problem with your new console. </p>
<p>I would say that if you are getting disconnected from pretty often and your network is good, then I suggest trying the steps our on "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/random-disconnect-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Xbox
 One is getting randomly disconnected from Xbox Live</a>" on our website. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Give that step a shot and let us know how it helped out with the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

<h2>            Opening the same application on a different desktop opens it on the desktop it was first used on. Microsoft, &#42;please&#42; let us use the same applications on different desktops.</h2>
                    <p>So here is the thing: the entire point about using multiple desktops is that we get to separate our windows into different "activities". One Ubuntu, for example, I use a desktop for work and another for personal things so that I don't have to deal with all
 of them when I'm working. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On windows this is a hassle. </p>
<p>Here are the steps to reproduce the issue I'm facing:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open Google Chrome on a desktop. </li><li>Make a new desktop (Win + Ctrl + D, or go to task view and click "New Desktop")</li><li>Open Google Chrome again in the new desktop. </li></ul>
<p>Now, you would want Windows to open a new Google Chrome window on the new desktop -- because of course, we could use Chrome for several things and we'd want to separate the stuff related to work from other things such as watching a random music video. This
 should be simple, right? Not with Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of creating a new application window in the new desktop, Windows takes me back to the

<p>
</p><p>It's just very annoying to see how Windows missed a very simple thing. <strong>
No one </strong>-- and I repeat, <strong>no-one </strong>uses multiple desktops to separate applications. We use multiple desktops to separate use-cases! This problem has been here for years and several others have pointed it out -- but it's 2018 and there's

<p>Has no-one fixed this problem for you?</p>
<p>I just posted this which is exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>This is discouraging - why advertise the function if it doesn't work?!</p>
<p>But if I understand you correctly, it does work in Ubuntu? I need to learn about that....</p>
<p>Here's my post:</p>
<p>I can create multiple desktops but they are all the same. What I do on the first desktop is replicated on the others. If I delete something off one, it deletes off all the others as well. That totally defeats the purpose of having more
 than one desktop. I want to be able to assign each desktop to different uses. I tried to discuss it on Help Chat but the person on the other end keeps talking about how it can’t be set up for different USERS when I am talking about different USES, not that
 it makes much difference. The multiple desktop feature states that each desktop can be used for different purposes, and on mine, they can’t – they are all the same! How do I do it? Anyone? I’d be very grateful for an answer, Thank You.</p>

<p>Nope. No fixes yet. What I've found out is that this doesn't affect all applications. For example, I'm able to have multiple instances of Firefox running on different desktops. But other important applications continue to have the issue; for example, MS
 Word or MS Excel. </p>

                    Okay. This has been a LONG road so bare with me. It started with an update continuously failing. I got an unknown error so I googled it. The update pertains to IE 11 and I found that you can manually download each piece of the update from the website.
 I found the piece not wanting to download&nbsp;"windows(Kb2639308)" and got an error of "error 0x803c010a". I troubleshot it and got a message saying my "registration is missing or corrupt ". I googled this and followed the instructions. I checked Services. I checked
 Windows Update, Cryptographic Services and Background Intelligent Transfer Service. Then went to Cmd prompt to stop them and restart. Then when I went to my registration to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/WindowsSelfHost"..... but I have no WindowsSelfHost.
 So I tried another suggested fix to restart .NETs and went to Control Panel, Programs, Turn windows features on or off, but it won't load. I'm probably forgetting some other suggestions I tried. I'm really not sure w

<h2>            Cant Left-Click mouse when holding down keyboard key &#40;Windows 10 Home Laptop&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello !&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>This is the first time i haven't been able to find a answer by googling, so this is my last resort!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Im on a Windows 10 Home laptop, my issue is, i cant left-click while holding down a key, it does not register as anything.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have went into my Mouse and Keyboard and Touchpad settings, and there is no option to change the delay, like what most answers are online.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On top of that I have went into the RegEdit, right clicked the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span> changed the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">AAPThreshold unit to 0 ( it was at 3) and restarted
 my computer, still no change. I still cannot left click while holding down a key.
<br />
<br />
It seems that Windows 8.1 or other versions of Windows 10 have a way easier way of doing things, mine is Windows 10 Home.
</span><br />
I tried turning off and on my Touchpad, still no difference. I have checked if my Mouse has drivers to update, and it is all up to date.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Hi Samuel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that this issue is being caused by an outdated driver. Even if it is showing that it is updated, it is still possible for you to experience incompatibility issue. We recommend that you update your mouse's driver manually.
 To do this, you will need to go to the device manufacturer's website and download the latest driver available.</p>
<p>

            Hi Billy
<br />
<br />To have a lot more control over your screenshots and saving those, use the Snipping tool:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type snip and hit Enter - this will open the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Set Mode to your preferred Mode, then click New to take a screenshot
<br />
<br />Save that file to your Desktop and close the Snipping Tool

                    <p>I&nbsp;have a set of Turtlebeach REcon 50X headphones which I can no longer&nbsp;hear through on my Xbox One (they are only one month old).&nbsp; The&nbsp;headphones work when connected to other devices.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have downloaded OS2 and OS1 updates from Microsoft to Xbox but it hasn't fixed the problem.&nbsp; Last time I&nbsp;had this issue I&nbsp;had to replace the controller (only 2 months ago).&nbsp; I think the issue may be with the controller again (it is not wifi). Seems ridiculous to have to buy another controller.&nbsp; Any ideas/thoughts on how to fix this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Interestingly I am also having the same problem with the headphones.&nbsp; Not to Hazmat radio concerning the type of connection, he states that the headphones can no longer be heard through his controller implying that the same headphones once worked with the same controller and therefore I would submit that they are wired&nbsp;using the CTIA standard.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I followed the process of updating the controller firmware with no success.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also the process for&nbsp;re-acquiring&nbsp;the controller to the Xbox by removing the controller power for 15 minutes and doing a hard power cycle on the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;Later introducing the batteries into the controller and pressing the small button on the front of the controller while powering on the console.&nbsp; &nbsp; This did not seem to work but gently applying pressure to the jack and pressing if in more firmly seemed to correct the issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;So the issue seems to be with the wiring in the jack or the s

            So my son can hear fine using these headphones, but his friends can't hear him chat. We have followed all tips&nbsp;on Xbox and have gone through tech support with no luck getting the solution. Xbox suggested we replace the console which we did and within a
 week the same issue is occurring. Any suggestions? Both the system and headphones are only two-three weeks old. This is very frustrating!!

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 finger touch not working&#63; &#40;With videos and picture&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I bought a surface pro 4 from somebody 2 days ago for £300 knowing that the type cover it came with was faulty so i needed a new one.. I thought £300 is still cheap enough so went ahead with it. However, today I am experiencing touch problems using my
 finger. Nothing happens when I try and touch the screen just right of the middle of the screen. this is about 3 inches in width and goes from the top to the bottom of the screen. It was working perfectly fine yestarday but for some reason it decided to stop
 working today? It works fine with the surface pen, I can touch everywhere and it will respond perfectly fine however when drawing and if i try and draw in that area, it will end up giving me random lines as if I am pressing the screen somewhere else, but if
 i use the pen as a mouse and for tapping, it works perfectly fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I know is the guy before me had actually dropped the surface with the type cover attached and the type cover trackpad buttons (left and right) stopped working so he sold it to me for £300 and said I would need to buy a new type cover for it. When booting
 the surface up, it has some marks down the bottom as if the screen was pressed in with force and it has left marks on the screen however when windows loads up, the screen is fine and you cant see the marks.. There is no physical damage to the screen or digitiser
 from the outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that the drop actually resulted in screen damage too? If so, why was it fine for 2 days but playing up now? Could it be a software glitch? Im not that bothered because I am just going to buy a new type cover for it and use it as a laptop as
 I prefer it that way but I do want to fix the problem so it can hold its value rather than me having to sell it with a broken touch screen. Does the screen need replacing? Here are the videos/pictures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the PC by deleting everything and doing a fresh install of windows 10</p>
<p>calibrating the touch and the pen</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I reckon the lcd has become faulty but I need to make sure this is the case as then I know I need to replace it. By the looks of it the LCD cost is around £105 from ebay and I would do the repair myself so even then the pro 4 cost me around £450 which is
 still a good price.. or I could leave it like it is and use a type cover with it as I dont actually use it like a tablet any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <div>dropping a Surface can result in intermittent issues, etc. You can ask the</div>
<div>seller to refund your money and return it to that person and move on. There are</div>
<div>also many threads in this forum about typecovers that no longer work on SP4. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We can't help with replacing the LCD or give advice. Sorry.</div>

<p>This issue didn't result from dropping the surface on the floor. After it was dropped, the only issue it had was the keyboards trackpad stopped working which is understandable. Now the touch issue occured 3-4 days later and I believe it is a software issue
 as there are also a lot of people on youtube having the same issue but unlike me their surface wasnt dropped on the floor so it definately isnt the case of surface dropping and causing an issue. The touch was working fine for 2 days straight and it wasnt dropped
 or anything so for it to stop working some how.. I cant blame the fall for that.</p>
<p>

            <p>StyleRush.dll appears to be related to a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) and therefore has undoubtedly been removed by your antimalware software.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://www.herdprotect.com/stylerush.dll-68bdfb3887a1b19e19659f668e79ecbaa8975b27.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.herdprotect.com/stylerush.dll-68bdfb3887a1b19e19659f668e79ecbaa8975b27.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you're getting a "not found" error regarding this file when your computer starts, the reason is that&nbsp; your antimalware software did not remove the mechanism that was intended to invoke this DLL file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the webpage linked above, click the Start Orb and type "Task Scheduler" (without quotes) in the Search box and press Enter.&nbsp; Find the task that runs StyleRush.dll.&nbsp; You can either click "Task Scheduler (Local)," expand the "Active Tasks" list and
 scroll through it or try to find it by expanding the "Task Scheduler Library" tree.&nbsp; See screenshot below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd29fa02-9f28-4268-819a-ac97c373ff68" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find the task in the list of Active Tasks, double-click on it to open the task.&nbsp; If you find it by looking through the "library," it should already be open.&nbsp; Right-click on the task and "disable" or "delete" it (disabling will let you change you mind
 if you turn out to have selected the wrong thing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't find the task in Task Scheduler that starts StyleRush.dll, download and run
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the "Logon" tab and look in the "Image Path" column for the StyleRush.dll.&nbsp; It probably isn't in the Logon section, so either click the "Everything" tab and use the File &gt; Search tool or go to the "Scheduled Tasks" section directly.&nbsp; An idiosyncrasy
 of the Autoruns search tool is that you have to move the selection line below the "found" item before you "Find Next."
</p>
<p><br />
Once you find the line with the offending file, either "Delete" it or (if you want to be safer) uncheck it.&nbsp; The latter prevents the line from being executed but you can reactivate it later by replacing the check mark.</p>
