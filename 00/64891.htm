            <p>Hello Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's place the computer in a clean boot state and try to troubleshoot the issue.<br />
You can refer the section “How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue: Make sure that the touchpad services and applications should remain enable while trying to
 troubleshoot the issue.<br />

<strong>Note: </strong>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to check with the HP support once.</p>

            Ok, my dad and I figured it out. BUT incase any one else has a problem like me I am telling you guys how to fix it so you can help them... when it worked on all the other accounts on the computer but not the one the person is using they need to go to here
 (it will be similer to them except maybe the drive letter and the account name)
<div><br />
<div>C:\Users\cgyearian\AppData\Local\Microsoft\GFWLive</div>
<div><br />
<div>then they need to delete yes I did say DELETE the two files called appsettings.dat and livedata.dat</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>then start up games for windows marketplace and it will remake those files AND finally work note this fix is only for the people who dont get the log in box on their account on the computer but on another account on the computer you guys should save this
 info incase someone else comes along that has same problem as I did....</div>

            Hi Cand, 
<br />
<br />Let’s try the easiest thing first:
<br />
<br />Click start, type "control panel" - open it 
<br />
<br />Look for file explorer options - open it and click the "view" tab
<br />
<br />Make sure "show hidden files...." is checked off.
<br />
<br />See if the folders still appear to be empty. We know they aren’t, so it must be a setting/permission somewhere. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

 share with my computer, it wasn't finding it for some reason.... even though it appears I have already mapped the folders.. weird. thanks for helping me... what shall I try next?

            On the PC you’re trying to share the folders from, right click on one of thre folders, and go to properties. 
<br />
<br />Once there, click on the sharing tab, then advanced sharing. 
<br />
<br />Is “Share this folder” checked off? Then click on permissions, are Full Control, Change and Read all checked off? If not, do so. Click OK a couple times, and check to see if you can see the files now. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

<p>

<li>Faulty hardware.</li><li>Incompatible driver.</li><li>Software conflict.</li><li>Antivirus driver filtering.</li><li>Corrupted system files.</li></ul>

<li><em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Do a clean boot</a></strong></em> to isolate software conflicts, driver conflicts, anti virus filtering.</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">Windows will load your PC without any 3rd party services. Drivers will be generic which means, built in driver with basic functionality of all devices (monitor, touchpad, soundcards, etc.) will be loaded. This will isolate conflicts.
 If the issue doesn't happene in this state, you can drivers, antivirus, 3rd party services and software settings to possibly fix the issue. There will be steps on how to check it in the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. If the issue still persists in that state, it maybe a corrupted Windows 10 System files. (most unlikely since it rarely happens and Windows 10 will prompt you immediately after booting or you won't be able to boot to desktop)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. &nbsp;Faulty hardware. Before we conclude this, I suggest that you do a system reset (it's disruptive, possible data loss so I suggest you backup all pertinent files to an external drive or stick)
<strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update </strong><strong>and
</strong><strong>Security </strong>&gt; <strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Reset</strong>
<strong>this </strong><strong>PC </strong>&gt; <strong>Keep </strong><strong>nothing</strong>. This step will
 assume that it's a hardware issue. Contact your manufacturer for replacement.</p>

<p>You can't use STG without incurring expensive roaming charges. Your least expensive option is to purchase a NZ Subscription to enable you to call home. When you are in different countries the best option will probably be to use Skype Credit. Please bear
 in mind that Subscription funded calls to NZ do not include calls to cellphones.</p>

            It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS.

<h2>            Can&#39;t find my old files. I know they&#39;re there.</h2>
                    
<p>Last night, I upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 7. I first popped in the disc from my desktop and did the upgrade function. Everything was going fine and dandy for the first couple hours. I would check up on it every fifteen to thirty minutes to see
 how it was going.</p>
<p>Well, after a couple hours, when I went back to it, the screen was black. It remained non-responsive so I turned off the computer. I only needed to press the power button, not hold it. When it booted again, I tried just booting from Windows 7 (Windows Vista
 wasn't on the list anymore) but I got an error message, saying how it restarted unexpectantly or was interupted. I couldn't get past anything, so I ended up booting from the install disc. I then had to do the custom install. It said all my files would go to
 windows.old.</p>
<p>So now my computer's up and running, but I can't find my old files. I know they're there because my hard drive is "25.0 GB free of 687 GB." But when I scour the windows.old file, I find nothing of use. I'm pretty sure it's just the old system files. The
 folder is only 20GB, I know I had about 600GB of data before the update (I work with video and audio). I know it's stored on that hard drive somewhere. but I can NOT find it...</p>

<p>Try and unhide the hidden folders and look out for folders named : Windows.old.ooo or look in Windows.~BT, Windows.~LS and any such named folders.. You would see folder named data..</p>
<p>I am sure the data should be in them..</p>

    <title>Windows Update left my laptop useless&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hf-batool  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update left my laptop useless&#33;</h2>
                    <p>2 days ago, this new update was installed in my Windows 10 laptop and ever since after that my Internet is not working on the laptop. I have tried everything from troubleshooting to reinstalling the drivers but nothing works. I tried to ask for help from
 online support but nothing worked. I am very troubled by this policy of Windows 10 that I cannot turn off updates and they start installing whenever they want. It's been 30 hours and I have tried everything but all in vain. It gives proxy error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not all, I have also troubles with my keyboard or search bar. Whenever I open search in windows, my keyboard won't type there, however, it is perfectly working when I use it elsewhere for instance Browser, search in file explorer. I thought it was
 some problem with my Windows search so I tried all the suggested solutions. It didn't work. But I just realized that the problem is not with search rather something complex and different. When I tried to connect to password protected WiFi, &nbsp;my keyboard won't
 even type in the text box for password. I have not a slightest hint what is going on with my computer and I cannot connext to any proper support agent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is because my laptop turned off while update installing was 30% though when I turned it on it started updating again. Maybe half of the updates were installed and the other half was corrupted or something. If this is the problem then it is very
 sad to realize that installing updates is not Atomic i.e. &nbsp;Either whole update should install or none.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to roll back the last update but no use. I am very depressed and angry right now. I doubt that any microsoft support person would read this. The only option left to try is resetting the PC which will delete all the installed apps. This is so annoying.
 Please improve yourself services Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus I have tried uninstalling last Windows update but there was no use. The thing is that I have Internet or a ghost of Internet in my PC since &nbsp;I was able to connect with the Microsoft support agent over remote session but my internet on browser or other
 apps just won't work. Any idea?</p>

I also looked for tech support from Microsoft online agents over live chat support, but none of the them could solve my problem. One even got remotely connected to my PC because my internet started working for 4-5 minutes. He kept trying to figure out the problem
 for about 2 hours (though the internet wasn't working but remote session somehow was connected) but there was no use. My issue still has not resolved.. I tried to restore back to previous settings but it said that I have no changes in my PC. Maybe because
 I have already rolled back. The agents in the end suggested resetting of Windows that I don't want to do. Has your problem resolved?

    <title>Explorer not displaying Computer &#47; drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philip goddard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer not displaying Computer &#47; drives</h2>
                    I have just purchased a new computer with Win7 Home Premium x64, and completed installing all my software on it.&nbsp; This new system has two internal nominally 128 GB SSDs, and most of the time I also have an external USB hard disk attached.&nbsp; The system has
 8GB RAM.<br />
<br />
The problem is that, sometime late in the process of installing close to 70 programs, 'Computer' stopped showing any drives (just an empty pane, and no navigation drop-down on the navigation bar).&nbsp; This would be no great trouble for me in a way, because most
 of the time I use my own third-party file manager (Free Commander), which is great and still displays all drives and allows me to navigate as usual without problem. The real trouble for me is that applications cannot access my data directly, because the 'Open
 File' dialog uses Explorer, which now displays only Desktop and it items and system folders such as Libraries, and Network and so on - but NO Computer and no drives.&nbsp; So my applications cannot browse for files to open, and my FTP program cannot open the required
 local folders.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with the drives, as is evidenced by the problem being ONLY with Explorer. Disk Management and Device Manager show things all being as they should be, and the problem is NOT empty disks, and in any case I have set Explorer to display empty
 disks to see if that made a difference; unsurprisingly it didn't, as the disks are not empty in the first place.&nbsp; I have also tried rebooting into Safe Mode, and I found there that the problem was there too, so it is not some resident program of mine interfering
 with Explorer. I have also checked that the problem persists when the USB HDD is disconnected.<br />
<br />
I have a further significant observation. If I open Free Commander and select 'Open' from the right-click context menu with any folder or drive selected, that folder or drive then opens correctly in Explorer. There is then a proper path sequence shown in the
 Explorer navigation bar, with each folder / drive name bearing the standard down-arrow button for navigation within it - and the ALL work. However, if I click on 'Computer' at the left end of the path in the navigation bar, once again I'm faced by a blank
 pane and there is no down-arrow navigation button next to 'Computer'. Clicking on 'Computer' there does nothing then. Also, as when trying to brows for files using the Open dialog of applications, the folder tree on the left doesn't include Computer nor any
 of the 'tree' that should open from it.<br />
<br />
So, Explorer still can navigate anywhere through the drive / folder system, EXCEPT that it completely loses the plot every time it is directed to 'Computer', and one cannot navigate away from that..<br />
<br />
I was wondering if this might be the result of some crazy security setting that was hiding Computer from possible prying eyes. I have therefore checked on the effect of disabling my security software (Comodo Internet Security; I have Windows Firewall and Defender
 turned off), but that has made no difference. In any case, as I say, even running Windows in Safe Mode doesn't get Explorer to show 'Computer' and the drives.<br />
<br />
I'm truly at a loss with this, and it is essential that this situation is rectified speedily, because the computer is unusable for many purposes until this is fixed.&nbsp; I would most appreciate any genuinely informed assistance here!&nbsp; -- Thank you in advance!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Later addition:</span><br />
I've found that if I enter a drive or a folder in the address bar of any Explorer window, it opens up correctly, and then Explorer functions correctly, except that Computer and its tree of drives and folders still isn't in the folder tree pane, and again, if
 I click on Computer in the navigation (path) bar, at once all navigation is lost and I'm faced by a blank pane.<br />

            <p>Hi Philip Goddard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Check if the external hard drive gets recognized in
<b>Disk Management</b>.</p>
<p>To open disk management:</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>Disk Management</b> in the Start search box and hit <b>Enter</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the drive gets detected in disk management, I would suggest you to assign a drive letter and see if that does the trick.
</p>
<p>For instructions, refer the article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Change, add, or remove a drive letter</b></p>

            Sorry, you haven't read and understood my post properly - absolutely typical of Microsoft 'support' on this forum in my own experience, I'm sorry to say.&nbsp; The problem is NOTHING to do with USB devices, and I have already said that the drives are ALL in
 order and are shown in Disk Management and Device Manager and all diagnostics as being in order and healthy. I had in any case already given drive letters to all my external drives.
<br />
<br />
In fact, although I forgot to mention it in my post above, one of the first things I did when I found I had this issue was to do a sfc /scannow. That reported no problems.<br />
<br />
In any case, this could not be a drives problem because if I enter a drive or a folder in the address bar of Explorer, all is working fine and I can navigate fully - including the drop-down list of drives next to 'Computer' at the left end of the path in the
 navigation bar, and any of those drives can be accessed and their folder structure can be navigated through. The issue is simply that Explorer will not display 'Computer' (at all) or its direct contents (i.e. the drive list) in its listing pane - and also
 'Computer' is not displayed in the Explorer-derived file browsing dialogs in applications for such functions as 'Open' and 'Save as...'. Indeed, I cannot use my FTP client (Wise FTP) at all at the moment because it relies on Explorer-based listings in its
 'local' pane - though as a work-around I am now using the more basic FTP facility in FreeCommander, because the latter creates its own Explorer-type listings and thus isn't thrown by Explorer's current shenanigans.<br />

<p>Hi <strong>Jan Mosberg</strong>,</p>
<p>1. What is the file type of the pictures?<br />
2. Do you wish to view the contents of the picture folder in thumbnail view?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to follow these below steps and check whether you are able to view the pictures.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Open folder that contains pictures.<br />
b. At the top right you will see View by.<br />
c. Select Medium icons or large icons or extra large icons.<br />
d. Check if you are able to view the pictures.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the issue persists then I would suggest you to follow these below steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. In Windows Explorer.<br />
b. Click Organize.<br />
c. Select Folder and Search Options.<br />
d. Select the View Tab.</p>
<p>Make sure that the option Always show icons never Thumbnails is NOT selected.</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to delete the <strong>thumbcache_*.db </strong>files in the following folder (you can copy the following location in to the Search box directly)<br />
<strong>%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer</strong></p>
<p>Please note after deleting the thumbcache you need to reboot your computer, so that the thumbcache will be rebuilt.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Blue light filter in Windows 10 is not powerful and efficient</h2>
                    <p>When i enable "Light Blue" filtering in Windows 10, the intensity of the filter is not enough efficient and powerful and the screen does not become completely orange and blue light filter In Windows 10 does not completely remove the&nbsp; blue light like other
 free software that removes blue light like f.lux and sunsetscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make the blue light filtering of windows 10 more powerful and extreme: i wish that my laptop screen becomes completely with orange color to eliminate all the harmful blue light and save my eyes from strain. Thank you</p>

            Hi Sun.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The search box in the tabs is always going to be Bing because they exact that price for using the Microsoft browser.  So you need to do Google searches in the URL box (AKA "omni-box") which can be set to Google search as shown here:

<h2>            Windows 7 -- What qualifies as communications activity&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 7 has a feature to automatically reduce other sounds by a set amount if it detects communications activity. I would like to know what qualifies as communication activity? I have an application which is being detected as communications app. Can
 anyone explain me how to make sure my application doesn't reduce the volume level of other applications?

<h2>            Active Directoy &#34;Home Folder&#34; not mapping consistently Win10 and Server 2012</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I'd like to start by pointing out that&nbsp;this issue is specifically with Windows 10 Pro on client machines and&nbsp;Server 2012&nbsp;on our DCs and File-Print servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users here in my business have been complaining about issues with the Home Folder not consistently mapping. It's affecting several different users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have many mapped drives, all of which are mapped via Group Policy but their Home folder "Q:" in this case is implemented through Active Directorys User&nbsp;Home Folder through the path
\\fileprintserver\Personal_Shares\username .</p>
<p>
</p><p>On logging in (usually first thing in the morning) the users Q drive&nbsp;may fail&nbsp;to map, that is to say it's totally missing. Sometimes other drives are marked with the red X and disconnected but you can simply open these and reconnect them but the Q drive
 is missing altogether. The users must restart their machine to get the Q drive to then map successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason we map users home folder using AD rather than something through a GPO is that we use Citrix for remote users and we found using GPOs to manage their home folders resulted in some strange behaviour.</p>

    <title>Computer fan keeps working even in sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> siabusiness  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer fan keeps working even in sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>My 2010 Toshiba laptop keeps constantly working. Even when in sleep mode, the fan is constantly on. Sometimes it isn't the fan, sometimes it's something rotating loudly like the hard drive or something. This issue has evolved. When it was operating normally,
 once I close the lid or put it in sleep mode, it would instantly quite down and the system lights on the front side would be flashing slowly, steadily. After a year or so, it wouldn't shut down for hours, and all the lights would flash so rapidly that it would
 seem like they're one solid light. Kind of like when a computer is at top action, even though I've closed all the programs and stopped most background actions in Task Manager (except system actions). Now, it would keep roaring all night, all day, all night,
 all day, all night and all day long until I shut it down. Then it would need a revolution to shut down and to start up again. I don't understand why, it isn't doing anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7. Is it a virus that keeps my computer working or hardware struggles of an old computer? Although even though it's 2010, I started using it in 2014, it was laying around my closet never opened from the original box. Please help. And if it's
 a virus, please let me know what tools I can use to detect it, because I've led wars with viruses on this computer for eternity. I have Kaspersky, it's blind to that virus. Norton found it, but never could erase it. I am very hesitant to trust those free virus
 cleaners online. Do I need to address a professional with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>If you've had virus problems, I'd recommend doing a factory reset of the computer, back to how it was when it was brand new.&nbsp; Except for extreme infections, this will clear up whatever has been causing any problems.&nbsp; Plus it will make your computer work
 like brand new again so you won't have the issues.&nbsp; So you're going to get clear of viruses and fix the problems, plus you'll have a computer that works as fast as it did the first day it was built.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that, all you need to do is:</p>
<p>1) Copy files you want to keep.&nbsp; Put them in your OneDrive, put them on a USB flash stick, whatever you want.</p>
<p>2) Once you have your files saved elsewhere, use the Toshiba recovery option to restore the computer.&nbsp; If you aren't sure how to use Toshiba recovery option, use the built-in on-screen manual, the original paper manual, or the Toshiba website to look up
 your model number and how to reset it.</p>
<p>3) Once the reset is done, copy your files back to the computer and use your nice fresh computer.</p>

            <p>If it is either the fan or the hard drive, you had better have backup because failure is imminent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you are not using your laptop on a soft surface.&nbsp; There are slots and holes on the underside that are the intake for air to cool your system.&nbsp; Use one of those cans of compressed air to blow out any dust accumulation in the fan on your computer
 while it has its battery removed and no power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most likely cause from your description is the disk drive.&nbsp; Buy a 7200rpm rotating drive replacement (likely cost about $60).&nbsp; Re-install Windows 7.&nbsp;

                    <p>I am trying to download a couple apps from the store on my windows 8 laptop. It asks for my password, after I enter it, it asks for my email and password again. Then it says it needs to make sure its me so type in phone number and they text me a code I enter
 the code. The next page comes up it says your almost done, switch to a Microsoft account on the pc, I hit switch then it shows my account picture and says the account already exists on this pc. I cant figure out what to do it keeps sending me back to the first
 page to do it all over again. Tried several attempts all failed. </p>

            <p>Hello Viper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you tried logging into your Microsoft Account and then tried downloading the apps?</li><li>Are you able to sign into the account online?</li></ol>
<p>If you download the apps in a local account, you will get a prompt for email and password for the Microsoft Account or setting up a new Microsoft Account in order to accomplish the installation. However, if you setup a Microsoft Account and then try downloading
 the apps, you won't get these prompts as the settings would rather sync automatically with the system and apps would get downloaded without getting redirected to the sign-in page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, if you are in the local account, I would suggest you to refer to the following link to setup the Microsoft Account.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-how" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I sign up for a Microsoft account?</a></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already signed up for a Microsoft Account earlier but are unable to switch to that account now, then it&nbsp;might be possible&nbsp;that the account is blocked or the password is reset. Follow the steps from the article provided below and check.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-back-blocked-hacked-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><em>Get back into your Microsoft account if it's been blocked or hacked</em></span></a></strong></p>
