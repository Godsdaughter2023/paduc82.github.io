    <title>More than 1 custom drop down list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessyw  say:</h3>
<h2>            More than 1 custom drop down list</h2>
                    <p>I am VERY new to doing any type of edting in VBA (I am NOT a developer, just a desktop publisher).&nbsp; Our group is in the process of switching from Word 2003 (where we had customized toolbars) to Word 2010 (where you can't have toolbars), so rather than creating
 shortcuts to macros on a custom ribbon and being forced to assign an icon to each macro and not being able to fit everything on the ribbon properly&nbsp;or have any control over how it auto arranges on the ribbon, I am attempting to create a custom ribbon with
 drop down lists which I would later add onto the QAT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have figured out how to create a drop down list on a custom ribbon, but I can't seem to figure out how to create additional drop down lists on the same ribbon.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the following code in Custom UI Editor:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&lt;</p>?xml
version="1.0"
encoding="UTF-8"
standalone="yes"?&gt;
<p>&lt;</p>customUI
xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2009/07/customui"
onLoad="RibbonControl.Onload"&gt;
<p>&lt;</p>ribbon&gt;
<p>&lt;</p>tabs&gt;
<p>&lt;</p>tab
id="CustomTab1"
label="Publishing
 Custom"&gt;
<p>&lt;</p>group
id="CustGrp1"
label="Publishing
 Macros" &gt;
<p>&lt;</p>dropDown
id="DD1"
label="Publishing
 Macros"

getItemCount="RibbonControl.GetItemCount"

getItemLabel="RibbonControl.GetItemLabel"

getSelectedItemIndex="RibbonControl.GetSelectedItemIndex"

onAction="RibbonControl.MyDDMacro"
 /&gt;
<p>&lt;/</p>group&gt;
<p>&lt;</p>group
id="CustGrp2"
label="Publishing
 Styles" &gt;
<p>&lt;</p>dropDown
id="DD2"
label="Publishing
 Styles"

getItemCount="RibbonControl.GetItemCount"

getItemLabel="RibbonControl.GetItemLabel"

getSelectedItemIndex="RibbonControl.GetSelectedItemIndex"

onAction="RibbonControl.MyDDMacro"
 /&gt;
<p>&lt;/</p>group&gt;
<p>　</p>
<p>&lt;/</p>tab&gt;
<p>&lt;/</p>tabs&gt;
<p>&lt;/</p>ribbon&gt;
<p>&lt;/</p>customUI&gt;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This code does generate two drop down lists, BUT they generate the identical list.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to modify it within Word VBA.&nbsp; This is what I have in the RibbonControl Module:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option Explicit<br />
Public myRibbon As IRibbonUI</p>
<p>Sub Onload(ribbon As IRibbonUI)<br />
&nbsp; 'Creates a ribbon instance for use in this project<br />
&nbsp; Set myRibbon = ribbon<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>'Callback for DropDown GetItemCount<br />
Sub GetItemCount(ByVal control As IRibbonControl, ByRef count)<br />
&nbsp; 'Tell the ribbon to show 10 items in the dropdown<br />
&nbsp; count = 10<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>'Callback for DropDown GetItemLabel<br />
Sub GetItemLabel(ByVal control As IRibbonControl, Index As Integer, ByRef label)<br />
&nbsp; 'This procedure fires once for each item in the dropdown. Index is _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; received as 0, 1, 2, etc. and label is returned.<br />
&nbsp; label = Choose(Index + 1, "Select a macro", "6 pt", "Answer Key Blurb", "Blank Line", "Blank Line Indented", "Insert LO Header", "Shading", "Strip Formatting", "Subscript", "Superscript", "Title Case")<br />
End Sub<br />
&nbsp;<br />
'Callback DropDown GetSelectedIndex<br />
Sub GetSelectedItemIndex(ByVal control As IRibbonControl, ByRef Index)<br />
&nbsp; 'This procedure is used to ensure the first item in the dropdown is selected _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; when the control is displayed<br />
&nbsp; Select Case control.ID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Is = "DD1"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Index = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do nothing<br />
&nbsp; End Select<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>'Callback for DropDown onAction<br />
Sub myDDMacro(ByVal control As IRibbonControl, selectedID As String, selectedIndex As Integer)<br />
&nbsp; Select Case selectedIndex<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 6<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro6<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 7<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro7<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 8<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro8<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 9<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro9<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 10<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macros.Macro10<br />
&nbsp; End Select<br />
&nbsp; 'Force the ribbon to restore the control to its original state<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; My apologies but I am completely new to this.&nbsp; If I'm understanding you correctly, I should rename this:</p>
<p>&lt;dropDownid="DD1"label="Publishing Macros"getItemCount="RibbonControl.GetItemCount"getItemLabel="RibbonControl.GetItemLabel"getSelectedItemIndex="RibbonControl.GetSelectedItemIndex"onAction="RibbonControl.MyDDMacro" /&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p>&lt;dropDownid="DD2"label="Publishing Styles"getItemCount="RibbonControl.GetItemCount"getItemLabel="RibbonControl.GetItemLabel"getSelectedItemIndex="RibbonControl.GetSelectedItemIndex"onAction="RibbonControl.MyDDMacro" /&gt;<br />
<br />
to something like this:</p>
<p><br />
&lt;dropDownid="DD1"label="Publishing Macros"getItemCount="RibbonControl.GetItemCount"getItemLabel="RibbonControl.GetItemLabel"getSelectedItemIndex="RibbonControl.GetSelectedItemIndex"onAction="RibbonControl.MyDDMacro1" /&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;dropDownid="DD2"label="Publishing Macros"getItemCount="RibbonControl.GetItemCount"getItemLabel="RibbonControl.GetItemLabel"getSelectedItemIndex="RibbonControl.GetSelectedItemIndex"onAction="RibbonControl.MyDDMacro2" /&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did I interpret that correctly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, I will have to modify the RibbonControl Module.&nbsp; I can see how I would do that in this section since it contains the unique name 'MyDDMacro1 or 2'</p>

<br />
<br />
I'm just not sure how to modify it in the Item Count and Label sections.&nbsp; I'm not trained in VBA, I've only modified an already existing ribbon I found online, so I can't even begin to understand how I would word it to include options for both drop boxes.&nbsp;
 However, if I could see an example of a custom ribbon that has more than 1 drop down list, then I think I could figure it out.<br />

            that doesnt work, ive gone onto the date and time settings and theres nothing there about the size of it, it just asks how u want the date and time shown and wot format etc, it says u can stop the time and date from being shown, but that way i will never

<p>if by the manual u mean the tiny little book that came with the phone, well i did read that thanks and its a pile of **bleep** doesnt tell u anything, hasnt hardly got any contents in it, and it certainly doesnt have anything about how u make the clock and
 time smaller, u keep saying go to the display settings well i have and it has wallpaper and standby font colour notification details transition effects font size which is only for messaging and contacts not clock or time, operator logo and cell info display,
 well yeah they certainly sound like theyre helping me make the time smaller,</p>
<p>and then u go to date and time, they have settings but only for which format u want, do u want - or / etc again nothing to do with making it smaller or moving it across or down the page. the only thing u can do is make the clock and time disapper which is
 extremely helpful when u wanna know wot time it is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so thanks for ur help, u've been as helpful as the manual which is no help at all</p>

<p>Are you sure you have a 2330?&nbsp; I'm also having a problem with the clock on my 2330, but it's the exact reverse of yours.&nbsp; The time is way too small to read at a glance, and it actually disappears if there are too many icons along the top!&nbsp; (See below image).&nbsp;
 If you ever find out how to change the clock text, let me know, because I want mine to be bigger. &nbsp;:robothappy:</p>

<p>I have the same issue, I have recently purchased the 2330 classic from 02 and the display screen appears different to the picture above, infact I think thats how I would like it to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the time pretty much takes up all of the display screen, and the icons on the top bar e.g battery/signal etc are twice the size of the above picture. Also I have tried to download a few themes for Nokia 2330 but these dont work properly as the bar
 at the top just puts a big white bar over the top of the picture etc!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could this be due to the 02 settings on the phone? I see the phone with the smaller icsons is on T Mobile. Also is there any progress on how this can be fixed?</p>

            <p>It sounds like you are running Comodo Internet Security and MSE.</p>
<p>Please confirm.</p>
<p>If this is so, it is a bad idea to run more than one active anti-malware programs. It will cause conflicts and perfromance degradation.</p>
<p>From what I can determine, many other Comodo users are having this same issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Bing ksnapshot.etl and you will find more info.</p>
<p>The file appears to be harmless, but I suggest checking with Comodo support.</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>Qinggg</strong>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The error that you’ve encountered can be due syncing issues. It can also be that restrictions were set before making some changes. To learn more about your concern, I’d like to ask the following questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which <strong>type of files</strong> are you trying to upload?</span></li><li><span>Are you using <strong>OneDrive </strong>to save your files?</span></li><li><span>Does the <strong>error </strong>occur on <strong>all files</strong>?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meantime, I’d suggest <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">installing any available Office updates</a></strong>
 and see if it will resolve the issue with uploading your files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I’ll wait for your response.</span></p>

<p>Outlook Mail (Preview) has not worked in Mozilla Firefox. When I tried to access my mail account from Microsoft Internet Explorer it worked just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Mozilla Firefox I have done following: opened HELP menu in Mozilla Firefox menu bar, then clicked on Troubleshooting Information item in the menu, and then in the right upper corner clicked Refresh Firefox button. After that Firefox restarted and I could
 access my mail from Mozilla Firefox. Outlook Mail (Preview) in Mozilla Firefox works.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You perhaps don't have Access 2007 parts installed. In fact, you don’t need access installed, but you do need the new version of jet now called ace.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your connection string should look like:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, in your example for an mdb (as opposed to a accDB), JET 4 should also work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you choose Access database during the connection, do you see the provider also?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            There are several apps on Ovi Store that alow this, like nUnlock, and Mazelock. Just push the menu button and it will light up the screen showing you a Mazelock screen (like on Droids), or an iPhone-like slide lockscreen

</span></p>
<p><span>There is no need to download the older versions of the Zune software to sync with your device. The latest version can also be used with your device. Just make sure that you have the Windows XP
 SP3 installed as the Zune software won't work on versions of Windows earlier than Windows XP SP3.
</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have XP SP3 installed you can download the Zune software from here;
<a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zune.net/en-US/</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you encounter any problems.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,
</span></p>

            <p>Hi Gaurav,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for asking Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mention the edition of Office 2007 you are trying to install?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you installing Office 2007 using an installation disc/media or a downloaded file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it’s a disc, then create a flat and try installing the Office 2007 from the copied location. To do that, create a folder on your desktop and then copy over the contents of the Office 2007 installation disk to that folder. Once the files are copied over,
 double click on the setup.exe file within the folder to start the installation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check for multiple/trial versions of Office installed on the system by going to Control Panel and then Add or Remove programs. If found you may uninstall it and then try installing Office 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer to the following thread which discusses a similar issue and check if it helps:
</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 images in reading pane</h2>
                    I have seen a lot of information about how to display images in email but I have the opposite problem. Even though I have images turned off, they are still displaying in the reading pane. This just started happening. I had previously turned off the images
 by selecting, File/Options/Trust Center/Trust Center Settings and selecting "Don't download pictures automatically in HTML email messages or RSS items" and that box is still checked. Any ideas? Was there a recent fix that might have changed this?

            Thank you for the response and the tips, unfortunately those did not work. Some other errors I'm having is the view downloads option and Ctrl-J does nothing. I can download from other browsers but I have to download the s/mime through IE.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - Google Caldav sync failing</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to the Windows 8.1 release and I am having a problem with google calendar sync.&nbsp; I have found similar articles that were resolved related to CardDav but nothing for CalDav.&nbsp; When syncing my google account my email and contacts sync correctly,
 but my (multiple or single) Calendars are no longer syncing.&nbsp; Prior to the update I was using the Black OS and was successfully able to sync with multiple google calendars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symptoms:</p>
<p>When viewing the account in settings - email+accounts I see the status message "Not up to date"</p>
<p>When opening the account i see "Not Updated" with an error code of 801901F5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assumption:</p>
<p>Possibly the URL for the Caldav server is incorrect</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried to resolve hat lead me down this road:</p>
<p>- I tried removing and re-adding the account (multiple times)</p>
<p>- When re-adding I tried to use a app specific password since I have 2 factor enabled - the windows phone doesn't allow me to do this.</p>
<p>- I Completely reset the phone</p>
<p>- I tried adding "https://" in front of the CalDav url in the account - advanced settings</p>
<p>- I created a new gmail account (no two factor) as a test and tried to sync with it and it produced the same results</p>

    <title>Outlook opens rich text messages as HTML - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamichau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook opens rich text messages as HTML</h2>
                    <p>I have a customer whose computer was just imaged with Windows 7 and Office 2010 last week&nbsp;(she'd been using Office 2010 for a long time prior to the re-image).&nbsp; Right after her Win7 upgrade, her mailbox was migrated to Exchange 2013.&nbsp; Since then, her Outlook
 opens rich text formatted email messages as HTML (HTML shows in the title bar of the message) and the entire body of the message is blank.&nbsp; If she clicks Actions in the Ribbon, then View in Browser, the message displays fine in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Also, if
 any of our administrators grant themselves permission to her Inbox and open the same messages, they open as rich text and display normally.</p>
<p>This customer's default compose format for Outlook messages is HTML.&nbsp; If she changes her default format to rich text, she can then see graphics inserted into rich text formatted messages she receives, but still can't see any of the text.&nbsp; Also, in this scenario,
 the View in Browser workaround no longer works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have an idea why Outlook might misinterpret rich text as HTML?&nbsp; I'm trying to avoid un- and re-installing Office, which would likely fix it,&nbsp;because we want to find the actual cause and resolution, in case other customers see this same problem.&nbsp;
 Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            This is fixed, but we never found the actual cause or a good resolution.&nbsp; I had to backup the customer's data and re-image the computer.&nbsp; Sure enough, after that it works fine.

            <p>Hi Wendy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short answer is "With a List Style".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The style of type "List" is a structure in Word that connects a List Template (Which contains the indents and numbering of a list) and up to 9 paragraph styles (which contain t he spacing and fonts and line spacing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paragraph styles can also contain indents, but when the List Template is applied, the List Template wins, and when a List Style is applied, it automatically applies the whole combination, including the list template.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>So first off, create your paragraph styles. &nbsp;I recommend customising the built-in styles List Number through List Number 9, or List Bullet through List Bullet 9 -- that's what they exist for and I am all for avoiding unnecessary work.</li><li>Then Format&gt;Style&gt;New and assign a name. &nbsp;I normally make the name descriptive of what I will USE the style for, not what it contains. &nbsp;So "BodyTextNumbering" rather than "My multilevel list".</li><li>Change the Type to "List"</li><li>As soon as you change the type, the dialog changes. &nbsp;To the OPPOSITE of what you need! Whoever designed this mechanism really has no clue how users use numbering, and it's obvious that they never do! &nbsp;All the controls are there somewhere, but you're in
 for an irritating game of hide-and-seek.<br />
</li><li>First you want to drill down one more level, to the Professional controls. Leave the amateur playground to the people who don't know Word. So at the bottom left corner of the dialog, click "Format" and choose "Numbering".</li><li>Now we're in the professional control set and you can see what you are doing. You have seen this dialog before in the Bullets and Numbering command, but this time, only the Outline Numbered tab is offered because while it is the same dialog, it is configuring
 a different structure.</li><li>Choose the sample that looks most like the numbering scheme you are going to create. &nbsp;If there's none that look right, pick any of them: we can completely reconfigure if needed, but try to avoid that much work.</li><li>Now click Customise. &nbsp;What we're going to do now is run through and configure the styles you created in Step 1 into the List Style. &nbsp;Once they are configured, they will hold and most of the possibilities for problems are removed.</li><li>At the bottom of that Customise Outline Numbered List dialog, click the blue disclosure triangle at the extreme bottom left to reveal the Link Level to Style field.&nbsp;</li><li>In the Link Level to Style field, choose "List Number" as the style. &nbsp;Ignore the other settings for a moment.&nbsp;</li><li>In the top left of the Customise Outline Numbered List dialog, set the Level to "2"&nbsp;</li><li>In the Link Level to Style field, choose "List Number 2" as the style. </li><li>Repeat these last two steps 11 and
 until you have used the higher levels. I recommend configuring one more level than you need, so you can use Outline View properly.</li><li>When you have set up levels 1 to 5, OK back to the New Style dialog and enable the "Add to template" checkbox At the bottom left of the dialog. &nbsp;This stores your creation in the template so you can use it for all your documents.</li><li>OK your way all the way out and save the document (so if your changes blow up later, you have a foundation to go back to).</li><li>Now go back to Format&gt;Style... and choose the name of the style you just created.&nbsp; Hit Modify&gt;Format&gt;Numbering&gt;Customise...&nbsp; Notice that several options are greyed out, because you are working on a List Style, which does not have the other options.</li><li>NOW you can go from Level 1 down to Level 5 and set your indents and tab positions.&nbsp; All of the other settings will probably be correct, so leave them alone.</li><li>When you have set the tabs and indents for all levels, OK you
 changes will be stored only in the document you are working on.</li><li>OK your way out now, hold down the Shift key, and choose "Save All", which will appear on the File Menu when you hold down Shift.</li><li>Notice that we do not change the indents in the paragraph styles?&nbsp; We do not need to, the List Style will reflect our indent and tab changes into them automatically.</li><li>Notice that we have not yet "applied" the list style to anything?&nbsp; We never need to: it will be linked in automatically when we apply the paragraph styles to text.
</li><li>You can now close that document and create a new one.&nbsp; If everything worked, our new List Style will be in it, copied in from the template to which you added it in step but not applied to any text.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now put some text in there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the paragraphs you want numbered, and apply the paragraph style List Number.&nbsp; Behind the scenes, Word will automatically attach the List Style we just made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To adjust the level of numbering in each paragraph, place your cursor at the beginning of each paragraph and hit Tab or Shift Tab.&nbsp; When you do that, the List Style automatically switches in the correct paragraph style for you, which automatically calls
 in the correct level of numbering as defined by the List Style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list style acts as a "holder".&nbsp; It is actually a tiny list structure like an Excel table that contains a line for each level of the list, and a row of data for each level that indicates which paragraph style, character style, or List Template contains
 the indents, fonts, or numbering level, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are right: it's quite complex.&nbsp; There are other ways of setting it up (suitable for lawyers...).&nbsp; I strongly recommend that you do not use those ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done this way, the list style and all of its associations will be stored in your template, will copy into each new document automatically available for us, and will even paste into another document if you copy a paragraph formatted with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works very well, and its stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh: &nbsp;Word will never show you which List Style is applied. &nbsp;It does not need to, because when the list's paragraph styles are applied, the list will automatically be applied.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><strong>The paragraph styles defined into the list style must not be used (CAN not&nbsp;be used...) for anything else in the document.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Word has a "Style Inspector" which will show you the formatting of selected text, and enable you to see which formatting properties came from which of the styles applied. &nbsp;They removed this from Mac Word to make way for the much-reviled Ribbon.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">We need to be very careful to keep the various entities separate in our&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">minds.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Everyone :-),</p>
<p>Alas, I have not been successful with these instructions. Many questions came up. I am so glad that I had a back-up copy of my Normal.dotm on a flash drive outside my computer, and a print out of style descriptions just in case I have to re-create the List
 Numbers that broke while trying this. Any insights from anyone would be very helpful. Thank you all in advance for your kindness in this ever so frustrating project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated with Microsoft right now. My questions/comments for more information refer to the step numbers above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: </p>
<p>I interpret this to mean modify the paragraph styles of the existing List Bullet styles to a new style. I’d rather not do this, only because these style appearances should remain with the recent changes made.
<br />
Typed out a style list of each List Bullet that I had modified, 1-5. This was just the bullet with some random text after it to provide something to click on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4:</p>
<p>Clicked on my random List Bullet text. Then Format&gt;Style&gt;New, named it, changed Type to List (ignored all the weirdness that showed up in that window), closed without Applying. Clicked on random List Bullet 2 text. Then Format&gt;Style&gt;New, named it, changed
 Type to List, closed without Applying and so on. Ignored all the formatting strangeness that showed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 10:</p>
<p>Am following this step exactly, even though I am creating a List Bullet style. Changed it to List Number, even though it appears that List Bullet would be more applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 13:</p>
<p>Followed these steps without clicking OK between each edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 15:</p>
<p>Final window, there was no OK. Clicked Close. Did not click Apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 17:</p>
<p>The Link Level that had been previously set was not showing. Went back through and re-set Link Level, clicking OK, and Close between each one. When at the …Modify&gt;Format&gt;Numbering (Outline Numbered) window, multiple tiles appear looking very similar. It
 is not clear which one to click. Sometimes I kept the one suggested, and sometimes clicked another tile. Don’t know if this is creating a problem, or what the tiles are showing me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 18:</p>
<p>Read this step too late. To make up for it, went into the Modify window for each style, clicked Add to template, then OK’d out for each one individually, and went back in to Add to template for each one. Each time, I cringed at the Modify Style window that
 showed:<br />
Formatting Start at “1”,&nbsp; regardless of the level. <br />
Apply formatting to: “1st level”, even though that had been changed further down.
<br />
Apply formatting to: Wingdings 2 (which is the font for the bullet image chosen for this list). In other lists it shows the paragraph style here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 19:</p>
<p>After doing this, whenever closing Word, it asked me to save a new “Normal.dotm” to the desktop. After deleting all evidence of this experiment, this problem went away, and the older Normal.dotm still had my customized List Numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 22:</p>
<p>When applying the “new style”, the formatting appeared for a bulleted list, but do not appear as they were set up. And, "List Number" is the name that shows up in the relevant ribbons and windows. And, the List Number style that was used in this process
 has changed to this poor bullet list; it is no longer a numbered list. My original List Number style is gone. It displays the edited bullet style, shows “List Number” as the style name. I had previously changed “List Number” to my purposes, and now that is
 gone. Luckily, I have a back-up Normal.dotm on a flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that it is still possible to do this. If anyone has any thoughts, it would be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Wendy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Step 1, it does not matter which styles you use, provided that they are, and remain, PARAGRAPH styles. &nbsp;You need up to 9 of them, they can be any styles you like, but they can't be used for any other purpose in that document. &nbsp;It's much easier if you
 use the built-in styles (less work). &nbsp;Certainly when you come to using list styles for headings, it is essential that you use the built-in styles. &nbsp;But for this purpose it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Steps 2 through 9, you are creating the List Style. &nbsp;You create only ONE of these, which links all of the paragraph styles together into the list (up to 9 of them). It doesn't matter what you have selected when you do this: you are working on a background
 structure that is not applied to text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when you say "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Clicked on random List Bullet 2 text. Then Format&gt;Style&gt;New, named it, changed Type to List, closed without Applying and so on." I think you have stepped out of the creation of the first
 list style and created a second list style. &nbsp;That will not work: you need ONE single list style to connect all your list paragraph styles. &nbsp;Maybe name it "OutlineBullets" or some name suitable to yourself.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then in steps 8 through 15, you define into OutlineBullets list style the paragraph styles you will use to format the text: maybe List Bullet through List Bullet 9, but they can be any styles you like,
 provided that each style is used only as part of THIS list (OutlineBullets).</span></p>
<p>Think of the List Style as an egg carton: it contains as many as 9 eggs, and keeps them together as a single entity. &nbsp;This is what enables you to hit a Tab at the front of the paragraph and get the next level: it's the list style that controls the levels
 and bullet or number formatting. &nbsp;The paragraph styles control the text formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Steps 10 through 13 use "The paragraph styles that you prepared earlier". &nbsp;If those are the "List Bullet" series, then use List Bullet. &nbsp;In these steps, you are setting the paragraph styles that will format each level of your list. &nbsp;You cannot use any
 styles twice: for each level, you need one paragraph style; and you cannot use the paragraph styles defined into the list for any other purpose in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 13, you are correct, you do not need to OK anything until you have done all of your levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Step 15, "Close" is correct. You never need to "Apply" a List Style, it remains in the background, linking the paragraph styles together. &nbsp;When you apply any of the paragraph styles to text, the List Style is called in to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 17 is a very badly designed dialog box. &nbsp;The tiles in this box are showing you the List Templates in the document. &nbsp;I was trying frantically to avoid discussing List Templates, because they add another layer of multi-level confusion to the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A List Style has nine levels. &nbsp;It connects a List Template, which has nine levels, with up to nine paragraph styles. &nbsp;The paragraph styles format the text. &nbsp;The List Template formats the bullets or numbering. &nbsp;The List Style connects the two so they work
 together and can be copied from document to document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tiles are showing you a list template for each of your previous efforts to customise the list style. &nbsp;Because you were creating a new list style each time, you will see multiple entries here. If you had been working to modify a single list style named
 OutlineBullets, there would only be one customised tile showing here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Decide which one has all the levels you are using in it, and click "Reset" to get the rest out of sight. Yes, if you have more than one customised tile in this operation it is creating a problem: there must be only one customised tile, setting the bullet
 formatting for all the levels of this list style. If you later create several list styles, then you will have a tile for each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 18: &nbsp;You do need to click "Add to Template" every time you make a change to a style. &nbsp;However, you can take advantage of an undocumented feature: once you have enabled "add to template", ALL the changes you make to the styles will be saved at the next
 Save. &nbsp;So you need to check it only once for each time you save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will notice that "Start at" is greyed out if you are defining a non-numbered list. So the "1" doesn't matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are seeing "Apply formatting to 1st level" you are two levels too high in the dialog. &nbsp;In Step 4 and 5 I warned you about this. &nbsp;It may be possible to define a list style using that dialog, but I would not try it. &nbsp;Go down two levels further to the
 professional controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 19: This suggests to me that there is something very wrong with your Normal template, and this process is never going to work until you fix that. &nbsp;It sounds as though your Normal template has gone "read-only". &nbsp;Templates sometimes do that if you make
 too many changes that overlap and conflict. &nbsp;It's very possible to get them into that condition by making mistakes in this procedure. &nbsp;It may be that you have more than one copy of Word running. &nbsp;No big problem: here is how to get them back:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the other copy of Word if there's more than one (Quit, not minimise...)</li><li>Save the new template to the desktop or wherever you can.</li><li>Rename the old template</li><li>Move the new template to the "/Users/&lt;user name&gt;/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates" folder where it is supposed to be.</li><li>The new template will contain all your customised styles, plus the changes you are now making, and should be read-write, which will enable you to maintain it.</li></ol>
<p>Step 22: The name that will appear in the style windows when you use the List Style is the name of whichever paragraph style you assigned to that level. &nbsp;So if you have a bulleted list style, and you are at the third level, you might see "List Bullet 3".
 &nbsp;You should never see the name of the List Style: it is simply a linking structure used behind the scenes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, you got yourself into a muddle: this process is unconscionably complex (badly designed!) and you need to follow the steps very carefully, changing the steps as appropriate to your circumstances. You will find it easier to start again than to fix the
 one you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can fix them when they go wrong, but you need to know what you are doing, and you need to successfully create a few of these before all the pieces drop into place. &nbsp;Don't beat yourself up, it took me a long time to understand this stuff because
 it is really complex (and shouldn't be, but we have to work with what exists, not what we would like...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deep breath, and recite after me: "A List Style is a structure that connects nine paragraph styles to the nine levels of a List Template." &nbsp;The paragraph styles format the text at each level: font, line-spacing etcetera. The List Template formats the behaviour
 of the list: the indents, the bullet characters, the way the numbers behave. The List Style ties the two sets of objects together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has taken me a long time to find out how this stuff actually works, and I am still not clear why they chose to design it this way. They were looking for a way to make list formatting copy from one document to another. &nbsp;Two problems they faced are: you
 can't just copy a bunch of styles into a destination document: either you will overwrite the destination formatting or you must re-name the styles, which breaks the lists. &nbsp;And you can't simply copy a list template into another document -- you corrupt the
 document if you try. &nbsp;So the List Style is not actually the formatting of a list, it is a list of instructions by which you can MAKE a list that formats the way you want it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The distinction is getting a bit esoteric. &nbsp;But it means you can copy this thing from document to document, and every time it gets there it will create the list formatting you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good questions Wendy. &nbsp;Keep at it: this is what we are here for, we need your questions more than you need our advice, so please keep them coming. &nbsp;Together we will built a complete set of instructions for others to share.</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Short answer: &nbsp;I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you will see in my later answer to Wendy, there are three objects involved: paragraph styles, list templates, and list styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, List Styles are not supported in the obsolete .doc format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know much about OpenOffice, so I do not know if it supports List Templates. &nbsp;I suspect it will have a similar structure: but remember that .doc is a binary format and there is no guarantee that they have implemented the hierarchical XML ordered list
 structure as used in .docx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, the way we used to solve this problem in the .doc format was with the use of Named List Templates. &nbsp;Otherwise known as "The Margaret Aldis Method". &nbsp;Margaret's code is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/numbering/ListRestartFromStyle.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/faqs/numbering/ListRestartFromStyle.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of us believe this is where Microsoft got the idea for List Styles from. &nbsp;What Margaret's code is doing is looking through the list templates in a document for one that has the "name" we are expecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem we face is not in defining the list formatting, but in finding the definition again later. Margaret's code slaps a label on the thing so we can find it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now: &nbsp;Don't get led astray here: List Templates do not HAVE a "Name". &nbsp;That's the problem Microsoft solved with List Styles. &nbsp;But List Templates DO have a "name" field that was intended to store the name of the SEQ or ListNum field list that the list template
 would format. No problem: it is almost unknown for that field to be used for its intended purpose, so there's no real downside to overloading it as the name of our list template. &nbsp;Just be careful what you write in there: various list names are reserved: LegalDefault,
 NumberDefault, OutlineDefault are reserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Margaret's code is complex, but it will certainly run in Word 2011 (and, I guess, in OpenOffice).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this system is not foolproof. &nbsp;You have to train users NOT to touch the Bullets and Numbering button at any time: because as soon as they do, they will break the list template, potentially even removing the name from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check for these conditions and repair the damage on document open. &nbsp;It's a lot more code, and you need to understand the whole thing really well. A commercial coder would run this up for you for around $40,000 if you could find one who understands
 the mechanism well enough. But it's still not 100% bullet-proof: there are ways users can cause such damage that you can't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this kind of money, it really becomes a lot more cost-effective to buy a Mac or PC and a real copy of Microsoft Word that will provide List Styles. &nbsp;Then you can get rid of the obsolete .doc format and your life will become a lot easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks. I have a Mac with Word 2011 now, and my problem is shifting of multi-level lists when I convert my old files from .doc to .docx using Word. Maybe a root of this problem was in OOo where these documents are created but now I meet with a legacy of
 these problems everyday...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, your explaining may help me in future. Best regards!</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 1020 Cyan not connecting to my laptop.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello frnds. I own a lumia 1020 - Cyan update. When I bought it, it was comfortable connecting&nbsp;with my win8.1&nbsp;Dell lappy with the standard nokia usb cable. But then after a month or so, gradually it showed some problems while connecting. In those days,&nbsp;I
 used to hold my phone&nbsp;in some specific manner for the phone to connect !!! Yaa I know, that sounds absurd, but it is true ! Then it used to suddenly disconnect in between and reconnect.&nbsp;My lappy also used to show :&nbsp;"Device not Identified".&nbsp;I thought that it
 was a fault with my phone's or my lappy's usb port. But then I used it with another lappy with Win7 with various other&nbsp;cables. It just didnt connect. I went to the service centre. They said, it would be alright within few days. After two days,&nbsp;I got a call
 from the centre saying my phone was now okay. I went there, checked it... and yes it was working alright. But when i came back home, what I see, the problem was still there. The phone was not able to be identified. I took the phone back to the centre. And
 to my astonishment, they gave me so stupid and vague&nbsp;replies ! They said, sir your lappy has win8, our PCs have win7 and your phone connects on win7 !!! I mean seriously ? I took my lappy to them and showed the problem.&nbsp;I said I have tested my phone atleast
 on 5 other laptops, its not working. They just refused to accept the phone for service. I said, atleast report this problem to the company ahead. They said sir, in front of us, the phone is perfect so we can't do that !!!</p>
<p>Freinds, I really look&nbsp;forward for your help. I have tried all possible ways... Updating the drivers, reconnecting after switching off, dozens of usb cables, half-dozens of PCs and what not ! Please help guyz. I mean how will I transfer those big-MB files
 to and fro ? As of now,&nbsp;I use wifi transfer, but that is&nbsp;not as speedy and reliable, you know.&nbsp;I will really really&nbsp;appreciate your suggestion friends.</p>

<p>Causes can be different - a hairline crack where the port is connected to the phone's main board due to a manufacturing fault or more likely physical impact (a drop, even from a small distance can make it happen); corrosion in that same area caused by liquid
 ingress - you don't have to dunk the phone in the toilet to cause that, it could be caused by condensation in a humid environment, sweat, rain, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that is the problem, the only solution is a replacement of the main board, since usually the USB connector is hard-soldered to it and is virtually impossible to repair. That is a very expensive exercise if not accepted under warranty - and I suspect that
 the service point has already prepared the groundwork for a non-warranty repair by telling you about liquid damage and taking photos of the inside of the unit. I am not saying they are right or not, since I cannot check the phone myself, but it seems they
 have prepared themselves for this scenario.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>In the Internet Explorer window, click on Help&gt; About Internet Explorer. You may have to right-click the Internet Explorer toolbar and check Menu Bar in order to see "Help."</p>
<p>Or, hitting the Alt key, with an IE window open, will temporarily display the Menu Bar.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Yes, it's not feasible to attach SharePoint online files in a task of Planner. I understand it will be great and much more convenient if we could upload SharePoint online files
 directly on task. Therefore, I would suggest you vote this post in our Planner Uservoice:
</span><a href="https://planner.uservoice.com/forums/330525-microsoft-planner-feedback-forum/suggestions/14847522-allow-documents-to-link-to-sharepoint-rather-than" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Allow documents to link to Sharepoint rather than OneDrive</span></a><span>.
 This is the best way to improve our product. We appreciate your valuable insights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Oriel, Apex and Other Themes from PowerPoint 2007</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />What do you do when you need Themes that were included in older versions of PowerPoint, such as PowerPoint 2007.
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>PowerPoint 2007 included several Themes, most of which are not available in newer versions of PowerPoint -- so what do you do if you need a particular Theme from PowerPoint 2007 for a project or a study exercise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can ask anyone who has PowerPoint 2007 to create a single slide presentation based on that Theme and send it to you. Alternatively, if you have PowerPoint 2007 installed on an older computer, you will find all Themes within this folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Document Themes 12&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your location may differ if you installed Office 2007 on a drive other than your C drive. Your folder path may also differ if you did not choose to install Office 2007 to the default location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, the Themes included within Office 2007 were:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apex</p>
<p>Aspect</p>
<p>Civic</p>
<p>Concourse</p>
<p>Equity</p>
<p>Flow</p>
<p>Foundry</p>
<p>Median</p>
<p>Metro</p>
<p>Module</p>
<p>Office Theme</p>
<p>Opulent</p>
<p>Oriel</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>Paper</p>
<p>Solistice</p>
<p>Technic</p>
<p>Trek</p>
<p>Urban</p>
<p>Verve</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find out how these Themes look at this resource page:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/themes/which-themes-are-installed.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Which Themes are Installed within Office Versions?</a></p>

                    I've been using OneNote for some time.&nbsp; Lately, maybe for the past couple of months, I'll be typing along and it will just pause/freeze and then resume.<br />
I've closed all but one notebook, but it continues to do this.<br />
<br />
I've run the onenote /safeboot, but I'm still seeing the problem.<br />
