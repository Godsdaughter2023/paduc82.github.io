                    <p>I have noticed that in word 2011 for mac It prompts you when you open a document if it is already in use by another person but excel doesn't. I have compared the settings and cannot see anywhere to change this?</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Vincenzo,<br />
<br />
As the case has been archived, I would like to provide a summary to let community members easily see the information.<br />
<br />
Issue Description<br />
============ &nbsp;<br />
When logging out from the Office 365 Portal on Safari on Mac, an empty file named "logout" will be downloaded.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Assessment<br />
===========<br />
As the issue cannot be reproduced now, we have archived this case. <br />
<br />
Our troubleshooting steps would be to compare the safari extension of the machine in question and another Mac computer. Pop up window and cookies in safari should also be checked.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards,<br />
Sheen

<h2>            Find Destination or Points to Address</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use PHPMailer in my website and I got to the point where gmail gets the emails sent, Hotmail sends them to the junk folder and Office365 does not let the emails go through. I talked to my hosting techs and they informed me that the emails
 are going through their servers and that is probably causing the emails to be rejected. Searching deeper into the issue I came accross this page:&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Gather-the-information-you-need-to-create-Office-365-DNS-records-77f90d4a-dc7f-4f09-8972-c1b03ea85a67?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US
 which asks me for the&nbsp;Destination or Points to Address. Unfortunately I cannot find this value at Office365 Admin area nor at godaddy.com. Can you help me find the&nbsp;Destination or Points to Address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Yet another Data Thread - 3220 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morpheus---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yet another Data Thread - 3220</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have gon and purchased a DKU-5 cable from my wifes Nokia 3220 from Orange.<br />
I have done the recomended install by installing software (Nokia suite) then installing the DKU-5 Driver from disk then connecting the phone, I unfortunately don't get a connection and one time I got an error code (0x8004360a) but can't find any info on this.<br />
I haven't yet tried Switching the PC off - connecting the cable - connect the phone - switch the PC on yet but surely this isn't the way it needs to be done?<br />
<br />
Any further info or suggestions would be appreciated<br />
<br />
[]V[]<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Forgot to add that according to the phone manual I should go to - Menu -&gt; Settings-&gt; connectivity -&gt; Packet Data -&gt; Packet Data Connection this however isn't in this phone I can get to connectivity but only have an option for GPRS not Packet Data.

            ok,<br />
<br />
So I decided to try with my PC which already had all the software as I have a N70, but all I did was install the drivers. An hey presto it's working.<br />
But why wouldn't it work on my missus PC?<br />

            could be anything. but you have highlighted the fact that the first computer is the faulty component.<br />
<br />
you could try updating windows manually, disabling your security software etc and try to reinstall pc suite to it.

            Dude,<br />
<br />
Not to judge your intellegents but you saying the 1st PC is Faulty, I think not, I have put it down to the way it was installed, as this is a 3rd party cable the process should be as folows:<br />
Install Nokia Suite first,<br />
Then Install the Driver supplied for the cable,<br />
then plug in the cable and Windows will want to do it's thing,<br />
go through the process of windows found new hardware,<br />
Then goto device manager and look for USB COM device and update driver pointing it to the file on the CD or where ever the driver is located,<br />
Goto Nokia Suite and select<br />
then only and only the goto manage Connections and select Serial cable (DKU-5, CA42)<br />
then and only then connect the phone and and press Get Connected.<br />
<br />
That worked for me so hopefully it will for you as well.

            I thought you're always supposed to install the DKU-5 driver first and then the PC Suite, at least that's what it says in the PC Suite download Flash thingy..?<br />
<br />
So maybe you could uninstall the Suite and the driver and try again but this time install the driver first.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is known fact that 3rd party cables and drivers does not work. DKU-5 cable itself includes some software that converts phone messages into PC messages and vice versa. In 3rd party cables this SW cannot be same than in Nokia genuine cable --&gt; problems!<br />
What you should do is to buy genuine Nokia CA-42 cable. It will most probably cost some more than fake cable but it will most probably work much better.

            If that's the case then why does it work on my PC and all I did was install the driver then insert the cable, manually install the driver again and then pluigged the phone in?

            to be honest it doesnt really matter, you have a third party cable and the DKU-5 driver was never designed to work with your cable. so, it might work on one pc but not on the other.<br />
<br />
basically, either use the nokia cable or install the driver that came with your cable.

            Hi David,<br />
<br />
When searching emails in your account through Outlook.com, it will display all the emails that contain the information that you entered in the search box. These are collated by the system which comes from all folders in your account. Regarding your concern,
 customizing the search result is currently unavailable. However, this would be ideal to have in Outlook.com. We would appreciate if you could raise this to our Outlook team as a feedback by going to our
<strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Feedback</a></strong> page. That way, our team could add it as a feature in the future updates.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

<p>Hi there and thanks so much for getting back to me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you will find THIS update interesting for sure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOMETIMES when I do a search...the FOLDERS that the emails are actually IN...DO show up on the right hand side!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact it happenned only a couple of days ago when I did a search, but it does happen that the FOLDERS containing</p>
<p>the searched-for stuff ARE shown over there on the right-hand-side...SOMETIMES and at random!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let's keep this "conversation" OPEN and when I do another search and those FOLDERS (with names) are shown</p>
<p>again, I will take ANOTHER screen capture and display it here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards:&nbsp; DAVID.</p>

    <title>Audio file won&#39;t play - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio file won&#39;t play</h2>
                    <p>I recorded a meeting using Skype for Business, but the audio file will not play. It's an MP4 file and is 62.3 MB. When I click it to open it in WMP, an error message appears stating "WMP cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or
 might not support the codec that was used to compress the file." I have also tried to open it in other programs with no luck. Is there any fix for this?</p>
<p>

Thank you so much Don.&nbsp; I&nbsp; already decided to uninstall my Outlook App and leave the rest of Office 2010 on my System. I use the other programs, ( including Publisher) and now my mail still comes in via regular means. I just don't have the other facets like
 Calendar, and in the future if I want to reinstall that portion of the Suite,&nbsp; I will keep your suggestions . You sure sound like you know what you are doing, unlike me.

<h3> ding_dong_yo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 not launching in Windows 8.1 - &#34;ordinal 294 missing in ieframe.dll&#34; related&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Internet Explorer will not launch at all in my Windows 8 desktop. Not really an issue, but some programs that depend on IE will fail installing because it won't launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<p>- I've had Task Manager open when trying to launch IE. I can't see any Internet Explorer process appear at all, not even a fleeting one.</p>
<p>- I turned IE off and back on in the Windows Default Programs, no fix. </p>
<p>- Event Viewer doesn't show any related errors or warnings.</p>
<p>- Running as administrator or re-pinning IE to the Taskbar doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>- When trying to install some programs, I get a "<strong>The </strong><strong>ordinal
</strong><strong>294 could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\ieframe.dll.</strong>" popup error. The install then forces me to abort.</p>
<p>- I've run the two IE-related "Microsoft Fix It"s I could find. One ran successfully, the other reported that it did not apply to my system. Problem persists.</p>
<p>- I also ran a full scan using System File Checker. It resulted in "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log
<var>%WinDir%</var>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log." I opened CBS.log, but it's massive and I have no idea what I'm looking at or what I'm supposed to do with it.</p>
<p>- I downloaded and ran Microsoft's Safety Scanner, which took several hours and reported one adjustment to my computer. IE still fails.</p>
<p>- I restarted after all of these adjustments and attempted IE again. No improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this could be fixed with a reinstall of Internet Explorer, but everything in Microsoft Support says that's impossible now because it's "part of the OS." Does this mean I have to reinstall my entire operating system just because one component
 is failing?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you have described it appears that the some of the DLL files required for Internet Explorer is either corrupt or missing. You have already performed most of the relevant troubleshooting steps and yet the issue persists. In this case, I would suggest
 you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue started recently, restore the computer to an earlier date prior to the issue and check. Refer to the section ‘Restore your PC to an earlier point in time’ in this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned the SFC scan reported corrupt files which it couldn’t fix. If the issue persists after the system restore, then I would suggest you to run the DISM tool and check. Refer to these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press&nbsp;Windows key + X, select ‘Command prompt (Admin)’.</li><li>In the&nbsp;Command prompt window, type the following commands and press enter after &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each command:</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Close&nbsp;the command prompt and check.</li></ul>
<p>Try these steps and let us know the results for further assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, I have just realized that you might have a different ieframe.dll than my EN-US one.&nbsp; E.g. I think there could be a MUI difference.&nbsp; Perhaps that would be enough to give you that ordinal?</p>

            <p>The commands in the suggestion don't work. &nbsp;In fact, the DISM.exe/online/? won't work either as the DISM.exe/? file claims it will. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's no wonder many of my friends and colleagues won't use Explorer at all. &nbsp;How does a DLL file get corrupted or removed in the first place? &nbsp;I tried the restore point solution and it worked until the next update from Windows, and then Explorer began crashing
 again. &nbsp;Computer wouldn't let me restore back to that point again, so I'm stuck. &nbsp;This is a Windows issue, so I don't think I should have to pay for an outside software system to "fix" the problem. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ben</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not only getting the dll error as described. In my case I also lost the whole Win 8 start screen (black screen). I manage to reach the desktop though.</p>
<p>Another issue is that I cant access Skydrive (sorry, OneDrive) in the exporer (only offline content available). It claimes I am not allowed/access/priveledge or similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway. I tried your commands as I could not roll back. The first succeeded but the second failed (see screen shot)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/433398df-b073-4888-bcc3-e0b478abe100" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more advice or do I need to call your collegues and open a case? I am very sure this has to do with a win update so it would need a public fix for this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>

            <p>There should be no problem deleting the old onenote app even if all data on the device is cleaned up as well ... as long as your last edits had been synchronised with OneDrive (you could check on www.onenote.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data on your device the message is referring to is the OneNote cache ... an offline copy of all (opened) notebook content; the original is kept on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely after that when opening the new app it will download all notebook content again which can take a while. So make sure you do this while connected via WiFi.</p>

                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I basically have the same issue as this person: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_win10-mso_365hp/were-sorry-we-cant-open-xxxdocx-because-we-found-a/a1f3ac1c-0459-4c51-bf32-7d94952684e1?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially my documents have been getting corrupted for some reason. I spent an entire day on trying to figure out why/how this was happening and I've managed to pinpoint and replicate the specific problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the previous thread mentions, there is some kind of bug that occurs with Comment boxes. Below is a link to a test document with instructions on how to replicate this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test Document: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZRuU8DpUU25cchtXNDwXdR76JrMUdjq/view?usp=sharing</p>

</p><p>Full folder with error &amp; repaired files: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1icMLmsTyABU_JXWqJnX5HUGHkDWSuoaC?usp=sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>This however only identifies the problem. If anyone can help out with a solution please advise!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm struggling greatly to continue to work on this document of mine because of this issue. Fortunately I make constant backups so was able to revert to a previous version when this error occurred. This real issue is that this keeps happening and it's impeding
 my project.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming that this is some kind of a bug with the office programs. I've tested this with two different computers. My main rig (Skylake) has the latest version of everything. Word 2016 was last updated this month (January 2018 ver. 1711). My other backup
 computer has a very old version of Word 2016, but the exact same errors occur. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see if you can also replicate this error with the files provided above. And I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can provide a solution for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<br />There are real MS staff and developers who monitor all submissions to the UserVoice forums whether you submit them through the Feedback Hub, or by using the Feedback command built in to some MS applications, like Office 2016, or by using the appropriate link directly
<br />
<br />This next link is a wiki with a collection of MS UserVoice.com sites I’ve encountered (I’m sure there are more):

<br />Softie Devlin Sco suggested using the Win 10 Feedback Hub to capture errors to submit to MS. I am waiting for confirmation that it can be used to capture, and submit to MS Support, Office installation errors.
<br />NOTE: If you do submit a suggestion to UserVoice, please copy the link and post it back here in a reply so that other people can more easily find it and vote to support it and add their comments.
<br />
<br />In order to submit new feedback, please follow these steps:
<br />1.	On a Windows 10 device, search for “Feedback Hub” in Cortana search, then launch the app.
<br />2.	Navigate to Feedback in the left menu, then press + Add new feedback.
<br />3.	Select the Problem, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory
<br />Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) (ie start Office Install) after clicking Begin monitoring (or Start capture) near the end of the form; Stop monitoring when you’re done
<br />4.	Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click Submit
<br />5.	Click Continue using Feedback Hub
<br />6.	Click My feedback at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear)
<br />7.	Open the item you submitted, then click Share
<br />8.	Click Copy link, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like <a href="https://aka.ms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/</a> &lt;unique link&gt;)

<br />“USERVOICE.COM” - MS SUGGESTION BOX SITES 
<br />The Office 2016 applications now have the File menu &gt; Feedback command.  The 2 “smiley face” buttons just submit ideas, with no possibility of feedback.  The third “I Have a Suggestion” button. It connects you to the appropriate “UserVoice” subsite.  There you can make a suggestion. During the start of the process it does a keyword search looking for similar existing suggestions. You can pick an existing suggestion to vote for (and add a comment to or you can submit a new suggestion.  Copy the link to the suggestion and post it back in the Answers forum if you had a question started there. 
<br />A better place to submit this type of feedback the “UserVoice” forum. You can submit suggestions for “new feature requests”, “change existing feature requests” or actual “bug reports” to the forum either by “voting” and commenting on a similar existing suggestion or by creating a new suggestion for others to vote and comment on.
<br />When MS determines there is “enough” interest they will change the status of the post to indicate if they are going to work on it or ignore it.  What is “enough” interest is totally undefined. Some postings have been acted on with only a dozen or 2 votes and comments.  Others (like “bring back Picture Manager” continue to be ignored even though they have several hundred votes and comments. 
<br />It is also a good idea to provide cross posted links.  Put a link back to this answers.com posting on UserVoice, and add a reply here with a link to your specific posting on UserVoice. 
<br />Pointing to “uservoice” is a wasted effort.  That is just the high level identifier with no link to MS specific subsites! 
<br />•	MS has SEVERAL dozen sub sites. 
<br />•	MS does NOT have naming standards for those sub sites. 
<br />•	MS does NOT have a home page to guide people to all of the sub sites. 
<br />&lt;HINT HINT MS!&gt;
<br />This next link is a wiki with a collection of MS UserVoice.com sites I’ve encountered (I’m sure there are more):

<br />Go to UserVoice, either through specific links I’ve provided below or create your own suggestions there. That is where MS is looking specifically for this type of user feedback to bring them back to reality from what-ever lala-land they are working in when they make these “improvements”.  Comments (and votes) like these in UserVoice helped to convince MS to roll back the “phat QAT” buttons in 2016 and to at least partially undo the 2016 changes to the way the Pen input works.
<br />
<br />Please do copy the comments you’ve made here and paste them into comments in UserVoice. Also include a link to this question. If you do make a suggestion, copy the link to the UserVoice suggestion and post it back on this question so other people with the same problem can vote for it and comment on it. (You’ll get faster action that way.) Please get all of your friends and co-workers who use Office to vote for your issue!

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your advice. I have made a post on uservoice.com as you suggested:
<a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304924-word-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/33023944--major-corrupt-document-error-we-re-sorry-we-can" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft released another patch for Office 2016 (Version 1712 - January 17, 2018), but this patch does absolutely nothing to address this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously had sent feedback directly from Office 2016 but who knows if they're actually addressing this or not. I literally can't do my work because of this bug, and moving on to another application at this point would literally take me months of work
 to recreate with all the different headings, comments etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm gonna continually spam them with the feedback button, let's see if that does anything to grab their attention.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, can you perhaps confirm if this bug also occurs at your end? It would only take a few seconds of your time, and would further validate that this is not just a problem with my specific application or something:

<p>
</p><p>In the half dozen or so documents for which I have fixed this problem, there has only ever been one piece of "bookmark" related code in the comments.xml and deleting it has always overcome the problem of the comments not being visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an issue that has been brought to the attention of the Microsoft employees charged with trying to overcome the issues with document corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have not tried to replicate the issue using the procedure that you highlighted in yellow, I have sent a message to Microsoft employees advising them of this thread and that you had included a procedure in it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've attempted your method but that also just corrupts the document. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that the main problem occurs only when attempting to create a new comment around the "MAIN BODY" text field. There's something around there that is causing the corruption. There were bookmark links in the original document but I removed them
 and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just spent a bit more time meddling with this document and I've discovered/narrowed down the problem further. In fact, I think I've found the solution at least for this particular document. If you delete the "CATEGORIES:" comment field, that basically
 seems to solve the problem. After that it looks like you can create as many new comments as you like and the document won't get corrupted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you don't delete the "CATEGORIES:" comment field, then creating new comments around the "CATEGORIES:" text area or "MAIN BODY" text area causes the document to get corrupted. So there's something there around those fields that is causing the
 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issue though is that in my actual project files there are likely dozens of these "corrupt prone points", and there's literally no way of knowing where all these corrupt points are (at least without searching through the code directly, which I'm
 no expert on). </p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone here can perhaps take a look at the code specifically around the "CATEGORIES:" comment field, and see if there's something off, that might help to identify exactly what's causing this error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Unable to print docs &#34;properly&#34; directly from 365 Word.</h2>
                    
<p>I am unable to print Word or Excel docs "properly" from Office 365. After opening a document from Office 365 (OneDrive), I click the "Print" icon, and the doc opens up in a PDF. Upon attempting to print, it prints out in a shrunken, and unusable format.
 We have to re-save the document to a Word or Excel file to our local drive, and print from there. This seems very convoluted to me.</p>

<p>Same applies when attempting to e-mail a doc directly from OneDrive. Have to re-save and send as a separate attachement.</p>
<p><br />
Am I doing something wrong, or is this just the way it is? Please advise. Thank you....</p>

<p>hi robert,</p>
<p>to clarify the situation, can you confirm the information below?</p>
<p>1. regarding “it prints out in a shrunken, and unusable format.”, can you share with us a picture of a sample printed page?
<br />
to upload screenshots, click <b>use rich formatting</b> in this thread and select
<b>insert/edit media</b>.</p>
<p>2. does the document open a right format in pdf when click print in office online? &nbsp;have you tried adjusting the page layout or using another format and see the outcome?</p>
<p>3. regarding the problem when attempting to e-mail a doc directly from onedrive, can you let us know the specific error symptom? is there any error message when you attach files from the onedrive for business library?<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;IainL2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support. Glad to reply to your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your description, my understanding is that the "quota" refers to your Android physical memory but not your Office 365 mailbox's memory since your Office 365 mailbox has no such an issue in Outlook client. However, please be noted that the storing size
 of your Office 365 mailbox will be calculated into your Android physical memory. In other words, the bigger size of your Office 365 mailbox, the more memory occupied for your Android physical memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, please try firstly back up the data from your Outlook and then reduce the size of your Office 365 mailbox. After that, you can check whether the error persists on your Andorid Outlook app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it persists, please contact the "In- App" support of Outlook for Android via&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-in-app-help-for-outlook-for-ios-and-android-218a22d1-9fa5-4889-b689-de1c63493243#ID0EAABAAA=Contact_Support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-in-app-help-for-outlook-for-ios-and-android-218a22d1-9fa5-4889-b689-de1c63493243#ID0EAABAAA=Contact_Support</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Data Validation - Combining more than one criteria</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>I need to validate a data entry from a list. Also, I want to stop the user to enter any duplicate data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, usually I prevent user from entering duplicate data by using the following formula on the dropdown list.</p>
<p>=COUNTIF(A:A,A1&lt;=1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as far as I am aware, the easiest way to enable a user to enter data from a given list is to use data validation and the nominate the list that has the required values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, is there a method to combine these to data validation for the same cell ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>Data Validation </strong>is a very useful feature in Excel. You can use it to create a drop down list in a cell and limit the values user can enter. However, sometimes you may want to prevent users from entering duplicate values
 in a range of worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 2 ways on how you can set-up the settings correctly to have this function available on your end. Please follow the steps on the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Prevent duplicate entries with Data Validation feature:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(For this scenario, we are entering identify card number into a range of cells (A1:A20), and we want to ensure that all item numbers entered in range A1:A20 are unique).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the range of cells that will contain the item numbers. Go to <strong>Data &gt; Data Validation &gt; Data Validation</strong>. Please see screenshot below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79f34b65-2e7c-4239-b406-1eced2b7af68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79f34b65-2e7c-4239-b406-1eced2b7af68" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Data Validation </strong>dialog box will display. Click the <strong>Settings
</strong>tab, click drop down list under <strong>Allow</strong>, choose <strong>Custom
</strong>then enter this formula <strong><em>=COUNTIF($A1:$A$20,A1)=1</em></strong> into the
<strong>Formula </strong>box. See screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10e429bf-e8dc-4c59-9ca0-8c54402e2e84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10e429bf-e8dc-4c59-9ca0-8c54402e2e84" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Error Alert </strong>tab under the <strong>Title </strong>box. Enter
<strong>Duplicate Entry </strong>then put the proper message in the <strong>Error Message Box
</strong>such as <strong><em>The value was already entered. All Item Numbers must be unique. Please try again.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87e477c6-563f-4c7f-b789-44e87569d4c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87e477c6-563f-4c7f-b789-44e87569d4c5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>OK </strong>to finish it. Now when you enter a duplicate number,
<strong>Excel </strong>will prevent the entry and alert the user with an error message, it will show like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c38c924b-bb67-47a6-acac-cabe0131ab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c38c924b-bb67-47a6-acac-cabe0131ab01" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Quickly prevent duplicate entries with one click:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of the convenient way to easily access and work on the data validation function. Refer on the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the range that you want to prevent duplicate entries. Click <strong>Kutools &gt; Prevent Duplicate Entries</strong>. Please check the screenshot attached:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7baf16d-fc04-4d15-8ab8-990b725a8367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7baf16d-fc04-4d15-8ab8-990b725a8367" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when you enter the same data with the first data in the range, you will get the following warning:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00ef6742-579c-4fef-9f24-89bd6f8206e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00ef6742-579c-4fef-9f24-89bd6f8206e1" /></a></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As I stated before, I think I didn't make it clear in my request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to make a list on table which selects its data from another source (using data validation) and also it should not allow to use duplicate entries on the selected data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above, we can do either of that on a range of cells separately but wondering if there is a way to combine that on the same list.</p>

            <p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe&nbsp; you stated you requirement clearly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Short and sweet, there is no easy built in way to satisfy that requirement with the existing capabilities of data validation.&nbsp; However, I have outlined a possible approach you could use to achieve your objectives.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you would need to do is have your list of items but that would not be the source for your data validation.&nbsp; You would need to set up a second list that is populated with formulas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formulas would reference the choices you have made and build a list for the dropdown that includes no duplicates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would dynamically refer to this second list using a named range and the named range would be what you would refer to in your data validation list. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a cell is filled, the choice would be removed from the list.&nbsp; That would not affect that cell because data validation is only used when an entry is being made (a choice is being made).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, using macros is of course another option. </p>
<p>
</p><p>-- </p>

    <title>Using Tabs within a Table Cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c-ramage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Tabs within a Table Cell</h2>
                    I am using word 2008 and working in a document that was created on a PC a ways back. &nbsp;I am working in a table which has a tab set within a cell. When entering new data, even though the tab is set, the tab key just advances to the next cell, not to the
 tab stop. &nbsp;The only way I can enter new data that is formatted correctly is to copy an old cell and change the data. &nbsp;Does tabbing within a cell no longer function or is there something else I must do?&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the following example, the tab is used to enter the year on the second line so it is positioned equally for all cells.
