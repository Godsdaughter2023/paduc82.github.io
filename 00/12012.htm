    <title>locking the view in Outlook 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            locking the view in Outlook 365</h2>
                    <p>I have installed outlook 365.&nbsp; When we set the preview pane to the right and size the columns to show who the sender is and the date, then open an email or click on the calendar and then return to mail, the preview pane is gone and the columns have reverted
 back to the incorrect size.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you lock this or prevent this from happening?&nbsp; I've only had one user complaint so far so it seems to be isolated to one user.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jay</p>

    <title>The Settings app does not belong in Desktop mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ace2213  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Settings app does not belong in Desktop mode</h2>
                    I understand that some people like the Settings app. I understand that the majority tolerates it. I understand that the future (unfortunately) demands it, for all those who primarily use smartphones with their simplified UI, and also for touchscreens on
 Windows 10.<br />
<br />
All that being said, the Settings app is TERRIBLE for desktop users, especially long-time desktop users. To address this issue, I suggest keeping the Settings app for tablet mode (also as an option for laptops/desktops with touchscreens) but
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>leave the Control Panel alone in Desktop mode</strong></em></span>.<br />
<br />
For the love of God. I'm not old. I'm 24. I've been using Windows since 98. I actually didn't hate Windows 8. Yes I hardly ever used Metro (or whatever you guys are calling it these days) and was perfectly fine remaining in Desktop mode. I did find it slightly
 offensive that "Desktop" was demoted to "App" status, but I got over it.<br />
<br />
With Windows 10, however, Desktop mode itself is under siege. It has been slowly losing functionality. I have noticed an increase in the number of times I am forced to use the Settings app, or at least where it has become the default option. For example, when
 I click the "System Properties" shortcut in Explorer, I want to see a summary of my specifications and have access to "System" settings. Now, that same shortcut pulls up the Settings app (and so does "Uninstall a program", as does "Open Settings"). WHY? I
 don't care if it's functionally the same. I shouldn't have to be yanked out of my desktop experience for an app that obviously is designed for kids on touchscreens. And my laptop's touchpad is broken, so I navigate primarily using mouse keys and the keyboard.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Metro Apps are not possible to navigate by keyboard or mouse keys.</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
And no I'm not asking you to fix that. It's for touchscreen users and that's fine. Just stop forcing me to use it. Touchscreen users prefer it over the traditional Control Panel, so keep it for them. And keep the Control Panel for us Desktop users. I don't
 see why everything is all or nothing to Microsoft. Like how I can't disable Cortana (ever. Not completely anyway) without losing Search functionality. Just, why? Why do you have to try and force me to use things I simply don't need or want? When it ain't broke,
 why try to fix it? Add the option, on the side, for those who want to use it, but why make it an integral part of the OS that can make or break a big part of the UX? Keep all of that stuff separate from Desktop, like Metro. It's there for touchscreen devices
 (or in tablet mode) and otherwise it's out of the way, and removable to save resources.<br />
<br />
I will never use the Settings app, so making it increasingly difficult to access Control Panel is not moving me away from Control Panel, it's moving me away from Windows. Stop harassing actual users for kids who just want to play Candy Crush and watch Netflix.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Added screenshot of 3 shortcuts in Explorer that open the Settings app:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/553df78d-0847-4a06-8dba-745fd62f4c72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/553df78d-0847-4a06-8dba-745fd62f4c72" /></a><br />

            You need to post in the feedback hub where MS will see it, as I have no issues with the control panel I simply put the icon on the desktop, taskbar or start screen, it's even easy to find just type "c" in the search bar and a menu pops up, in my opinion
 for MS to make it harder to find is to help keep the users with little or no knowledge of computers from messing up the system same reason for auto updates

<p>Sorry J&amp;N but those are silly reasons. Windows has always (at least as far back as Windows 98) had access to Control Panel right in the Start Menu. And I don't know about you, but I never heard of a child or an inexperienced user "messing up the system".
 People, and children, get intimidated by things they don't understand and usually leave immediately.<br />
<br />
I'm frankly tired of this cat and mouse game with Microsoft. With every new update I explore everything new to see what I want to add to my routine, what I'm willing to adjust to and what I absolutely must find a way to get rid of. And for some reason, they
 really love making drastic changes with every update now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I'm aware of the purpose of this forum. I also understand how beta releases work, which is evidenced by the fact that I go out of my way to clean install new versions of Windows. I clearly specified that I'm not an old man who is unable to adapt or deal
 with change; otherwise I would absolutely stop updating to newer versions. You seem to be under the impression that I'm updating to beta builds by accident.<br />
<br />
In case you misunderstood my post, I made it to voice my dismay with the direction Windows is going in- to provide feedback. Your inability to comprehend my extremely thorough and detailed post does not make me ignorant or unable to adapt to change. It makes
 you narrow-minded. Please spare me the cookie cutter responses if you decide to reply again.</p>
<p><br />
Regarding the app, I disagree with being forced to have my precious storage used up by "system apps" that I can't remove, which is why I've gone through the trouble of removing all of them. I don't care how important you believe they are. The fact that feedback
 is provided exclusively through a forced app is unacceptable. What kind of app doesn't have a web interface anyway? Especially an app whose audience is supposed to be advanced users and beta testers, not children who enjoy large monochrome tiles with faded
 "metro" colors.<br />
<br />
I never once said that Windows needs to stop changing. I said that Windows needs to stop trying to fix what isn't broken simply because it's not "child-friendly" enough. Again, I understand and support adding a "user-friendly" alternative alongside the main
 one. What I disagree with is being forced to use those childish alternatives, or being forced to use anything for that matter.<br />
<br />
It's sad to see Microsoft adopting Apple's simplified walled-garden approach to its most successful offering. And when I voice my dismay with this direction, I'm told to "if I don't like it, stop updating". Is this how you respond to all feedback or just when
 it points out how backwards and idiotic you've become?</p>

<p>For testing purposes, I have enabled auditing and I have added myself as a full access delegate on another user's mailbox and then logged in to their account from OWA. &nbsp;Where would I look or what would I search for in the audit log to find this activity?
 &nbsp;I can't find it in "Run a non-owner mailbox access report..." or the Audit log search after 24 hours.</p>

<p>Hi Layne,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>When you say “<em>I can't find it in "Run a non-owner mailbox access report...",</em> do you mean that you can’t find Non-Owner Mailbox Access Report in the Exchange Administration Center or else?</p>
<p>Please make sure that you have an Exchange administrator rights then you can access the Exchange admin center (EAC), and can perform the Non-Owner Mailbox Access Report in the Exchange Administration Center lists the mailboxes that have been accessed by
 someone other than the person who owns the mailbox.</p>
<p>When you enable mailbox audit logging for a mailbox, Microsoft Exchange logs specific actions by non-owners, including both administrators and users, called delegated users, who have been assigned permissions to a mailbox.</p>
<p>To Run a non-owner mailbox access report, please refer to the following steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;In the <strong>EAC</strong>, navigate to <strong>Compliance Management</strong> &gt;
<strong>Auditing.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Click <strong>Run a non-owner mailbox access report.</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, you can also specify the type of non-owner access, also called the logon type, to search for. Here are your options:<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>All non-owners</strong>: Search for access by administrators and delegated users inside your organization. Also includes access user outside of your organization.<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>External users:</strong> Search for access by users outside of your organization.<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>Administrators and delegated users:</strong> Search for access by administrators and delegated users inside your organization.<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>Administrators:</strong> Search for access by administrators in your organization.</p>

<p>Note: You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mailbox audit logging" entry in the

<p>hi layne,</p>
<p>i understand that you have done everything shyamal explained but still can’t search the auditing log even after waiting for 24 hours. in general, if all the steps are taken correctly, it should work after waiting for one day.</p>
<p>may i re-confirm the following information to help you narrow down the issue?</p>
<p>1. please use powershell to check if the mailbox audit logging is enabled successfully.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that being said, then it could be that the Excel file is corrupted. Now, to isolate what is causing this issue, particularly when printing an Excel file attachment through Quick Print, have you tried saving the Excel file first, then try printing it?
 And also, what are the steps that you've already prior to resolving this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

                    I spent hours doing a large publisher brochure with many pages.&nbsp; Like an idiot when it asked if I wanted to keep it to the clipboard after I thought I had saved it, I said no.&nbsp; Now I can't find all of that work I did on Publisher 13.&nbsp; Help!

<p>
</p><p>And for what it is worth the contents on the clipboard have little to do with your Publisher publication. If you copied and pasted a lot while working on your publication then the clipboard will hold up to 24? different elements but not the entire Publisher
 file. When you close out Publisher you are then asked if you want to keep those items on the clipboard. When you said no then they disappeared forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is the Pub file you were working on was a separate operation.&nbsp; You would have been asked if you wanted to save the changes in the file when you closed it. Open Publisher and look at
<em>recent </em>publications. Your file should be there along with any changes you saved before you saved and closed the file and Publisher.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you didn't save the file? Then you can try the %temp% approach I discussed in the other post or you can start over.</p>

<h2>            Turning off AutoComplete in IE11 on Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>My work has just provided me with a Nokia Lumia phone running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has synced a load of websites from my home laptop, some of which I don't even use any more, and many of which are not suitable for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type a website name or URL into the IE browser, it attempts to autocomplete from a long list of websites (from my home laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to delete the IE history, but this doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have (I think) told it not to sync with my laptop, but this hasn't made any difference either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I turn off (or preferably erase) the autocomplete function on the phone?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access the "Get suggestions from Bing" option from <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>Internet explorer </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced settings
</strong>as garym123 was suggesting, but you can also access the same setting in <strong>
Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>search</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to delete the temporary files from <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Storage</strong> <strong>sense</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone</strong> &gt; <strong>
temporary files</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't make any difference, and that you really want to delete this automatic typing, you might have to reset your phone:</p>

<p>
</p><p>- I'm using build 10162. even it's only a beta, I clearly see that Microsoft didn't care about it (problem since Windows 8 - 2012)</p>
<p>- I don't want to resize all of the start menu. Only texts not icons, images,...</p>

<h2>            Excel - Summing numbers by currency format</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing difficulties with Excel 2013. </p>
<p>I am working on a reporting sheet, showing sales in various countries in the past month.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to sum the numbers by currency format : all euro sales summed up in a cell, those in dollars in another one, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is : how can I make excel sort and add up numbers by currency format?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An image being better than a thousand words, I posted an example below. </p>
<p>In the example, I'd like to show the sum of (number of units sold*price per unit) for all countries, sorted by currency (col. D, F, H) ; the presentation is shown as such because prices may vary between countries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you very much for your help!</p>

            <p>Hi again... ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason I can think of re. "Unit" everywhere in row 7 is that you did not copy to the&nbsp;right the formula in C7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In D7 you should read </p>
<p>=IF(MOD(COLUMN(),2),"Unit",VLOOKUP(<strong>C</strong>$6,$C$12:$D$21,2,FALSE))</p>
<p>in E7 you should read</p>
<p>=IF(MOD(COLUMN(),2),"Unit",VLOOKUP(<strong>D</strong>$6,$C$12:$D$21,2,FALSE))</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted a <a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AsuqEFbTJNgcgZkeWYN7xCUn0o_Y_A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sample on OneDrive</a>. You will see that I moved the Country/Currency table to another sheet and named that range
<strong>CountryCurrCodes</strong>. So my formula in C7 is now</p>
<p>=IF(MOD(COLUMN(),2),"Unit",VLOOKUP(C$6,<strong>CountryCurrCodes</strong>,2,FALSE)). Copied right into D7, E7... this alternatively returns "Unit" or the Currency Code that matches the Country Name enterred in row C6, E6, G6...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38d5ba9e-2210-460b-a0d0-b81427ee5774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38d5ba9e-2210-460b-a0d0-b81427ee5774" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what else to do/say for now. Again, if you could upload your file (or a sample that reflect its structure) I could potentially identify the source of the problem</p>

<h2>            Office Accounting 2009 cannot automate word</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am running Office Accounting Express 2009 and Office 365 home (Word&nbsp;16.0.11601.20178) and I'm no longer able to create invoice documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to Create/Modify an existing error I see what looks like a DCOM error.&nbsp; &nbsp;Having checked dcom config, office 2003 documents is running with authentication none and as the launching user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open an invoice and click the word icon to export, I can choose one of the templates but then Word does not open.&nbsp; Having checked Task Manager, I can see an instance of Word which I've assumed is Word running in automation mode?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restart my pc, when I log in again, an instance of Word opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions as to what might remedy this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Louise</p>

            Hi  Louise
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This is likely a compatibility issue with Office Accounting 2009 and Word 2016.
<br />
<br />You likely might have to downgrade to Word 2013 or even Office 2007 in order to get it to work. 
<br />
<br />You could always try compatibility mode to see if it works.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that when the screen locks the music stops playing in Groove Music. It is very unusual that this is not working as expected.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried to reproduce the same on my computer running on Windows 10 1903 build and it seems that the music continues to play even when the
 screen is locked.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know the version of Windows 10 (To check type:
<strong>winver</strong> in the search bar in <strong>Taskbar</strong> and hit <strong>
Enter</strong>) that you are using and the version of Groove Music (To check open Groove Music app, click on
<strong>Settings</strong> and click on <strong>About</strong>) that is installed on your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not using Windows 10 1903 build, I would suggest you to install the latest updates on the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try resetting the Groove Music application and check if that makes any difference. Please refer the troubleshooting steps mentioned
 in the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Instead of using the combining underline, could you just use <strong>Ctrl+U</strong> to underline the text? In the
<strong>Font</strong> dialog (<strong>Ctrl+D</strong>), you can choose from a number of underline styles if desired.

            The combining diacritics are notoriously unreliable and vary from one font to another.

    <title>Shared mailbox calendar - twice in outlook, once in OWA - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Shared mailbox calendar - twice in outlook, once in OWA</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Office 365 with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a calendar display issue. Have a shared mailbox (used just for sharing a calendar, including on iOS).</p>
<p>When using OWA - the calendar did not show up automatically, but I had to add it using the 'Add Calendar &gt; From Directory' option.</p>
<p>Now, in Outlook the shared calendar automatically shows (the shared mailbox appears in the Mail view mailbox list). But ... the second copy of the calendar also shows up.</p>
<p>If I delete the second copy of the calendar from outlook, it then gets removed from OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook, there is nothing in the Account settings advanced options, for open these additional mailboxes ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to get just one copy of the calendar to display in both Outlook and OWA ?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi cleareyesfullhearts,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be a synchronization issue. Please try the following steps to resolve the issue. Before doing that, please make sure they are the same calendar in case of removing wrong calenda. I suggest you do a backup for it.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Firstly, please make sure the shared calendar is removed from the both side. You can manually remove it.
</p>
<p>Generally, once we remove it from OWA, it will also be removed from Outlook, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then re-add it to the OWA calendar, open the Outlook client &gt; Calendar &gt; select “Other Calendars” folder &gt; Update Folder.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Toby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I removed the shared calendar from OWA and it got automatically removed from Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook - 2 calendars under the 'My Calendars' folder, my personal one, and the shared mailbox one. There are no calendars under the 'Other Calendars' folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In OWA - 1&nbsp;calendar under the 'My Calendars' folder, my personal one. The shared mailbox calendar does not show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-adding it to OWA (using Add Calendar &gt; From directory) adds it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;'My Calendars' folder - so I now have 2 in OWA.</p>
<p>It then gets aromatically added to Outlook - and now I have 3 calendars&nbsp;under the 'My Calendars' folder, (i) my personal one, (ii) shared mailbox calendar, (iii) another copy of the shared mailbox calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, i still need to get rid of one duplicate calendar in Outlook !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi cleareyesfullhearts,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if you can delete the original shared calendar that cannot be synced to OWA. I guess the “Delete calendar” button is grey out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding “In Outlook - 2 calendars under the 'My Calendars' folder, my personal one, and the shared mailbox one. There are no calendars under the 'Other Calendars' folder.”, the root cause might be related to this.</p>
<p>Generally, after granting us full access permission to a shared mailbox, the shared mailbox and its calendar will automatically appear in the Outlook client. The shared calendar will in our “Other Calendars” folder instead of “My Calendars” folder unless
 we manually set up an account to the Outlook client. However, as I know, the shared mailbox doesn’t have credentials.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So please provide more details about how you added the shared mailbox to the Outlook client. In addition, please try to create a new
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook profile</a> and check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>In outlook - I cannot delete the shared mailbox calendar from the 'my calendar list' - as you say it's greyed out. (the additional calendar I added in via OWA can be deleted okay).</p>

            <p><span>Hi cleareyesfullhearts,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The root cause might be related to the “shared mailbox”. I wonder how you grant shared mailbox permission to you.
</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, how did you create the shared mailbox? Please follow the articles below to create a new shared mailbox and grant “</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Full
 Access</span></strong><span><span>” permission to yourself and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>

<h2>            I need some help but I do not know how to categorize the question as to whether it is Windows or Office</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer system, a Lenovo PC desktop ThinkCenter, with 16 G memory, a hard drive with 1 T and Windows 10 plus Office 365.&nbsp; At times, the computer will suddenly just go to dead, and I do mean DEAD slow!&nbsp; Tonight as an example, it was running
 fine.&nbsp; I was doing some research using Edge with Bing, and Excel.&nbsp;&nbsp; My old system which just decided to completely die at the end of July, was running XP, SP3, with FAR less memory and much smaller hard drive.&nbsp; Right now I am dumping all of my saved files
 from everything onto an external hard drive that is not even close to being full so that is not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly, I had copied some material online and went to paste it in Excel and I could not get Excel to respond although there was no indication or notice that Excel was not responding.&nbsp; I could not get it to recognize that I had clicked on a cell and I could
 not paste the material I sought to paste and just like right now, I am about 4 lines ahead of what is showing up on the screen in this dialog box.&nbsp; I did notice finally in Excel that the little blue wheel was spinning but I had done nothing.&nbsp; After switching
 back and forth, suddenly all of the Excel windows I had open (about six) were closed and gone.&nbsp; So I waited for a bit and then I clicked the taskbar icon for Excel to open it again.&nbsp; After I clicked the icon, it was over 10 minutes before it opened and then
 it showed the screen where you pick what you want to open along with the recovered files that were opened, and saved, when Excel suddenly shut down.&nbsp; But here is the kicker, at least for me:&nbsp; that little blue wheel was back and I could not do anything in Excel
 to open any of the recovered files nor a new file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here right now, I have two questions (oops, that's odd, it has now been 15 to 20 minutes since I tried to open Excel and I just got a notice on the screen that Excel had stopped working and was being restarted or recovered, I didn't get to read the whole
 message.)&nbsp; Back to my two questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When one is in say Excel or Word and the little blue wheel icon comes on, and will not go away and just keeps spinning until infinity, seemingly, is there anything one can do to stop or shut the icon off?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Any clues as to why the machine suddenly goes to dead slow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you ask, no, I have not checked Task Manager to see what is running which I was used to doing in my old machine with XP but there is so much running in this system at any given time, I seriously doubt I would recognize something that, as far as I
 am concerned, shouldn't be running.&nbsp; I suppose I could copy what is running and keep a comparison worksheet in Excel and watch that when things happen, or actually don't happen, but I am not even sure how to copy the list of processes running in Windows 10
 Task Manager.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating to say the least and not something I am used to especially with the vast amount of memory in this system.</p>

<p>Are you having the problem of running slow and the constant busy icon if you DON'T open an office application?</p>
<p>How are you connected to the internet?</p>

</p><p>Before you ask, no, I have not checked Task Manager to see what is running which I was used to doing in my old machine with XP but there is so much running in this system at any given time, I seriously doubt I would recognize something .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, given the specs on your machine there is no excuse for it being slow. No excuse for you being able to type ahead of it, at all let alone that much.&nbsp; On to your questions ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 when the little blue wheel&nbsp; is on it is showing you that the application is busy, but it is still working, it is not "locked up".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If "it" is taking 'too long' (what ever that means for you), there are a a couple of things you can try.&nbsp; First use the &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;SysReq&gt; key combo.&nbsp; That is a very old command at the "System level" that tells the computer to "break" into / stop what ever it
 is doing.&nbsp; It doesn't always work, but it is worth a try. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work you should go into task manager.&nbsp; You don't have to "know" what all of the running processes are at this time.&nbsp; We can help you worry about that later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by going to the "Performance" tab.&nbsp; Under the graph there is some text. What you want to pay attention to here is "Logical Processors". That tells you how many parts ("logical partitions") your computer hardware has been "split" into.&nbsp; The idea is
 that even if one part of the computer is "maxing out" the rest is available to do other work so the computer is not completely "locked up".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the "Processes" tab. Then click on the "CPU" column heading. This forces it to sort. You want it set to "largest to smallest". That may take 2 clicks.&nbsp; I expect Word (or Excel) will be maxing out its "partition", or bouncing off the top of the limit.&nbsp;
 As well as CPU maxing, are any of the other three: Memory / Disk / Network also maxing out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now would be the time to shut down Word and restart it in "Safe Mode". If Word is still maxed out, in Task manager you can right click on the "MS Word" entry and select "End task" and confirm. This will kill Word, losing any unsaved changes.&nbsp; Now you can
 start Word again, this time in Safe Mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Word/Excel in safe mode disables all addin tools. Sometimes they are not "well behaved" and can cause all sorts of unexpected effects.&nbsp; Use the application for a while. If the problem does not come back, that implies the problem is in one of the
 addons.&nbsp; Restart Word normally and turn off all of the addins. Then slowly turn them back on until the problem comes back.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It is not just Word addins that can cause problems. Sometimes they are Windows addins.&nbsp; Here is a list of collected addons that caused problems:</p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are some general trouble shooting process you can work through:</p>
<div>
<strong><span>Trouble Shoot Word</span></strong>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong><span>A General Starting point when Word does something unexpected</span></strong>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word “menu’ go to Tools and then Options, in Word “ribbon” go to File then Options,
 and study all of the various options, both turned on and off.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may even get lucky and find some other settings that you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</span></p>
<p><span>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Always check Tools Options</li><li>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When in doubt, right-click on something</li><li>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you’re wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each
 time the answer was, “I’d use a Word table.” By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</li></ol>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong><span>A good, simple quick fix is “Boot your computer”</span></strong>
<p><span>The simplest fix is shutting down your computer normally and restarting it. Often subtle “corruption” happens to create unusual effects. Shutting down and restarting the computer resets all of the
 loaded software, often clearing up strange problems.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>NO</span></strong><strong><span>TE:
</span></strong><span>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling
 BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process. Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly
 as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</span></p>

<p><span>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely

<p><span>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.

            <p>Okay, here we go.&nbsp; Please understand that I had prepared my answers to fit into Rohn007's response but when I tried to enter it all, it was rejected because the message was too long (too many characters) so I am putting it all together without the initial
 questions from each of you and I hope you can make sense of it.&nbsp; If not, ask as I have it in the original form&nbsp; and should be able to straighten out any confusion. I am going to begin with Rohn007's response and go from there since his is long like my answers.</p>

<p>In reference to the percentages in Task Mgr trying to see what is using up CPU and Memory, yes, I have seen Excel high, but never over
<strong>37%,</strong> thus not nearly as high as would be expected and the same for memory.&nbsp; I believe one time I saw Excel at 97% for about long enough to view it and it then dropped hugely.&nbsp; When I have received the "OLE app running" message, and have gone
 to Task Mgr, I have never seen anything high enough to cause issues.&nbsp; It is a shame that Task Mgr does not total the columns as I am very sure they do not total 100% as they should !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relative to starting Excel in "Safe Mode" - HOW?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, when this "OLE" thing was shown, I have even tried to shut down the machine and restart to get rid of it.&nbsp; Unbelievably I could not shutdown the system thru normal means and finally jumped on the power button on the CPU tower.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUT, when I restarted
 the machine after waiting for at least a full minute, the "OLE" started up again!&nbsp; When I have gotten this message and gone to Task Mgr, NOTHING shows up at a high percentage and by that, I mean nothing over 7%!&nbsp; I&nbsp;have no idea what triggers this "OLE" app,
 or how to stop it.&nbsp; One time when I got it and went&nbsp;to Task Mgr. I did see a system file at the top&nbsp;and it was a "Service Host" but I do not remember which one and it was only there a short time then dropped but the "OLE" was still running.&nbsp; What or how could
 something run that would ONLY affect Excel that would not show up in Task Mgr.?</p>

<span>Back to not using Word:&nbsp; There are a lot of reasons but two of my major complaints are the insistence to always capitalize the first word on each line causing us to go back through our documents and correct this which is time

 very frustrating and to add to it, Excel does not do all of the things to the copied and pasted material that Word does.&nbsp; Then I thought "well that is simple, I will simply paste in Excel and then copy to Word".&nbsp; WRONG as once again, Word jumps in and does
 things including guidelines even when I set Excel to no guidelines and the color for guidelines to white.&nbsp; It is very frustrating.&nbsp; In my old system, somewhere, I have a&nbsp; document telling folks how to get around all of this in Word but when it crashed, it
 did so in a manner in which we believe the hard drive failed and while I have purchased some equipment to&nbsp; supposedly force the data from the hard drive, I have yet to figure out how to hook it up!&nbsp; Still working on that.</span></td>

            <p>Wow!&nbsp; This is unreal as my problems now are following me.&nbsp; What you see below, I have entered PREVIOUSLY here but it would not allow me to SUBMIT it, so I was forced to copy it all, paste it in Word, yes Word and then re-paste it here, hopefully, for all
 to see and read.&nbsp; Here goes:</p>
<p><span>Okay, now for the rest of the questions.</span></p>
<p><span>For Gil deG:</span></p>
<p><span>I do not have any idea of the affect on other Office apps as I do not use them.&nbsp; I only use Excel 85% of the time and Word maybe 15% of the time.&nbsp; When it does occur, it is very sudden with no warning.&nbsp; I will tell all, when
 I boot my machine each day, once booted, I load File Explorer, Excel, and Edge to go online but I do not always go beyond Edge, that is to any websites.&nbsp; I just want it open and ready in the event I have to suddenly go somewhere online and I don't want to
 have to sit here and wait for the network to get itself going and everything connected.&nbsp; Please note this is a Desktop ThinkCenter Tower system and not a laptop and I am using a wireless system to go online which is Verizon's network including their "JetPack"
 which connects my system to the network and there is of course a router, also Verizon.&nbsp; I have from time to time, pulled the batter in the JetPack and let it sit for a minute or longer and the same with the router pulling the wires and battery and allowing
 it to also sit for a minute.&nbsp; Then believe it or not, I have fired everything back up with the batteries and wires of course back in place only to once again in Excel be told that the "OLE app is running".&nbsp;&nbsp; It is usually at this point in time I begin to have
 thoughts of sledge hammers!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You asked when it started with the system running slow.&nbsp; I cannot answer that. I will tell you the machine was new in early September, 2016 WITHOUT Office which I purchased from Microsoft Store.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have NOT added anything to
 this system other than updates and Office365 Home Personal.&nbsp; I also have not activated any apps that came with the machine other than the default apps&nbsp;that are a part of &nbsp;Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>TomBecca, you asked "Are you having the problem of running slow and the constant busy icon if you DON'T open an office application?"&nbsp; In all honesty, I do very little on this machine that does not involve Office.&nbsp; I do not
 believe in using PC computers for many of the things that people use them for today; like grocery lists and etc.&nbsp; I do almost everything in either Excel or Word and mostly Excel.&nbsp; So the answer to your question is NO.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You also asked if I turn off the internet connection before I open an Office app, does it still happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried running office without the connection and yes, it still happened.&nbsp; When I say "it" still happens, I am referring
 to:</span></p>
<p><span>"Busy Signal" running with message "OLE app is running and Excel will begin working when the app is finished." or,</span></p>
<p><span>Excel just freezes where I can do NOTHING, or</span></p>
<p><span>The entire system goes to "dead slow" and by "dead slow" I mean it takes MINUTES to do anything - load a file from any where, save a file, open a file from Excel or Word.&nbsp; The other night, I timed it and it took over 7 minutes
 to open an Excel file I had just closed!!!</span></p>
<p><span>Again at these times, my thoughts easily turn to sledge hammers.&nbsp; I might note since I mention this tool often, other than thoughts of the tool, I very seldom if ever use such a tool although I have two as it is just handy
 to have them when one does need one.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, this is all I have.&nbsp; Again, I thank everyone for all of your help and suggestions.&nbsp; I will copy all of the suggestions into a spreadsheet in Excel, what else? And then when problems hit, I will go to this and
 try to do things or troubleshoot or whatever and report back any findings, if I indeed find anything to report.&nbsp; I know that this takes time and effort and I very much appreciate it when sensible people make knowledgeable and sensible suggestions to we users
 to help us out.&nbsp; You know in the computer world of PC's, there are three types of people I believe which are:</span></p>
<p><span>Pure users who only learn to use what is in front of them</span></p>
<p><span>Those who have knowledge on all types of peripheral equipment and what it does, as I used to.</span></p>
<p><span>Those who are highly knowledgeable about the systems, how they work, what can go wrong, how the systems are built and on and on and on and to those of you who fall into this category and come here helping us,</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>I
 speak for all users seeking help, WE ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR KNOWLEDGE, EFFORTS, DIRECTIONS, SUGGESTIONS AND ALL OF YOUR HELP!!!&nbsp; THANK YOU!&nbsp; THANK YOU!&nbsp; THANK YOU!</span></span></strong></p>

    <title>GSM&#47;UMTS &#40;3G&#41; network preference and the crashing Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sockatume---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            GSM&#47;UMTS &#40;3G&#41; network preference and the crashing Settings application</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not expecting an immediate answer to this, but I thought I'd throw it out and see what people had to say anyway. I've got an N79, and setting it to Dual Mode gets me GSM and UMTS (3G) hither and ither.&nbsp;However, now and again the phone goes down to a
 GSM signal and seems to refuse to go back up to 3G, even if there's a better 3G signal or (worse) there's no GSM signal at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This persists in spite of software updates and resets. If I put it in UMTS-only mode I don't suffer any network issues. By toggling into UMTS-only and back into Dual Mode I can convince it to use the UMTS network, and then it'll behave itself for a while.
 If I toggle it into GSM-only and back into Dual Mode it stays on GSM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is complicated by the fact that when it's misbehaving, the Settings application will crash a moment after start-up. The next time I run it, it'll run incredibly slowly, and then crash again. After a few cycles of this, I can get in and change the network
 settings. When I eventually get it playing on UMTS again, the crashes stop. This was an intermittent issue on a couple of other Nokias I've had, but it was never as persistent or linked to network behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annoying as it is, there's no way in hell I'm sending it off to the churning horror of Nokia Care, so you can skip the usual advice about sending it in to get looked at. ;) This is purely a mental puzzle. My thinking at the moment is that the radio chip's
 malfunctioning slightly and that's what's preventing the UMTS connection and causing Settings to crash. Or it's a purely software issue and the Software Updates I've applied so far don't patch the particular part of the software that's acting up.</p>

<p>Dealing with the same relative issue of unwanted 2G bonding, I thought I'd check to see what carrier you're using. &nbsp;There is a band aid for this if you're with ATT, They have a new software for their branded phones that can eliminate this problem for those
 of us that use unlocked, unbranded Nokia's in North America. &nbsp;Of course, you can't tell Muffy or Buffy that in tech support....send me a reply if you need to pursue it further,</p>

    <title>Track Changes Color Default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisab627  say:</h3>
<h2>            Track Changes Color Default</h2>
                    I recently installed Office 2016.&nbsp; I have been trying to make my track changes default to red insertions and red deletions.&nbsp; I do not want the standard default of blue insertions.&nbsp; I have changed this in Advanced Settings multiple times and it works on
 the current document.&nbsp; Then when I open another document and turn on Track Changes, it reverts back to blue insertions.&nbsp; Is there another setting to change that will make this the default on all documents?

            <p>The printer hardware does the scan, but it needs software to run the hardware to do the scan. You will have to figure out what software is being used.</p>

</p><p>In 2010 MS "<em><strong>improved</strong></em>" the scanning feature out of Word. You have to use work arounds like the one Doug provided the link for.</p>

            <p>You can move in a Subform from your Mainform like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Not Me.NameOfYourSubformCONTROL.Form.Recordset.EOF Then</p>
<p>&nbsp; Me.NameOfYourSubformCONTROL.Form.Recordset.MoveNext</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IF line checks to see if you're at the End Of File (EOF), and does not execute if you are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that NameOfYourSubformCONTROL is the name of the Subform Control on the parent form, and may or may not be the same name as the form you're using as a Subform. This can be tricky, so be sure you get it right. See the image below for an illustration:</p>

    <title>My Surface Pro 3 Pen &#40;Insiders Program&#41; Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phiresun  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Surface Pro 3 Pen &#40;Insiders Program&#41; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So the last to big updates on the Fast Ring for windows 10 has basically rendered my Surface Pen useless. I have tried to remove battery, remove drivers, rollback drivers and also borrowed my wife's working pen for Surface 3. Conclusion it doesn't work on
 my SP3 but it does work on her Surface 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does work is pairing of the pen. I can also use the top button to screen capture and launch One Note app. Beyond that it does not participate with my SP3 device. I have searched the forum for others have similar trouble but none mention the details
 of pairing and the top button working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help.</p>

            <div>the pen does NOT need to be paired in order to write. you could roll back your</div>
<div>preview build to see if this fixes the issue and if yes, you should post through</div>
<div>the Feedback App and on the Insiders Forum. You can also try to re-image with a</div>
<div>downloadable recovery image and go back to day 1 (which is what support would</div>

<h2>            Streaming apps not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just received the January Windows 10 Preview update on my Surface Pro 2, and I consider it an improvement in every area except one.&nbsp; None of my streaming video applications (ABC Family, Netflix or Hulu) are working after the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something that there is a workaround or fix for or am I stuck without them on this device until the next update?</p>
<p>

            Just a thought, check your network sharing settings and make sure the apps are checked to pass through firewall in either private or public network
