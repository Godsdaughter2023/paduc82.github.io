<h2>            WM sync Outlook 2007 skipping some data CDMA HTC Touch</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Seems I have ongoing issues with syncing, sometimes not all the data in calendar is synced, as sometimes I drag an all day event to another day and it wont sync the new date unless I make a slight change to it? Sometimes reoccuring appointments go missing I
 have marked my payday and when it passes I delete just that one but keep the future and today I see it went missing again? I also entered a birthdate on my phone and it won't sync to computer? I am running Windows Vista Home premium SP1 and the latest sync
 6.1.

    <title>Custom Scaling Quit Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drice_ava  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Scaling Quit Working</h2>
                    The custom scaling in Excel 2013 quit working today.&nbsp; The print preview shows the scaling, but when the print button is hit, the file reverts to 100% and prints that way.&nbsp; I saved the file with 60% before printing, no change.&nbsp; The print view will show
 the 60%, but when the Print button is hit, you can see the increase in number of pages&nbsp;due to the reverting back to 100%.&nbsp; Once the file is printed, the custom scaling will say 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The file worked fine previously.&nbsp; Tried other files and it appears they
 now all have this problem.

            <p>I would suspect that a BeforePrint event procedure is being triggered and is setting the scaling to 100.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the workbook have a Workbook_BeforePrint macro in the ThisWorkbook module?<br />
If so, try disabling it (e.g. put Exit Sub as its first line).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, try running Excel in Safe Mode (hold down Ctrl while launching Excel).&nbsp; Does the problem still occur?&nbsp; If not then an add-in or automatically loaded workbook is responsible.</p>

            The custom Scaling has given me this issue, and more commonly, the Print Preview shows normal, then, after Print command is given, the document is reformatted and broken from a single page into about 50, most with just a two inch line and very little of
 the spreadsheet's data.&nbsp;

<div>No macros, these are simple data matrices, brought forward from Excel 2010.&nbsp;</div>

            Safe Mode has no effect. The printer is a Toshiba networked copier. Printing to PDF creates the same effect&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The format change happens the first time I try to send a sheet that uses Custom Scaling. Prior to hitting the PRINT button, the sheet appears correctly in Preview, with the correct number of pages indicated. The formatting changes, and the number of pages
 sent to the printer changes, before I get to the password sending the file to the Toshiba. All indications are this is a glitch internal to Excel, when using Custom Scaling.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can reformat my document with no scaling, and it prints as previewed, but any attempt to reformat with scaling gives me the incorrect result.&nbsp;</div>

            I have also tried copying data from sheets created under Excel 2010 into a blank sheet created under 2013. This behaved in the same way, however, things go straight to the wrong formatting.&nbsp;

            <p>We have 2 brand new Dell computers with Win 7 and Office 2013. I had the same sort of problem this week when using a basic spreadsheet, no macros or anything fancy in it, just data and some basic formulas. The printing went nuts a document that should have
 been under 3 pages turned into a 350 page nightmare. My coworker is having same problem with a different spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>When going into Page set up and telling it to print 1 page wide by 3 tall it freaks out and changes the setup into a printout with a huge number of pages, as if every cell was its own page. We are also trying to print to a Toshiba copier which leads me to
 think something is wacky with the print drivers for Office 2013 and the way it talks to the Toshiba copiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are files that existed prior to the new machines and originated in Office 2007. They print fine on our HP Laser printers. They only&nbsp; misbehave when sent to the copier for printing.</p>

            <p>This problem is already here since 2013, and not yet addressed by Microsoft!!!???</p>
<p>
</p><p>For people like me using Office for the job, when you <em>cannot</em> log in in secure mode when you have to print out your tables for the very next meeting with your boss (and anyway in secure mode you will not be able to use all the other network services)
 we need the bug to be corrected, not some other workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirm: other hardware, Office 2013, Windows 7. Print preview and "actual" printout do NOT correspond as soon as one sets some custom formatting of page layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking care!</p>

<h2>            Access relationships</h2>
                    <p><span>Good day</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm working on an Access 2016 database with many tables.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First table has a PK CustomerID where all the general information about the customer is included.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The second set of tables are food groups, one each for protein, starch, vegetables, salads and deserts. Each of these tables are setup the same way with an ID connected with the food group, i.e proteinID and also include
 the customerID. <span>&nbsp;</span>The ID’s is all short text as the CustomerID is alphanumeric.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The third set of tables breakdown the food groups, i.e. starch is indicating different starches, i.e. rice, potatoes, etc. These tables all have a unique ID, the food group ID and the customerID.</span></p>
<p><span>I got relationships to work as 1 to many between tables 1 and 2 and between 2 and 3.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Problem statement:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The second set is an intermediate table. The following
 error message is displayed if I try to create an indeterminate relationship, “no unique index found for the referenced field of the primary table.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When creating the input form, it requests that I should
 input the relationship for some of the fields. This create another problem that when I move between design layout views it requests for a value. All the tables had been setup the same it is only the different foods that differ.</span></p>
<p><span>The total number of when I copy the tables to excel is about 150 and there will be 2000 customers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can anyone please assist.</span></p>

<p>First of all I think you have to re-design your database. You should have only one table FoudGroup, with one of the fields containing the name of the group. Also there should be only one "Food" table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do not understand is what the meaning of the relation of&nbsp; between customer and FoodGroup is. I can imagine a relation between customers and foods (customer buys food).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your problems. Number 1 seems to indicate that the field in the customer table that you refer to in the relationship is not the primary key of that table.</p>
<p>Number 2 is not clear to me.</p>

<p>We'd need to know what you are trying to accomplish with the database. What is it used for? What sort of data are you storing (not datatypes, but the "business data" you're storing). I'd agree it sounds like you have structural issues, but it's hard to know
 that without knowing what you're trying to accomplish, and I also agree that it seems not logical to relate the Customer with a FoodGroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the surface, it would seem that you'd have a value in the "second" set of tables to indicate what sort of "food" it is (i.e. protein, starch, etc), which would seem (to me, anyway) to be data that would be stored in a lookup table (a "FoodType" table).
 That FoodType table would have an ID, and you'd store that ID in the "second" set of tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming a Customer could be associated with multiple values from the "second" table, you'd need intermediate tables (i.e. Join tables) to model that relationship. It could be something as simple as a table that contains the Primary Keys of both tables,
 or you may also have other columns. Again, we couldn't really tell you without knowing more about your needs.</p>

            Firstly, you appear to be encoding data as table names.&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle (Codd's Rule #1). This requires that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables, and
 in no other way.<br />
<br />
When referencing a tree-structured hierarchy the referencing table should contain a foreign key only for the lowest kevel of the hierarchy.&nbsp; In your case you have a hierarchy of two levels&nbsp; FoodGroups and Foods, so only Foods should be referenced.&nbsp; To also
 Reference FoodGroups would introduce redundancy as FoodGroup is functionally determined by Food, and would this be transitively dependant on the key,.&nbsp; The table would consequently not be normalized to Third Normal Form and open to the risk of update anomalies.<br />
<br />
The relationship type between Customers and Foods is many-to-many, so should be modelled by a table which resolves the relationship type into two one-to-many relationship types.&nbsp; The overall model will therefore, in broad outline, comprise the following tables:<br />
<br />
FoodGroups<br />
….FoodGroupID&nbsp; (PK)<br />
….FoodGroup<br />
<br />
Foods<br />
….FoodID (PK)<br />
….Food<br />
….FoodGroupID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
Customers<br />
….CustomerID&nbsp; (PK)<br />
….Customer<br />
….etc<br />
<br />
To model the many-to-many relationship type:<br />
<br />
CustomerFoods<br />
….CustomerID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….FoodID (FK)<br />
<br />
This table is 'all key', i.e. its primary key is a composite of the two foreign keys.<br />
<br />
Diagrammatically the model is:<br />
<br />
FoodGroups---&lt;Foods---&lt;CustomerFoods&gt;----Customers <br />
<br />
When dealing with tree-structured hierarchies it is often necessary to cater for a discontinuous hierarchy.&nbsp; This would be so if you need to relate a customer to a food group as a whole, and not to individual foods.&nbsp; This would be done by, for each FoodGroup,
 including a row in Foods with a Food value of 'N/A' or similar.&nbsp; You'll find an example of this in DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly.<br />
<br />
This little demo file includes, in the section on 'entering data via a form/subforms', a contacts form in which a country, region and city can be selected in correlated combo boxes.&nbsp; You'll se that the country Monaco includes a region 'N/A', the country of
 Monaco comprising the city only, with no regional structure.&nbsp; Note also that only the city combo box is bound, reflecting what I said in the second paragraph above about referencing only the lowest level of the hierarchy.<br />

<p>We have a restaurant where I'm staying and we would firstly want to gauge what the residents want to eat, which will then be input via a form, to keep the integrity of the tables, after that we will generate reports to submit to the management of the estate
 and to improve attendance.</p>
<p>Table 1 is the general information related to the residents and whether they will make use of the facility.</p>
<p>As the list of all the food is approximately 150, i thought that it would be easier to have it in 5 different tables. However as protein dishes have 9 different subsections each with at least 8 different choices, yes/no check boxes, intermediate tables make
 sence. It is only needed to be done for protein as I be able to collapse smaller ones into 1 table each</p>
<p>I did in the structure of each of the intermediate tables had 2 PK , proteinID and customerID. Under each of the sub tables of protein there is a uniqueID PK and both the proteinID and customerID.&nbsp; however I did also made the proteinID a PK as previously
 it did not give me 1 to many.</p>
<p>I do realise that the intermediate table will solve the problem but I keep getting&nbsp; theep error message as stated in problem statement 1</p>

</p><blockquote>As the list of all the food is approximately 150, i thought that it would be easier to have it in 5 different tables.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That is not how data is stored in a relational database.&nbsp; It's what is meant by 'encoding data as table names' and violates the Information Principle, which is fundamental to the database relational model.<br />
<br />
You should have a single Foods table, which can reference a FoodTypes table in the way I described.&nbsp; This in turn can reference a table of 'subsections', which in turn can reference a table of 'choices'.&nbsp; The 'choices' table should be the only one referenced
 by the Customers table via a CustomerChoices table which models the many-to-many relationship type between customers and choices.
<br />
<br />
You should not have check boxes bound to Boolean (Yes/No) columns to enter customer choices.&nbsp; That again violates the Information principle, in this case by encoding data as column headings.<br />
<br />
You might understandably be reluctant to undo the work you've done to date, and go back to square one, but the first thing to do when in a hole is to stop digging.<br />

<p>The foundation of an efficient database is a properly normalized table structure. As you are being told, you have not achieved that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I suspected, you are trying to develop a menu application. You have customers with meal preferences. And you are trying to catalog those preferences. But you have TWO SEPARATE entities here; customers and food. And they are not DIRECTLY related. Each
 Food item is a separate entity and may include sub entities I'm not really clear on how you are doing that (some sample data might help).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you have a many to many relationship here; a customer will be associated with multiple foods and a food with multiple customers. So you need to model that relationship with a junction table.</p>
<p>tjxCustomerFood</p>
<p>CustomerFoodID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>CustomerID (FK)</p>
<p>FoodID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The customer table should be fairly straightforward. But you need to show us more of the data for us to help with the food table(s).</p>

            No database should contain an indeterminate relationship.&nbsp; All relationships between tables should&nbsp; be one-to-many, or in rare circumstances, one-to-one.&nbsp; In each case the relationship should be between the primary key of the referenced table, and the
 corresponding foreign key of the referencing tables.&nbsp; By definition a primary key is indexed uniquely (no duplicates).&nbsp; A foreign key in a one-to-many relationship type should be indexed non-uniquely (duplicates allowed).<br />
<br />
All relationships should have referential integrity enforced.&nbsp; An unenforced relationship serves no useful purpose whatsoever.&nbsp; The following is an image of relationships from my DatabaseBasics demo, to which I gave you a link earlier, which illustrates a simple
 contacts model.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/212991dd-8c58-4e79-a641-751d5b2ab7b8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/212991dd-8c58-4e79-a641-751d5b2ab7b8?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
As you can see all of the physical relationships are one-to-many.&nbsp; There is also a conceptual many-to-many relationship type between Contacts and Employers, which is modelled by a ContactEmployers table, which resolves the relationship type into two one-to-many
 relationship types.&nbsp; The CustomerFoods table in the model I suggested earlier does the same, modelling the many-to-many relationship type between Customers and Foods.<br />
<br />
It would help us to advise you if you could post a similar image of your database's relationships window, set out clearly so that all tables and all of their columns (fields) are clearly visible, along with the relationships between them.&nbsp; Include any tables
 for which you are unable to create relationships in the window, to give us the full picture.<br />

            Can you show us your new structure? As Ken said there should be no indeterminate relationships. So getting the error means you still need work on your structure.

<h2>            I have 2 questions relating to Azure AD connect</h2>
                    
<p>first here are my questions, then i will try to give some background.</p>
<p>1. i have a new user that is not syncing from on site ad to the cloud. &nbsp;i just converted from on site exchange 2010 to office 365. &nbsp;all the users migrated up and are working. &nbsp;the exchange server is now turned off. &nbsp;it was not a hybrid. &nbsp;it was a cut over
 using migration wiz. &nbsp;this user is new and has never existed that i know of. &nbsp;it shows in the sync logs that it has updated the user and added everything. &nbsp;i have changed the password and it again shows it updated. &nbsp;the user does not exist in the cloud. &nbsp;i
 create a test account the same way. &nbsp;same password just different name and that synced with no issue. &nbsp;why is it not syncing and how can i figure out how to fix this? &nbsp;also may have something to do with the second question</p>

<p>2. second is i am getting completed-sync-errors on delta and full synchronizations. &nbsp;when i firs started the sync all was fine and all accounts were migrated up. &nbsp;these errors started after the mx record was moved and email was already being reconfigured
 to point to the cloud. &nbsp;it was more then 12 hours after the cut over actually. &nbsp;i am getting a lot of these. &nbsp;it lists out almost 200 users and there are only 280 objects synced. &nbsp;the synchronization error page if i click on a user shows sync-generic-failure
 as the error and the synchronization step is provisioning. &nbsp;the user above gets this error as well even though it says she was added. &nbsp;my test user did not get this error. &nbsp;as far as i know i only have the one user not syncing so far.</p>




<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e1a39e3-0362-4e4e-85f6-04947a12dca3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e1a39e3-0362-4e4e-85f6-04947a12dca3" /></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>any help is greatly appreciated. &nbsp;i need to get this resolved before the weekend.</p>

<p>also is there any way to take a user that i create in the cloud and sync it with an onsite ad user late? &nbsp;if so i may have to do that just to get the user created.</p>

<p>I finally just removed Azure AD connect from the server it was on, rebooted, and reinstalled it again. &nbsp;Once i did that i let it run a sync and it synced the user that i had that was not syncing and so far (only one full run has happened) there are no errors.
 &nbsp;I went in and changed the user off the onmicrosoft.com sign in name and put it to the domain i wanted and that changed the email address to the correct one. &nbsp;As long as i can continue to do sync's with no errors i am good. &nbsp;Thank you for the article on SMTP
 match. &nbsp;I will update later with if i have errors again or not.</p>

<h2>            Solver pop up windows</h2>
                    <p>with the present MacOS 10.12.4 and Excel 15.33 Solver appears to work correctly - while working it shows at the bottom of the screen the incumbent value and the current calculation - but when in pops up the window asking Stop o Continue, one would expect
 to actually see what the current result is: instead the Excel window is blank and if you press Stop the other pop up window comes up asking if one accepts the current results or restore the original values for the parameters, still on a completely blank window!
 besides, the Show Trial Solution pop up (see below) it never pops up..</p>
<p>how can one actually see what the proposed solution is and what its consequences are (on calculations, charts etc.)?</p>
<p>PS now for the 1st time, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after</span> having accepted
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">blindly</span> the result, the following pop up showed on the screen - the pop up window
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">cannot</span>&nbsp;be deleted but when moving the Excel window it doesn't move with it - I have the suspicion that this pop up opens in the wrong place or time (I guess it should open

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently interested in the results of my worksheets (in a pause of development/updating) and related Solver processing, which appears to be functioning as expected - so at present I plan to upgrade neither OS 10.12.4 which I think it's still the latest)
 nor Excel (I am on 15.33), nor my worksheets until really needed</p>
<p>so I do not know what happened to the previously reported issues because I am not exercising the system in similar conditions..</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far so good, but I'll have to do some updating in the near future and I suppose something worth reporting will be soon available</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks very much for now</p>
<p>Renato</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Access 2016 Date Picker</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for my very novice questions.&nbsp; I have a form used as a scheduler and need to alter my date picker to exclude weekends.&nbsp; I located the following code online however I cannot get the message box to display what the code indicates it will display.&nbsp;
 Also, I am only prohibited on my first attempt at choosing a weekend date.&nbsp; Additional attempts are allowed.&nbsp; I want all Saturday/Sunday dates to be prohibited.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
System.DateTime myDate = DateTime.Now();</p>
<p>String myDateString="";</p>
<p>
</p><p>private void dateTimePicker1_ValueChanged(object sender, System.EventArgs e)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>System.DayOfWeek i = myDate.DayOfWeek;</p>
<p>if((i == System.DayOfWeek.Sunday) || (i == System.DayOfWeek.Saturday))</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>MessageBox.Show("Please try again, can't select a weekend day");</p>
<p><br />
myDateString = dateTimePicker1.Value.ToString();</p>
<p><br />
return;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>else </p>
<p><br />
myDateString = dateTimePicker1.Value.ToString();</p>

            <p>Umm Leah, what Tom gave you was the exact code you should use. The only difference is the name of the control where you are storing the date. Since you did not provide the name of the control Tom used a placeholder ("<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">theNameOfYourTextbox").</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The other change is the message. Tom used "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Yo! No weekend days", but you can place anything you want in between the quotes for the MsgBox command.</span></p>

            From the error message, it appears that you are entering the code in the Table's validation property. That's the wrong place! It should be in the BeforeUpdate event property of the form textbox with the date picker.&nbsp;

            <p>As John said, it looks like you are entering the code in the wrong place. Tom's instructions specifically said "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In your textbox' BeforeUpdate event".</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open the FORM in design mode and select the&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Scheduled PM Date</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> control (note: using spaces in object names can
 come back to haunt and is not recommended). Go to the Event tab and select the Before Update event. Click on the ellipses&nbsp;[...] next to the event and select Code Builder. Then paste the following code:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>dim intWeekDay as integer</p>
<p>intWeekDay = WeekDay(Me.[Scheduled PM Date])</p>
<p>if intWeekDay=1 or intWeekDay=7 then</p>

            What do I need to alter in this code to allow the user to leave the date blank? &nbsp;I imagine I need to remove the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Cancel = True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Important: this stops the user from leaving the field without first
 correcting it." but what else needs to be done? &nbsp;Right now If I do not select a date, but rather leave the field blank, it doesn't like that</span>

<h2>            &#34;An installation for MicroSoft Works is currently suspended.  You must undo...&#34;</h2>
                    <p><strong><em>"An installation for MicroSoft Works is currently suspended.&nbsp; You must undo the changes made by that installation,
<u>but</u>---we won't let you."</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HP laptop (2 years old) with:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vista Home Premium SP2 32-Bit,&nbsp; Works 9,&nbsp; Office 2007.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Human Owner with:&nbsp;&nbsp; Moderate experience dealing with Windows PC's,&nbsp; and currently a slightly higher than bad attitude--Service Pack 3 !</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I get by failing to check my kids PC's for problems, in order to catch them when they are (or were) small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having problems installing (thru MS Automatic Update)&nbsp; Updates and Security Update files for Works 9, Office 2007, Adobe Reader 8 thru X, Quicktime Player, and a few others (but not Vista itself).&nbsp; One of the error messages given is:&nbsp; &nbsp;"An installation for
 MicroSoft Works is currently suspended.&nbsp; You must undo the changes made by that installation to continue....."&nbsp; followed by selection boxes for Yes and No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run thru this more than 25 times, hitting Yes to undo, but it fails without any further error messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was also having stability problems with Office 2007, and it came down to uninstalling that, but many Ofc-2007 updates still&nbsp;remain in the Update History.&nbsp; There are also many failed updates for Ofc-2007, Works 9, and one for Net Frameword 2.0 SP2.&nbsp; These
 various updates go back to March 3, 2010 and up to this week, June 18, 2012.&nbsp; I am considering removing Works 9, but where would the fun be in taking a shortcut?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another error message, whose exact wording I have lost, suggested there is a problem with MS Installer.&nbsp; I checked "Services" to see if it was on Auto, or needed to be Restarted---but it does not exist on the list of Services.&nbsp; And, no matter how many times
 I try to install it from a MS download, it fails to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I can solve the problem(s) by doing a complete re-install of the OS and all other programs, but that would be too easy.............I would like to continue to learn new things---but maybe for only about two weeks more...........then again,
<em>maybe</em> less..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<h2>            Compatibility of Word documents on iPad</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have just paid for my cv to be redesigned and have discovered that the document does not open in the Word application on my iPad with the design and layout intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The design will open with no problems on a Windows desktop, but as I use my iPad the majority of the time, this is causing me real problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cv layout is not complicated and I have opened other Word documents on my iPad with more intricate designs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance you can provide me with to make Word for iPad retain the layout of this document would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How do you copy email addresses from the &#34;To&#34; field in a received email without the name&#63; Outlook insists on selecting the whole thing</h2>
                    When I receive an email, I often want to copy an email address that is listed in the "To" or "CC" field. Each recipient shows in the format "Surname, Name (email address)". I just want to copy the email address, but Outlook insists on selecting the whole
 recipient, including their name. This is really annoying.

<p><span>I fully understand your concern. However, Outlook has no settings to change this behavior when we select a contact in the To field. In this situation, I welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through:

<h3> mac usually, pc occasionally  say:</h3>
<h2>            PPT file created on PC Office 2013 - images distorted in PPT Mac Office 2011</h2>
                    <p>I have a PPT file that was created on a PC (Office 2013) but when I view it on the Mac (Office 2011), the images become distorted and lose all the formatting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are EPS files which have been inserted, then scaled and some additional formatting added (drop shadow, colour correction).</p>
<p>Is this a compatibility issue? </p>
<p>If so, how do the image files need to be saved before inserting into PPT?</p>
<p>Note: there are 10 files. Three work perfectly, the other 7 are distorted and lose formatting.</p>
<p>They have been recreated and saved and inserted the same way but do not react identically.</p>
<p>How to fix?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            It is my understanding that EPS files are not pure vector formatted files... maybe PowerPoint 2011 is only picking up the raster components within the eps wrapper. Try converting the original images to EMF or TiFF and then inserting them.

            <p>Can you put an example PPT/PPTX file someplace where we can download it? &nbsp;Better yet, an example as saved from 2013 and an example or screenshot of what you see in the Mac version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as a general bit of advice, I'd avoid using EPS graphics in PowerPoint. &nbsp;I've been using PowerPoint since version 3, have used EPS graphics in other software all that time, and have never had anything but trouble with EPS+PowerPoint. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd try PNG if possible. &nbsp;But again, if that doesn't work, put an example where we can see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EPS isn't so much a graphics format as a programming language that can describe graphics (in both raster and vector format as Rich has mentioned). &nbsp;Typically, EPS also includes a (usually but not necessarily) raster/bitmap preview image for the computer
 to display and/or to print to non-PostScript printers. &nbsp;It uses the PostScript content of the EPS when printing to PS printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there aren't that many PS printers out there, EPS have been something of a problem for developers; if they handle the EPS as per spec, a lot of the customers will be unhappy because the preview image they see and print is usually low rez and kinda
 nasty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, recent versions of PPT actually behave something like a PS printer ... they interpret the programming code in the EPS and convert it to a Windows Metafile (PC) or Enhanced Metafile (Mac). &nbsp;It does quite a good job, at least for simple graphics,
 but it's not a real PostScript printer, so sometimes the graphics get munched.</p>

<h2>            Intermittent Outlook 2011 error &#34;The directory server cannot complete the search.&#34;</h2>
                    We have a number of users connecting to Exchange getting intermittent an&nbsp;popup&nbsp;with the following "The directory server cannot complete the search. The search is taking too long. Narrow the search by specifying more search criteria or increasing the timeout
 setting in the Edit Account dialog box." Clicking the popup displays the error code -17797 in the details.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've seen the error shortly after launching Outlook 2011 before I've taken any action such as composing a message or&nbsp;switching&nbsp;folders. So, it appears there are LDAP calls behind the scenes that are not user-imitated.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This started happening after Christmas and may have coincided with the installation of 14.1.4.</div>
</div>

<div>Any ideas what might be causing this?</div>

            imho win8.1 is much better with touch. win 10 first few builds showed great promise but we suddenly veered away to the current silly start menu. So yes I agree with you at the moment hopefully future builds will be better.

<p>At this time I would suggest staying as far away from Win 10 as possible.&nbsp; I now have a Lenovo Tablet that is a brick.&nbsp; The loss of touch screen was only the beginning of my problems.&nbsp; There are almost no drivers now.&nbsp; The keyboard doesn't work, the networking
 doesn't work, almost nothing works.&nbsp; I'm trying to figure out if I can download and restore Win 8.1.&nbsp; I've participated in a lot of Beta programs since the mid 80s and I have to call this the biggest single disaster ever.</p>

<p>I would have agreed through the prior build.&nbsp; When the version I had expired it took me 3 days to figure out how to successfully get the new version loaded.&nbsp; Once I did I found that I had no drivers.&nbsp; Maybe on a Surface it works - that's what I'm working
 on now.&nbsp; But there's no way I would risk my Surface Pro 2 - which I use daily.&nbsp; I put 10 on a Lenovo ThinkPad 2 that I don't use on a daily basis.&nbsp; Now it's a brick.</p>

            <p>I would suggest that you always needed to restore to Windows 8.1 and then re-install Windows 10. It sounds like you were trying to "fix" it yourself and whatever you were doing was only making it worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway on the topic of is Windows 10 TP ready for touch, yes it is. It is two steps forward (or more) and one step back from Windows 8.1.&nbsp;The&nbsp;steps back is the&nbsp;replacement of the All Apps page (ok for touch - not perfect but horrible for mouse) with an&nbsp;All
 Apps list. This list&nbsp;is not configurable, sorts folders within apps and programs with no ability to group,&nbsp;re-sort, re-name etc. The steps forward are the death of charms and better integration of the touch apps with the rest of the operating system and a
 general clean&nbsp;up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After 3 days of trying - with the help of our IT person, I was able to get Win 10 back but there are no drivers so nothing works.&nbsp; So, yes, I've tried to reinstall Win 8.&nbsp; I can't get it to read the recovery USB and begin to install.&nbsp; This tablet is virtually
 a brick.&nbsp; I think my choices are to send it back to Lenovo or buy a full copy of Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've participated in beta programs for MS, Apple, Google, AOL and companies you've never heard of since the mid 1980s.&nbsp; This is the most screwed AND PISSED, I've ever been.</p>

            I installed build 10074 as a dual boot. Set up went OK. Touch works so far, but my Bluetooth mouse shows its connected but doesn't respond. With only one USB port, it is really inconvenient to have to use a USB mouse and switch between that and a flash
 drive.

            <p>Hello. I am having a problem with, what I believe is the Quick Response Bar. I have done the above "fix" and it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem occurs when the desktop alert pop-up shows that a message has arrived. If I click on the message, it opens the message window - OK. However, the "Message" tab does not show, therefore I get no toolbar icons for reply, delete, etc.. I have tried
 all the usual methods to manipulate which toolbar sections show and the like, and it works like a charm when I open a message window by clicking open a message from the main Outlook view. But, if I open a message window by clicking on the desktop alert, I
 have no message tab - and therefore virtually no toolbar icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise. Thanks.</p>
<p>

            l am having something similar.l have a Galaxy note 10.1. l have used the pre installed e-mail app to access my hotmail acc. However, when l send an e-mail it gets resent about every 5 mins! Showing in the sent folder as being continuously resent. But the
 recipient&nbsp; actually only gets it once. Have done a factory reset and started over again but still doing the same thing. Suggestions please.

<h2>            error code 0x80073b01&#58; Windows Defender</h2>
                    <p><strong>error code 0x80073b01</strong>: I recently got this error message when I was trying to turn on<strong><em> Windows Defender</em></strong>, or start using it on my laptop. I have an Acer laptop that was pre-loaded with
<strong><em>Windows 8</em></strong> and I had been using <strong><em>Mcafee</em></strong> for my virus protection. Once the subscription ended, I uninstalled the program from my computer and I have tried a number of things to get the
<strong><em>Windows Defender</em></strong> to work as my anti-virus/anti-spyware thing and everything I try to open has this same error message. I am able to get updates, and it has the troubleshooting options, which I do as an<strong><em> administrator</em></strong>,
 and it says that it fixed two different things, and to try what I was trying to do again. I keep trying and it still gives me the error message. Is there anything I can do to get<strong><em> Windows Defender</em></strong> to work on my computer?

    <title>Status bar View shortcuts icons inactive when starting outlook in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Status bar View shortcuts icons inactive when starting outlook in calendar folder</h2>
                    When I start Outlook in calendar folder, the view shortcuts buttons in the status bar are inactive (cannot click on them to change view).<br />
I have to switch to mail item view and then come back to calendar to have them active.<br />
Is this known ? Is there a fix for this ?<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for asking.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately starting Outlook in calendar view disables the shortcuts in the status bar. As already described by you, the only work around
 as of now is to switch to Mail view and then switch back to calendar view.</p>

<h3> ethan_win_osx_linux  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Lumia 950 XL Doesn&#39;t Work Right</h2>
                    <p>I've had this phone since the middle of December. When I first got it, it had issues. It got horridly hot when charging and updating at the same time. It still gets warm, but not like that anymore. It also, and frequently rebooted at random while locked
 and when shutting down. I figured they were just bad bugs in Windows 10 and they would be worked out. But now, I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Yesterday it rebooted (while it was locked) three times. Its been randomly rebooting since I bought it.</li><li>WiFi stopped working this morning (it does this from time to time) and turning it on and off still wouldn't allow it to detect any access point. Restarting the phone fixed the problem.</li><li>50% of the time, the start screen loads jittery when closing or switching out of an app.</li><li>OneNote is very glitchy and loads choppy like. One of the issues is once the copy circle pops up when selecting a word, it never goes away until you close the app completely.</li><li>The speaker makes popping sounds when it stops playing sounds sometimes.</li><li>Cortana crashes and fails to remind you on time (like over an hour late at times).</li><li>The email notification has been broken on the phone since I bought it, except it did work for a couple of weeks in between updates a couple months ago.</li><li>It says I need to restart the phone because my sim card settings changed sometimes.</li><li>Sometimes w
 unlock sound the screen comes on in the lowest brightness setting and refuses to brighten. It&nbsp;will continue to do that every time you lock the phone until you restart it.</li><li>It also crashes when shutting down and reboots.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Those are just some of the major issues. Did I just get a bad phone? Is everyone experiencing this? I've reported these bugs in the feedback app months ago. Will resetting the phone fix the problem? If it doesn't, what do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are just some of the issues, FYI.</p>

            <p>Yes, these are symptoms which are mentioned quite often in Microsoft Answers. However, Microsoft Answers or at least not me, are able to judge about the hardware of your phone and whether these issue correlate. Or stated differently: If you think you face
 a hardware issue, your phone needs physical examination by a qualified technician. Especially, if your phone got warm quite often, and even hot, hardware components might be damaged now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to your issues, the best way would be to attach yourself to existing threads and discuss each issue individually. If you are interested and you do not find those threads yourself, please, do not hesitate and ask here. I look up those threads
 and link to those, then. However, the very first step would be to mention (just) your current OS build and firmware version: All apps » Settings » System » About » More info. The second step (can be skipped if you like to find the cause): Did you already&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset
 your phone</a>&nbsp;without restoring one of your backups afterwards? The next step would be the app&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=73c58570-d5a7-46f8-b1b2-2a90024fc29c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Field Medic</a>, which helps you to find the
 cause of many crashes and reboots. For example, when it comes to your Wi-Fi: Are just those Wi-Fis are affected which are in 5 GHz and on 2.4 GHz channel 12 and 13 – or are all Wi-Fis affected regardless their channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You get the picture. Each issue has to be looked at individually here at Microsoft Answers. If you suspect a hardware issue with the phone in general, I would approach my retailer, who sends that phone over to a local but authorized repair facility.</p>

            That didn't work, but I did fix the problem by uninstalling the microphone device and then rebooting my system. Thanks for the help
