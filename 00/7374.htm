<h2>            OneDrive&#47;Windows10 - Changeover from OneDrive Personal to OneDrive Office 365Pro</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and OneDrive Personal was set up on my machine with a 5GB free storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then subscribed to Office 365 Business with 1TB OneDrive storage, but the computer still wants to default to the OneDrive Personal for everything I do. I've searched for tutorials but can't seem to find anything that tells me how to make the OneDrive Business
 the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings doesn't give the option of deleting the OneDrive Personal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight would be appreciated &amp; thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi CBDF,<br />
<br />
We can use the new sync client of OneDrive for Business to sync files from both consumer OneDrive and OneDrive for Business. After setting up the new sync client with Microsoft account, we can right click the sync icon on the task bar&gt;Settings&gt;Account&gt;Add a
 business account&gt;enter our work/school account (in this case, it is your account for Office 365 Business which has 1 TB storage).
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
After configuration</a>, we will have two sync icons and two synced folders for these two kinds of accounts.
<br />
<br />
If you don’t need to sync your consumer OneDrive anymore, you can follow the steps below to check the outcome:<br />
1.Right-click the sync client icon (the icon for the personal account) on the task bar&gt;Settings&gt;Account&gt;Unlink the account. Close the sign in pop-up.<br />
2.Open Registry Editor on your computer <strong>(Win+R</strong>&gt;enter regedit).<br />
2.Find the FirstRun registry key in the path below, change its value to 0<br />
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\Microsoft\OneDrive\Accounts\personal </strong>
<br />
3.Restart your computer.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After finishing setting up with the work/school account, you can firstly upload the files from your personal accounts to your OneDrive for Business if you want.<br />
<br />
<strong>WARNING</strong>:&nbsp;Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
 Edit at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

Sorry for lack of clarity.</p>
<p>My problem occurs when I try to include the named range (Threshold) in the formula ie, =CountIF(A7:N7,&gt;Threshold) Excel treats the range name as text.</p>
<p>I'm trying to limit the user input of the threshold number to a single cell and be able to use the value elsewhere in the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
OK, as long as Threshold is a single cell, then it's the same syntax:</p>
<p>=CountIF(A7:N7,"&gt;"&amp;Threshold)</p>

<h3> gooseberry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug&#58; Outlook selects ALL emails, not just the ones I selected, and then starts opening them ALL&#33;</h2>
                    <p>When I select multiple emails to open at once inside the Outlook inbox, Outlook predictably tells me that opening multiple messages can take a lot of time (even when it is only a handful).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, if I press the Enter key to activate the "OK" button and go on, instead of just opening the emails I selected, all of a sudden ALL emails are selected (as far as I can tell; I never wait around long enough to let Outlook try to open them
 all) and Outlook proceeds to open them one by one by one until I manage to shut down Outlook using Task Manager (which is a challenge, because Outlook keeps popping open new emails so I have to keep finding the Task Manager, select Outlook, and click the End
 Task button in between new emails). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if this ALWAYS happens when I use the Enter key instead of the mouse to press OK, but when it does, it is a royal pain. I am a power keyboard user, so my first inclination is to use the Enter key. This has happened to me several times in the
 last couple of months, and I think the only solution is to use the mouse.&nbsp; However, I curse Microsoft every time I make the mistake of using the Enter key, because this is a bug that ought to have been fixed by now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Outlook 2013. Is there any hope for a fix?</p>

            Correction: The box that pops up says "Yes" and "No." It does not always happen; I just tested it deliberately. I am not sure how to make it happen deliberately, but it has happened more than once.

<h2>            OnPremise Mailbox with SharedMailbox in Cloud -&#62; Authentication Prompt</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>At the beginning of a O365migration Project we moved a Shared Mailbox (which was automapped to a OnPremise-UserMailbox) to the cloud and now the User&nbsp; gets an Authentication Window for the RemoteMailbox. We've configured NTLM as Authentication for OnPrem
 and as far as I know O365 uses Basic only. Might this cause the problem?</p>
<p>Is it possible to have an OnPremise-Mailbox and a Shared Mailbox in Office365 mounted to this user?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>Hi Alex,<br />
<br />
No. Currently, this cross-premises scenario is still not officially supported. You need to make sure the user mailbox and the shared mailbox are at the same side.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I will help you monitor this thread to see if our community members can share any 3rd-party experience about having a cross-premises shared mailbox.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hey John I am writing to let you know you are not the only one. This has been driving me crazy over the weekend. My @dot.net email is critical to my business. I tried contacting Microsoft support by phone but they could not help me whatsoever. They didn't
 give any useful information. I also opened a chat ticket with their support and outlined in detail my issues and the DNS error that happens when you attempt to send an email. All to no avail as their customer support assumes that I have registered a custom
 domain when in fact this domain was provided by MSN itself. Absolutely absurd. I have spent hours running Google searches in hopes of some info but again, I have made no progress. I will be closely monitoring this thread in the hopes that someone has info.&nbsp;

            <p>Hey guys, got some bad news for everyone here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out @dot.net was actually privately owned but spread around using Microsoft's hosting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically nothing awful has happened but since it was privately owned, the DNS seems to have gone down which is leading to these emails dropping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The type of information that is stored on an administrative level that this user could see is nothing more than first/last name and username for the email. Nothing else of yours is at risk, but I would suggest migrating everything to a new email address
 as soon as possible. I'd also suggest closing the account just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>whois on dot.net:</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">So obviously not Microsoft.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">On a forum someone tested making their own domain hosting with outlook.com and this is the extent of what they could see</span></p>

</p><p>So again, nothing at risk really. Just take care of your stuff and migrate it.</p>

            <p>Hey, you're not a moron by any stretch. The announcement was never officially done through Microsoft, just someone set up for outlook's web server system to work with their own privately owned domain of @dot.net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These were never officially announced by Microsoft, but were presented as if they were by MS. If you try to search for an announcement back when these emails opened, you won't find anything officially from MS.&nbsp;</p>

            dang..... i legit want to cry right now haha<br />
<br />
so does this have to do with the domain itself going down or the new microsoft rule or whatever disabling custom domain usage? we can all send emails, but can't receive them, is there any sliver of a chance we wake up and everything works as normal :'(?

            <p>Basically this is up to the domain owner right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I do suggest switching your account to something more reliable. The absolute worst case scenario that could happen is the owner redirecting the DNS to start receiving your emails. The odds of that actually happening are pretty low but it's better
 to migrate to something more secure.</p>

do you think the owner is aware of the situation? or he's the 1 who cut the DNS domain or whatever?<br />

            <p>Speculation exists that the owner originally did this in an attempt to get private info in a larger scale phishing style attempt, but unfortunately for them the only information you can actually get are first/last name and username for the email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the service being cut, maybe they either changed the DNS or simply stopped paying for the service. Either way, it's not functioning now and I wouldn't suggest continuing to use it just as a security means.</p>

    <title>Exception Errors in BFG - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old_duck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exception Errors in BFG</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, I have been a BFG'er for as long as I can remember … but of late, quite a few games are not playable, i.e. I get Exception Errors.&nbsp; I have checked with and worked closely with both BFG and Malwarebytes, who I use to ensure no viruses, etc.!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have played Big Fish Games for over 20 x years now, never, ever had a problem but of late, now constantly get games that won't play, giving me Exception Error messages!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to wonder is it Windows 10, is there a common dominator, although BFG deny it, - is it, in fact, Window 10 … but naaahhh, can't be as other games play beautifully!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But these Exception Errors are becoming more frequent and very annoying and frustrating!&nbsp; I keep my drivers up-to-date, no viruses, laptop running beautifully ….. and yet an Exception Error now pops up and the game won't work!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does it mean, why now, after all these years is it happening and how on earth, can I fix it?&nbsp; I know they are only games, but now it has become more …. I need to know why, fix it and conquer this problem!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please ……… to anyone out there!&nbsp; Would be eternally grateful if you can advise and and/or been through what I am now going through!&nbsp; Especially, if you solved the problem!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take care, hope someone can help!</p>

<h2>            Pivot Table Date Grouping - Expand Doesn&#39;t Show dates</h2>
                    I've got my data table, created a pivot table, everything works great.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have about 200 records over a years period. &nbsp;I've grouped the records by month, works great.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can click the +/- button to expand and&nbsp;collapse, works great.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However when I expand, it shows the correct records for that month, but no dates. &nbsp;I also reorganizes the records&nbsp;alphabetically&nbsp;by subject rather than date.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I haven't figured out how to show the dates when I expand a month. &nbsp;I'm sure once I do I can again filter by date.</div>

            When you apply the grouping for dates you need to select all of the possilbe return values&nbsp;you want. ie Quarter, Month and Day. Then these elements will show up as usable dimensions in your field list. Now it is just a matter of adding those fields to
 your table. If you don't add the field it will not be one fo the drill to levels.

            <p>Dear DanCooper71,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your posting.&nbsp; If someone is using an ad blocker that prevents them from seeing ads on search results pages in a search engine, then they would not see those ads.&nbsp; I am not sure if there is an ad blocker that provides this specific functionality
 or not.&nbsp; However, there is no way from our side to specifically block people that are using an ad blocker from seeing your ad.&nbsp; Hopefully this answers your question.&nbsp; If you need additional assistance please chat in with us, or call us at 1-800-518-5689.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Justin</p>

    <title>Word 2016 Ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulinphoenix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 Ribbon</h2>
                    <p>I know customizing the ribbon gets a lot of grief, but I still have to say something anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use "Styles". A lot. But there is never enough room on the ribbon to hold all the styles I use in document writing. It is good that making Word wider expands the Styles section, but widening Word just to get more Style button on the ribbon? That doesn't
 make sense. Can I make the ribbon section "two rows" high? Not anymore, sadly. How about eliminating the graphics from the style buttons, then having two rows of them instead of only one? Works for me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And one more thing. All too often I'll be typing away and the text I'm writing slips down on the Word screen, and out of sight. Then I have to manually scroll the screen to see it. What is up with that???</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes, thank you, I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I noticed that you've also "hidden" those styles that you didn't want displayed (clever!), something I've also done. For those not familiar with that particular technique, you can hide styles you don't want to see by clicking on the third button at
 the bottom, lower-right of the display, above, "Manage Styles." Change the tab from "Edit" to "Recommend." Select a style, then click "Hide" from the cluster of buttons, and it won't appear in the "Style" list. You'll notice non-unique numbers to the left
 of the individual "Styles." If you change a style's number you'll change its position in the list, and if you give a group of styles (say four 'List Bullet' styles) the same number, their secondary sort will be alphanumerically within their number. Yet another
 clever way to organize your styles. Be sure to select the "New documents based on this template" Radio Button before clicking OK or your changes won't be saved in the template (whichever one it is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other point: it seems I used to be able to specify the default template to be used on all new documents? Why not make that an option again. I realize that "Normal.dotm" contains a lot of formatting "stuff" that has to be incorporated before an alternative
 template can be applied, so why not just run it immediately when a new document is opened, then apply the user-specified template? Seems simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, after some searching I found that "Personal" templates aren't, but MY templates are under "Shared" which they too definitely aren't. Funny place to not put them, and funny place TO put them. I wonder how many users have searched for them templates
 only to give up without looking under "Shared?" Faithful to ergonomic designs? Better heads than mine seem to think so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, again yes, I've found that I can apply my own template to an existing document if I just look under the "Developer" tab and click "Templates." Really? A developer feature right over there with "COM Add-ins" and "Macro Security?" No room under "Home";
 inappropriate for "Insert", "Design", or "Layout"? Hmm... Tough choice...</p>

    <title>Purchased Movie Expired - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lancecarey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Purchased Movie Expired</h2>
                    <p>Couple of questions. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recently purchased a movie and my receipt shows that&nbsp;the movie&nbsp;was a purchased. Now the movie shows as being expired. Not sure why. If I rented the movie because of not knowing or understanding the agreement why would this form of rental be&nbsp;twice the price
 of a normal rental charge? I really thought that I was buying the movie. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Second question, my master purchase list at Microsoft shows some items as a "Charge&nbsp;as opposed to a&nbsp;Purchase".&nbsp; However all of my emailed confirmation receipts show "Purchased". As an example, I purchased Season 1 of some show and my receipts shows this,
 however when I purchased the second Season it shows this as a charge. The only difference is the second Season is on going.</p>

            I can confirm that this was only available for Rental on the date you've listed, and that it was available before it reached theaters which is why it was priced more than&nbsp;normal rental.

<h3> phrab  say:</h3>
<h2>            2003 navigation pane startup</h2>
                    When I used to start Outlook 2003, the navigation pane (on the left side) would default to Calendar &amp; the current view (on the navigation pane) would show various options.<br />
<br />
I went to the "Go" menu, deleted some folders that I didn't need, pressed Ctrl+2 (to go back to the Calendar in the navigation pane, &amp; closed Outlook.&nbsp; However, now, whenever I start Outlook, the navigation pane defaults to "Personal Folders" (as if I pressed
 Ctrl+6).<br />
<br />
How can I get back to the original navigation view?<br />
Note: I have Outlook set, under Tools/Options/Other/Advanced, to start the main window as Calendar, &amp; it does, so that's not the problem.<br />

I found the answer.&nbsp; I located<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/start-outlook-in-the-folder-list-or-shortcuts-view-HA001118248.aspx?CTT=1<br />
<br />
which gave me 3 options for modifying the registry at:<br />
<b>My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Outlook\Options\WunderBar<br />
<br />
</b><span>The value was set at 5.&nbsp; Now, none of those 3 options worked (making the WunderBar change to 0, 3, 5), but I guessed to change it to 2, knowing I could change it back, if needed.&nbsp; It now defaults to the calendar.<br />
<br />
FWIW, I don't know why that article didn't give all the options from 0 to 6.<br />
P.S.&nbsp; Don't know why I can't mark this post as the answer to my own question.<br />

<h3> mark77---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 internet connection problems</h2>
                    
<p>I like(d) my N8 until the internet connection started causing me major headaches....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure when it started, and can't find any topics that cover this issue. When I connect to the internet or synchronise emails, I get a connection that works against 1 in 4 attempts. Most of the time I open the web browser and wait.... I get the connecting
 pop-up window in the top left corner, but that after that&nbsp;an empty white browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I check the connection, it says "Conn.(inactive)" and has sent/received a few bytes, but nothing more. So I then have to manually disconnect the connection and then re open the browser.</p>
<p>I run my home screen in offline mode and have email accounts set to check every 30 minutes... if I get a bad connection, it'll run for ages without actually receiving or sending any real data.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe it has anything to do with my service provider as I hardly ever have any problems making or receiving calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This&nbsp;means that phone, and internet connection is completely useless and unreliable. My setup:</p>
<p>Release PR1.2</p>
<p>Software 014.002</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help or point me in the direction of a topic that helps?!</p>

<p>I have my access points set to WLAN set to priority &nbsp;and GPRS set to priority 2. If you're having problems with connectivity, try setting phone to offline and deleting all access points, remove sim card, re-boot phone and run for acouple of minutes. Then
 turn off phone , put sim back in and go to web, phone will ask to search for available access points and the one it offers will be your sevice provider, accept it, and hopefully the phone will then connect OK, then assuming you have wifi set up your home wifi
 and then set this to Priority one and your GPRS to Priority two.</p>
<p>This worked when I'd used a couple of sims in my phone, and started having a couple of problems (and about 6 access points LOL)</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<p>Hi I've had the same problem. After installing "Vlingo", my N8 went bonkers. I found in the past that many problems come from unstable applications. For over a month I couldn't download the second part of Anna. After installing Vlingo I couldn't make any
 phone calls althought I could receive calls. So at that point I had 2 problems, couldn't call and couldn't update.</p>
<p>I did a hard reset *#7370# before the reset I backed up all the data using Ovi and moved all pictures and videos to the memory card. Took it out before reset. I also used an application called Screen snap to take pictures of the home screen just in case,
 it was a life saver. After the reset, I tried the phone everything seemed to work fine. Did the upgrade OK tried calling OK and obviously the internet was fine since I did the update. Now I did the restore from Ovi and after that again I couldn' use the internet
 with either the Wap connection or WIFI. So I did the hard reset again but this time I didn't do the restore. I suspect that there was still some application that was unstable in the restored files. Now all works fine I've had to reinstall a lot of applications
 but it's a little price to pay for a phone that works fine. This is where the Screen snap was handy. I just looked at the pictures and reinstalled the applications that I had in the same places. Minus the applications that I don't use. I also made a list of
 the applications installed and reinstalled just those that I use. Hope this helps. Hard reset will solve a lot of problems. You can also usr the restore in the settings menu go to;<strong> menu/settings/phone/phone management/factory settings</strong>, there
 you have 2 options Restore or Delete and restore either will work.</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>abtaf</strong>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AutoArchive helps users manage the space that they have in their mailbox or on the email server being used. Just to clarify, are you using the Outlook desktop application or the Outlook.com website?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If you’re using Outlook.com, is it the
<strong>beta version</strong> or the <strong>classic Outlook.com</strong>? Please see this screenshot:<br />
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef113f46-2532-4a31-ad77-306d96d56c2f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef113f46-2532-4a31-ad77-306d96d56c2f?upload=true" /></a></li><li><span>If you’re using the Outlook app, which <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">version</a></strong> of it
 is installed on your PC?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If it’s the <strong>Outlook desktop app</strong>, you may refer to the instructions
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/archive-older-items-automatically-25f44f07-9b80-4107-841c-41dc38296667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">here</a></strong> on how to auto archive emails.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it’s <strong>Outlook.com</strong>, the option that you can use is
<strong>creating a rule</strong> instead. This is due to the availability of this option and AutoArchive settings can be managed if you’re using the Outlook desktop app. For the steps on how to archive emails from a specific contact using a
<strong>rule </strong>can be found <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">here</a></strong>. Once you've created a rule,
 all the emails from a certain sender will moved automatically to the Archive folder. You may refer to the image below for the suggested rule that you can establish:<br />

    <title>Synchronize OneDrive for Business with local file server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthatfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synchronize OneDrive for Business with local file server</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to accomplish the following scenario: My users currently access files on a local file server. These files are backed up nightly locally and I'd like to keep it that way. I also need to provide access to these files while users are traveling (currently
 each user has a laptop and a desktop, when they travel with their laptop they VPN back and RDP to their desktop to access file and email). I have them all migrated to Office 365 email, but now I need to do their file shares and it seems simple to me.....</p>
<p>I just want to synchronize the current file structure from the local server to&nbsp;OneDrive and vice versa continuously. I.E. if a user changes a local file it gets synchronized to OneDrive. If they change a OneDrive file the change gets synchronized back to
 the server. This way I can continue to backup the file locally while providing a faster means to access files when traveling.</p>
<p>Is this setup possible?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<p>No, it is not feasible to sync SharePoint Online&nbsp;library with a mapped network drive or UNC path using OneDrive for Business sync client.&nbsp;

<p>I was actually hoping to install OneDrive for Business on the file server itself and keep it in sync that way. Would that be possible?</p>

<p>I have seen that the OneDrive for Business app can be installed on the file server and sync files to the Office 365 cloud (with some severe limitations), but is this synchronization bi-directional and continuous?
</p>
<p>What I am really looking for is something that will keep my local file server and Office 365 in sync all the time so my users can access the data from anywhere, but I still have a local copy that I can backup, store offsite and keep for longer that the 14
 day recycle bin that is provided in SharePoint. </p>

<p>Matt, I would be very carefull in doing so with the current OneDrive solution. Bear in mind that you can only sync up to 20k files per account. This is not as much as it seems and I m sure you already know about that...</p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>All files synced by using the OneDrive for Business sync client are bi-directional and the OneDrive for Business sync client automatically syncs folders with their SharePoint libraries approximately every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>
