<h2>            PowerPoint won&#39;t play audio, Sierra 10.12.6</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot hear the audio downloaded from an online lecture class's PowerPoint presentation. &nbsp;I get a notice saying I need to update the media files and then after I downloaded Flip4Mac the files updated, but audio was lost. &nbsp;Does anyone have a solution to
 this? &nbsp;Before downloading Flip4Mac the audio files said "Codec Error" when trying to play them before updating. &nbsp;Other lectures were fine, however this lecture's audio format is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Amanda</p>

    <title>Rethinking Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> capch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rethinking Windows</h2>
                    <p>Sorry to dump it here, but there really is no any other place to give a general feedback on Windows, anywhere; which kind of shows the real root issues with Windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows' foundations' time has long passed and nowadays' users want much more than the traditional PC setup with the enormous amount of history baggage. Windows today make almost all the things that users need a pain. The UX is horrible in these areas. It
 would be time to start doing the right things, thinking outside of the box and really listen to users. Here is my 2 cents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. For a long time now Windows has been famous for making installation, uninstallation and backup of programs extremely frustrating. It's time to take an action on that. If Mac can do it, surely Windows too. Let's forget finally the damn shared directories/libraries/registry
 tools and let each app just be installed with a simple copy into ONE INDEPENDENT location only. It would make app maintenance, development and backups much easier than it is today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Users care a great deal about their data. Sure, it's nice to protected the OS itself from viruses and so on (admin accounts), but please provide a way where we can restrict which app can access to what in an easy way. Having everything dumped in Documents
 and let every app access that, is not a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Microsoft always implement half-solutions only. WPF, OS widgets, and almost all other code bases make it impossible for average developers to develop apps QUICKLY without investing into 3rd party libraries, just because the base OS libraries are so poor.
 With WPF, there is still no D&amp;D reordering of items in lists, and the list goes on and on. VS express is a good step into the right direction, but the OS libraries need to catch up big time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Licensing. That mess has to be cleaned up and centralized for all products. Anyone who bought Windows, then an upgrade license, should be allowed to get a free license for the updated full OS version and download the ISO image for that. Nowadays HDDs/SSDs
 die every 1-2 years, so going through a system reinstall is a huge pain, mainly because of the bad licensing solutions and also the nonexistent backup solutions (see point 1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added:</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Attaching meta-data to files. Though this feature works for some files, not all file format can be used, which is nonsense, since the meta-data shoudl be attached to the file on the FS level, not embedding into the file itself. The end result is that
 this feature sometimes work, sometimes not, which is especially bad for media files, the main use case for file metadata.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Office. Well, a long list of UX problems could be added here, so I'm just gonna pick some of them.</p>
<p>a) In Outlook there is no a single global font setting for emails. The way font settings work reflects the Office programmer's view of the topic, not the users. This makes simple tasks like increasing font sizes permanently in all email formats a big pain.</p>
<p>b) Outlook also makes it hard to see which email address is used for a sent email, a trivial task again for&nbsp;a mailer application of an Office suite.</p>
<p>c) Still no row/column move and swap in Excel.</p>
<p>The list of these minor UX annoyances can be continued almost endlessly. All of them is present today because Microsoft not listened to users good enough.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I would like to generally second the OP's post. I am aware that a lot of effort is going into developing a strategy for mobile devices, and that this is seen as the "growth" area. But Windows 8 and 8.1 made it seem that the desktop community, a gigantic
 community, was being abandoned in a knee-jerk sea-change toward touch and mobile.
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>In other words, what I'm looking for in the next version of Windows <span>
</span>is a compelling reason to upgrade from Windows 7. </p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>Whereas windows 7 marked another step in a forward direction for the desktop, Windows 8 appeared as a total course-change to something new, untested, and I'm sorry to say, irrelevant. That is, a huge part of Windows' market-share is in the workplace or the
 home office, and this market-share is not interested in anything Metro/Modern. Why? Because Metro/Modern
<em>at this time </em>offers no "killer feature" which compels businesses to adopt it as a new platform. Quite the opposite, Metro/Modern hasn't been around long enough to prove itself.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>On the other hand, Office on Windows is stilla "killer app". Perhaps a little boring, because it's so ubiquitous, but it's THE PLATFORM that businesses like mine rely upon every single day.
 For us, it has to work, every day, 8-14 hours a day. Windows XP did a very good job at this. Windows 7 did better. What I
<em>wanted </em>from Windows 8 was Windows 7 made better. More polish, performance, fixing lingering bugs and annoyances, improvements to day-to-day functions and maintenance (like a modern backup/restore app as suggested by the OP).
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>and as to the UI, I wanted changes directed to IMPROVING WORKFLOW, not to an art project or bringing attention to a mobile platform. What I wanted was a way to do repetitive things more quickly and easily. I wanted a platform that better provides the information
 I need at a glance, and the ability to easily find whatever I need when I need it.
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>Example, Windows 7 has a good start in file searching. But try searching with the "content:" tag is hit and miss. An advanced file searching feature, with REGEX-like power for both filenames and file content, would be a great feature.
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>But in Microsoft's push, push, push on mobile, is anyone working on these issues? Whose giving attention to the Desktop?
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>That's what I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">really</span>want
committed</span> to the Desktop and to working people like me who depend on it for our livelihoods. I live in a world where screens are getting bigger, not smaller. It's also a world where there's less and less time and willingness to stop and re-train on something
 new, particularly when the old still works well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it's a victim of its own success, but Windows is not a platform for radical changes, cosmetic or otherwise. Its success has been due in large part to its reliable familiarity, as well as a reasonable amount of customizability, and an expectation
 that it will do what's expected and otherwise stay out of the way and pull no surprises.
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>I'll leave it with this: Microsoft has a lot to be proud of. The Windows NT experiment has been a roaring success. It not only unseated OS/2, it removed Solaris, AIX,
and HP/UX completely from the desktop. But this was largely achieved by paying close attention to the needs of the workplace, big and small. Whatever the attraction of mobile, the Desktop should not be set aside as "the old thing" that
 nobody wants to work on anymore. </p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>
</p><p>Because there's a lot more to do to get the Desktop finished, polished, fast, secure, and reliable, a lot of it undoubtedly tedious and boring, achievements that will be difficult to take credit for. But that's the only thing that will compel me off Windows
 7 as the platform I rely on to make a living.</p>

            <p>I understand and appreciate the concern not to sacrifice the desktop for tablets and mobile, but I don't think going back to two (or three) different versions of Windows (desktop, tablet, and phone) is the right answer&nbsp;(and it's not clear that J_d_Meister
 was recommending that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hybrid and appreciate being able to switch modes when I remove or reconnect the keyboard.&nbsp; I did have several days of "retraining" to get used to the tablet interface (the desktop interface is mostly unchanged--except for the missing start menu).&nbsp;
 I also put Windows 8 on my older HP tablet pc and it became immediately more usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I resisted put Windows 8 on my Windows 7 desktop system.&nbsp; I use two large non-touch screen monitors and was leery of using a touch screen OS on that system--until my hard drive crashed and I had to reinstall Windows and couldn't find my Window 7
 boot disk.&nbsp; I was teaching online and on site classes and needed to have the system back quickly. So I installed Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out my concerns were unfounded.&nbsp; Windows 8 worked just fine on the desktop (Window 8.1 was even better).&nbsp; Now I wouldn't go back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point of this is not that I'm right and J_d_Meister wrong, it's that we are both right.&nbsp; The Windows experience is different for everyone and any one person's experience isn't--and shouldn't be--the driving force behind the evolution of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are businesses that really can't afford to develop new processes and learn a new OS (although, if they never change, they will ultimately go out of business--even big companies like Digital Equipment, Sun, and all those Slide Rule manufacturers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there are also many businesses, both large and small, that are embracing the use of tablets and Windows 7 doesn't&nbsp; meet their needs.&nbsp; Many also use desktops.&nbsp; It is much more convenient to be able to switch modes between the two or three equipment platforms
 and still have access to the same apps on all three in a consistent mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The times are changing--even more rapidly than in the past.&nbsp; Embrace change,&nbsp;For those of&nbsp;you still using your typewriter, you should seriously consider retiring it.</p>

            <p>A few months ago, we replaced one of our office desktop computers&nbsp;with a brand new one which had Windows 8.0 pre-installed. It was then upgrade to Windows 8.1.&nbsp;It was a very steep leaning curve at first, but the person who is now using that computer&nbsp;has
 been doing okay on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another story, another person came to me&nbsp;with a brand new touch screen laptop with Window 8.1 installed on it and she&nbsp;had all sorts of problems trying to use it. After spending all sorts of time on&nbsp;coaching sessions with her, she was still having problems
 grasping the concept of how to use it. To solve the problem, I ended up installing "Classic Shell" on it. I haven't heard a complaint since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most people I have spoken to, who are desktop users, really don't like the window 8.x interface and many have asked me what was Microsoft thinking when they came up with it. Myself, I understand that Microsoft was trying to have a universal interface accross
 all of its platforms similar to what the folks at Apple have done&nbsp;with their I-Products. However,&nbsp;the Mac is still a Mac and maybe&nbsp;a PC should be the same way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my own case, I played with a couple of versions of Windows 8 RTM Preview Editions. On the first one, my hard drive crashed after a couple of months&nbsp;with it and I did not bother to re-install it when the drive was replaced. On the second one intended for
 enterprise, it would not install onto my computer because of a well known bug it had in at the time. I've stuck with Windows 7 since then until I've heard about Windows 10. What I'm seeing so far, it does look promising.</p>

            <p>Yes, I moved my work desktop machines (actually docked labtop) to Windows 8.1 and after "I was retrained" can find the places that I need, even when in Server 2012 it seems to be have been an attempt to hide much of what we use on a daily basis.</p>
<p>

    <title>list indent changes multiple lines when changing indent level - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> affenwaffen  say:</h3>
<h2>            list indent changes multiple lines when changing indent level</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I have a styled list I created in word 2007, modified a little in word 2010, and work with now again in word 2007. This list is being applied to a large block of text that is not indented in any way. The text was brough across from MODI after OCR was performed
 on it. The spacing and spelling has all been cleaned up. This is just plain text at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I select the entire block of text and apply the styled list everything starts off at the first indent level. I must then go through the block of text, chunk by chunk and change the indent to match the desired level. Changing a chunk to level 2 works
 no problem at all. If however I then proceed to try and change the chunk of text after a level two (remember that it is starting off at level one) it successfully changes to a level 2, then it changes to a level 3 BUT, and here is the bit I am stuck on, the
 previous line that was set at level 2 also changes now to level 3 as well. If I select the line that is supposed to be a level 2 and change it back to level 2, the following line that is supposed to be a 3 changes to a 2 as well. It is acting as though there
 is some sort of link between the lines of text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW each line is ended with a CR/LF so in theory should be starting a new paragraph. The text styles have been created for levels 1 and 2, but not for further levels down the chain, and linked to the indent level. Its a numbered list. I think that about
 covers it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone advise me on what I have to change in order to have the correct indentation behaviour? I have mucked about with this for about a day and am stumped. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me. I dont have the ability to attach a file as it is against company policy to do so (even the template).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been trying to figure this out so I out some more time into it yesterday. The weirdest of things happens: The indentation works as expected in 2010, but not in 2007. I have crafted the paragraph / font / list styles and in 2010 they work exactly as
 defined and expected. On 2007 the wierd behaviour of indenting one line by an extra level (specifically level 2) indents the line above as well if it is a level 2 - so you end up with 2 level 3 indented lines. Damn strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the short term I will have to keep working on the document in 2010 just to get it finished in time, however I would still like to get to the bottom of this problem as the bulk of my work is still done in office 2007. The only thing that I can think of
 is that there must be a difference in the way the two applications perform the indenting operation. I might try recording a macro later today and see what is going on behind the scenes. Might tell us something. Is there a setting I might have inadvertantly
 altered that could cause this behaviour?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for having a crack at this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you receive an error message saying "mailbox unavailable", it is almost the same as "mailbox not found". It could mean that there is a problem with the account of your recipient. You can check if you have the correct email address, and then try sending
 it again. If the issue persists, you can contact the recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Not at all related. I am attempting to share the Microsoft Calendar via my Outlook.com Calendar page&nbsp;https://outlook.live.com/owa/#path=/calendar. To share a calendar, I right click the calendar I want to share, choose "Sharing Permissions" and then put
 in the @yahoo.com email address of the person I'm trying to share with. I then receive a bounced message as mentioned above. Again, clearly an issue on Microsoft end, not end user's end.

<p>hi stan,</p>
<p>to clarify the situation, can you provide the information below?</p>
<p>1. about “it does not let me do it”, what is the error symptom? is there any error message when you add this student? please send us a screenshot of it.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b21f0ff1-c35d-41ad-b584-aecdc4d6df1f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db21f0ff1-c35d-41ad-b584-aecdc4d6df1f" /></a></p>
<p>to upload screenshots, click <b>use rich formatting</b> in this thread and select
<b>insert/edit media</b>.</p>
<p>2. can this user be added to another class notebook?</p>
<p>3. does the problem only occur to this affected user? if so, please let the global admin check if this user has sharepoint online licenses assigned.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<p>[<em><strong>the personal information is removed by jerry duan msft support</strong></em>]</p>
<p>1. this is the screen shot i get when it comes to actual adding students email.</p>
<p>2. i am unable to add the student to another class</p>
<p>3. i am unable to add any students to any of the classes</p>
<p>last semester i was able to add some students after sharing my class with them. which i do not wish to do.</p>
<p>i want the students work to be private.</p>
<p>can you let me know if these domain names are valid with education accounts&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>there are no other teachers using this at my school, so i wouldn't be able to tell if it is working with others.</p>
<p>if it is getting difficult to add students, it will be difficult for me to even attempt to use onenote&nbsp; class as we have limited resources in our school, i have to book the computer lab and when i get there nothing can be done. in the last two days i have
 altogether waster 150 minutes trying.</p>

<p>hi stan,</p>
<p>given the error message, it seems that a problem occurs during the sharing process. to look into the issue, can you confirm the information below?</p>
<p>1. try sharing a class notebook with teachers and let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>2. navigate to your onedrive for business library &gt; select the class notebook &gt;
<b>share</b> &gt; <b>shared with </b>&gt; <b>advanced </b>&gt; <b>check permissions </b>&gt; confirm that you have the full control permission for the class notebook.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d2e12add-8f9c-43ac-b974-6d85281e0e6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd2e12add-8f9c-43ac-b974-6d85281e0e6e" /></a></p>
<p>3. if you have the full control permission over the class notebook,</p>
<p>4. try granting a permission to the affected users via<b> grant permissions</b> and see the outcome.</p>
<p>5. sharing other documents in your onedrive for business library with the affected users and see if there are any sharing issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<p>1. None of the teachers in the school are using it so not possible</p>
<p>2. I have full control, I am the owner</p>
<p>3. When sharing by &nbsp;inviting students the message is &nbsp;"*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is outside your organization"</p>
<p>Is it because the student email domain name is @student.tdsb.on.ca where as the teacher email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Students have not yet accepted the invitations for me to try to add them to the class.</p>
<p>4.Still I am unable to add students to onenote class</p>

<p>Hi Stan,</p>
<p>After checking the information from our side, we find that domain <b>student.tdsb.on.ca
</b>and <b>tdsb.on.ca </b>are added to different organizations. So the students with the email @student.tdsb.on.ca will be treated as
<b>external users</b> of your organization. If your tenant’s SharePoint or global administrators have blocked users to share contents with the external users, you will not be allowed to share any contents with them.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, you can contact the global administrators of your organization to adjust sharing settings to allow internal contents to be shared with external users. Below is the article to manage external sharing settings for an organization:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-external-sharing-for-your-SharePoint-Online-environment-c8a462eb-0723-4b0b-8d0a-70feafe4be85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-external-sharing-for-your-SharePoint-Online-environment-c8a462eb-0723-4b0b-8d0a-70feafe4be85</a></p>

<p>I had contacted my employers help desk. At this point they are not in a position to help me, what they said in summary is that it is not possible now.</p>
<p>So I believe I may not be able to add students to my OneNote classes.However I will be writing to the ICT of my school board &nbsp;to see if they will take up this issue.</p>
<p>At the moment I am not guaranteed any help due to technical difficulties.</p>

<p><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></p>
<p><span>Mention the type of email account configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) or Exchange Server Account)?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the account is configured as POP account, you may try to repair Outlook and check if it helps in resolving the issue:</span></p>

does this have to be configured otherwise to make it work? or, do you have any idea why the emails don't arrive in the users' mailboxes?</p>
<p>thanks in advance for your response.</p>

<p>Hi Stef,</p>
<p>Have you checked if “Send e-mail when ownership is assigned” option in the Task List’s properties is selected as “Yes”? If so, set it to
<strong>No</strong> and set it back to <strong>Yes</strong> again to check the outcome. If this issue persists, try changing the email recipient to another group or a single people to see if there’s any improvement.</p>
<p>In addition, to make sure that you get the dedicated support, it’s recommended you post this issue on
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=sharepoint%2Capps&amp;forum=sharepointcollaboration%2Csharepointecm%2Csharepointworkflow%2Csharepointsocialcomputing%2Csharepointaccessibility%2Csharepointbdc%2Csharepointbi%2Csharepointexcel%2Cvssharepointdevelopment&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    I just finished installing MSE and was checking the Windows Firewall.&nbsp; The Virus Protection tab in my Windows Security Center says "Windows found more than one antivirus program...".&nbsp; Does the PC-cillin conflict with the AV/AS program in MSE?&nbsp; I can't

<p>I found the problem.&nbsp; I had a dead icon in the Control Panel for Trend Micro PC-cillin.&nbsp; It was still there even though I had uninstalled the software 3 years ago.&nbsp; I had no other traces of the old software anywhere on my computer.&nbsp; I finally found a program
 called Advanced Uninstaller Pro which has a Control Panel Manager which allowed me to disable the icon.&nbsp; That removed the reference to PC-cillin from the Windows Security Center and now I only have&nbsp;MSE anitvirus.</p>

            You may want to visit a Verizon store to trade for the TWOm; this way you will not have to bypass the request to create a KIN data plan each power on. Setting up an email and using wifi would be possible with your hotmail. Shift + Alt + L will bypass the
 request to begin the setup, if you do not have a KIN data plan.

    <title>IFS Function for Office 365 Subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            IFS Function for Office 365 Subscription</h2>
                    <p>Information: </p>
<p>Subscription: Office 365 Enterprise E3, Exchange Online (Plan 2)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use excel through my work subscription. I recently tried to use the IFS function, and found it does not exist within my version of excel. After some research I found that I must be an Office 365 subscriber with the latest version of excel to have "access"
 to the IFS function. I believe that my work subscription qualifies as an Office 365 subscription. Being a financial services firm, I assumed they would have a Business 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>How do I gain "access" to this function in excel? Do I need to update my version of excel? (I have Microsoft Office 2016 for Business).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p><span>Hi Shurtleff,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your description, it seems your organization has both one-time purchase and subscription version of Office, with the one being installed on your computer a one-time purchase version.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the subscription version, your Product Information would show<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Office 365 ProPlus</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First thing we would like to do is check whether you have the appropriate license for the subscription based Office. Login to your account via the link below to check your subscription:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you see a license for the latest desktop version of Office, this means you can use Office 365 ProPlus.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed2002b8-e81e-431d-a265-bad35595fffe?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed2002b8-e81e-431d-a265-bad35595fffe?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The next thing you should do is uninstall the version currently installed using Option 2 (easy fix tool) in the link below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall Office from a PC</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then, restart your computer before downloading and installing Office from the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Portal</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After it's done, you can check and see whether your product is called Office 365 ProPlus.</span></p>

            You can't, other than with VBA code in the data entry forms or with Before Insert Data Macros in the tables (and I'm not even sure if that will work). Referential integrity itself only applies within one database.

<p>There are many ways. As an example. Lets say you have a student database with a grades table. Now the student drops out so you want to delete his record and also his grades. So you have a delete student button. Behind the button you have code like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim strSQL as String</p>
<p>
</p><p>strSQL = "DELETE * FROM tblGrades WHERE StudentID = " &amp; Me.StudentID &amp; ";"</p>
<p>CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError</p>
<p>
</p><p>strSQL = "DELETE * FROM tblStudents WHERE StudentID = &amp; Me.StudentID &amp; ";"</p>
<p>CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError</p>
<p>

<p>Scott, what you've shown implements Cascade Deletes, which is a good thing and is part of RI. But it's only a piece of the puzzle! You also need to check that deletions from a parent table don't leave orphan records in a child table, and error out the deletion
 if so; you need to ensure that adding, or changing the foreign key value, in a child record is only allowed with a valid parent record; and so on. It can all be done but the effort required really makes you appreciate a working RI system!</p>
<p>
</p><p>KarenAnne, why the two backends? What benefit are you getting from the extra complication?</p>

<p>There is no support for this in Access.</p>
<p>There is some support for this in SQL Server, via DTC: Distributed Transaction Coordinator.</p>

            There's something of a logical contradiction in your question.&nbsp; Having a table in a local front end implies that one user can update it independently of other users, in which case an enforced relationship would not in any case be possible as different
 users' updates might conflict.<br />
<br />
Local tables are perfectly valid, e.g. for storing each user's preferences, default values etc., but such tables would not need to be in an enforced relationship with any back end tables.&nbsp; If, in such a table, there are columns which reference the table in
 the back end and are constrained by the relationship to that table, whereas other columns reflect the user's local preferences, then such a table should be decomposed, putting the columns which are constrained by the relationship into a separate table in the
 back end, and enforcing the relationship between that table and the referenced table, leaving only those columns which are not constrained in this way in the local table.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you can explain the exact real world context behind your question, we'd be able to advise further.<br />

            Ow. You do know about the very severe limitations on Access working over a WAN, I hope? Microsoft (unwisely) doesn't prevent linking across a WAN, but it doesn't work well, or at all (if you care about performance or database corruption). Been there, done
 that, lost the contract.

            <p>Hi Mandamamba,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in response. Since you are unable to send emails using Entourage 2008, it is possible that the SMTP server for your account is not properly configured. We suggest that you use the SMTP server provided in the link below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once done, kindly check if you can already send emails. If the issue persists, kindly contact
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2008-macother?tm=1363239588068">

<h2>            HTC Touch Diamond rebooting during phone calls</h2>
                    The problem I have is that intermittently (but often) when I make or take a call, within 5 seconds, the Diamond reboots (and obviously ends the call).&nbsp; Looking around the web, a few people seem to have an issue with this and some indicate that this is
 only a problem when the device is set to Sync data with Windows Exchange.&nbsp; If this is switched off then the device works as a phone.&nbsp; Is this a known issue, is there a patch to fix?&nbsp; thnx

<h2>            I cannot send emails from Outlook 2003</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 and use Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 to organize my emails, contacts &amp; calendars. Everything works (receiving emails, updating files,&nbsp;syncing contacts &amp; calendars) except I&nbsp;can no longer send an email from Outlook. I get the errror message

            I'm not sure if this will help you, but I encountered almost the same problem except I could neither send or receive.
<div><br />
<div>After checking everything I could think of I went to 'Control Panel', then 'Programs' and in the "Programs and Features" section is a listing for 'View Installed Updates'.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It showed I had an updated installed yesterday that was specific to Outlook (updated the junk mail filter) and is #KB2597035. I uninstalled that update (highlight the file and when you right click 'Uninstall' shows up) and immediately after it was uninstalled
 Outlook began receiving e-mails and the ones that had not been sent before were sent immediately.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps you also.</div>

            Screen backlight should switch off when you play music in Music player (Menu/Media/Music player).<br />

Light will stay on when you play music in Media player or gallery.

/discussions/board/message?board.id=phones&amp;message.id=9453&amp;query.id=15297#M9453<br />
<br />
it says:<br />
To record a conversation whilst in a call, you need to just choose 'options' and then 'record'.<br />
<br />
Also to use the 'voice memo recorder' press the button on the top left hand side of the phone and click 'record'<br />
---------<br />
<br />
But it doesn't work on my phone. I get the Push to Talk option.<br />

            OK, your SW is pretty old. Mine's 4.91 and dated on 25 Sept. '06. Anyway, as for button on the top left side of the phone, in my experience, in some versions it's configured to activate push-to-talk feature (like in yours) and in some versions it's configured
 to activate voice recording. It might be different in versions customized for an operator than in non-operator versions.
