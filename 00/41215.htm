<h2>            Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service, despite starting TrustedInstaller service</h2>
                    <p>I'm in the WinPE environment you get when you boot to the Win 10 installation DVD and opt for a command prompt. I'm trying to run SFC on my Windows installation in the hope of getting it bootable again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my "diskpart list volume" output:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5c3a052-1cd1-4677-a6fb-c6618a1eea46?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5c3a052-1cd1-4677-a6fb-c6618a1eea46?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that I don't seem to have a Recovery partition. So as I understand from reading online, my boot drive is the same as my Windows installation drive. I attempt to run SFC:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&gt; sfc /scannow /offbootdir=E: /offwindir=E:\windows</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So I start the TrustedInstaller service as suggested in various online posts I found:</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, that article doesn't address errors that might be encountered when running SFC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
one of the MS support articles that it links to</a> recommends running DISM before SFC, so I'll try that. Unfortunately, all its instructions (and 99% of all the instructions in search results I've read) end up assuming an online scan, which I can't do as my
 installation isn't bootable. I could count on one hand the number of forum responders who seem to have paid attention to the problem, but unfortunately they don't have the answer. So I'll ask here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I use DISM to check an <strong>un-bootable</strong> Windows installation against the install.wim of a Win 10 installation DVD and repair it?<br />
</p>
<p>https://superuser.com/a/1079747/ gives one of the only on-point answers I've found, but when I try it, it doesn't work:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">E:\dism /image:E: /cleanup-image</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Error: 2</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Unable to access the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not knowing what "the Windows directory <em>for</em>&nbsp;the image" means, I also tried /image:E:\windows in the above, but the same error results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.technibble.com/forums/threads/have-you-used-the-windows-system-image-repair-dism-exe-offline.70835/page-2#post-557553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">One person suggested</a>&nbsp;possibly creating a WIM from the corrupted installation,
 and using DISM to repair that WIM. Could anyone advise me on how to do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before sharing DISM-related links, <strong>READ</strong> them. If the instructions include "/online", they ARE NOT RELEVANT and WILL NOT WORK. This question keeps being asked online probably because it never gets answered.</p>

                    <p>Is there any way that I can force the version 1809 update on my one computer?</p>
<p>I have an older HP Pavilion g6 notebook and it got the update on like October 4th but the update tried 3 times in this desktop computer, which is a Frankenstein.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This desktop computer is faster and I have plenty of drive space for the update.</p>
<p>I've moved all the files I wouldn't want to lose, to an external hard drive, just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sick of waiting to get it.</p>

<br />
<br />No, I’m sorry, Microsoft has withdrawn the 1809 update for now. They will make it available again once some issues with it have been resolved.

    <title>Does Windows 10 1511 update change the operating system id&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muse2u  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Windows 10 1511 update change the operating system id&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After the recent Windows10 1511 update, several installed programs behaved like they were starting on a completely different computer. The programs required reactivation, re-authorization, etc.. For the majority of programs this meant simply reentering the
 activation code and losing previous settings because the program treated this as a new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, because the program was limited to a single activation on a particular date, the program could not be reactivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, because the program was limited to a single computer, the program rejected the reactivation because it thought it was already installed on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of iTunes for example, it resulted in an error message indicating that the iPod that had been previously authorized for that computer, was no longer authorized. After re-authorization, there were some additional errors that, at the time of this
 post, could not be directly attributed to the update.</p>
<p>The iTunes issue could be of some significance. Apple limits authorization of a device to five computers after which you must deauthorize all before you can authorize the next one. You can perform a deauthorize all only once a year. You could potentially
 run into the situation where you are not able to sync your device anymore because you are unable to authorize it for a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, a major upgrade from one Windows version, say 8 to 10, resulted in a predictable change of the operating system id and there were anticipated re-authorizations and potential for negative consequences (e.g. failed re-authorization of programs,
 redefining permissions on files and folders, etc). But to some degree, we had some control over whether we would proceed with the upgrade and when. In the past, Microsoft Windows updates did not change the system id. If Microsoft flags significant Windows
 10 updates as "new OS installs", if these updates occur more than once a year, and we have lost the ability to make the choice of rejecting that update, we could potentially start losing the right to use paid for programs and devices that use the operating
 system "id" to identify licensed software installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone else run into problems like this after the 1511 update?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience caused to you and will help you solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask If you are referring to Hardware ID and the Hardware Hash value. I would like to inform you that the 1511 update will not make any changes to the hardware, it is just an update for Windows 10. For more information on November update for
 Windows 10, refer the link provided below:</p>

            <p>What I was referring to was the domain or local computer identifier of the Security ID (SID), sometimes referred to the machine SID. The SID being a component of Windows access control since XP. I have noticed over the years that in spite of the fact that
 the hardware of a particular computer had not changed, the machine SID changed with every OS upgrade (e.g. XP to 7, 7 to 8, 8 to 10). This resulted in the permissions of many files created on internal or external hard drives by a given OS not being accessible
 by the upgraded OS. I have an external HDD that I have used as a backup drive for XP to 10 and there are folders and files that have different machine SIDs for each OS. My understanding was that some software publishers use this SID to manage/limit installation/functionality
 of their programs to a particular computer or OS. In the past, I have not seen a change in the machine SID as a result of an update within a given OS version, so this was my first suspicion for the unexpected behavior of some of my apps.
</p>
<p>Since posting, I have confirmed that the security ID of the computer was not changed by the update. The current SID can be established by using a file manager to view the file names in the system drive Recycle.Bin; the folder names represent the current
 SID. I cleared the Recycle.Bin on another installed hard drive, created a folder and file on the drive, deleted them,&nbsp; looked at the folder names that appeared in the Recycle.bin of the drive, and established that the SID associated with the new folder/file
 were the same as the SID that I had recorded for the initial Windows 10 install.</p>
<p>That confirms the the 1511 update did not change the SID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that begs the question, what was changed by the 1511 update that would cause iTunes on two different computers to think that the computers were no longer the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were some reports on the net that the update resulted in some programs being "uninstalled" (without warning) because they were no longer "supported" by the updated Windows 10. That suggests to me that there may have been changes made to the registry
 that resulted in the status of installed programs having been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were also some reports that the update caused some folders to become inaccessible to an application program. If that folders and information inside it was used by the program to establish the state of install of the program and devices it supported,
 conceivably the program might conclude that access to the program or devices was not authorized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there do not appear to be a large number of people reporting similar problems, there must be something unique to my computer configuration.

            <p>I had this with Malwarebytes pro, it worked until I had to uninstall it (for an unrelated problem) &amp; when it asked me to enter product key it stated that it had already been used on a different computer, I had MB support reset to key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>iTunes too registered the Win 10 computer as a new device, I removed all devices &amp; activated the updated laptop but as you say if every Win 10 update registers as a new computer with other software then it'll become a major problem for users.</p>

<p><span>Hello,<br />

I installed Windows 7 and everything works great except for Windows Explorer. The view settings don’t look right, I tried changing them but it’s not working. Can someone help fix this?</span></p>

<p><span>Hello Christi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In some rare cases the templates used by Explorer to determine view settings and commands can get overwritten or corrupted. This can
 cause folders to not use the correct view mode, columns, sort order, or command bar buttons. You can reset these a couple different ways, the easiest is to use the Reset Folders button. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Organize </strong>dropdown in the upper right corner of the window</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Folder and Search Options</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>View</strong> tab</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Reset Folders</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the steps don’t work the next thing to do is to reset the folders by deleting the registry keys that hold those folder settings. This
 should be the last resort. To do this, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Search programs and files</strong> box, type <em>regedit</em></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Programs</strong> list, right-click <strong>regedit.exe</strong> and click
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or click
 Continue</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Browse to and then click the following registry subkey:

</span></span></span><span>Close the registry editor and reboot your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If he issue is still not resolved you can double-click the 4 files saved to the registry to restore those keys. If the issue is resolved you should immediately delete the 4 files saved to the desktop so you don’t double-click them at a later time and have the
 issue come back.<br />

<h2>            Error 1722 with Windows Installer Package</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Encountering a problem when trying to install a 2D CAD program, Draftsight from Dassault Systems. It is the free 2015 version for a 32 bit system. I have had it previously on this computer but uninstalled it due to a crash, and then failure to restart. When
 I attempt to install the program again, I receive the message "Error 1722. There is a problem with this windows installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor. Action register_dsAutomationDll,
 location: C:\WINDOWS\system32\...\dsAutomation.dll". I have tried every method I can find on various forums, including the Microsoft Fix it tool, which also does not work. Have contacted various IT support to no avail. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cole</p>

<h2>            Windows 7  upgrade hangs and cannot reboot&#61;&#61; &#34;Setup cannot be canceled at this point&#34;</h2>
                    Apparently tons have people have the "upgrade hangs at 62%" problem.&nbsp; The solution is to "restart the computer and it rolls back to Windows Vista."&nbsp; That's all well and good, but if I try to close the upgrade window, I get a message that says "Setup cannot
 be cancelled at this point. doing so will leave your computer in an unusable state" &nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to leave my computer in an unusable state but there is no other way to get out of this window to restart the computer.&nbsp; I've tryed "shift-F10" and every other
 combination of F10.&nbsp; I've tried CTRL-ALT-DELETE (once) but nothing happens, it just sits there at 62% for the last 20 hours.&nbsp;

<p>Wait 10 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Start the computer again.</p>
<p>You will be given the option to do a rollback to Windows Vista. </p>
<p>Do that and try the following:</p>
<p>1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade</p>

<p>If you are unable to roll back to Windows Vista, try the following, this require that you do a custom install:</p>
<p>If you are unable to do that or continue the existing installation, I suggest you do a custom install and recover any important personal files from the Windows.old folder.</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

<h2>            Blue screen of death with different error code each time</h2>
                    Hi, just yesterday I started experiencing a blue screen of death issue. Just in the past hour ibhave had three all displaying different stop code errors. Those include IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL, ATTEMPTED WRITE TO READ ONLY, and SYSTEM SERVUCE EXCEPTION.
 I have googled all these but I cannot figure out what is causing this. Also I have an update for windows: 2018-2 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4090913) but the update will not install and is throwing the error code
 0x8007065e. How can I fix these problems?

            Hi Ashleigh, since you only had 2 programs installed, your best option is to re-install Windows 10 . . . I know it is a bother, but you will end up with a more stable system !
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Thanks for the reply guys but I figured out the problem. Just did some googling on the beep codes and figured out it was a memory problem, removed all the ram and moved them around and its back to normal. Thanks again for the help!

<h2>            LaCie d2 Quadra v3 incorrect function when trying to initialize.</h2>
                    I recently bought a LaCie d2 Quadra v3 directly from their website, upon receiving the product it failed to work properly. I tried to manually initialize the drive and no matter what I do I get a I/O device error or Incorrect Function error in the diskmgmt
 tool. It shows up in my hardware manager and my manage hardware and printers under the control panel. It's properties show up when I right click on it too.<br />

    <title>Xbox Home Console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scoldingmantis8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Home Console</h2>
                    <p>So Xbox offers a service known as home console sharing that allows people to play and access Xbox live along with games, even if they do not own them as long as their friend that shared their home console with them has the purchase or active subscription
 right.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>My question is how many people can designate a single console as home?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I know that the home console does have a limit and it is not 1. It is more than that cause I have various home console accounts set on my friends console and have finally received the error message that we 'cant set any more home console to this Xbox' even
 though we other accounts with available home console switches available.</p>

<p>Hello Scolding,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The home console sharing is set with 5 switches and then after it will give you a date when you will be able to switch again. You are only able to have one home console at a time. For example you cant have your console and friends console set as home. It
 is possible that there are multiple accounts on a single console&nbsp; There also is a limit as to how many can have that same console set as home. For example if five profiles are on the console and each have it set as home that is why you are getting the message.
 You will have to change home on one or few of the profiles to use it on profile you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

<p>This is incorrect I guarantee you that I can set multiple accounts as home console on a single console., and I'm aware that I have five switches every 365 days that was not my question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how many until I get the error message that I can no longer set any more home consoles to this Xbox.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t login to my windows 10 PC. Login screen refreshes after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexanderzm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t login to my windows 10 PC. Login screen refreshes after entering any key.</h2>
                    <p>So since yesterday I have this one problem. I started my pc as usual and then this pre-login screen appears, everything looks like always, but when I try to enter any letter into the enter password box the login screen 'refreshes' and I still have to enter
 my password which leads to the same problem if I enter any key the login screen refreshes and I am stuck in this loop. On the bottom left only the ease of access button and the change language button works. If I try to hit the power button or the wifi button
 the login screen refreshes again. I tried pressing shift and the power button on the bottom left but the same problem comes. I've also tried a couple of other things and now I am out of ideas. Would anyone be so kind and give me a solution to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: After sometime my pc restarts automatically but the problem still persists.</p>

            Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to a Clean Reinstall
<br />I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

    <title>Windows 10 - Email Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grahamchamberlainxn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Email Account</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a new Hewlett Packard laptop which has Windows 10 pre installed. This was to replace my aged Dell Inspiron laptop which has Windows Vista OS. The latter laptop has served me well and is still going OK though it is now not supported
 by Microsoft and is only a matter of time before it fails me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem with Windows 10 is that when I tried to install my email account (btinternet being in the UK) after several minutes it informed me that it could not retrieve my emails as my BT password needed updating, this I did and it tried again unsuccessfully,
 this time saying that my BT account settings are out of date. With this in mind, I can obtain my emails on my IPad, IPhone, Android device and my out dated laptop, but not my new computer with Windows 10. (Incidentally I use Windows Mail on my older laptop
 without any problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into <strong>Settings</strong> and the <strong>Accounts</strong> on the new computer and then click
<strong>Manage Account</strong>, my Btinternet email address is shown, I enter my Password and hit Save. Again the system tells me that it is trying to retrieve my Email, without success. I return to Sttings and Account and I Have noticed that the blanked out
 Password box shows more "hidden" digits than my current password has, which works well with all other above mentioned devices) I delete the hidden password digits and enter my password again, without any success on obtaining my emails. I have tried this several
 times today with the same results. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone out there help me to load up my emails on my new Windows 10 laptop please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Graham,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conflicts with the security certificate settings is one of the possible reasons why you are having an account settings out-of-date issues. I would suggest that you follow the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Manage Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Choose the account that's out-of-date to display the account settings dialog.</li><li>Choose <strong>Change mailbox sync settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced mailbox settings</strong>. You may have to scroll down in the dialog to see
<strong>Advanced mailbox settings</strong>.</li><li>Check the boxes for <strong>Require SSL for incoming email</strong> and <strong>
Require SSL for outgoing email</strong> and then choose <strong>Done </strong>&gt; <strong>
Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you can follow the steps in this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/your-account-settings-are-out-of-date-in-mail-or-calendar-for-windows-10-4484de9e-66b2-46a9-8459-6ca1fcc110b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    I'll put it as simply as I can. My computer is stuck on The lock screen with no area to put my username or password in. The only thing that I see is the wifi option, the ease of access option, and my background photo. Nothing else. I have tried countless
 times to restart my PC and nothing seems to work as it takes me right back to this screen. I will add a picture about what I mean.

            So I have figured one thing out. It turns out that the wifi connection was a cause of this, not sure if it was the whole reason. Basically, with the only 2 options I was given, I clicked on the wifi option and saw that my current home network was not being
 able to connect to. So I tried something else. I went on my IPhone and did a personal hotspot and connected automatically. Now it was connected. So I restarted my PC and after connecting
<strong>BEFORE&nbsp;</strong>getting to the lock screen, my computer was able to log in. I can elaborate more if needed, but now I would like to understand &nbsp;how the wifi and login topics are connected, because I personally don't want to repeat this every time it
 doesn't work, thanks again.

<h2>            Can&#39;t download Xbox video to Sd card</h2>
                    I am trying to download a movie I have rented to my Surface 2 sd card.&nbsp; It won't allow me to download as it says there is not enough room on the c:drive, which I know - that is why I want to use the SD card!&nbsp; I have changed the default save locations to
 the SD card, and deleted the other folders in the "watch for video" option leaving only the SD card, but it still tells me there is no room, and is obviously not looking for the SD card.&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; It shouldn't be this difficult! And even finding out how to do
 these steps took me ages - no clear and obvious help support to do that.

<p>

<li>Can your device recognize this Micro SD card?</li><li>Can you copy and paste other files to this Micro SD card via file explore?</li><li>What's your Micro SD card format?&nbsp;<span>If it is not NTFS, please try backing up your files and reformatting the card in NTFS format. After you reformat it, try downloading videos again. However, some Micro SD cards don't support this file format, so you
 might have to confirm this with the manufacture.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

</p><p>I was able to fix it by changing the settings for the download from high definition to standard definition (HD to SD). Lower video resolution means a smaller file size, and less chance of running out of space while downloading. It seems to have done the
 trick - videos that I couldn't download before as HD download fine in SD. It also means you can store more videos, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're planning to watch the movie on the Surface, you may not notice the lower quality - it's a relatively small screen, after all.</p>

            I am seeing the same problem. Clearly the video app is not saving directly to SD. It must require storage on the main drive to be able to do the download. Which is idiotic given that most tablets have very limited internal storage and that is why SD cards
 are used at all. I have to assume that MSFT has no real interest in selling videos to mobile customers.

            I am still having the same problem - my c: drive is so full that I can't save even a low-res movie on it.&nbsp; I can write and save all other files on the SD card - it is working fine.&nbsp; I need to be able to save the movie directly to the SD card, and that
 does not seem to be possible.

            <p>Hello SCArmstrong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried moving other files onto your SD card to free up some space on your C: Drive? You could also try some things like uninstalling unused apps, moving files and pictures to OneDrive, or performing a disk cleanup on your Surface. This
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 from dvd or memory stick. Strange thing, a very strange dism log file full of chinese characters??. This is a new install just upgraded to 8.1 from an original 8.0 ISO in Australia</p>

            <p>I'll answer this one myself. It appears that if you have any of the updates below installed, then you get the DISM Source error. Uninstall the updates and all should go well. You can then re-install the updates after Net Fx 3.5 is installed</p>
<p>It would be kind of nice for Microsoft to tell you this before letting you install the updates.</p>

    <title>Win 7 does not recognize my System Image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bighlrzr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 does not recognize my System Image</h2>
                    
<p>Prior to me having to redo my Win 7, 50 gig installation, I created an Image using Win 7 built in utility in control panel. I saved it to an external NTFS USB hard drive for safe keeping.</p>
<p>Now that I have to rely on this image, Win 7 refuses to recognize that it exists!!!!! The image creation process went off without a hitch saving a folder with about 12.5 gig worth of files &amp; folders on the external drive.</p>
<p>Now when I have tried to restore the Image using all of the specified procedures from Microsoft, whether it be from the Win 7 Installation disk, or From within Control Panel, since I have now had to go through the actual O.S. installation. I just keep getting
 a dialog that a prior system image does not exist, &amp; There is NO browse button in that dialog for me to physically point Windows to it.</p>
<p>The USB drive is recognized in Windows Explorer &amp; I can see the files &amp; folders that where created by the imaging process. I have even copied that folder from the USB drive to the Desktop &amp; it copies fine.</p>
<p>How do I make windows use this image so I don't have to re install everything from scratch??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>O.k. I did all of the above &amp; at step:</p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then
 insert the last system image USB hard drive from the set when prompted.</span></p>
<div><br />
<div><span>This is the problem. I get the following
 dialog:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>"Windows cannot find a system image on the computer. Attach the backup hard disk or insert the final DVD from a backup set &amp; check retry. Alternatively, close this dialog for more options."</span></div>
<div><span>I keep hitting "Refresh"..same error. I choose "Advanced" and a get he following 2 choices:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span><span>"Search for a system image on the network"</span></span></div>
<div><br />
<div>or</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Install a driver"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows refuses to find the external USB drive &amp; the darned image is sitting on the drive named as Windows named it when it was created "_WindowsImageBackup". There is NO browse button to point windows to the image. And to make matters worse, I can boot
 into windows, go into "Windows Explorer" &amp; look right at the damned image file!!! Windows can see the USB drive &amp; file fine except for when I need it most!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any suggestions anyone??</div>

            <p>Amazing how so many Microsoft "experts" are either unavailable or unable or maybe just cant be bothered to help out on this issue which is clearly effecting many users!<br />
<br />
Instead "Chris" from Microsoft has the audacity to tell users they are asking for help in a wrong topic!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have exactly the same issue as the original poster and have tried exactly the same things he has mentioned already getting exactly the same results!&nbsp; Why cant someone from Microsoft resolve this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made my image just before updating to Windows 8.&nbsp; Windows 8 is worst of all Windows OS I have ever had the dis-pleasure of using so wanted to go back to my Win 7 installation using my image files.&nbsp; But image files are simply not recognisable by Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on Microsoft experts...what do u suggest?</p>

            I'm thinking "or" is the answer. Windows 7 has ton of problems from its backup&nbsp;utility to registry edits&nbsp;and its mind boggling internet explorer. can MS come&nbsp;up with anything good?&nbsp;

            I've run into this same exact frustrating problem.&nbsp; I have one good system image on my external HD but it is from last fall.&nbsp; I've given up on trusting System Image and am using a 3rd party software called Macrium Reflect.&nbsp; I've already had occasion to
 use it and it works.<br />

Hello, 


I'm an user just like you, I'm an  IT guy (I have to deal daily with Windows's **** and at home I use Linux lol). I had the same issue but in windows 7. My solution is to copy and paste the system image from the external drive/usb device to the computer itself, for example in the C folder. Then run the repair disc and see if it can locate the system image. good luck :)
