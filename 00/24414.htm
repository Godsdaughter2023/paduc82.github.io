            Clarify the view to which you are referring. Clarify the location of these so called "useless icons." Your "description" matches nothing the rest of us could recognize. Be very specific. Post a screenshot if you cannot describe what you mean.

            Not aware of any setting&nbsp;that would remove the folder icons that appear in the Navigation pane. These icons are no different in concept that appear (on an equivalent basis) when using Windows Explorer. If the Outlook folder icons are "unintelligible" then
 the folder icons displayed in Windows Explorer should be equally unintelligible - is that the case?

            <p>Dear RajithR:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press the<strong> Windows key + X</strong>, choose <strong>Control Panel</strong>, then select
<strong>User Accounts and Family Safety </strong>in Category view, and then click on
<strong>User accounts</strong>, there is no option "<strong>Manage User accounts</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>These options are available <em>(the asterisk represents the Admin Shield icon)</em>:</p>
<p>Make changes to my account in PC settings</p>
<p>*Change your account type</p>
<p>*Manage another account</p>
<p>*Change User Account Control settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you meant "*Manage another account", as when I select this option the Manage Accounts window opens and shows two users - the one local user account created when Windows 10 Technical Preview was installed and the Guest account.&nbsp; The local user is
 shown as an Administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below the accounts, there are two options:</p>
<p>Add a new user in PC settings</p>
<p>*Set up Family Safety</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting "Add a new user in PC Settings opened the PC settings "app", on Users and accounts, Other users, but the "+Add users"was grayed out and nothing happened when clicked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions to enable the Built-in Admin account, and then repeated the above steps - now the "+Add user" when clicked opened the dialogue window to allow addition of a new user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new Standard user was successfully added / created.&nbsp; Disabled the Built-in Admin account.</p>
<p>I thought that this would reset the local Administrator account so that when attempting to add a new user, the "+Add user" would again be disabled, but it has remained enabled, so that I can now add more users with the Built-in Admin account disabled. Not
 complaining, just noting - this is the state I expected for the local administrator account in the first place, so I am happy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your instructions and assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hello RajithR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a similar issue. I upgraded from Win 7 Pro to Win 10 and was able to add users so I added my personal Microsoft Account and my Work Account (over 1 week ago). When I wanted to add other users (local or Microsoft accounts), the link
<strong>Add Someone Else to this PC</strong> appears to be '<em>Dead</em>'. I click on the link (button) and I see that it is pressed and then depressed but nothing at all happens. When I log in as Elevated Administrator, then the
<strong>Setup New User Windows appears for a brief second and then disappears!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried the following (from reading around on the net):</p>
<ul>
<li>Heathscan &amp; sfc Scan</li><li>I do NOT have a Windows 10 Media to try recovery from it</li><li>Copied the <strong>Default</strong> user profile from another Win 10 PC</li><li>Added a local user (using the lusrmgr.msc command), logged in with that user but am unable to make that user log in with the Microsoft Account</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I formatted the hard disk (act of desperation), reinstalled Windows 7 then upgraded again to Windows 10 and everything worked like a charm. I added my Work and Personal Microsoft Accounts and restored all my data (took over 2 days to Sync my OneDrive
 again). After all of this was done, I decided to add the family users again but FAILED! (Same Issue As Above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems that Windows 10 has a "Grudge" again my Microsoft Accounts ... I appreciate any assistance in this regards.</p>

<h2>            How to filter a combo box in a subform based on the selection of a combo box in the main form &#40;Access 2010 Web Database&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a form (frmMain) in an Access 2010 Web database. This form has a subform (frmSub).</p>
<p>The frmMain has a combo box cmbDepartment,&nbsp; for the After Update event, I have:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requery</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frmSub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The frmSub has a combo box cmbEmployee, the Row Source of this combo box is: SELECT [EmployeeName] FROM tblEmployees WHERE [Department]=[Forms]![frmMain]![cmbDepartment].</p>
<p>However, it doesn't work as I thought. It seems the Row Source of cmbEmployee only retrieves the value of cmbDepartment when the form first open, and will not change with the Requery marcro.</p>
<p>How should I setup the main form and the sub form to allow the filtering of the subform combo box?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span><span>I not really sure how the re-query command is supposed to interact with the sub-form. If you FIRST set the focus to the sub-form and then execute a requery command

<p>here's what you can do.</p>
<p>1. Create a blank form, put a combo box Combo0 and bound it to query/table</p>
<p>SELECT [Department].[ID], [Department].[DeptName] FROM Department;</p>
<p>2. set the bound column to 1</p>
<p>3. Drag the 'Multiple Items' Employees form</p>
<p>4. put a macro 'After update' on combo box to do following.</p>
<ul>
<li>SetLocalVar with Name=CurrentValue and Expression = Combo0 </li><li>Requery with Control ANme = Employee (name of the subform that needs to be refreshed)</li></ul>
<p>5. Open Employees form and Set Fileter property on Form to be following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dept = LocalVars!CurrentValue </li></ul>
<p>The idea is whenever the value of combo box changes, you are changing the value of a local variable (i.e CurrentValue in this example) and then use the same variable as part of FilterCondition on subform.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span><span>The issue of GOTO a control was fixed for the retail edition. I remember this as it was a bug that I actually filed. So, yes, goto does for for me.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>So just keep mind that running the pre-release edition then you often find things are fixed in the retail version. And additional features such as returning vales
 from data macros was added. However, sometimes we see features removed. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For example the forms on-dirty event was removed just before RC (or if it in the RC version it is now gone in retail version I can't remember anymore). I was using
 the on-dirty event to set a global refresh variable that the "calling" form would thus know to do a re-query or refresh of data when that form on top was closed. A web refresh can be quite slow so one as a good idea should pay more attention to this issue
 for WEB applications as opposed to desktop applications . However there is still a forms dirty property that I can check. So I simply moved the code over to my code that closes the form and set the global refresh variable in that code.<span>&nbsp;</span>Again
 being flexible with my designs means I did not really miss the on dirty event at all.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I should mention that in most cases for long time products the RC edition is not that big of a deal and tends to be very close to the final retail. And features that
 been in for years (and code that also thus been tested for years) tend to work well much the same as previous versions. However in the case of Access Web we are talking about 100% of every feature you are using is brand new. So it is subject to MORE change
 from the beta and test and RC versions compared to the retail then average. This is not a huge deal here but I thought it a good idea to point out that not only will have some things will have changed in the retail edition but things will have changed more
 then average as compared to other products that already existed. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>One last issue on the RC, you find that what you develop now with an pre-release version will not convert without issues and work in the final edition without problems.
 So this is just a heads up that what you build now will not seamless convert to retail.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, lets get back to the query problem. One really important tip here is to always check the usys Application log. I not really been thinking about your question
 out since placing a forms expression or even expressions with a tempVar is NOT legal in the WEB query builder. You should be seeing this error in the USYSApplication log. I am not sure why you are not. It is possible you not checking this log when testing/debugging
 code after you published? (just go file view applicaton Log). You can also set the nav pane to display system objects, but I find that clutters up the tables too much).</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>However if you not looking at this log after publishing then I am not at all sure how you been testing this code? (trial and error?). It is difficult (if not impossible)<span>&nbsp;</span>to
 figure out if something is wrong if you not checking the USYSApplicationLog after each publish attempt to guide and tell you about errors (this would be like driving a car with blindfold on, you not see any of your new errors).<span>&nbsp;</span>So as
 a another good tip do make sure you become good friends with the USYSApplicaionLog. Perhaps you are checking the log and that error is not showing up because you are using RC? If that error not showing up then you in a real tough situation since I can't imagine
 any other reasonable way to know if something not working and you just flying blind.<span>&nbsp;</span>I not sure how the "there are new application" errors is supposed to work, but when publishing since that table is synced, then it will state no new
 errors, but when testing something like above you best just check that table after every new publish.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is a screen shot and you can see it notes the error of a forms expression in the query builder is not allowed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1p1wTlPG6njLdgVtnpL6v6lVq7LwaE6NjdF0PPdVz8fb1v4hDOqdRdcAlbSTtwzSgraHS6ZGSAQ41I5msk2UJyFw%2fNoFormsInQuery.png" />
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>In many cases we can find a good workaround but in case of a combo box there just not a good work around.<span>&nbsp;</span>Note that for a query attached to a
 form you can just removed the forms!someform expression from the query builder and replace it with the new parameter feature. This is a new feature to replace the forms! reference. You also have the WHERE CONDTION. Once you add parameters to the query then
 you will see the parameter option in the code editor appear for OpenForm (it just like passing a parameter to a data macro). This works well for a form (or report). However the query parameter feature is NOT supported for a combo or list box.
<span>&nbsp;</span>So your hands are quite tied on this.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>About the best I can come up with is to build a query that joins to the combo box data source to another table with two columns. One column has user name (so this
 example can be multi-user). The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; column would have the filter value that you joined the query to. You can then set that value of the join by calling data macro and that will get you your filter.<span>&nbsp;</span>This works quite well. However
 this will only work before the form is loaded. I don't believe even re-query would force the combo box to re-load while the form is open. So at the end of the day you can't do cascading combo boxes.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Another work around that would be my choice is just simply launch a form that presents the records listed for selection. Place a small button on each row that when
 clicked on sets the id in a global variable and then closes the form and you have your id value back in the calling code.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>While I am at this I noted in other questions of yours you attempting to use where clause and filters as strings. They are expressions ONLY.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also
 the were clause and those query run on the server side.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is a diagram that explain this</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1puNPEx2dR9b-Nsf_V91jGck8EttGY4L1f9y367FdxSxKhD_8-lbF2B3f4Tq-8C1lef5EF6_lj7wOgYbXmIoZjNA%2fHOW%2520WEB.png" />
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The above diagram also explains why you don't have record processing on your desktop code either. (UI macro). As the above shows a web browser on your desktop does
 not have a recordset or any type of data engine to process data inside the browser. Of course what is very cool is that since the code is running on your desktop then often your code can run without having to request or do anything from the web server. This
 makes for a very rich and windows like responding web form.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>A really cool thing to try is bring up the expression builder in a form when you building the where clause. You see a near VBA like function set. Now, try editing
 a expression just one or two lines up, and your see that the expression builder only has about 12 functions.<span>&nbsp;</span>The reason for this is that code that runs in the web browser has VERY limited functions. So, there no Hour() and very limited
 or where clause is a expression and is not a string.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Also for most where clauses etc. it is better to NOT use the forms!someFormName reference. Better to set a local var since then if you re-name the form or even use
 the new navigation control then the form becomes a sub-form and your code will have to be changed. In fact by adopting this coding standard then you don't miss the me! Property that we had in client forms. There also the case with un-bound text boxes used
 for parameters that the data type of the expression is often messed up (it not clear).</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Anyway the above diagram should help you with some of your code issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>And do check the USYSApplicationLog when you publish.<span>&nbsp;</span>It should have told you that the forms! Use n the query is not legal for the web (but,
 it is client side).</span></span></p>

            How would you set it up where the combo box would be filter from two combo box?<br />
<br />
For example, Combo box 1 would contain all the "Manufacturers".&nbsp; The user will pick one manufacturer for an initial filter.&nbsp; Then the user will select from Combo Box 2 containing the "Device Model".<br />
<br />
Essentially, Combo Box 2 would be filtered by the selected manufacturer from combo box 1, and then only display all the "Device Models" to choose from.<br />

<h2>            need help connecting computer to internet using bluetooth </h2>
                    
<p>I have had to "hard reset" my Samsung Saga (running Mobile 6.1) and am now struggling to set up my internet connection on my PC using bluetooth.&nbsp; I bought the phone last year and somehow managed to make it work, but it was confusing then and I don't remember
 how I did it.&nbsp; But I KNOW the phone has the ability to allow internet sharing through bluetooth.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am able to sync my phone via bluetooth, so the computer (running Vista) recognizes my device in some capacity.&nbsp; But how do&nbsp;I set up a bluetooth internet connection?&nbsp;&nbsp;It's probably just a simple setting or step I'm&nbsp;forgetting, but&nbsp;I'm done trying this on my
 own, I need help!&nbsp;</p>

The hard reset did not wipe the ability to do that.&nbsp; If you were able to do it before then it still can be done.<br />
<br />
So I'm not sure what provider you use but if you <a href="http://www.everythingq.com/forum/moto-q-9h/bluetooth-internet-sharing-tethering-on-at-and-t-vista-instructions-22247.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Let me know how you make out.<br />

<ul>
<li>Quit all versions of Outlook</li><li>Copy the contents of your Outlook 2011 custom sound sets folder: /Users/Username/Documents/Microsoft User Data)</li><li>Paste into your Outlook 2016 sound set folder:&nbsp;/Users/Username/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook</li><li>Launch Outlook 2016 and select the sound set you want from Preferences &gt; Notifications &amp; Sounds</li></ul>

    <title>Build 14936 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerardkeeley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 14936</h2>
                    I woke up in the middle of the night with my PC requiring a restart so I checked the community forum and sure enough 14936 was here. I timed it this time and&nbsp;it took from 2:53 to 3:25 to finish. I had gone from 14931 which was working fine other than a
 few IE crashes. In this build that issue is supposed to be fixed so I have my fingers crossed with that one. Seems pretty crisp so far but I'll have to use a bit more to make sure all is well.

            Update ...Since coming home from work I've had IE crash twice within 30 minutes. I hope this doesn't continue being this was an issue that was supposedly fixed, lol. Oh well, I still am happy with the last two builds. No complaints here.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Outlook application, most likely, this problem is caused by incorrect registry entries or third-party programs that conflicts with the app. For us to better assist you, we would like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which email platform are you using when accessing your emails? Is it Outlook app or online?</li><li>If you're using Outlook app, which version of Outlook?</li><li>If you're accessing emails online, which Internet browser are you using?</li><li>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you are using Outlook app, we recommend that you repair the application as an initial troubleshooting step. For your reference, check this article on how to

<p>Hi Jancy41, are you using Outlook in Firefox?<br />
<br />
There is a bug in Firefox 58: wherever there was text in the message list (for example, the Inbox), the mouse will behave like you are still hovering over the message list instead of the message. Once you notice this problem, if you zoom the message (on Windows
 hold down Ctrl and tap either + or -, on Mac hold down Command and tap either + or -), the mouse works temporarily until you view the next message.<br />
<br />
A fix for this will be in the next Firefox 58 update (58.0.2), but that could be 1-2 weeks down the road.</p>

</p><p><em>Change a Firefox setting</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This change switches Firefox back to laying out pages on live.com (including outlook.live.com) the way they were in Firefox 56 and earlier:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(A) In a new tab, type or paste <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk.<br />
<br />
(B) In the search box above the list, type or paste <strong>stylo</strong> and pause while the list is filtered<br />
<br />
(C) Double-click the <strong>layout.css.stylo-blocklist.enabled</strong> preference to switch the value from false to true<br />
<br />
(D) Double-click the <strong>layout.css.stylo-blocklist.blocked_domains</strong> preference and set the value to
<strong>live.com</strong> and click OK. (In the unlikely event that you already had one or more sites listed add
<strong>,live.com</strong> to the list.)<br />
<br />
<em>Note: if you are viewing your mail on Office365, instead of live.com use office.com or office365.com -- whichever you see in the URL in the address bar.</em><br />
<br />
Then exit/quit Firefox and start it up again to make the change effective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does either of those work for you?</p>

<p>On 3G active Data connection, 1 day is quite good. But doesn't the device charge itself when you connect it to your PC for use as modem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For restarting-Go to settings-restore factory settings - settings only. It will set the phone to default settings but will not delete any of the data. You can also use *#7780# on the main screen followed by security code. If it doesn't work use *#7370# on
 the main screen followed by security code. Do note that it will delete all the data on the device, So do take a backup using Nokia Suite. If even that doesn't solve your problem, you will need to reinstall the firmware using Nokia Suite.</p>

            If its getting heated up so much, then you need to get the device inspected at the authorised Nokia Care Centre in your area. You can find it at

            Nah using 3G will surely heat up to a limited extent. But if its too much, Nokia Care will help. I'll try to calculate its temperature when used for a hour over 3G :)<br />
<br />
And i use it for hours to keep connected to the internet on my pc, never restarted or anything. Maybe except once or twice :) :D<br />
I think only even a factory reset will help :)

<h3> lucideone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel and Dot Matrix issue</h2>
                    I have a client who uses Excel spreadsheets to print checks on a dot matrix printer.&nbsp; She must do this - it is not an option to change printers.&nbsp; Since upgrading her from Excel 2003 to Excel 2007 (Professional Plus on XP), the column widths and row heighths
 randomnly shift on her on all of her check-writing spreadsheets.&nbsp; I've tried a variety of things to correct this and the problem went away for a few weeks, but is now back.&nbsp; Any ideas or suggestions?&nbsp; The initial things I tried involved fixing issues in the
 sheets (hidden columns within the print area and making sure she had set column widths, for instance) and also saving the sheets as the newer version of Excel to reduce the possibility of compability conflicts.&nbsp; It's not a matter of the paper feeding wrong
 in the printer or anything like that.&nbsp; It's solely an issue with the lines not printing where they should consistently like they should.

            <p>Update:&nbsp; I discovered parts that needed to be replaced in the original dot matrix printer that could have accounted for the slipping.&nbsp; Rather than replace the parts, since they had to spend money any way, they chose to purchase a modern dot matrix printer
 and the problem has not replicated since.</p>

    <title>Win 100410 Install, Update, and Activate Notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unclscott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 100410 Install, Update, and Activate Notes</h2>
                    <p>System: Intel 5000p chipset, Dual Xeon E5440 2.83 GHz ( 4-cores per cpu ), 16GB FB DD2, 3 15k-rpm SAS hdd's in RAID 0, nVidia 660 GTX, Intel PCIe Gigabit NIC ( with 9k Jumbo Frame network ), some cheap usb stereo sound device, external asus dvd+- r/rw/dl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OFFLINE INSTALL</p>
<p>
</p><p>Offline install was painless and flawless. Created a local account without issues. Having read the initial blog, I decided to just uninstall all pre-built in apps. First I right-clicked and Uninstalled and rebooted - SystemSettings exe crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an elevated mode, within 10 minutes of boot, ran the Powershell commands</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Get-AppXProvisionedPackage -online | Remove-AppXProvisionedPackage -online<br />
Get-AppXProvisionedPackage | Remove-AppXProvisionedPackage -online<br />
Get-AppXProvisionedPackage -online | Remove-AppXProvisionedPackage <br />
Get-AppXProvisionedPackage | Remove-AppXProvisionedPackage <br />
Get-AppxPackage | Remove-AppXPackage<br />
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Remove-AppXPackage</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Get-AppXPackage</p>
<p>
</p><p>All looked good and normal, Rebooted - <strong>SystemSettingsBroker</strong> crashed on reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked my device manager. It lists PCIe, PCIx, and PCI as all PCI - Win 10041 makes no attempt to differentiate components. Whilst I'm totally good with base, generic drivers, I would like to see&nbsp;better descriptions. SystemSettingsBroker would crash on
 reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Features, I only keep default: &nbsp;.Net 4.6 AS, IE 11, WMP, Fax and Scan, Print as PDF, SMB, Ps2.0, and the XPS stuff. By the way, I really like that Print As PDF was added :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Ms Visual C++ Redist, 2k5-13, directX June 2010, Chipset, and NVidia 347.88 Drivers; Everything else works great. Rebooted. Went through my device manager and disabled ( from bottom up ) unused components; no need to have these available if I'm
 not going to use them right? </p>
<p>Created this Online Account and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed the<strong> Start Menu is populated with empty boxes </strong>that do nothing when clicked. Having removed the packages, this just should be empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Activation </strong>keep popping up - and I would try to activate, but I was getting an error. Finally remembered that I needed to enter in the Key. Ok, but SystemSettings kept crashing on reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked the WUApp - KB2993928 ( .net mvc 4 security ) and NVidia HD Audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NVidia update&nbsp;I don't think should show up. I had it disabled in my Device Manager. For the NVidia drivers, I don't install anything Audio or 3D. Prior to this build, I noticed Windows Update would install the components I don't want or need, and even
 when I uninstalled them, windows would reinstall them. Also, in the NVidia control panel, my monitors are set to 60Hz refresh, but in the Device Manager, I'm at 59 Hz. Switching to 60 Hz prompts me to keep, I click Yes, but the settings don't stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In setting up my preferences, I set the voice to <strong>Zira</strong>. I go into<strong> Ease of Access
</strong>to underline keyboard short-cuts, and notice Mark's voice shows up there... shouldn't it be switched to Zira?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway,&nbsp;I'm still getting SystemSetting errors at reboot, but I'm all installed. I set&nbsp;option 100 in CleanMgr with everything checked and run
<strong>cleanmgr</strong>.exe /sagerun:100. CleanMgr <strong>timed out</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check my temp folders and all my temp files are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run CleanMgr again, this time I notice, it's not waking up my external hard drives. So I go into a yet unchecked folder to wake up the drive ( Windows Caches the folder list, so just going into the drive doesn't always wake up the drive ), and run CleanMgr.
 It does it's thing in a few seconds, but temp folders still exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Chkdsk /f /v /r /x on all my drives ( took a good&nbsp;day )&nbsp;- still getting errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run an elevated Script</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded /hidesp<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Dism /Cleanup-Mountpoints</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">sfc /scannow<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All Corruptions have been fixed! Yay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>SystemSetting crash disappears on reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total Install Size 9.4 GBs - no apps, page file, or hibernate. It was 8.4 GBs without the drivers and online account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check Dism and sfc again and getting Source errors. 3 corruptions and the recovery partition only has 33 MBs in use.<strong> TiWorker
</strong>is now corrupted. Checked gpedit, and I'm set to get updates from Windows Update. Sfc and dism are now broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm kind of wondering, which command do you think is causing the recovery partition to be deleted? Also, any other issues anyone out there has noticed?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side Notes: I miss searching directly from Start ( this has been around since the days of Vista ). Better interface for PC's with dedicated video cards, 16 GB RAM, 8 cores, RAID 0, etc. OR just disable themes and set&nbsp;Performance Options to Best.&nbsp;I like the
 see through for the start. Multi-monitor support seems to work, but would like to see the volume controls on the monitor in use, as well as Win+R, etc ( clicking the desktop of the monitor should be enough to tell Win where I want the controls ).&nbsp;When using
 small icons on the taskbar, Cortana can't be set to a box anymore.</p>

            <p>Well I tried an online install, and forgot to mention that when you first log in, it reads "Other User" as the profile name. This is fixed however on a sign-out or restart. Still have the activation issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cloud restored most of my settings, but not the desktop icons ( This PC, Control Panel, and Network ), themes, or service settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time there were no updates except for Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc and dism, and it killed my start menu - also shellExperience is gone again. Removed all apps, still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over all of the clean installs I have tested, so far, java is having major issues with 10041.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'm going to go back to 9926, then have the update installed - see if I can get stable again... i think there's a reason the ISO wasn't released.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: By the way, for the online install part, I think it was too wordy about creating the first account. Might be easier if there were 3 buttons on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Button 1 = Microsoft Account</p>
<p>Button 2 = Work/School Account</p>
<p>Button 3 = Local Account ( can be upgraded to a Microsoft account later&nbsp; )</p>

            <p>So the initial transition from 9926 to 10041 broke my system. I have a SAS RAID 0 configuration, so each time, blanking out and recreating it is a major pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempts to get 10041 to work</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial rollout of 10041 - had both live id and local</li><li>ESD to ISO Clean Install - offline</li><li>ESD to ISO Clean Install - offline, remove all apps via uninstall and powershell</li><li>ESD to ISO Clean Install - online
<ol>
<li>tested new local account without success</li></ol>

<ol>
<li>tested new local account without success</li></ol>
</li><li>Clean 9926 to 10041 by WUapp - online</li></ol>
<p>I cannot achieve stability. Going to attempt to apply the system image I created of 9926.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty serious. The stability of Windows 10 from the start was excellent - it appears things are getting worse.</p>

            <p>Restore Notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems rolling back to 9926 by using the built in recovery feature breaks the start menu. That and my image size is now doubled to 18.8 GB; after chkdsk, cleanmgr, ccleaner, sfc, and dism still. However, using a System Image ( File History | System Image
 ) the recovery works fine.... but after restoring the image, WuApp wants to update me to 10041 again :s</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I was/am totally willing to let Microsoft into my system a good 4+ hours a day Mon-Friday, however, the link to
<strong>contact support </strong>wasn't working :\ So yeah - there's that too :|. I would gladly let any support engineer into my system for trouble shooting and logging.</p>

<h2>            USB flash drives not recognized after update to build 14295</h2>
                    <p>I have tried finding usb drivers to load. The only HP driver I can find is a USB port replicator and it keeps telling me another process is using the setup file then continues to try to install then stops halfway telling me that a install is in progress
 restart my computer to complete it which does not resolve anything. The same thing if I run the trouble shooter for devices it says that it has applied some fixes I need to restart my computer to complete some setups and updates in progress and with a cold
 or warm boot it will tell me the same thing over and over.&nbsp; My iso file is on my flash drive. I have searched for answers to no &nbsp;avail&nbsp;and I do understand things better than I can explain them.</p>

            <p>Hello TLSP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something that&nbsp;usually works when there is a fault with drivers, is to uninstall
<p>
</p><p>When Windows restarts, it should automatically install the correct drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; When you do the uninstall, if prompted - choose to remove those drivers from the system - this will ensure that they will not simply be re-installed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<div>"As per the issue description flash drive (USB 3 device) is not working on your computer after upgrading to Windows 10"</div>
<div><br />
This issue is happening on two Hp 15 notebooks used by two different people we had no problem with he original 10.&nbsp; I just started on the inside program and started getting problems where as hers came&nbsp; outside of the insiders program when windows upgraded with
 the 1511 build.</div>
<div>All windows updates are installed automatically on both our machines</div>
<div><br />
We both have the same drives under the USB device section of the device manager. I will uninstall and reinstall them again on my machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did this and it made made no difference.</div>
<div>After writing this I found on the HP site something about checking the hubs for the amount of power used and allocated while doing so I got a devmgr.xml file is missing error could this cause these problems.&nbsp; I checked the computer in the apartment downstairs
 and they are missing the devmgr file as well.</div>
<div>
<p>I ran sfc /scan now and it said it fixed many things but none of my issues were resolved.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If SFC is unable to resolve the issue, try running the DISM scan and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a new command line tool that you can use to service a Windows image or prepare a Windows PE image. The DISM tool replaces the Package Manager (pkgmgr.exe),

<h2>            Word 2011 &#40;Mac&#41; footnote inconsistencies</h2>
                    Working on a long scientific document (~50 pages) with footnotes and endnotes.&nbsp; Footnotes (to appear at bottom of page) sometimes appear where they're supposed to, sometimes a footnote from four pages ahead appears with a previous one (and is duplicated
 where it is supposed to be).&nbsp; Printing to .pdf usually (but not always) produces correct placement.&nbsp; Saving and re-opening file sometimes (but not always) also corrects problem.&nbsp; Frustrating inconsistencies!<br />
<br />
Have done all software updates 14.1.2 (110505), running Snow Leopard 10.6.7<br />

            Placement of Footnotes is dependent on pagination of the document which is almost a constant process while a document is being revised. That's why you see the correct adjustment when you print or reopen the file. Either process forces re-pagination based
 on the current status. Switching to Draft view then back to Print Layout view also will cause pagination to occur. Although what you're describing isn't 'typical' it isn't unusual either. If you're using Track Changes [or have been using it] with unresolved
 changes existing in the document it will exacerbate the behavior.<br />

            Hi Chetwynd,
<br />I have to say that is the most uninformative message, with no real clues as to the problem. 
<br />
<br />Try using a private browser session - do you get the same error?

<h2>            MS Access Query matching people by skill &#40;mentor&#47;mentee database&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>MS Access Query matching people by skill (mentor/mentee database)?</p>
<p>I have a list of people who can be both mentors and mentees based on their skills listed.
<br />
The table for skills per person is normalized so it has a unique ID, Skill, and Skill Experience level. The aim is to develop a
</p>
<p>query to match a person (linked by Skill_ID) based on reported experience level of "Expert" and "Trainer" level with others in the
</p>
<p>database who report less than trainer experience ie.. "Beginner", "Average", etc.</p>
<p>In practice, the query should for example say that Skill_ID 4 with Excel Expertise can train #6 and #9<br />
While Skill_ID #6 with Access Expertise can train #4 and #9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data is such <br />
| Skill_ID | Skill | Experience |<br />
| 4 | Excel | Trainer |<br />
| 6 | Excel | Beginner |<br />
| 4 | Access | Beginner |<br />
| 6 | Access | Expert |<br />
| 9 | Excel | Average |<br />
| 9 | Access | Beginner |</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking of using wildcard* formula with a conditional filter of Expert for the Mentor and wildcard* with everything else
</p>
<p>like Average and Beginner. Though I have no idea how to approach this design.<br />
This database will contain over 200 skill types which will be selected by a dropdown and the users will define their individual
</p>
<p>experience level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final result will be something like :<br />
| Mentor | Skill | Mentee | Experience |<br />
| 6 | Access | 4 | Beginner |<br />
| 6 | Access | 9 | Beginner |<br />
| 4 | Excel | 6 | Average |<br />
| 4 | Excel | 9 | Beginner |</p>

            You need several tables. You need a people table with an ID. You need a skills table and an experiences table.
<div><br />
<div>You then need a junction table to list each person with their skill and experience.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally you need a query that can match people with a lower experience with someone with a higher experience.</div>

            <p>Hi Zekirifat, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I understand that you are having an issue with browsing Internet and search engine. I will be happy to help you with this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Which search engine are you using?</div>
<div>2) Have you tried with another search engine?</div>
<div>3) Are you searching from the browser's search box, from a toolbar, or by visiting the sites using the address bar?
<div>4) Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to follow the steps from the link and check if the issue persists.</div>

    <title>Want to download OneDrive Pictures to External Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Want to download OneDrive Pictures to External Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the Office 365 with 5 Users, but have only used one. I take a ton of trip pictures and have already filled up the 1 TB allowed. I would like to download all of the pictures to a LARGE Hard Drive attached to my computer, but can't seem to do it.
 I only have a TB of disk space on my computer and I think it might need some of it's space to do the download. I'm just guessing here. Does anyone know how I could download all of the pictures from my One Drive to my external Hard Drive and free up the 1 TB
 of space on my One Drive?</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated, I feel completely stuck here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scott</p>

            Hi ScottTietjen,
<br />
<br />I'm a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd suggest signing into the OneDrive desktop app and during the sign in process choose the external drive as the location for it to create the folder. 
<br />
<br />This will  download your entire OneDrive to the external drive. Then unlink your account from the app,and then you can delete the files from your OneDrive online.
