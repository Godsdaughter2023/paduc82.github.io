<h2>            Outlook for Mac - &#34;a secure connection cannot be established with the server&#34; - verify certificate error</h2>
                    <p>Greetings. I have a question for the group. I have a user that is reporting certificate errors in Outlook for Mac. Turns out, every time he loads Outlook, he is prompted to verify the certificate for the
<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.example.com</a> website. I have found some explanation about it in this support article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3066652/certificate-warning-in-outlook-2016-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3066652/certificate-warning-in-outlook-2016-for-mac</a>, but it does not apply to my scenario since it is a generic website with a self-signed root certificate. For the user standpoint he just wanted to know why this
 is happening and is concerned to hit "Continue" due to security issues. Once he selects "Cancel" he can work with the program without issues until he closes and reopens Outlook for Mac the next time. What puzzles me is the fact that why is that generic website
<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.example.com</a> trying to connect to the server? Here is a screenshot of the prompt:</p>

</p><p>I appreciate your contribution, but the user keeps the workstation with him at his office. I just trying to solve this issue for him. Found some other suggestions online such as delete that particular certificate from the computer's Keychain Access application,
 however every time the person opens Outlook for Mac that <em>Verify Certificate</em> window prompts for validation again. I checked for updates for the Microsoft Outlook for Mac and it was up to today's date - version 15.36 (170702).</p>

            The grey shading is called field shading, not field codes. To turn it off, you can select "Never" in the "Field shading" drop down at File | Options | Advanced.

<h3> ajw_htcone  say:</h3>
<h2>            HTC One M8 &#42;not&#42; Getting Windows 10 Mobile Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Am I the only one that is upset about the not even two year old HTC One M8 not being on the upgrade list? &nbsp;HTC and Microsoft have announced in separate posts that this phone isn't going to get an upgrade. &nbsp;I purchased this phone specifically because it was
 HTC and it had superior specifications to handle any new OS. &nbsp;In fact, I thought things were going great on the Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview especially that its been my daily driver for more than a few months now. &nbsp;Can anyone answer these questions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Why is the Lumia 640 getting an upgrade but not the technically superior HTC One M8?</p>
<p>- If there is a specific reason (ex - 512MB RAM like the Lumia 520) that its not getting an upgrade?</p>
<p>- Was there an insider release to the 14xxx branch that I missed? &nbsp;(still on 10xxx branch / fast ring)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a Samsung Focus on Windows Phone 7.x, upgraded because 8 was released. &nbsp;I had a Lumia 920 on Windows Phone 8.1, upgraded to get a better spec'd device. &nbsp;I currently have an HTC One M8 that I thought was going to get Windows 10 for Phone....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt, after all of the disappointment the last several years, that I will continue to support Microsoft and their Mobile OS. &nbsp;What's the point of Universal apps when you can't run them on your mobile too? &nbsp;What's the point of sticking with 8.x when developers
 are already migrating to UWP exclusively? &nbsp;It's only a matter of time that 8.x is relegated to the same fate that WinMo 6.5 suffered a few years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My future is most likely going to be Android because Apple will NEVER get even a $1 from me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any and all comments, especially answers. &nbsp;This sucks.</p>

            <p>I'm not happy with this issue either and in Nov14 I find myself standing at the counter at a Microsoft Store with two options: the HTC One M8 or the "affordable flagship" 830. Every salesperson that worked with me assured me that the device would be updated
 with anything MS threw at it for 24 months including WP10.&nbsp; The 830 paled to the HTC and I spent the extra $250 or $300 more on this phone just for this reason.&nbsp; I would have held onto my 920 longer and waited for the 950XL if I had seen this coming and I'm
 not sure that would have been any better of an experience for me after watching how that has progressed.&nbsp; I love this phone.</p>
<p>I was on the fast ring for a short period of time with it after Halloween and had to move into the slow ring and I was very concerned with the state of the software then.&nbsp; But it seems to be running fine now.</p>
<p>**** MS?&nbsp; You guys should throw some bones out there for us or ATT should or HTC (well I guess they have made their decision because they're in a crunch).</p>
<p>This isn't right.</p>
<p>So, my dev phone is a 1520 that I got because I can see it without my glasses on.&nbsp; I really like it, but I don't even have a pocket that it will fit in.&nbsp; I can't even see a next cycle coming in products.&nbsp; What am I doing now?....</p>
<p>As the builds get beefier it looks like your going to surpass the current gen pretty quickly.&nbsp; Hope I can make calls on my surface.&nbsp; I can put my head under it when it rains.</p>
<p>My 4 phone hobby just became a not cost effective to continue business.</p>
<p>You guys have to help us!&nbsp;</p>

            I agree, an explanation is needed here! I bought the HTCone M8 only because Microsoft promised me that they would upgrade it. I feel betrayed and abused here, I'm beginning to have nothing to say when People make cracks about Microsoft screwing over their
 customers. This is ridiculous and from what I've seen it's entirely on Microsofts side! HTC has said that they would provide the update as soon as they could!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm feeling really torn here, I went with an unpopular Phone OS... I didn't get a lot of things that others have, because I wanted to believe in this. Microsoft owes this to us, or at least an explanation? They can't make this promise and then just go back
 on it, it's not right.&nbsp;

            <p>I couldn't agree more.&nbsp; I love Windows Mobile.&nbsp; Love my M8.&nbsp; I also bought this under the assumption that&nbsp;a flagship phone only a year ago would be supported for at least 24 months.&nbsp; Geez.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still a beautiful piece of hardware, and a great way to show off WP 10...</p>

            I saw a post on Windows Central that indicated that HTC needed to pay for carrier testing in order to have this phone upgraded to Windows 10 Production. &nbsp;HTC is currently in financial trouble and for an unfortunately small user base with M8 for Windows
 devices, I can see it from their point of view. &nbsp;What they fail to realize is that one customer usually has family, friends, etc. that can now recommend some other manufacturer. &nbsp;Its a shame.

            <p>I had a back and forth chat with HTC customer service today and they refused to acknowledge that they have a 24 month software support guarantee.&nbsp; She kept telling me they only have a 12 month warrantee.&nbsp; I pointed out that all of the HTC phones have this
 and even directed her to the Android page where there is a flow chart showing the 24 month HTC software support program.&nbsp; They used to have this same diagram for Windows.&nbsp; I was asking for any help, compensation, management contact...anything that could help
 me out of this situation.&nbsp; First she blamed MS for the issue, then ATT&nbsp;and I told her that MS develops and sends out to them for carrier testing.&nbsp; She totally disagreed and said that they never stated that this was their program.&nbsp; I pointed out the original
 carrier brochure on the M8 stated to the contrary and she just kept apologizing but finally literally just hung up on me.</p>
<p>Then I thought, I'll go over and talk to ATT because I have insurance on the phone.&nbsp; That didn't go so well either because the only thing they would replace me with is an A9 running Marshmellow.&nbsp; Then I talked to ATT because the insurance carrier said I
 was eligible for an upgrade.&nbsp; They sent my over to the buy one iPhone get one free or same promo on an S6.&nbsp; Wow, that's another expensive&nbsp;hobby.</p>
<p>Then I see the surface phone rumored out for between $700 and $1200 in October.&nbsp; Sounds expensive.</p>
<p>I've had an AOL account since 1994 and they wrote me yesterday to tell me that I would no longer be able to sync with MS mobile and here are every other mobile operating system that you can move over to.&nbsp; I can get it other places but....</p>
<p>So, none of the people that took my $600+ 15 months ago can help me.&nbsp; How is that?&nbsp; Totally not fair!</p>
<p>Um, I'm beginning to feel like we're breaking up.&nbsp; I love my OS.&nbsp; No, I don't like HTC anymore.&nbsp; I'm not having any problems with .164.&nbsp; I can take more!&nbsp; I just feel like fanboy is not your demographic anymore.&nbsp; I'm still using Microsoft Bob!&nbsp; Help Us!</p>
<p>I've still got my 1520 that is larger than my head but I guess that is all I have left and it sad faced me on a clean install into the slow ring.&nbsp; Just a matter of time for that little/big guy.</p>
<p>I'm sad facing too. :(</p>

            <p>I got my HTC One M8 through my company almost exactly one year ago. Nobody else I knew was using Windows phone, but I was swayed by the excitement for the upcoming Windows 10 and Microsoft's promise of universal upgradeability. HTC and Verizon also touted
 that the phone would be eligible for the next version of Windows when available. My IT person cautioned me about the lack of apps, but since this was a business phone I wasn't too concerned, and figured the situation would improve once W10 launched, which
 I expected by fall 2015. Besides, I was optimistic about Microsoft's new management and vision, the HTC looked like a solid piece of hardware from a company that seemed to understand the potential of Windows phone, and I could not ask for a better carrier
 than Verizon. With these three industry stalwarts behind me, what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One suspenseful year later, Windows Upgrade Advisor tells me without further explanation or qualification that my still shiny, more than capable phone cannot be upgraded. I suppose I can continue to use it as a basic communication device for another year,
 but I wonder what I will think of Microsoft when I go to choose my next phone, or what I will say to my IT person when he asks me what I think now of my decision.</p>

            <p>There has to be something we can do, this is a great phone, </p>
<p>to let it just become obsolete is an insult to the People who built it. We at least need answers... and we should get a voluntary upgrade option or something.</p>

            I don't have any answers, but I went to the AT&amp;T store today to beg and plead on anything they could do for me. &nbsp;I'm still at least 12 months away from my payments on Next being completed. &nbsp;The store was helpful, listened to my issue, and did everything
 they could to help. &nbsp;The options given to me weren't the best, but within what they could do at the store. &nbsp;I ended up getting an Asus Zenfone 2E pre-paid go-phone (Android unfortunately). &nbsp;It will suit my needs for work well enough until I'm out of my Next
 payment plan. &nbsp;Not ideal, but I'm still holding some hope that HTC will just let Microsoft push Windows 10 OTA (since Insider Preview works!) without any firmware updates. &nbsp;Radio stack in Windows 10 is separate from the kernel anyway, so its not like the carrier
 will have issues. &nbsp;I really hope that someone from Microsoft provides some answers here.

            <p>So, I got a call today from HTC "Special Projects."&nbsp; It was a frustrating call because English was not the caller's first language.&nbsp; She never said where she was from, but I suspect Philippines.&nbsp; No big deal, we got through it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She said she was calling regarding the chat session that I talked about&nbsp;here from Friday and wanted to know about the survey that I posted about the chat that came up afterward.&nbsp; I basically stated that I would not be purchasing another HTC product ever
 and wished them luck in layoff season beginning shortly after Christmas.&nbsp; Never gave them my phone number either.&nbsp; So, I guess&nbsp;my carrier&nbsp;gave them my number?...or the NSA...or China!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anywho, Mae also came prepared with specific info on the One M8 and why I was in this situation.&nbsp; She said that HTC was not receiving W10M from MS and that it was not their fault that MS had made this decision not to release (specifically) to HTC.&nbsp; She also
 told me that HTC has no information regarding a 24 month upgrade program for Windows Phones and that she was "sorry that I had gotten mis-information from a third-party website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not true!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their website posted their software update program for all of their phones in November 2014.&nbsp; No where on that site did it say anything about Windows not included.&nbsp; This product was sold as being ready for W10M from both MS and ATT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone can link to last week's article quoting HTC VP Marketing stating that the expense associated with updating the phone through carrier testing to such a small base of users was not cost effective in the scheme of things.&nbsp; Moving forward he said
 their focus was on Vive and Android Phones.&nbsp; I can't, I'm supposed to be working.</p>
<p>I would like anyone at Microsoft to come out and say what the issue is.&nbsp; HTC is already out there with "we can't afford it."&nbsp; MS should back that up or......did MS refuse this because there is something wrong with the phone?&nbsp; Is MS mad because HTC has walked
 away from Windows?&nbsp; What is the problem with this phone or why is this phone being left out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone screwed up and I paid way more for this phone than the 830 based on the information at the time.&nbsp; ATT offered to buy my M8 back for (get ready!) $40.&nbsp; That's not even enough to buy the amount of **** that I need to end all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the very least I should be able to go back to the Microsoft Store or my carrier and get a deal on whatever the next thing is that gets me back on track.&nbsp; I can't develop squat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not fair!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the conversation Mae asked me if I would consider an HTC Windows Phone in the future?&nbsp; No and never but I told her that if HTC needed feedback on how this device is performing with either 8.1 or .164, I'd be happy to help.&nbsp; Its a good phone
 and I'm sad that I'm not moving forward with it.&nbsp; I only had 2 phones left in the group.&nbsp; Now I'm down to 1.&nbsp; Am I starting over?</p>

            Well, I too bought into the MS scam. I have been a MS supporter for over 30 years. It's a shame that they cannot pull their heads out of their a$$ on this one. I wish that they would **** or get off the pot on the mobile OS. They continue to disappoint
 all those that support them.

            Really, you too? &nbsp;Is this really meant to be a helpful comment or just making you feel important? &nbsp;You guys all have nothing to do other than be smart asses? &nbsp; I have red tape from government to get through just to be able to take care of a patient and
 someone, just like one of you, locked the form and no longer works here. &nbsp;That's the reason I needed to ask the question. &nbsp;But...you can bet one thing for sure, my Macintosh does a much better job and I have never been spoken to in this way when asking a question.
 &nbsp;I do hope that you all feel you are much better than most people today, since you have to make some look bad in order to look good. &nbsp;If I saw you eye to eye I am sure you would not be so brave. &nbsp;One day you will display that attitude and perhaps someone will
 teach you a very valuable lesson. &nbsp;Obviously your mothers didn't teach you how to act or treat people. &nbsp;

    <title>How to get Win 10 calendar data from PC to phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james099  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get Win 10 calendar data from PC to phone</h2>
                    <p><span>I have recently upgraded my PC to Win 10 pro from Win 8.1 pro; I am running Win 8.1 on my Nokia 521 phone. I find the Windows 10 calendar somewhat improved over the 8.1 version. I think I might be
 able to use it and retire my Palm except for one thing: the communication between the desktop and the phone is quite sporadic. I am long retired and do virtually all my work at the desktop, so I rarely use the phone for any sort of data entry, but I do rely
 on it when I am “out and about”. </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>It seems to me that if I connect the phone to the desktop via USB any changes to the desktop calendar should be communicated to the phone and vice versa. I don’t think this is happening. When communication
 between the two does take place it appears that MS is doing through the cloud at their convenience.
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Is there some way that I can control the communication between the PC and the phone? With the Palm it merely takes the press of a button (assuming the two are connected via USB).</span></p>

            <p>You apparently have different accounts on 10 and the phone or used another account type on 10.</p>
<p>The purpose of having and using one Microsoft account is to share information and make it available across your different devices so that connecting or syncing the actual device is not necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what is used for Windows 10 so I will give a link to that forum, accounts section to ask there what would be best to do. Don't know what the two accounts you have are used for.</p>
<p>The Microsoft account on the phone and Windows 10 should be a Hotmail, live or outlook.com account. On the windows 10 forum describe the account you have setup on 10.</p>

            Thanks for your prompt response. I thought I was dealing with only the MS account, but I'll confess I really am not up to speed on the business of accounts. (I'm from the day of one person-one PC.) Thanks for the reference - I'll look into it further in
 a day or so.

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you go into Safe Mode / Minimal on your own computer, if you are running the Newer Insider Builds including Skip Ahead, because all Safe Mode / Minimal have the same errors. And you can see for yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start does not open by Mouse or Keyboard Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that others don't use Safe Mode / Minimal, otherwise, it would not be broken for about 6 Builds and No Category for Safe Mode in the Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can right-click Start and have that Menu open up.</p>

<h2>            Ovi Maps Challenge won&#39;t operate</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed a new app: Ovi Maps Challenge, but it will not play.&nbsp; Every attempt to open it results in a mesage that "This app requires Flash Lite 3.&nbsp; Install it or latest phone software.&nbsp; Update now?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have selected "Update Now" at least 4 times...and after less than a minute, I receive the message that "All apps are up to date."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have turned the phone completely off twice, in an attempt to "reboot" it, but still get the same above messages.&nbsp; I have also opened the Nokia Ovi Suite (2.2.1.23) on my PC, with the Nuron 5230 connected, but that merely confirms that my version of the
 Suite and the Nuron software are both up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to get Ovi Maps Challenge to function (and / or update Flash Lite 3)?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is it really not possible to print out in Microsoft Outlook and select "fit sheet on one page" ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really is annoying that you always have to use Snipping tool to "take a picture" of your e-mails and paste that to Word in order to print out an e-mail and having all the content on one page. Or just even to make all the content appear at all !</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this can be done in Excel and other Microsoft software, why isn't this possible in Outlook?</p>
<p>

                    I'm using PowerPoint 2007. My company's presentation template uses a green arrow for first-level bullets, and I want to be able to apply that green arrow style as needed. Problem is that the green arrow style is available in the Bullets and Numbering dialog

<br />
So you want it available for text boxes as well as for placeholders? I take it you have used the custom bullet style on the 'mother' master (the big one at the top of the masters)?<br />

<h3> masterminduser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 has no way to shut off these redundant tabs and tab bar. Now showing a tab and a window, which takes up 2 lines of room. How to shut off&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    I use Windows 7 and currently am trying out Internet Explorer 11. I am VERY unimpressed and find it to be yet another time Microsoft has ignored 50% of it's user base. My primary issue is that "tabs" are supposed to save space, yet for me they redundantly use it up more.    Let's examine. You open an instance of IE 11 and a window opens both below and a tab opens above. Now I absolutely HATE TABS with a passion, just like everyone I know, but I'm trying to give IE one last chance. So I have a tab at the top (taking up screen space all the way across the bar) and a toolbar at the bottom which has to be there displaying my clock, active icons, and MY OPEN IE WINDOW! REDUNDANCY!!!! You just cost me 2 lines of screen space and I haven't even begun to open more than 1 window with 1 "space saving" tab which I never asked for nor want to use!!   Now, the first question is, HOW do we remove the use of tabs?   WHY does IE NEVER provide customization of the font size, color, and placement of that di

            <p>&nbsp;Excellent rant! Feel better? OK, just FYI, IE11 was designed by very-talented coders for Touchscreen computers, then a version re-coded for 'Smartphones'. Not their fault; they were shackled by up-the-chain-of-command constraints (including the infamous
 MS "Immersive" experience, gaack!). IE11 often hoses on W8.1 PCs with basic mouse/trackpad (no touchscreen), so don't feel left-out... you are not the only UNhappy MS customer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;You can check out the following 'MS Support' (ha ho ho) link:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/answers?tId=c5c8d632-0f9a-4fda-80b9-f51a7e67300d</p>
<p>just for further laughs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Or... i recommend you just do not use Internet Explorer "at-all"; especially not in your 'antique' Windows 7. [ Yes, DO retain W7 for as long as possible; good for you!.. just realize that MS is slowly 'changing' your OS to be more-like-W8.1 with some of
 the Updates that come along for W7 (and there ain't nuthing you can do 'bout that cute stuff). ]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Just install Firefox and live happy...&nbsp; [ Chrome is actually an OS pretending to be a web-browser; one should NEVER allow Chrome in a MS Windows PC.&nbsp; Just sayin' ] *Cannot wait to see if the latter stirs up some Google-nuts...</p>

<h2>            PHONE MEMORY or SIM card</h2>
                    When my last phone went into the pool i lost all my contacts because i didn't know to copy the contacts from phone memory to sim card<br />
Now with my new phone I know to do that but doing so created a big mess double entries etc. trying to fix it - move instead of copy caused entries to separate ( where a contact JIM, had general phone, mobile and street address I end up with JIM, JIM1 and JIM2
 with general phone in one mob in the next and address in the last)<br />
If I move (not copy) the contacts from phone memory to sim card PC suite sees no contacts as it can't see the sim card.<br />
<br />
I guess the way to go is keep all contacts in phone memory and back up regularly to PC??

            yes , that is the best way, SIM card is pretty simple and thus it makes such entries in copy. (or at least the old SIM card are, mine is from 1997 and I do not store anything there.<br />
<br />
Since contacts are most likely the most valuable content to you too, I recommend:<br />
- make a backup with PC Suite regularly<br />
- additionally synchronise your contacts to Outlook or Outlook Express (Windows Address Book) to be sure, if for example the restore of the bakcup file should fail in the future

            Thank you, Mohan, for the reply to my issue. <br />
To reply to your questions:<br />
<br />
1. Both times it happened it has been to the first page of my newsletter. <br />
<br />
Some history: I publish a monthly newsletter that is 8-12 pages long using Word for Mac 2011. I use Print Layout View for the Header and Footer and switch to Publishing Layout View for the remainder of the document. For purposes of saving time, I will use a
 previous month's newsletter and delete the text boxes that don't apply to create the new document. This problem happened last winter and I couldn't figure out what was happening. I tried different things. I made sure that there were no underlying text boxes,
 etc. Eventually, I uninstalled Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 and re-installed it.
<br />
Yesterday the same thing happened with a newsletter I was working on for this month. When I opened it in the morning to work on it, the text box on the left side of the page appeared enlarged across the page partially covering the text box on the right of the
 page. And the text was missing. I am always able to select the text box and re-size it and the text will reappear. But it gets frustrating to have to do this every time I open the newsletter to work on it.<br />
<br />
2. This does not happen to all of my Word 2011 for Mac documents. <br />
<br />
I created a test document as you suggested and did not have the same problem. I do have a problem of text disappearing from text boxes and then reappearing when I either click in another text box and then go back to the empty one or perform some other manipulation.
 That particular problem happens frequently while I work on my newsletter. Today it happened right before my eyes while I was reading something in my inbox with the Word document open alongside it. I wasn't even touching the keyboard and the text disappeared.
<br />
<br />
Is there some kind of corruption going on?

<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br /> Click Start, and type "cmd". 
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator. 
<br />- Copy and paste the below one line at a time, pressing enter each time: 
<br />netsh winsock reset - and press Enter. 
<br />netsh int ip reset - and press Enter. 
<br />ipconfig /release - and press Enter. 
<br />ipconfig /renew - and press Enter. 
<br />ipconfig /flushdns - and press Enter 
<br />
<br />You could also try resetting your DNS service with the following steps: 
<br />- Press Windows Key+R and type "services.msc" and press OK. 
<br />- Scroll down to find DNS Client. 
<br />- Right-click it and click Restart. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, see if resetting your Hosts file to default fixes the issue:

            I'm using my gmail account. On a different computer, a net book, I set up the reminders to text my former cell phone with calendar updates. Well, I"m using a different laptop, I now have office 2010 and for some reason, every day, I get this error message
 in the email.
<div><br />
<div>How do I access the settings area that I must have used to set-this up? The new office 2010 is new to me and I can't find the options.</div>

<div>Will that help me get rid of this ?</div>

            I have this problem whenever I reply to an email by clicking on the hyperlink address from another email. Then it blocks any email I try to send to that email address no matter if I type it out or reply to a received email. I've gone through the junk mail
 options, the safe sender options. Nothing has helped in anyway. I'm using outlook express 2010 on windows 7. Please help!<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have the same internet setup, I have no reason to think that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buying Office 2016 instead of 365 likely&nbsp;would <strong>not</strong> fix the problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, both are now running (or NOT!) in "Click to Run" virtual environments (don't get me started on that rant ... &lt;grin&gt; ).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first issue was probably caused by accidentally hitting shortcut keys to swap the
<strong>Office</strong> keyboard language. It was very frustrating the first time I encountered it.&nbsp; Took a long time to figure out (no Answers forum back then) The simplest fix I found for that is to uninstall French language support from Office since I don't
 use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other people have complained about Office 365 "disappearing" from Windows 10.&nbsp; Personally, I strongly suspect that there are a number of bad interactions between Office 2016/365 and Windows 10. But that is an unsupported theory, just a guess.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly what do you mean Office has "disappeared" from your computer.&nbsp; Explain what you see and what you expect to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you still Office 365 in the Control Panel?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, the first thing I would try is go to the Start menu and type "Word" in the search window and hit &lt;enter&gt;.&nbsp; Does Word start?&nbsp; In that case Office is still installed on your computer. Normally, doing an Office Repair would reset the shortcuts
 and start menu entries associated with Office.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Repair apparently did not fix your problem, the next thing to try is doing uninstall and re-install.&nbsp; Re-install, especially with 365, should be a fairly trivial effort.&nbsp; Rather than depending on constantly re-downloading Office during re-installs,
 you may want to download the "Offline installer" (see link below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first thing to try would be uninstall from control panel, and re-install.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then use the appropriate Fix-it tool to uninstall and re-install.</p>

<p>thanks for all the tips - I'll save them for another time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I eventually talked to a microsoft support person who uninstalled then reinstalled and found the 'hiding' program pieces of 365. &nbsp;Everything seems to be working well now - WHEW!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete windows.old and other setup folders after build 9860</h2>
                    <p>Starting with Windows 7 and going through the previous build of Windows 10,&nbsp;I have always been able to delete the Windows.old folder and the other folders created by an upgrade (such as $Windows.~BT). After upgrade to build 9860, that is no longer the case.
 Tells me I need permission from SYSTEM. Also, there is now a "RecoverImage" folder which takes just over 5GB. This is going to present problems to those of us with smaller SSDs (e.g. mine is 60GB)&nbsp;as system partitions in that they are going to fill up quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest making the installation/upgrade program choose an appropriate drive for the Windows.old and other upgrade folders, like the Microsoft Office installation routine does for the Microsoft Office Installation cache. I have&nbsp;2 TB of space just
 sitting there ready to be used, but the Windows 10 installer wants to put everything on my 60GB SSD. I now have less than 14 GB free which means the next build won't even install.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following suggestions that can work for both online videos on voot.com and twitter as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Many websites use <em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">add-ons</a></strong></em> to play video or audio files. If videos on a
 site won't play correctly in Internet&nbsp;Explorer you might need to install an add-on. Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure you're not using InPrivate Browsing. InPrivate Browsing might block info or add-ons that a video program needs in order to play properly.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Install any necessary add-ons. Often, the website that you'd like to watch a video on will let you know which add-on you need to install. Some common add-ons used for playing video are Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, or QuickTime. To learn more about
 using add-ons in Internet&nbsp;Explorer, read <strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage add-ons in Internet&nbsp;Explorer</a></em></strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Some websites might appear blank or might not display correctly in Internet&nbsp;Explorer. For example, portions of a webpage might be missing, or colors and text might be incorrect. Some pages might not display at all. If a portion
 of a page is blank or doesn't display correctly, try one or more of these options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Turn on <strong>Compatibility View</strong>. Learn how by reading <em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use Compatibility View</a></strong></em>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Turn off Tracking Protection for a single website. Learn how by reading <em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/use-tracking-protection#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use Tracking Protection</a></strong></em>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Turn off hardware acceleration. To turn off hardware acceleration, open Internet&nbsp;Explorer for the desktop, click the
<span><strong>Tools</strong></span> button, and then click <strong><span>Internet options</span></strong>. Click the
<span><strong>Advanced</strong></span> tab, select <strong><span>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering</span></strong>, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>. You must close and reopen Internet&nbsp;Explorer for changes to take effect.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Edge is available only in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>Hi R-Van,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The error code shows there is no internet connection, you could check&nbsp; OneDrive in a different network environment, maybe try it in your cell phone using digital data.<br />
</p>
<p>Besides, could you access SharePoint online?<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf6e7463-129c-48ee-9340-fc5596bb4c96?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf6e7463-129c-48ee-9340-fc5596bb4c96?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
Thanks,&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem with my internet connection.<br />
I have access to my onedrive online too.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55f2dec7-7d15-473a-8015-6e998a6f625e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55f2dec7-7d15-473a-8015-6e998a6f625e?upload=true" /></a>*</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was probably not clear: This error code is new and come since the re-installation of onedrive on my PC.<br />
It appears when i try to link my OneDrive Folder on my PC to OneDrive in the cloud (see below)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ce24566-3aac-46d7-ae00-7144c282de9a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ce24566-3aac-46d7-ae00-7144c282de9a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have access to Share point too (and also to the Share point admin page):&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94cb8744-ac85-41b7-a8d1-340428396a6d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94cb8744-ac85-41b7-a8d1-340428396a6d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know if it is linked nor if it is important but I've seen that my profile in Office 365 is empty. I'm not sure it was so originally.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7adc479b-cb0c-445e-bcfc-c5a58f157fac?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7adc479b-cb0c-445e-bcfc-c5a58f157fac?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping that all these print screens will clarify the problem and help in its resolution</p>

<p>To try to be more precise:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The problem this morning was (and still is) that I did not have (and still do not have) access to OneDrive Admin to authorize the upload of shared files (see: https://docs.microsoft.com / en-us / onedrive / manage-sharing)<br />
</li><li>The additional problem after reinstalling OneDrive is that there is no more synchronization with the PC folder. I am asked to login (email + password) and I get the error message.<br />
</li><li>It could be that i've done a wrong manipulation in this area (i went on this page yesterday)&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5480332e-37b3-42b0-bfef-e03586349ab7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5480332e-37b3-42b0-bfef-e03586349ab7?upload=true" /></a></li></ul>

<p>Hi R-Van,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing, the last image you shared shows you don't have permission to your OneDirve, click Manage Parent, until you see a page like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/825caef4-5f9d-4339-8c9b-4af34fc75df9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/825caef4-5f9d-4339-8c9b-4af34fc75df9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Then click Grant Permissions and add your account.<br />
<br />
Thanks,&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Angelova,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The last error message for which I had not sent a screenshot yet (because it's in French (*)) is this:
<br />
<br />
<em>(*) Although, I do not understand why some pages are in French and others in English while my Office 365 is installed in English.</em><br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1405064-3e0c-49f8-bb37-13be2ec1a27f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1405064-3e0c-49f8-bb37-13be2ec1a27f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><em>"Access denied You must be an administrator." Disconnect and try again with an administrator account) "</em></p>
<p>I receive this message when I try to connect to my Onedrive admin page.<br />
This is the beginning of all my search for solution (and the origin of all my following problems I fear)
</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for the time spent helping others ... !!!<br />
