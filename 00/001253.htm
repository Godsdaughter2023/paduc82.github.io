<h2>            Use VBA SaveCopyAs to save to Sharepoint URL</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>Is there a way of using the VBA statement ActiveWorkbook.SaveCopyAs to save files to a Sharepoint URL? I have tried this but get runtime error 1004 "we couldn't find [location]". This happens when I use the path ActiveWorkbook.Path (the active workbook
 being saved in Sharepoint) or if I type out the full path name (http:// etc).</div>
<div>The only way I can get round it is by specifying the location on my c:\ where I have mapped the Sharepoint address. This is fine for when I am using a synced PC, but means that it won't work from a different workstation.</div>
<div>I'm using Excel 2013.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Chris</div>
<div><br />

                </div>

<h2>            One Drive and One Drive for business Not Signing in</h2>
                    <p>hi there,</p>
<p>i have been searching for a solution for almost 2 weeks now.</p>
<p>i have windows 10 single license.</p>
<p>office 2016 (office 365) installed.</p>
<p>one drive for business connected as well as one drive (personal account)..</p>
<p>it worked perfectly and then just all of a sudden stopped working.</p>
<p>i have reinstalled office, uninstalled and re-downloaded office and installed office, removed the one drive cache's, removed all the saved credentials from credential manager. and still the problem presist.</p>
<p>one drive does not connect, </p>
<p>i enter my email accounts on both one drive and one drive for business, and when you click next or just press enter, nothing happens.(it stays the same for both one drive accounts.)</p>
<p>it just stays in the screen like below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0d9620a-4645-42d3-bcd9-dbd85a2b5d97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0d9620a-4645-42d3-bcd9-dbd85a2b5d97" /></a></p>
<p>everything else on my o365 does work, and i can sign into both accounts for one drive via web browsers.</p>
<p>have anyone encountered this issue before, and know how to resolve this issue?</p>

<p>Hi Barend,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. Which situation below was from your side before this issue?<br />
<strong>Situation</strong> 1. You use the sync client in Office 365 ProPlus to sync your OneDrive for Business library. Use the OneDrive to sync your personal account.<br />
<strong>Situation</strong> 2. You use the OneDrive sync client to sync both work/school account and personal Microsoft account.<br />
To determine which sync client you are using, see this article.</p>
<p>2.What do you mean by “a sudden stopped working”? Are there any error messages (e.g. credential needed issue)? If yes, please capture some screenshots of the message.
<br />
3.How do you get the sign in pop-up (the screenshot in your post), when you click Sync button in the cloud or it automatically appear?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, the OneDrive in Windows 10 is also<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> the new sync client
 of OneDrive for Business</a>. It can be used to sync both consumer OneDrive and OneDrive for Business. Please follow the steps below to reinstall it.<br />
a. Log into your Windows system as Administrator &gt; open command prompt &gt; type <strong>
taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe</strong>&gt;click Enter button.<br />
b. For 64-bit Windows, type <strong>%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall</strong> to uninstall OneDrive (For 32-bit Windows, replace
<strong>SysWOW64</strong> to <strong>system32</strong>)<br />
c. Access this path: C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive and empty all documents and folders.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>:Please firstly back up the important files.<br />
d. Reinstall OneDrive via this URL: <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reinstallation, firstly sign into OneDrive with your personal Microsoft account, and then right click the white OneDrive icon&gt;<strong>Settings&gt;Account&gt;Add a business account</strong>&gt;enter your work/school account. Check if it works well with both
 two accounts.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: If you choose to use OneDrive to sync your OneDrive for Business library, the legacy OneDrive for Business cannot sync the same library any more.
</p>
<p>Let us know some updates when you have time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>Good day Tim,</p>
<p>Situation 2 applies to me.</p>
<p>And I have provided the screenshot in my 1st post, there are no errors, if you click next, nothing happens..</p>
<p>I get the Popup when on Login and as a notification on my taskbar that credentials is required for one drive and one drive for business.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I will follow your re-installation steps and get back to you.</p>

<p>Hi Barend,</p>
<p>OK. Just post back if you have any updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if the issue persists after reinstallation, you can try removing the OneDrive credentials to check the outcome.<br />
a.Right-click OneDrive icon on the task bar&gt;<strong>Settings&gt;Account&gt;Unlink OneDrive</strong> (for both personal and work/school account).<br />
b.Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>&gt;search for <strong>Credential Manager&gt;Windows Credentials</strong>&gt;remove all the
<strong>OneDrive cached credentials</strong>.<br />
c.Restart your computer and re-run OneDrive, sign into it with your personal and work/school account.<br />
d.Check if both accounts can be synced well.</p>
<p>We appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has now become an ARRAY formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT((B3:B102&lt;=QUARTILE(IF(E3:E102="ABC",B3:B102),1))*(E3:E102="ABC")*(C3:C102&gt;B3:B102))</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

            <p>In Mike's formula, you need to replace 1 with 3 and &lt; with &gt;.&nbsp; 3 will calculate 75 percentile and &gt; will consider only those values which are above 75 percentile. Above 75 percentile means top 25%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, the formula will become</p>

    <title>MS 10 Upgrade from 8.1 pro failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ernst alexandre  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS 10 Upgrade from 8.1 pro failure</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Dell XPS8500 from MS 8.1 pro to 10. I use this machine to work remotely providing consulting services to financial institutions in the US East Coast. After completion of the installation, the machine rebooted and prompted me to "press alt ctrl
 del" to login. Upon following that instruction, the screen shows circling dots and instead of taking me to a screen where to enter my user name &amp; password, it goes back to the prompt to press "alt ctrl del". It's been in that state since. I've rebooted, power
 recycled the machine many times with no result. Any idea on how to resolve this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must also state that the upgrade on my Surface Pro 3 went very smoothly. I thought it would have been the same experience for the PCs. The first one I did went bad. I will have to stop other people to migrate until this is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</p><p><strong>Method </strong>: I suggest you to do a startup repair using the Windows 10 installation media and check if it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link&nbsp;to create Windows 10 ISO:</p>

<li>
<p>Insert the USB drive or DVD and restart your PC. If you’re using recovery media, skip the next step.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Install Windows</span> page, select <span><strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</span> (If you’re not seeing this page, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check out info from your PC manufacturer on how to change boot order and
 then try again.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Choose an option</span> screen, select <span><strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options </strong>&gt; <strong>Startup Repair</strong>. Follow the onscreen instructions and if you can boot the computer to desktop.</span></p>
</li></ol>

            No. First, the macro facility changed radically between Access 2007 and 2010. Second, when doing any sort of development work that will be used by others, that development NEEDS to be done in lowest version that there are users. If some of your users are
 on 2007, then ALL development/design work needs to be done with 2007.&nbsp;

<p>I tried this several times but when I reopen the data list, none of the changes show up. &nbsp;I even tried to make a new mailing list, everything worked fine on it however I could not fix the double spacing it was doing so parts of the last line were only partially
 there. &nbsp;Also, if I unchecked a recipient, so that a mailing list would not be made, it would not work. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, if you mean that you created a new mail merge main document, then the issue is with the formatting of the paragraphs in that document and you need to adjust the paragraph format so that the Line spacing is set to Single and so that there is no space
 before or after the paragraphs.</p>

    <title>Lumia 950XL hotspot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greglush  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950XL hotspot</h2>
                    <p>Purchased device from the MSFT store, possibly a big mistake.&nbsp; Everything on the device works great
<strong>EXCEPT the hotspot</strong>.&nbsp; When enabled (and it connects perfectly to my Surface Book) to the ATT network and errors with a message that it cannot find my data account.&nbsp; The same plan worked great on the Nokia 640 and ATT has checked and double checked
 my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that possibly the SIM APN settings may not be set properly for ATT, or not at all.&nbsp; Oddly, ATT states that they do not know the settings and not surprisingly MSFT says the same thing.&nbsp; So what to do, $650 phone that neither party wants to help
 get the hotspot functional, very disappointing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any thoughts on settings for the ATT network and the 950XL?</p>

            <p>Hi - I have a slightly different problem that may be related.&nbsp; I stop being able to connect to sites on the internet with my 950XL (from my PC using the Mobile Hotspot).&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; After more investigation, I found out the 950XL loses its DNS functionality
 (talk about a lack of MS testing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix I use is open your <em>Network and Sharing Center </em>(one way to get there is through Control&nbsp; Panel), click on your
<em>Internet Connection</em> (It will display with the green vertical bars followed by
<em>WiFi </em>and your <em>SSID </em>name).&nbsp; Then click on <em>Properties </em>(must have Admin rights), and then click on
<em>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</em>.&nbsp; Change from <em>Obtain DNS Server automatically
</em>to<em> Use the following DNS server</em> and I use 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 which are Googles public DNS servers (thank you Google!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I can actually use the Mobile Hotspot on the 950XL.&nbsp; Kind of sucks that MS can't get their act together (to say nothing of Visual Voice Mail doesn't work with ATT on the 950XL - you can use a 3rd party app ISeeVM but then you are sharing all your (confidential)
 voice mail with a third party - don't know the company behind it).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Clock is counting.&nbsp; Keep the 950XL if MS fixes within the 30 day timeframe or I'm afraid I will move back to an Android :(</p>

<p>I have a completely unlocked 950XL and I have the same problem. My account is an AT&amp;T Go Phone account which used to be on an unlocked and non-AT&amp;T branded Android phone and mobile hotspot always worked. After I switched to the 950XL, hotspot stopped working
 with the familiar message that I didn't have a data plan, etc. AT&amp;T couldn't figure out what was wrong. I used the method outlined by Charles above and downloaded the Interop tools in developer mode to modify the registry, worked without a hitch and the hotspot
 is now working! So it seems like the issue is on the MS side.</p>
<br />
1. Download the Interop Tools for Windows 10 Mobile and follow the instructions to get it installed:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/interop-tools-windows-10-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.windowscentral.com/interop-tools-windows-10-mobile</span></a><br />
<p>To install Interop Tools, you first need to have your phone in developer mode to accept side loading of AppX files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Settings</li><li>Update &amp; security</li><li>For developers</li></ol>
<p>From the <strong>Use developer features</strong> area choose <strong>Developer mode</strong> and accept the warning. Once again, your phone does not need to be interop unlocked to install this tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you have downloaded the AppX file you can open the file directly in Outlook (if emailed it to yourself) or use
<strong>File Explorer</strong> to navigate to where you download it to on your device (usually
<strong>Downloads</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Tapping on the AppX will give you a messaging asking if you want to install the file. Select
<strong>install</strong> from the dialog menu.</p>
<p>Interop Tools will not show up as an app on your device. Instead, it is found under Extras.</p>
<ol>
<li>Settings</li><li>Extras (at the bottom; you may have a nested Extras to tap again)</li><li>Select <strong>Interop Tools</strong> from the list</li></ol>
<p>2. Edit the registry settings as noted by user&nbsp;<strong>imbushuo Wang</strong> on the Windows Central forums here:&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.windowscentral.com/microsoft-lumia-950-xl/414723-mobile-hotspot-tethering-950xl.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://forums.windowscentral.com/microsoft-lumia-950-xl/414723-mobile-hotspot-tethering-950xl.html</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open Interop Tools for Windows 10 Mobile. Find it in Settings &gt; Extras.</span></li><li><span>Open registry editor and enter the following&nbsp;:<br />
<strong>Registry&nbsp;Hive:</strong>&nbsp;(select)&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />
<span><strong>Registry Type: </strong><em>(select)&nbsp;</em>String<br />
<strong>Registry Key Path:</strong> S</span>ystem\ControlSet001\Services\icssvc\Settings<br />
<strong>Registry Value Name:</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>EntitlementRequired<br />
<strong>Registry Value Data: </strong>0</li><li>Tap<strong> Write Data</strong></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;</span>DedicatedConnections in<strong> Registry Value Name </strong>
<em>field</em></li><li><em>Tap&nbsp;<strong>Read Data</strong></em></li><li><em>Clear out the<strong> Registry Value Data </strong>field (so it's empty)</em></li><li><em>Tap <strong>Write Data</strong></em></li><li><span>Reboot your phone and try your Mobile Hotspot!</span></li></ul>

<h2>            Insufficient permission to change timezone</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a problem with my main site collection. I'm the site collection owner but whenever I try to change the timezone of the collection in the regional settings section of the site settings it brings up the request permissions dialogue. I then get an
 email asking me to approve my own permissions but this makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried creating a second site collection and I can change the time zone on this one quite happily. Does anyone know what's wrong with my primary one that would restrict this from working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            View and edit word page horizontally</h2>
                    <p>Fellow sufferers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the pages in my report contails a timeline, which the reader would read looking at the page in its flat position (he turns the page 90 degrees). It does not mean I want that page to be different to the others in terms of where the header/footer/page
 number are. All it means is: while editing that particular page, I need to view it in the horizontal position. Is it possible to turn the document while editing it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(The equivalent would be to turn my screen, but I have a laptop so it is not practical.)</p>

            <p>If you insert a landscape page, Word will move the page headers and footers, but you don't want that, so you'll have to keep the page in portrait mode.</p>
<p>You can insert a table and rotate the text. Word doesn't support rotating the view, however.</p>
<p>Your laptop's video card may have an option to rotate the image, and to use keyboard shortcuts to change the orientation - usually Ctrl+Alt+arrow key, e.g. Ctrl+Alt+left arrow to rotate the image 90 degrees to the left, and Ctrl+Alt+up arrow to restore the
 standard setting.</p>

<p>For example, my account had no picture in AD, when I start using Yammer I change my picture in the app and it was OK.</p>
<p>Now I assigned my user account a new picture in our on premise AD and if I log on the Azure Portal and look into the users I can see that my picture was well synced.</p>
<p>Why is the picture not updated in Yammer ? </p>
<p>What do we have to do force/enforce it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another example, for a user, not yet in yammer, who have a picture in our AD, we sync his/her account in azure AD, the picture is then in azure ad and when the user logs for the first time in yammer, the photo is well used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not very clear how the picture management works.</p>
<p>Can someone help me on this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Marc</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>As an IT Manager in a school it's very frustrating to go through the process of taking ID photos of all our students, uploading them to AD and then the only application/platform that seems to take it past there is the local Office install and Office365.
 &nbsp;Not even Windows can tap into the photo to use as their domain sign-in pic, ridiculous!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Yammer across our whole school and as you can imagine the students like to set all sorts of interesting imagery for their profile pics, very frustrating and we can't enforce the pic they should be using.</p>

    <title>Problem burning CDs with Windows Mdia Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim m.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem burning CDs with Windows Mdia Player</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hello RicW-nw and others reading this,</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I read through several of the posts in one of the Microsoft (MS) community forums, over which MS moderator RicW admitted having a diminishing role in moderating, the questions posed about the problem of burning discs with Windows
 Media Player (WMP), after I recently began having this issue of burn failure myself. I was at first having difficulty burning a CD in such a manner as to play the tracks in the order I want them to be played, then was unable to burn
<em>at all</em> and kept receiving error messages. </p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I thought I had found a method to do what I wished, by joining all the .mp3 audio files into one
<em>super</em> audio file with a media conversion program (Freemake, if that matters) and then plotting that file into WMP's burning process. But that will not really allow for individual playing of each track, just a continuous playing of all the tracks combined;
 although, granted, the songs are at least in the order one wishes.</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So the CDs I tried to burn, with WMP and a few other programs (Nero was one of them), all produced two basic types of disc--one called an "audio CD" that played the tracks in alphabetical order (I think) and one which may or may
 not play the tracks in the order I wish by virtue of writing as a "data disc." I need to try that latter method's end result out on a friend's automobile CD player, as my only boombox CD player doesn't work at the moment except for the AM/FM radio functionality.
 The discs I tried to burn will sometimes play on my laptop's disc drive and sometimes not. I really began to be confused about the whole process after awhile and so just gave up. But I am left with four piles of discs, one pile in which the discs seem to play
 the tracks in alpha order, one pile which may play in desired order, one which won't play at all, and one pile with another variation I cannot recall. The last few attempts produced error messages, implying either something is failing in the WMP program or
 mechanically with the disc drive itself. I would like to know if there is at least some way to tell
<em>which</em> is the problem--software or mechanical failure.</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">To veer off the subject at hand slightly, since RicW's replies mentioned the eventual obsolescence of media players, I have also read a few posts and on other online sites which state that media players (<em>including</em> Windows
 Media Player) and the hard copies played through such will soon be going the way of the floppy disc and audio cassette. But still, for those wishing to listen to their collections of CDs and DVDs, I would assume those devices for playing them will continue
 to be manufactured for the foreseeable future, as media companies continue to release products in CD and DVD (Blu-Ray included) formats as well.
</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The problem is these media companies never figured out (or simply don't care to make the investment) a way to market pre-loaded flash drives (or flashsticks or "thumb drives") with files of films and music albums, to replace CDs
 and DVDs. If they <em>had bothered</em>, presumably these businesses would have also replaced or supplemented (with an eye to eventual obsolescence) the CD and DVD players with a
<em>FlashBox</em> or some other such commercial contrivance. And most persons of a certain age (and born after that) prefer, it would seem, to listen to and view their mass-produced media through streaming technology and apps and services such as&nbsp; Amazon, Apple
 Music, iTunes, Napster, Pandora, Spotify, etc. anyway, thus obviating the existence of media hardware devices and the hard copy media played through such.</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">While one may certainly listen to and view audio and video files through the USB ports of desktops, laptops and smart television sets, as well audio files through iPods and .mp3 players, there is still a need (ever decreasing, granted)
 for the hardware to play CDs and DVDs. So CD/DVD players and even turntables and speakers will still be with us all for some time to come, I think.</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Meanwhile, for that matter, vinyl recordings and so-called "record players" have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, egged on (I think) by disc jockeys who think that aural method superior, as well by those with a retro-chic curiosity
 factor. </p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">But to get back to the subject at hand, my last few attempts at burning a CD with WMP produced error messages which said the disc failed to burn. I tried two methods of burning--as an audio CD and as a data disc, the latter which
 I understand from a friend will play in most modern automobile CD players (to the extent the car will
<em>even have</em> a CD player at all, as many automobile manufacturers now assume more people will listen to audio/music using Bluetooth or iPod/.mp3 players). But only the data disc method would seem (in a preliminary step) to allow me to burn the tracks
 in the order I desire them. And as I said, I still have to check to see if the data disc method worked, by listening to the final product on a friend's car CD player.
</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">My main problem now is the last few CD burn attempts produced error messages and quick ejects of the discs. I tried all of the recommended solutions I found in this MS forum, including wiping off the dust gently (with a soft brush)
 from around and on the optical lens inside the disc drive of my laptop, but all to no avail. So,
<em>HELP</em>, please.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">I read through several of the posts in one of the Microsoft (MS) community forums, over which MS moderator RicW admitted having a diminishing role in moderating, the questions posed about the problem of burning discs with Windows
 Media Player (WMP), after I recently began having this issue of burn failure myself. I was at first having difficulty burning a CD in such a manner as to play the tracks in the order I want them to be played, then was unable to burn
<em>at all</em> and kept receiving error messages. </p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I thought I had found a method to do what I wished, by joining all the .mp3 audio files into one
<em>super</em> audio file with a media conversion program (Freemake, if that matters) and then plotting that file into WMP's burning process. But that will not really allow for individual playing of each track, just a continuous playing of all the tracks combined;
 although, granted, the songs are at least in the order one wishes.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So the CDs I tried to burn, with WMP and a few other programs (Nero was one of them), all produced two basic types of disc--one called an "audio CD" that played the tracks in alphabetical order (I think) and one which may or may
 not play the tracks in the order I wish by virtue of writing as a "data disc." I need to try that latter method's end result out on a friend's automobile CD player, as my only boombox CD player doesn't work at the moment except for the AM/FM radio functionality.
 The discs I tried to burn will sometimes play on my laptop's disc drive and sometimes not. I really began to be confused about the whole process after awhile and so just gave up. But I am left with four piles of discs, one pile in which the discs seem to play
 the tracks in alpha order, one pile which may play in desired order, one which won't play at all, and one pile with another variation I cannot recall. The last few attempts produced error messages, implying either something is failing in the WMP program or
 mechanically with the disc drive itself. I would like to know if there is at least some way to tell
<em>which</em> is the problem--software or mechanical failure.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">To veer off the subject at hand slightly, since RicW's replies mentioned the eventual obsolescence of media players, I have also read a few posts and on other online sites which state that media players (<em>including</em> Windows
 Media Player) and the hard copies played through such will soon be going the way of the floppy disc and audio cassette. But still, for those wishing to listen to their collections of CDs and DVDs, I would assume those devices for playing them will continue
 to be manufactured for the foreseeable future, as media companies continue to release products in CD and DVD (Blu-Ray included) formats as well.
</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The problem is these media companies never figured out (or simply don't care to make the investment) a way to market pre-loaded flash drives (or flashsticks or "thumb drives") with files of films and music albums, to replace CDs
 and DVDs. If they <em>had bothered</em>, presumably these businesses would have also replaced or supplemented (with an eye to eventual obsolescence) the CD and DVD players with a
<em>FlashBox</em> or some other such commercial contrivance. And most persons of a certain age (and born after that) prefer, it would seem, to listen to and view their mass-produced media through streaming technology and apps and services such as&nbsp; Amazon, Apple
 Music, iTunes, Napster, Pandora, Spotify, etc. anyway, thus obviating the existence of media hardware devices and the hard copy media played through such.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">While one may certainly listen to and view audio and video files through the USB ports of desktops, laptops and smart television sets, as well audio files through iPods and .mp3 players, there is still a need (ever decreasing, granted)

</p><p class="contentStandard">Meanwhile, for that matter, vinyl recordings and so-called "record players" have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, egged on (I think) by disc jockeys who think that aural method superior, as well by those with a retro-chic curiosity

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for asking Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove any filters applied for the Inbox folder and then verify the results. To do so, on the View tab, in the Current View group click on Reset View.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, try to use the following command to reset views and check:</p>
<p>To do that, close Outlook, press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard. </p>
<p>In the Run box, type in ‘Outlook /cleanviews’ and then hit ok. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Using the command line switch ‘outlook /cleanviews’ will reset all views to default in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above information helps. If you still have questions, you can always reply and I’ll be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            My inquiry is slightly different.&nbsp; I see Filter Applied only for my gmail account I have configured through Outlook 2013.&nbsp; My Hotmail and Live accounts show the number of messages below.&nbsp; Am I missing something.&nbsp; Why would the Gmail account be the only
