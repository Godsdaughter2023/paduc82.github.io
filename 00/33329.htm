<h2>            Various programs show CRYPTUI.dll error&#59; cannot find where the error is&#47;find a fix</h2>
                    <p>Around last Christmas my hard drive started to fail, so I migrated everything onto a new hard drive in the same computer. Not long after that I began getting these errors with different programs. I've included two of my more common ones; Avast and Spotify.
 I've tried reinstalling each, I've tried running the scannow command line thing(it says there are errors it can't fix), I've tried to find a system image to restore to but there are none, I've tried running fixes from the boot menu with no luck...at this point
 I'm concerned I will have to get a new computer or just completely reset my computer, which I really don't wanna do as I have a few old programs that are literally impossible to find anymore. What are my other options to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>DLL files are used for holding multiple codes and procedures for Windows programs.
<em>CRYPTUI.dll</em> is not a part of Windows system files. For us to assist you, we recommend that you schedule a full scan of your computer using your antivirus. This is for us to make sure that this is not caused by an infected file.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we suggest that you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
perform a clean boot</a> on your computer. By doing this, your computer will start with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your applications.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and if you need further assistance feel free to post back.</p>

<p>I don't fully understand how it is not a part of Windows system files. These <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/corrupted-cryptuidll-how-to-replace/f892f14f-5b08-49d0-b235-8e7cbe5231f1">

 through various windows-inherent methods. They haven't worked for me, but that was the impression I got.</p>
<p>

            You have a **** audio device. Plus the software you use to chat with can only use one input device at a time. 



If your sound device has a decent mixer, then maybe you can do something.

    <title>SSD Hard drive no recognized after crashing Windows 10 update failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefanpilot  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD Hard drive no recognized after crashing Windows 10 update failure &#40;locked-up&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Folks, </p>
<p>right now my 1TB Samsung SSD Hard drive is not recognized after a crashing Windows 10 update: it locked-up during the installation with black screen, I waited for hours, but then reboot the computer.</p>
<p>Since then the Dell E6500 notebook does not recognize the HD anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can boot if I use the USB interface for the SSD HD after some attempts using F12 in the early stage off booting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to fix the trouble various ways:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) reboots,</p>
<p>b) various repair option of Windows 10, </p>
<p>c) recovery option with and without external media (CD&amp;USB),</p>
<p>d) safe mode in various options,</p>
<p>e) reinstall windows 10 from safe mode (which boots / reboots fine with network option, even wifi and any-virus&nbsp;doesn't work).</p>
<p>f) reinstalling a backup image I made just before the update from all partition (First HD Track, System Reserved, and C:\ )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing helps to make the PC recognize the SSD Hard-Drive again, not to boot normal (not using the Safe mode).</p>
<p>After first restore of the boot information, the Windows 10 would come up and stating that something went wrong booting with a &nbsp;:( &nbsp;smiley and starts with the trouble shooting mode (which gives the option to start with safe mode).</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHO can help me to get out of safe-mode and get my SSD Hard drive get recognize again.</p>
<p>All I want is to use my windows 8.1 pro again. I am done with Windows 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p><span>Thank you very much to look into my troubles.</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding your questions, here is my best recollection of events over the last week.</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p><strong>1. What is the exact error message you received? Please reply with the error code&nbsp;if available.</strong><br />
<strong>Here is my recollection of things:</strong><br />
- First time I had a black screen. (then reset)&nbsp;<br />
- Next SSD HD not recognized. (I checked the BIOS: SATA is still on IRRT option).&nbsp;<br />
- Next try to boot same drive via USB port. Works.<br />
- Next 2-3 times a reboot loop with message that windows10 can not start normal.&nbsp;<br />
- Then Troubleshoot screen with options:&nbsp;<br />
- there I tried all options but only safe- mode works.<br />
- Then I tried to install the same update via USB and DVD.</p>
<p>- at one point I got Error code 0x8007042c - 0x90016.<br />
- Safe mode adjusted via msconfig as boot option (with network) and it works even with normal screen resolution (VIA USB only). I tried to plug back in to drive bay, but SSD HD not recognized again... &nbsp;</p>
<p>- I try to reinstall the drive images I made before the update (First HD track, System Reserved, and C:\). no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Did you use the Media Creation tool or Get&nbsp;Windows 10 app to upgrade to Windows 10?</strong><br />
YES. (I try to reinstall via media (USB and DVD) but it fails with message that this is not possible in safe-mode. When booting with media it starts, but after choosing re-installation, it fails with Error code 0x8007042c - 0x90016&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. Did you check if your SSD is enabled in the BIOS?</strong><br />
I did use the same configuration in the past 8 month (with SSD) and rebooted may times. No Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much...</p>

My drive just did the same thing. I'm using win10 insider pro. This is really disheartening. It isn't hard drive failure so stop asking this

<p>Thank you for this comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the BIOS before, but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>THIS solved my troubles:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- I confirmed that my Samsung SSD 1TB was not recognized. (as before).</p>
<p>- I experimented with my old WD 750GB drive and it was recognized without BIOS change. (as 6 month ago)</p>
<p>- Then I tried again my SSD without BIOS change: =&gt; no luck.</p>
<p>- Then I explored my Dell E6500 notebook BIOS and found the option "Quick-Boot" as ON.</p>
<p><strong>- I changed&nbsp;BIOS option "Quick-Boot" to AUTO</strong> (Operation system can set this flag on/off by itself).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Samsung SSD 1TB was now recognized on first attempt and old Win 8.1pro started in "Safe-Mode" as adjusted with msconfig (previously called via run command).</p>
<p>- I reboot twice (back into Safe-Mode) to confirm SSD was further recognised and Windows would start.</p>
<p>- Then I called msconfig via run command again and set boot option to normal (deselect safe-boot).</p>
<p><strong>- My Win 8.1pro &nbsp;started normal.</strong></p>
<p>

<p>Those folders will be overwritten when you try to update again.&nbsp; Is your BIOS confused about the status of your SSD and misreports it to Windows as a USB device?&nbsp; That might explain your error message.</p>

<p>Yes. The SSD drive is recognized in the BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after the first failure with crash I tried to updated when the drive was connected via USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can that maybe still be stored in any widows update history log file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it is save, I should maybe delete the temporary update folders created by Win10?</p>

 if you delete the folders is that Windows Update might need to start again, if that is the upgrade route you want to use.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen Windows 7 &#40;hard drive raid error&#41; after identital motherboard swap </h2>
                    
<p><span>original title: Blue Screen (BCOD) Windows 7 (hard drive raid error) after identital motherboard swap</span></p>
<p><span>I have an ASUS M3N78-em motherboard that has a bad Ethernet adapter.&nbsp; I got an advanced replacement (identical version and bios) motherboard from ASUS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My system has 5 hard drives
 (4x640gb raid-0 and a 80gb all sata) running in raid mode on the motherboard controller (nvidea raid).&nbsp;In the bios startup it says the raid is working fine and all hard drives are detected. When trying to reboot windows on the replacement motherboard,&nbsp;I get
 a BCOD with an error on the raid hard drive. &nbsp;Windows then goes into repair mode and tries to fix the problem, three hours later (fix attempt and hard drive error checking)&nbsp;it say windows can't find any error (sends report to microsft).&nbsp;Upon reboot the cycle
 repeats.&nbsp;Same results from safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I had another hard drive laying around (80gb) with an identical copy of windows on it, and I can load
 that one fine (the bios is&nbsp;set up as raid and I have the right hard drive selected for each boot) IN the bios startup it says the raid is working fine and all hard drives are detected.&nbsp; After I get into windows on the non-raid drive (80gb) I can access the
 raid&nbsp;drive (4x640gb) fine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The strange part:&nbsp; Since I have two&nbsp;motherboards, I can put the hard drives&nbsp;back on the&nbsp;original motherboard
 and windows boot fine raid drive or non-raid drive. On the original board, the order of hard drive connection does not matter either.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>ASUS support is conflicted, depending on who I talk to, one says return for another motherboard, another
 (I do not trust) says it must be a windows driver error and I have done something wrong.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I need to know if this might be a windows problem or a motherboard problem - another RMA?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I know the best way to test the motherboard would be to try and install another raid-0 on the non-booting
 raid board, but I am out of hard drives.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Critical Update - Screwed up my PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> florida-al  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Critical Update - Screwed up my PC</h2>
                    <p><strong>My Question: How do I revert BACK to a restore point when a "Critical Update" has corrupted all the restore points on a computer?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My Thoughts about Microsoft:&nbsp; I wanted to THANK Microsoft for their latest "Critical Update." The system automatically applied it to my computer and now NONE of my programs which are not specifically Microsoft products, DO NOT WORK properly at all. In fact,
 most of them will crash upon start up. What is worse is that the Critical update also changed coding within video files on my computer so that they will not run in any video program. Those videos were videos of my childhood years and were irreplaceable. Now,
 none of them will open on my computer at all. Even the ones I stored on my disks will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion to Microsoft is simple. Instead of automatically assuming that every user NEEDS the critical update which changes more then 1 thing on the PC, make each update separate. This way users can choose what updates they want, and what ones they don't.
 Also you should ALERT users what programs can or will be affected by your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new printer for my PC because the printer I had was not compatible with Windows 10 and neither Microsoft nor the printer manufacturer would update the printer drivers so I could use it, even though my printer still worked beautifully before
 the Windows 10 upgrade. Now, your critical update has caused my brand new printer to stop working along with many other programs like JetAudio, Gimp, and some games I have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to do a system restore to revert back before the so-called "Critical Update" but those restore files are corrupted as well. Good Job Microsoft!!!! I think you for making my $2,000 computer and $500 printer into a very expensive set of paperweights.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to do another "Critical Update" to remove everything your screwed up in your last one. Oh and I would FIRE your entire tech department staff that works on these critical updates and hire a bunch of monkeys who will work for bananas only. The monkeys
 couldn't do that much worse.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried the video files on another device?&nbsp; That the main ones don't work as well as the backup sounds more like an incompatibility post-update with that file type.&nbsp; I've not heard of a windows update making changes to a users documents/files/videos
 etc.&nbsp; Perhaps the video codecs are screwed now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they all work on another device you know that the files are ok and its a problem on this specific computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another suggestion, when working with the files on your backup disks do not open these directly in case of corruption.&nbsp; Copy from the backup source to the PC then open on the PC.</p>

<p>I share your feelings and so do millions of other WINDOWS and MICROSOFT victims.&nbsp; I would be ashamed to tell someone I worked for Microsoft.&nbsp; We've all tried offering great suggestions, as you have, but after all these years, the only true respite we get
 from Microsoft's pathetic service is being able to vent and rant about it.&nbsp; I have two desktops sitting side by side.&nbsp; One computer is used to find workarounds for the MICROSOFT problems I am having on the other computer.&nbsp; I go back and forth between the computers,
 and somehow manage to keep one running long enough to peruse the internet for solutions.&nbsp; No matter how mature the software, every system running Microsoft WINDOWS is literally a beta test site where the software exceeded the competency of the software developers
 long before it was released.&nbsp; Whether we are victims of this apparent incompetency or victims of&nbsp; just plain crookedness, is immaterial because it looks the same to us.&nbsp; Microsoft, like any other cancer, feeds on it's own uncontrolled growth.&nbsp; I used "system
 restore" to reset the mess MICROSOFT left my computer in from the most recent WINDOWS UPDATE. &nbsp; As soon as UPDATE automatically re-applied its abominable band aids however, the video drivers were again CORRUPTED.&nbsp; I spend more time trying to fix Microsoft
 bugs than I do using the computer for anything productive.&nbsp; How did we allow this to happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            This new update just totally messed up my computer too. &nbsp;I have had to find ways to correct the damage Microsoft updates have caused almost every time they come out. &nbsp;This time, whatever they did messed everything up so bad that my restore points are corrupted
 too. &nbsp;Time to change operating systems, I guess. &nbsp;I don't have the time or the money to waste cleaning up the mistakes/errors being made.

            Something to think about, perhaps: There are more than 600 million devices running Windows 10. And if you read the professional blogs you see that people are successfully using Windows 10 in many ways. So maybe you should ask yourself: "Could I be doing
 something wrong?"

            You are correct in your statement referring to the fact that many people are using Microsoft for a lot of things.&nbsp; The problem with your question is found in this simple answer, "I turned my computer on before the Critical Update and everything was running
 normally.&nbsp; After the Critical Update, the computer doesn't work and keeps crashing every couple of minutes."&nbsp; Maybe it is coincidence, but when it happens after several updates are received for this new operating system, the frustration just compounds.&nbsp; I
 am sure everyone is working hard to get things right, but like you said, there are 600 million devices out there and I have always been loyal to the MS brand but now my devices are having issues, and my devices are the one's that matter to me and my family.

<p>Why are you so sure that the update(s) are the cause of your problem(s)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the problem(s) already existed, and the update(s) just brought them to light?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think of the feature updates as new versions of Windows, because that's really what they are. In the past, every time a new version of Windows was released ... XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 ... the community forums would be flooded with bitter complaints about how
 the new version 'destroyed' computers and why couldn't Microsoft leave well enough alone, why are they so incompetent, etc. when the truth was these computers were on the verge of being destroyed anyway due to incompatible hardware and software, incorrect
 configuration settings and general mess-ups arising from lack of knowledge. (I was particularly accomplished in that last category.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>New versions of Windows are like Judgement Day. Developers can't possibly anticipate all the ways users scr*w up their computers. Instead, updates anticipate being installed on configurations that are supported and otherwise correctly setup. You may not
<em>like</em> the way Microsoft thinks people should use their computers - I don't - but there's no point to working against that. Software application and driver writers also cannot anticipate all the crazy things people do to their computers, so they too
 presume a configuration setup the way Microsoft intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, upgrade problems could more easily be avoided by simply not upgrading. People could keep their versions of Windows as long as they wanted and, when the time came that it was no longer safe to use an out-of-date version of Windows, buy their
 next computer with the operating system already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those days are long gone. Software has been delivered as a service for a long time and Microsoft had no other option but to get on the bandwagon. Given the choice between having their lunch eaten by Apple and Google and placating people who are stuck in
 the past and/or insist on doing things&nbsp;<em>their</em> way, I think you would make the same choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all of us have to get used to having new versions of Windows 10 twice a year, which means taking responsibility for maintaining our computers. It also means replacing computers more often than in the past. My next computer will almost certainly not last
 as long as the 9-year old veteran I have now.</p>

            Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both dumped significant chunks of their fortune back into circulation about 5 years ago. Also Microsoft is ran by a board of rich folk who did not develop nor personally care about this product...just that people buy it. Just
 saying.

    <title>Where is the Secret Code to unlock Wipeout in the Zone Avatar Awards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whydoesn&#39;tthiswork  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the Secret Code to unlock Wipeout in the Zone Avatar Awards</h2>
                    
<p>The question is really simple. Where is the secret code and how to you redeem it to unlock the Avatar Awards for Wipeout in the Zone? I'm only renting the game so I don't know if anything is listed in the game's manual. There does not appear to be any place
 to redeem a secret code from within the game let alone any mention of what the secret code might be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activision's support is NOT helpful as they followed up with instructions on how to redeem a Marketplace DLC code from within the Xbox 360 Dashboard. Which I do not believe is used to unlock these Avatar Awards aside from the fact that they didn't provide
 a code or any information on where I'd find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically Avatar Awards are unlocked by some in game action such as unlocking an Achievement but there are no Achievements related to Secret code(s) and nothing that I can see that would relate to a secret code from having played the game. At the time of
 this post I just completed all the EASY Missions. Nobody else on any of the FAQ boards or through any Search Engine listings seem to have an answer, just listing what the Avatar Awards are and the basic description of how they are unlocked as seen from within
 the Avatar Awards listing on your Xbox 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone who bought the game have any information on what is required to get the Secret Code and where you would even redeem it? Is there any mention of a Secret Code in the instruction guide included with the game?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>The module that appears to causing the crash is the KERNELBASE.dll, which is a component of Windows:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Nome del modulo che ha generato l'errore: <strong>KERNELBASE.dll</strong>, versione: 6.3.9600.16408, timestamp: 0x523d557d</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However another, possibly third party, module may actually be causing the crash.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For instance older versions of&nbsp;Autodesk Inventor have been known to cause the issue in Windows 8.1&nbsp;such as in the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-files/file-explorer-crashes-when-extracting-zip-files/cc02d998-87ae-4fb2-8ba0-c31d47e8cd60">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-files/file-explorer-crashes-when-extracting-zip-files/cc02d998-87ae-4fb2-8ba0-c31d47e8cd60</a></p>

<p>You are running Windows 10 Education, which is a volume license client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you obtain this copy of Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span><span>
</span></span></span></p><p><span>Windows 10 Activation reports your license will soon expire.</span></p>
<span><span><span><span>
<p>This can happen for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You copied a Windows 10 Pro, Education or Enterprise key off the Internet (usually a volume license - organization - key) and changed on a Windows 10 Home installation. Windows 10 Pro<span>, Education or Enterprise</span>
 is not free<span>.&nbsp;</span>If this is what you did, you will need to reinstall the previous edition or version you were running. You inadvertently installed the wrong edition.<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
<ul>
<li>The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:</li></ul>
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ul>
</span></span></span></span>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core&nbsp;<span><span>will install&nbsp;</span></span>Windows&nbsp;<span>10 Home&nbsp;</span><br />
</li></ul>
<span><span><span><span><span><span>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro&nbsp;<span><span>will install</span></span>Windows&nbsp;<span>10 Pro</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>If the edition of Windows 10 installed does not correspond with the edition of Windows 7 or Windows 8 you were previously running, then you need to reinstall the right edition.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue with my laptop.</p>
<p>I purchased the laptop about 18 months ago, 2nd hand by private sale from the owner, with Windows 10pro installed. Everything has worked fine until today when I received the '<span>'your windows activation will expire
 soon'&nbsp; message</span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Based on the age of laptop I assume that it was upgraded from windows 7 or 8 and (per your previous advice) that previous owner downloaded the incorrect version... but
 I have no way of knowing.. It was an emergency purchase when I was traveling &amp; 'fried' my laptop with a spilled cup of tea.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Anyhow my most pressing issue is what is the best &amp; quickest way to fix this??</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Can I purchase&nbsp; a new 'Product Key' &amp; apply to the existing Windows 10 installed ??? ... Or
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do I have to buy a &amp; reinstall a whole new Windows 10??..</span></span>Thanks

<p>to answer PLCLMN -&nbsp;You would be best purchasing a license through the Microsoft option by searching About your PC and selecting the option Change Product key..</p>
<p>There is an option in there to go to the Microsoft Store which should hopefully help.

<h2>            desktop thinks it&#39;s running on battery power</h2>
                    Computer crash resulting in restoring factory operating system - VISTA. Loaded Service Pack 1 OK. Service Pack 2 won't install because of note that says the computer is running on a battery and to plug in the power cord. There is a battery icon on the
 lower right task bar. How did that get there? How do I tell my computer it's not running on a battery? It's a desktop and run on a plug.

 The volume control works. also the hybrid Nvidia/Intel graphics card requires the switch of a button to change from one card to the other. To make the cards function properly I'm looking for a specific driver/power management tool for the Nvidia/Intel cards

<span>Hi </span>
<span><span>calgarydude,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Answers Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>As it would be difficult to search drivers for the hardware drivers for each of your product individually through product
 ID.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>I would suggest you to contact the computer manufacturer or
</span></span><span>download drivers for
</span><span>Sony Vaio sz780DN</span><span><span> that are compatible with Windows 7 from the link below,</span></span></p>

<h2>            Error&#58; Windows Movie Maker format not supported when sending slide show</h2>
                    <p>original title: Need some help in windows movie maker...***...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am using Windows Vista Home Premium and have windows 7 on this computer. I am puzzled at how to show the slideshow of some classic cars photographs I took at a car show last weekend. I tried to post the slideshow into my external account and to
 another external account, but got an error message along the lines of Windows Movie Maker format is not accepted. I was told that the file I have needs to be in WMV format. I tried a converter, but it did not do the required converting. I can put slidshows
 together but with how updates and such go, I am kind of a total newbie to what to do. Would there be anyone out there who can assist me in trying to get this converted so I can display the slideshow in the two external accounts I wish to use? I do not know
 if it is acceptable to say which two external accounts I need, as sometimes forums do not allow names of those accounts not related to the topic at hand.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Any help is greatly appreciated and welcomed. I have the slideshow minimized to my taskbar so I won't lose it, but I would love to have some help as soon as possible. I will be checking back in here to see what assistance comes my way.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I am using Windows Vista Home Premium and have windows 7 on this computer. I am puzzled at how to show the slideshow of some classic cars photographs I took at a car show last weekend. I tried to post the slideshow into my external account and to
 another external account, but got an error message along the lines of Windows Movie Maker format is not accepted. I was told that the file I have needs to be in WMV format. I tried a converter, but it did not do the required converting. I can put slidshows
 together but with how updates and such go, I am kind of a total newbie to what to do. Would there be anyone out there who can assist me in trying to get this converted so I can display the slideshow in the two external accounts I wish to use? I do not know
 if it is acceptable to say which two external accounts I need, as sometimes forums do not allow names of those accounts not related to the topic at hand.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Any help is greatly appreciated and welcomed. I have the slideshow minimized to my taskbar so I won't lose it, but I would love to have some help as soon as possible. I will be checking back in here to see what assistance comes my way.</strong></p>

=========================================<br />
Sounds like you saved the Project File (mswmm or wlmp <br />
depending on your version of Movie Maker) which is only <br />
useful for re-editing in Movie Maker and cannot be viewed <br />
by others.<br />
<br />
Try saving your project in the .WMV Movie format...<br />
<br />
If you are running Vista&nbsp;Movie Maker 6...try the following:<br />

    <title>HDD in a HDD caddy is not showing up in the disk management - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HDD in a HDD caddy is not showing up in the disk management</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought Lenovo Z50 which came with a regular HDD. I had a spare SSD drive from an older laptop so I cloned the OS that came with Z50 to it and then did a clean install with installation media. Everything went well and the system is running very
 smoothly on the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that I can't get the regular HDD that came with new laptop running if I boot from the SSD. Regular HDD is in a HDD caddy that I used to replace my DVD-drive. HDD in the caddy shows up in device management as an other device, not as a hard
 drive and it's not showing up in the disk management. Is there a way to clean this drive without OS? Would it help? I have everything backed up on an external hard drive so it's okay if I lose the data. That's what I want actually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I boot from the regular HDD in the caddy the original OS starts up just fine and even the SSD shows up in the disk management. If I swap the SSD to the caddy and put the HDD inside the laptop I can boot from the HDD but not from the SSD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to get the OS running on the 128 MB SSD so that i could use the regular 1 TB HDD also to store everything i need?</p>

<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, I would like to ask some&nbsp;questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>How are you connecting the HDD Caddy?</li><li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you are connecting the device using USB, I suggest you to check if&nbsp;other USB devices are recognized as USB devices or Other device. If it is displaying as other device, then the issue might&nbsp;be with the USB port. So, I suggest you to update the USB drivers
 by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus Controller</strong>.</li><li>Right click on the drive, select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong> and follow the on-screen prompts.</li></ol>

    <title>Apple headphones mic doesnt work with windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluecew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Apple headphones mic doesnt work with windows</h2>
                    i need to use voice chat while gaming with my friends, but my computer doesn't have a built-in microphone and the only way i have to use a mic is my apple headphones. I plug them into the headphone jack, but it only plays audio and the mic doesn't work.
 I plug them into the microphone jack, but now there is no audio and the mic works, but partly. My friends can only hear other sounds but not my voice, for example me hitting the earbuds together. I find this weird how other noises get picked up but not my
 own voice. Then i tried with a brand new apple headphones into the mic jack, but it produces the same result. Then i tried with the pink mic jack in the back of the PC, same result. Please help idk what to do.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio jacks on your<strong> PC</strong> are<strong> audio out</strong> and<strong> mic in</strong>. It is not like the
<strong>mobile phone jack</strong> <strong>which acts as both audio out and mic in.
</strong>To use your headphone's audio out and mic in capabilities, you'll need a<strong> 3.5 mm Stereo Audio Splitter 2 Male 1 Female Adapter</strong>. They look like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60bbcd3a-9e00-405a-bcf5-5b492be59252?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60bbcd3a-9e00-405a-bcf5-5b492be59252?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>You could also just buy a<strong> gaming headphone</strong> for maximum game audio performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more concerns, feel free to post.</p>
<p>

                    Since installing the latest windows update I am unable to shut down my PC unless I manually power it off from the tower. I have tried all suggestions from the various forums ie uncheck fast start up, update drivers, checked BIOS setting, run all trouble

            Hi Alison, I realise you have already performed a lot of these steps already and understand your frustration, can you please check these 2 steps (especially step 2)
<br />
<br />1,
<br />Go to Control Panel - Power Options - Choose what the power button does
<br />Click on 'Change settings that are currently unavailable' - Uncheck 'Turn on Fast Startup'
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Go to Control Panel - Device Manager - System Devices - Intel Management Engine Interface - Power Management
<br />Uncheck the 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power'

<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Find Intel Management Engine (it should be in System Devices section), right click that and choose disable - do not uninstall it
<br />
<br />Restart your PC a couple of times and see if the issue is resolved . ..

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually powered down the PC and upon switching back on was taken to the black screen of doom and asked to Reboot and select proper boot device. I must admit I panicked ( wasn't expecting that) but had enough sense to enter the BIOS settings, clicked on
 default setting, exit and saved. Thankfully the pc restarted as normal and I was able to shut down the pc from the start menu ( normally it hangs on a blue screen and I am forced to manually shut it down) This is the furthest the pc has come to shutting down
 since the update rolled out but the power button on my tower still remained lit. Do you think the problem lies only with the Intel Driver and should I enable it? And is there anything else that I can try or need to do?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Alison, I doubt very much if disabling IME was the cause of that glitch, it is probably due to the fact that your system has not shut down properly in so long . . .
<br />
<br />Try shutting your system down and then starting it up again and see if the issue is resolved . . .

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You were quite correct Dave and my optimism was short lived. I had to manually power down again. Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve for me to try? I don't want to do a clean install and lose all my apps and stuff but I'm worried about damaging the
 pc by hard powering it down until MS come up with a fix.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Alison, here is a workaround, that may work for you until Microsoft fix this issue:
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Shortcut 
<br />
<br />Set Target to: %WINDIR%\system32\shutdown.exe /s /hybrid /t 0 
<br />
<br />Name it: Shutdown 
<br />
<br />
<br />Double click that shortcut and see if your system correctly shuts down . . .

<h2>            Replacement transceiver for sculpt keyboard and mouse</h2>
                    I know that this has been discussed before but I was wondering if anyone has been able to find a logical solution to the problem of replacing the usb transceiver for an ms sculpt ergonomic keyboard and mouse? &nbsp;Incredible as it seems MS could care less
 about the waste and ridiculous idea of replacing the &nbsp;entire set because they did not factor replacing the smallest part, which is prone to being misplaced, into their marketing plan. &nbsp;If ms is trying to boost sales or if they just didn't think this through
 it speaks directly about how little they care about the poor schmuck who shells out his hard earned cash. &nbsp;I called and was told three separate times &nbsp;that there is no solution and that I would have to purchase an entire new set. &nbsp;She said that one of the
 reasons for this was to prevent someone hacking your keyboard, laughable! &nbsp;Finally I asked to speak with someone else and she put me on hold and, after several minutes, a loud tone, as if someone was

            Someone didn't think this through, but it wasn't Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the transceivers were interchangeable, two people in the same house or office would constantly be interfering with each other.&nbsp; Logitech has developed the
<a href="http://support.logitech.com/en_sg/article/28930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Unifying</a> dongle system, for which the transceiver is replaceable via their own software.&nbsp; Perhaps MS will follow suit, but in the meantime the transceivers just aren't replaceable, and that's true of even some current Logitech devices. BTW, the idea of
 a class action lawsuit to compensate you for your own carelessness is a little silly.

            Microsoft absolutely didn't think this through. &nbsp;That assumption is giving credit to MS because the alternative is that MS purposely created a situation whereby the customer will have to pay more to replace the entire set instead of providing a mechanism
 to replace a part which, in all likelihood, costs MS pennies. &nbsp;Interesting argument about possible interference with multiple keyboards in the same household. &nbsp;I wonder how Logitech deals with it. &nbsp;The answer is - very simply, it's been the industry standard
 and interference is the exception, not the norm. &nbsp;Following the logic in your argument would result in concluding that MS, (to avoid interference) would suggest replacing the entire set as opposed to risking interference which is less likely. &nbsp;It is clear
 that MS EITHER DIDN'T THINK THIS THROUGH OR IS MALICIOUSLY TRYING TO EXTORT MONEY FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS. As far as a class action suit, it would not be to make me whole but instead it would punish MS for their

<p>We would not be having this ludicrous conversation if not for <em>your carelessness</em>.&nbsp;
<em>You </em>created the problem, not Microsoft.&nbsp; Wireless mouse/keyboard transceivers from
<em>all </em>manufacturers have <em>never</em> been interchangeable with the exception of the relatively recent, aforementioned Logitech Unifying devices.&nbsp; You also foolishly downplay the interference problem.&nbsp; In an office setting where there might be hundreds
 of users of the same hardware, the interference would create utter chaos.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you can "reason" all of this away by merit of the idea that your own carelessness is anyone's fault but your own, and industry standards should accommodate any errors that you might make.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

<h2>            DVD Burner doesn&#39;t work properly.</h2>
                    Hello everyone, here's my problem: I have Windows 7 64 bit OS in my PC. Everytime I try to make a copy of a DVD (clone it) or to burn it through an ISO file (I've tried with Ashampoo 9, DVD Decrypter and Windows ISO burner) I get an error, and sometimes
 I don't even get an error but when I try to play the DVD it doesn't work. I clicked on Troubleshoot on the drive icon in Devices And Printers. And I got this message: "A4N0H9SO IDE Controller doesn't have a driver". I don't know where can I find that driver
 or if that's actually the problem to begin with, because I do can burn DVDs just fine when I convert an Avi file (with ConvertxToDVD), and when I drag files to the DVD burner also. So I would appreciate a lot if any of you nice people could help me with this.

            Hi ShadowJournal,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Is your DVD drive recognizing the DVDs that were burnt on different computers?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would advise you to install one DVD burning software in first place and then try. Uninstall all the DVD burning softwares and then use Windows DVD maker to burn the DVD and check.<br />
<br />
Try playing the DVD on a different computer that you have already burnt and check if it works.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let us try the following methods and check.<br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer
 was installed correctly.<br />
Refr to the following link for steps:<br />
