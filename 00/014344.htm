<h2>            BEWARE OF HACK ON MS COMMUNITY&#33; ALMOST GAVE MY CR CARD &#35; THINKING I CALLED MS SUPP fr a &#35; on THIS SITE&#33;</h2>
                    Happened Friday 7/28/2017 approx. 8 pm-ish to 8:40 pm:<br />
<p>
</p><p>I <em>[found] </em><del>need</del> a <em>[link] </em><del>tel number</del>&nbsp;to report a
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SCAMMER'S</span></strong> EXTREME ABUSE when I called what I
<em>thought was MS Cust. Svc</em>. rep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SCAMMER</span></strong> connected/linked/accessed to my computer and "showed" me on screen that I needed to buy a new Office 365 package for Lifetime with security for $549.99 all inclusive. I tried to explain
 that I just needed tech sup for Word and already have a Lifetime acct. I said my husband was not home and I could not make that large a purchase without first discussing it with him. He ARGUED REPEATEDLY, RAISING HIS VOICE, actually YELLING AND TALKING OVER
 ME!</p>
<p>He WOULD NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. I finallly was able to yell NO!!!! several times.<br />
Then he said wanted to "<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SEE ME</span></strong>." I thought I was hearing things. I typed NO! He begged me, Please mam. I typed LOG OFF NOW. Then he went to the Run Bar and he typed CAMER.. Before he could finish
 the "a" I slammed my desktop off hoping it wouldn't crash and hung up on him. </p>
<p>Wait... I am on the phone with someone now at the REAL Microsoft Customer Support...</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SEE BELOW FOR IMPORTANT INFO. BEWARE</span></strong>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>OH NO‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èThis is info I got from the REAL MS&nbsp;Cust Support Rep (<strong>CORRECT PH # for "USA MS STORE SALES &amp; CUST SUPPORT ~ BUT VERIFY IT YOURSELF FIRST IN CASE SOMEONE CHANGES IT: 1-877-696-7786.</strong>&nbsp;I listed the scammer's number below although
 I'm sure they will change it. I just spoke with a really nice guy at MS for nearly an hour. He said the number I got off THIS COMMUNITY SITE WAS A
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SCAM</span></strong>‚ÄºÔ∏èUnfortunately, he couldn't do an online access to my desktop because it was orig set up w/out an Admin Password, so he wasn't able to fix anything and told me to call a local MS Cert. computer
 repair co. I'm hoping someone from MS reaches out to me after I report the scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I was searching Google for MS Support and a tel # to reach a HUMAN to help me with Word app. When I couldn't find one, I looked at COMMUNITY and saw what appeared to be several other people asked the same thing... but the screen was a
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HACK INTO COMMUNITY</span></strong>. All the info was fake. Not knowing, I called the number&nbsp;<strong>(DON'T CALL 1-844-496-1216) Listed on COMM. AS "US MS Cust Svc 24/7" (also had ph # for Canada and ?). &nbsp;</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Thank
 God I didn't give him my CR card #.</span> But it shook me up pretty bad. The scammer didn't really even want to sell me a new Office 365 pkg. "license" he called it... he just
<strong>WANTED MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The REAL MS Rep said a MS rep would NEVER do anything like the scammer did. He was very polite and helpful named Deepak Kumar. He gave me the MS&nbsp;<strong>LINK TO REPORT A SCAM: &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">support.microsoft.com.reportascam</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe me, I will right now, but I wanted to warn you all first. </p>
<p>The sad part is I STILL DON'T HAVE HELP WITH MY WORD APP and I saved some very important docs in it that I need to access! LOL. I have to laugh üòÇ or I'll CRY! üò¢<br />

<h2>            Links won&#39;t break in word 2010</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a large manual that has been written by multiple people over the past few years (e.g., probably started in word 2000 or 2003 or something) and contains images that must have been inserted via linking only (there doesn't seem to be any embedding).<br />
<br />
The problem is that I have a LOT of cross-links and fields that need updating but as soon as I update the whole document, all the images from previous writers error-out.. i.e., it says the link doesn't work. So I tried to break the links...<br />
<br />
I followed the procedure of:<br />
File &gt; Info &gt; Edit Links to files.<br />
In the popup window I found the files that didn't have an item number (e.g., the ones embedded have "_Ref232554331" (for example) while the others just have "--"). I assumed these didn't have links because they are the only ones that ungreyed the "Options for
 selected link" section of the window.<br />
I then select them (either one at a time or together) and ensured 'save picture in document' was ticked. I cilcked 'break link' and when it asked me to confirm I wanted to break it I said yes.<br />
<br />
Then... nothing happened. <br />
And nothing changed in the table, and the file size didn't increase.<br />
<br />
I tried running this macro that I found on a site:<br />
Sub BreakLinkstoPictures()<br />
Dim i As Long<br />
With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = .Fields.Count To 1 Step -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .Fields(i).Type = wdFieldIncludePicture Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Fields(i).Unlink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
End With<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Probably didn't work cos I inserted the pictures differently, but I was desperate.<br />
<br />
Now I'm out of ideas and asking for help! Please help -- the file is 250+ pages and I don't fancy doing it all manually again (takes forever!).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :-) <br />

<h2>            Word for Mac documents disappearing</h2>
                    <p>Over the last few weeks my word documets on my macbook have been playing up. &nbsp;I‚Äôll be saving them as I go through like normal and then all of a sudden the name of the file will change to Word Work File_ followed by a whole bunch of numbers. &nbsp;Then I do a
 save as to the same folder the original document was in and then thats fine but as soon as I close it the document it completely disappears from the folder as well as the original, recents and my back ups never to be found again...and this has happened multiple
 times over the last few weeks and it is really frustrating. &nbsp;The omly solution I have for the moment is just copying the whole file and pasting it into a new doc and saving that but thats only if i notice the name changing otherwise it just goes. Does anyone
 know how to fix this or has the same issue?</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for all the trouble it has caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your Word for Mac is still 15.35, we suggest you update Office first. Mojave is a new OS version and the latest Office released after Mojave has a better performance on it. Currently, the latest version should be 16.16.8(19031202)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how to update Office:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update-office-for-mac-automatically-bfd1e497-c24d-4754-92ab-910a4074d7c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Update Office for Mac automatically</span></a><span>&nbsp;If Office
 update cannot be detected, you can download and install the latest Microsoft AutoUpdate tool from here:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/release-history-microsoft-autoupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Release history
 for Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU)</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the new version of Office 365 for Mac still has this behavior, here are two more suggestions you can try. They are helpful to narrow down the issue and find us a possible root cause:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Use safe mode to isolate issues with your Mac</span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">. Safe boot will only load
 basic programs. It provides us a clean background to test Office performance.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT204443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to test an issue in another user account on your Mac</span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">. We have received
 the response from our users before that Office performance issue are related to the user profile in MacOS. By this test, we can know if this is the reason of our case.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<h2>            Creating a Macro in Excel 2013 to uncheck a checkbox when a new one is checked.</h2>
                    <p>I need to create a macro to uncheck a checkbox when another checkbox is mark. The worksheet will be broken up in section and a selection has to be made in each section of the worksheet. From what I have read already on this forum that I may need to move
 the check boxes to a separate column. Any help will be appreciated, </p>

            <p>To Trina D,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a follow up with what I believe to be a better solution than&nbsp;my previous post.&nbsp; It still involves using Forms Control Check Boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open VBA editor. (Hold Alt key and press F11 to open the VBA editor)</li><li>Insert a standard module. (Select menu item Insert -&gt; Module to create a module.)</li><li>Copy the code below and paste into&nbsp;the standard VBA module.</li><li>Close the VBA editor (Hold Alt key and press Q)</li><li>Save the workbook as macro enabled.&nbsp;</li><li>Create all of the Forms Control Check Boxes (if not already created).</li><li>Right click each checkbox in turn and select Assign Macro and assign the common macro name (ProcessChkBoxes) to the control. &nbsp;(If you get a popup menu options to move here, copy here, cancel then try again because you need the popup with the option to select
 Assign macro.)</li><li>Repeat above step for all the checkboxes.</li><li>Right click the first checkbox of a group.</li><li>Hold the Ctrl key and right click the remaining checkboxes in the required group so all&nbsp;boxes in the group are selected.</li><li>Release the Ctrl key and Right click in one of the selected checkboxes in the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;(If you get a popup menu options to move here, copy here, cancel then try again because you need the popup with the option to select Groups)</li><li>From the popup menu Select Group&nbsp; and then&nbsp;Group again to the right.</li><li>Click somewhere else on the worksheet to unselect the group.</li><li>Repeat for the remaining groups of check boxes.</li></ol>
<p>Because the&nbsp;code below is assigned to all of the checkboxes, it&nbsp;runs irrespective of which checkbox is clicked.&nbsp;If the checkbox ix checked (xlOn) then all of the checkboxes in the SAME group are turned off and then the clicked checkbox is turned back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The names of the checkboxes and groups are irrelevant just so long as the macro is assigned to the checkbox. You can also add more groups at a later time and assign the same macro to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The big advantage of this is that you do not need to know the names of the checkboxes and you do not need to alter the VBA code to match checkbox names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub ProcessChkBoxes()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Processes Forms Control CheckBoxes based on Groups<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim shpChk As Shape<br />

            <p>Hello again Trina D,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I decided to place this in a separate post. it is an automated utility for creating the Forms Control CheckBoxes and Grouping them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might like to copy the code into a blank workbook first and test to see how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply copy the code and paste into a standard module.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also copy the&nbsp;code that is assigned to the checkboxes into the same module (See my previous post for that code.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run the code from the VBA editor by clicking anywhere within the sub and press F5.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions in the InputBox.</p>
<p>When finished, Excel will take you back to the VBA editor. Hold Alt key and press F11 to get back to the worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub CreateCheckBoxes()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Use this code to create checkboxes with groups<br />

<p>hi james,</p>
<p>according to the error message, it seems that something is wrong with your outlook profile.</p>
<p>given the situation, would you mind following the steps mentioned in the below article to create a new outlook profile for your office 365 account?</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../829918</a></p>
<p>if the issue persists after creating a new outlook profile, to better understand the situation, i‚Äôd like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. are you the only one in your organization who encountered the issue?</p>
<p>2. could you please provide us with the detailed version of your outlook client? to check it, please click
<strong>file</strong> &gt; <strong>office account</strong>, there you can see the detailed version of the outlook client under the
<strong>office updates</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01edc1c1-b1bd-466d-9642-710774780bc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01edc1c1-b1bd-466d-9642-710774780bc2" /></a></p>
<p>3. to determine whether it‚Äôs a client side issue or not, could you please try setting up your office 365 account into another pc‚Äôs outlook client to see if the same issue occurs?</p>
<p>4. which office 365 plan you are using?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<h2>            Is it possible, in PowerPoint VBA, to get Active Controls names and values from a slide. Dynamically&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Powerpoint to make some kind of procedure with&nbsp;macros. I inserted inside my presentation activex controls (ToggleButton).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to make a dynamic table(or array) with the ToggleButton name and value, so two dimensions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that I do not know how to detect the presence of a activex control on a slide, and get the name and value...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoping I was clear enough... Otherwise, feel free to ask for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t uninstall program in Program and Features</h2>
                    <p>I did a windows update today. Since then I go a msg box up telling me my Dolby Audio driver version was 7.2.8000.17 and it expects version 7.2.7000.6 and to update my software or driver. I checked the dolby driver installed in program and features and it
 showed the correct version of 7.2.7000.6. I uninstalled it and checked the device manager and it showed NVIDIA as the media device. So I went to Program and Features to uninstall the NVIDIA 3d driver, NVIDIA driver,and the NVIDIA update programs. I did the
 uninstall 3 times and each time it restarted all 3 programs were back like it didn't uninstall. Each time I did the uninstalls I uninstalled starting with a different program figuring that uninstalling in a different order would work. Nope, no dice. I was
 hoping to uninstall so it would default to the realtek driver. nope. I also have no sound and the sound properties box shows no sound drivers installed and the buttons on the bottom of box won't work. Now all this after I did the Windows Update. Before I did
 the update sound and NVIDIA worked ok. I need some help here. Why won't Program and Features uninstall NVIDIA programs permanently? The Dolby uninstalled just fine and is gone.</p>

            yes. I have. It showed in the device mgr NVIDIA in the media with a yellow triangle and an exclamation point. I went into properties on each and got rid of them but, when I did a restart it all re appeared.

            <p>Running a Acer Aspire 5560-7414 and Build 10041 and have the same error. Unable to find a fix but my sound is working, just getting the error box on each startup. Hopefully next build may fix but not seeing many complaints so maybe not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect that the Dolby PCEE4 profiles software will have to be updated as it appears they were last updated in 2011. If the new drivers are included in an update it should fix the error.</p>

<h2>            Android app creating 1000&#39;s of tmp files</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the latest version of the outlok.com app from the play store. Shortly after, there was over 7000 tmp files in the /root directory. The file names were rotation-xxxx.tmp, and all are 0 bytes. The amount of files is causing performance issues on
 the device. The device is not rooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are these files and is there anything that can be done to prevent the files from being created?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Tmp files are temporary files that are saved by browsing the internet or downloading applications. Your device will become slow due to an increase of temporary files that can affect the capability of your device to run any applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to clean all the tmp files saved on your device. You can delete these files manually or download a temporary file cleaner on your device to resolve your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it answered your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>It's true that tmp files are created whenever you browse the internet or if you have downloaded an application. Like what you're experiencing right now, the issue started after you downloaded outlook app. Try checking this post:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it won't work for you, you can delete those files manually or install a tmp file remover to your device.</p>

            <p>I had the same experience. A month after installing <strong>Outlook </strong>on my Android tablet, I noticed it was very hard to browse for files -- File Manager took over 5 minutes to open. I discovered the root directory contained over
<strong>16,200 rotation-xxxx.tmp </strong>files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Outlook and, with some difficulty, deleted all the tmp files. Everything is running normally again.<br />

<span>It took over 11 hours to delete 47K .tmp files.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Notes: Outlook seems to have created the .tmp file. Answers above try to get you to think it is something else. When I deleted the 150k .tmp files (with Outlook still installed), .tmp files
 continue to be created. Once I uninstalled Outlook, no more .tmp files were created.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>DOS Attack. You hear about DOS Attacks on the news as a virus. DOS is a Denial of Service. Hackers try to use up all your computer‚Äôs resources bringing it to a crawl. This is a Virus!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well, Outlook, seems to be creating these thousands of .tmp file, which‚Ä¶ wait for it, is a DOS attack. Being a Microsoft aviate, I believe it is un-tensional but it still it brings my Nook
 down to a crawl making it is unusable. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This would take a bit of testing for them, so I could see it not being raided as a bug. Hopefully someone will repro this and get a fix.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I‚Äôm unable to use Outlook on Nook because of this, and it would be nice to get it running without the .tmp file DOS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One last note, the .tmp files are zero bytes, so it would not look like something is filling up the disk. That isn‚Äôt the issue, when you get thousands of .tmp files, every time the directory
 is accessed, it must read through thousands of .tmp files to get the directory list. This is the DOS attack, just reading those .tmp files from a computer takes hours.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope it helps people out there, and hope Outlook can repro this and get a fix. My guess it has something to do with syncing the email folders, which
 would constantly be running, creating those .tmp files, but this and everything else I have written is my opinion based on my experiences.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Have a happy day!</span></span></p>

<h2>            Excel Startup in Office 2019</h2>
                    Office 2011 had a specified folder for startup files; Office 2019 seems not to specify this. There is XLStartup for Windows, but for Mac ... &nbsp; I can specify my own folder. Is there a preferred place? (I don't want to put it in the Documents folder because

            Do you mean a print job that has already been sent to the printer?  That can't really be done after it has been sent to the printer.
<br />
<br />There is an old technique you could try.  Instead of printing to a "printer" you print to a file. It should have a PRN extenstion. That file can be copied and sent multiple times to the printer.

<span>Let's say I type a one page resume. OK. When I print it at home (but nowhere else), two pages come out.<br />
<br />
The first page is the resume, or any one page word document I created.<br />
<br />
But the second page comes out with some sort of stats which look like this:<br />
<br />
<strong>Filename: resume<br />
Directory: C:\Users\Owner\Documents<br />

Number of Pages: 1<br />
Number or Words: 134<br />

<br />
What the heck is this second page and how do I make it stop?<br />

    <title>LAN fax sending with no cover letter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _d.c._  say:</h3>
<h2>            LAN fax sending with no cover letter</h2>
                    <span>Hello,</span>
                    <span>Hello,</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I'm hoping some collective minds can help me out with this bind I am in. I do remote support for various businesses that use the Lexmark x464de MFP printer, I have set them all up on LAN Faxing and configured their individual cover pages
 on the drivers. When I fax from let's say a notepad document on my desktop, it faxes perfectly with the attached pre configured cover letter. All this is on Windows 7 64-bit</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So here is the issue, when I fax from the browser or a browser based application, the fax goes through but no cover page is attached!? I have been in touch with Lexmark who assure me it is not an issue with the driver, but with the OS itself,
 specifically the 64-version. I asked how they came to this assumption and they replied " This driver ( Universal v2 PS3,) has been tested on every OS and Win 7 64-bit is the only version this happens on.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>When this issue first came to my attention (1 yr ago) we where using the Lexmark Universal PS3 driver (not version 2) and a workaround was used to get by this, with the Uv2 PS3 the workaround does not work anymore. &nbsp;"So why not stay with
 the first version then!?" Good question, cause now the workaround doesn't seem to work there either! Let me explain the workaround that another clever mind came up with, this may help isolate possible theories.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>**Assume that the printer and driver is already installed**</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>We disabled post script pass through from the drivers preferences. Then we kept the enable fax and display this box prior to faxing (it's the box where you would type in the fax number) and disabled the send with cover letter option at the
 driver level. Now the workflow would be.....</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Pull up PDF in browser &gt; select the print icon &gt; choose fax machine &gt; click print &gt; a box then appears, you type in the fax number here and check off send with coversheet &gt; hit send and that's that.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>That worked with the first version of the driver, now not so much. So does anyone have any thoughts on what could be happening here. I've confirmed no issue on XP, Vista, and 7x86. I am open to any ideas and suggestions. I'll monitor this
 thread as best as I can. I should also mention that its been tested on all browsers and their respective version too.</span></div>
<div><span><br />

Microsoft Technical Support - Can you help me with my account?  No it's FREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT.(AWNSER-FROM-TECH) 



Server problems - NO MS knows what is good for you.  TAKE-IT AND LIKE-IT 



E-mail Delay - Your problem not OURS!! you must be spamming, have the wrong address, you are a baby that can't send a simple email.!!!  So no Help. 



E-mail 4 day delay - Hotmail e-mail delay, no further action need.   Yeah, except that your recipient did not get it. 



E-mail 10min - 8hr delay - All systems go, Outlook.com is up and running....  This is normal for a Microsoft application and service.

            I totally concur with your frustration with this lack of support. &nbsp;I have been unable to send isp emails since Feb. 10 but I can receive them. &nbsp;I, as is the case with others who have posted about this, have spent considerable time on the phone with their
 ISP but no problem is found on that end whatsoever. &nbsp;My ISP is Cox and they have been most helpful but there simply is no problem on their end. &nbsp;Thus, I have abandoned using the Outlook.com app and now go directly to the Cox site to send and receive all my
 emails. &nbsp;It is frustrating when MS shows absolutely no concern about an issue this widespread!!!

I'm thinking to do the same except that when I connected my email (Outlook) and my own email with a Live account it took over all my contacts, emails and has jacked everything up as it also connected my facebook wich I rearly use.  And now all my birthdays and events have different days.  I don't know how my Outlook on my pc can get overwritten by facebooks ****. 



Funny...... I called my best friend a week later to congratulate him on his birthday.....   he said "Thanks... man... how are you ..." I reply...  fine you?   he said "Good... not bad.... but my birthday was last week" .....  I thought.... ****!!!!  ......    God... I felt like a total ****.. 



I'm horrible with dates so I rely very much on the dates I write down.  Thanks MS and Facebook.!!!!

            <p>Yaknow it is funny, in a bad way! They can contact you with automated responses, make you jump through hoops, change passwords, re-login in the middle of sending a long email etc... and then you cannot reply back to tell them that their response caused a
 problem. Everything is a no-reply email. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was happy buying and using ms applications, but they forced me to go to outlook.com, claim its free, so I am supposed to quit complaining or be thankful its free, but I did not want it. I want support, and would pay for it. You cannot train phone support
 people anymore because of cost and complexity, but expect novices to figure it out or service yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you don't respond MS, at least have an email to give you info. </p>
<p>
Pull this bus over here. I want off! It is no longer fun! But the software gamers are having fun and thats what counts!</p>

            <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are here and definitely listening and trying to help whenever we can.</p>
<p>We have a team of Community Moderators and Support Engineers that answer hundreds of posts every week (I don't know the exact number but I promise it's high) on the Outlook.com forum, and many other product categories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do believe these people genuinely do their best in trying to help users out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, there are many product experts who are not affiliated with Microsoft but who are here in the community, volunteering their time for the sole purpose of helping users out. They are awesome and we work closely together to surface and identify
 issues when they occur so that we can solve ASAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that sometimes a product or piece of software doesn't work as intended but it's important to realize that there are many reasons and causes for bugs and failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it's the user's computer or browser or internet connection that is at fault. Sometimes it is our servers or products, but we need to troubleshoot that with each user to figure out the main causes which are often times different each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all in all, I hope you will reconsider the notion that no one is here to help, because we are and we are happy to assist everyday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and best regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            <p>Listen, I appreciate that there are people looking, watching and reading, but it is real frustrating when something happens, or does not happen, that there is know place to at least email. They have the right to contact me, but I cannot say anything back.
 that is unfair or unjust and they don't know whats really happening. </p>
<p>What if I took their email away for a week, or take their cell. I just needed my contacts. The old applications would let me access my contacts anytime and also lets me keep my trash for a long time. I had a legal case a few years ago, and I was so glad
 that I had three years of trash to research from. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So generally everything is going well, though there was a huge fiasco where I was locked out of my own account. Then it seemed to take forever to prove I own it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why wouldn't a consistent IP number and a couple quick questions solve that problem. Instead it took a week and a lot of lost time and huge grief. I sell and use ebay, and that turned my life upside down. Contact me, let me respond and let me back in and
 get under way again. What a mess that was. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The techs expect that the average person talks the way they do. thats not the case! The verbiage used most of the time, I could not understand what the heck they were asking, which added to the problem, and I could not ask them what they were asking. Just
 a hugely inefficient way of resolving. I didn't, but I wanted to cry in desperation, while they get to set the pace and the standards and I had to play along. It all could have taken ten minutes, if I could just communicate, but its one sided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the old applications back and I truly hate the cloud idea. I don't trust anybody but me top protect my things and I could always have access. Now I get locked out.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last issue was that you forced me to change my pass. Ok thats fine, but the very next day, after putting together a long and complex email with attachments and a lengthy writing, I hit send, and all gets stopped. They now force me to log out and then
 back it. WTF! Why! Stop that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also hate typing everything out. Every time I do, the reader never reads the email in its entirety and I must start again. Verbally, I would hear that they missed something and correct it then. Texting is for robots, not humans! Nobody reads your thoughts
 correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, let me off this ride. the fun is gone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jed</p>
<p>
</p><p>See how convoluted this message got to be, and I am tired of editing and re editing. What a mess and a time waster!</p>

            <p>Jed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get it and I know what you're talking about. This community cannot solve these problems for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that phone support 1-1 would be ideal to get things working, fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you find a local person to help you out with the issues you are seeing, because they most likely could do a better job at making everything work for you. You don't necessarily need assistance from Microsoft as a lot of the issues you describe
 can be solved without our involvement. It just sounds like you need to have some in-person help from a friendly local.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't be able to make you feel better after all the time you spent in this community. I can't get you that time back. But we are just not able to support every scenario for everyone here although we try our best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in regards to the cloud idea, as you describe it. Know that from that standpoint, there is no difference in how Outlook.com functions now and how Hotmail did 10 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and best regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

 a document as a pdf, the Conduit font looks correct again? Strange enough, in Excel the font does looks correct. It's a major problem for me because I now can't properly lay-out my documents in Word anymore.. What can I do?

<p>How do you mean with cannot install an email account?<br />
How do you want to browse the internet? Over WIFI or 3 G?<br />
Open Office is not an option for the Windows Phone because there is an Office Hub already.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop virus warning pop-ups when I open hyperlinks in powerpoint</h2>
                    I am trying to link several documents into a powerpoint presentation- some are pdf and some are word.
<div>I have two problems:</div>
<div>1. I get two virus warning pop up boxes when I click the hyperlinks- it makes the presentation clunky</div>
<div>2. When the document is opened the &nbsp;powerpoint presentation does not stay in the slideshow view.</div>
<div>Is there anyway round these issues? Using 2008 version of powerpoint:mac</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

            <p>All those warning dialogs are the result of loud (mostly undeserved IMHO) criticism in the press about the supposed lack of security in Office products. It's all about Microsoft "doing something" to "protect" users from themselves. Given how badly Microsoft
 was burned by these criticisms I sorta doubt they will remove these useless annoying warning messages, but it doesn't hurt to ask &nbsp;for their demise using this web form:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/product-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/mac/product-feedback</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't think there's much that can be done about PowerPoint not staying in full screen mode. That has a lot to do with how windows are managed in Mac OS (which one has focus, etc). Again, asking Microsoft to look into the matter would be done in a separate
 feedback using the same web form I just mentioned.</p>

    <title>Easy Conditional formatting macro for multiple names - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mooshak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Easy Conditional formatting macro for multiple names</h2>
                    <p>I have a report that I pull daily, and then put it into a pivot&nbsp;that gives me a team member's name is column A, and a number in column B. Is there a simple macro formula I could use, then repeat for each name as to what conditional formatting I want?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example. I want John, Jacob, and Sam to have any number below 5 highlight green, between 5 and 9 yellow, and 10+ as red.</p>
<p>but then for Hank, Frank, and Luke I want any number under 7 as green, between 7 and 11 as yellow, and 12+ red.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
