<p>Type disk management in the search bar and hit enter, wait about 20 seconds or so for it to load your drive information. Now maximise it or drag the corner of the box to make it big enough to see. Disk 0, the top one should be the one we are looking for.
 This disk should contain the 100mb partition (don't touch it, I will explain at the end of the post), and then it should contain the 443GB (note, that it is GB) and then it will probably contain unused space with the remainder of your available disk space.
 If this is so then put the mouse pointer over the unused disk space portion of the graph bar and right click, select create partiton, you will be asked how large you want it, I advise you just use the default (all remaining space). Now the remaining graph
 should reflect that it is an unformated partition, right click on it, select format and I advise that you format it NTFS and insure it has a drive letter assigned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 100 MB partition contains all of your boot files and other files that must remain uncompressed if you ever decide to use bitlocker. Bitlocker on the boot drive is overkill in my opinion for the average user, I do use it on one of my machines on a second
 hardrive. Note, your motherboard must support TPM in order to use Bitlocker, something to read up on on&nbsp;rainy day but be careful, you can lose data if you mess it up.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Center Configuration Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> free-kill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center Configuration Error</h2>
                    Hi. I've found people with this problem all over the internet but I've yet to get a definitive solution.<br />
<br />
My PC runs Vista Home Premium with Media Center all great. It is connected to my network wirelessly.<br />
<br />
My Xbox is connected to the network directly, as it's sitting right next to it.<br />
<br />
My PC finds the Xbox in "Network" and it comes up as an extender when I launch Media Center. My Xbox gives me the 8 digit code and I put it in. I tell it I want to share media, and then it goes to the configuring extender bit. It then says Configuration Error.<br />
<br />
I've enabled Media Player through my firewall, opened all the necessary ports locally and have no other firewalls up. I have no idea what's going on.<br />
<br />
I'd like to get this up and running, so any help is welcome.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just realised I put this in entirely the wrong place. Move please, mod?

<h2>            Windows 7 computer connecting to Airport Extreme with USB external hard drive attached. Flash drive shows up for network mapping but hard drive does not.</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;airport extreme hard drive</div>
Using Windows 7 and Airport Extreme. &nbsp;The Airport Extreme has a USB port that can be used to mount an external hard drive that is accessible over the wireless connection. &nbsp;Only thing is, I can only get a 2gb flash drive to show up for mapping. &nbsp;When I use other
 hard drives, they never show up for mapping. &nbsp;They do show up as connected in the Airport Extreme, but are not seen by my PC. &nbsp; The internet has a rumor that the hard drives will only show up on a PC if they are FAT32 format....that no other formated hard
 drive would work. &nbsp;What do you know about my compatibility problems with the hard drives?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check for firmware updates for the Airport Extreme.<br />
<br />
Airport Extreme<br />

<a href="http://www.apple.com/support/airport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/airport/</a><br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
Although I think the issue is really the Airport Extreme also check for Windows 7 WiFi&nbsp;updates.<br />
Check with the System Maker and the actual device maker for driver updates.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually using the methods&nbsp;<br />
below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are<br />
found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions.<br />
(The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Windows<br />
7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

                    <p>I would like to enable AHCI on my Win 7 64bit install it is at present&nbsp;set on ide as I did not realise I had to set it in the bios before install.I do not really want to mess about with the regitry fix and was wondering if anyone had tried to do it without
 ..I have 2 sata drives one boot and the other data..What I was thinking was is it possible to enable the data drive in the bios to AHCI without editing the registry and leaving the boot drive as it is..The theory being that once the data drive has been converted
 to AHCI and the driver loaded would it then be possible to go back into the bios and then enable AHCI on the boot drive without all this meesing around in the registry..Would this work ?? Has ayone tried..I realise if you only have one drive then you only
 have one option..All the sata ports on my asus motherboard can be configured seperately..Hope the above makes some sense and very sorry for a rather lengthy post</p>

<p>What you suggest will not work since the controller where the drives are mounted is what is set to AHCI not the drives.</p>
<p>Therefore the operating system must have the proper drivers inorder to boot at all when the controller is set to AHCI.</p>
<p>Your only option is a registry change or reinstall.</p>

    <title>DVR Capture Issue&#58; Not Recording Full Length Clips - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergeant-rex77  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVR Capture Issue&#58; Not Recording Full Length Clips</h2>
                    <p>So this is something that’s been really bothering me for a while. Many times the Xbox does not record the DVR captures for the right length of time. For example, let’s say I play a match in online PvP where I feel like I had some memorable moments that I
 would like to share. I open up my guide and select the “Record the last 5 minutes” option. After which I get a pop up saying “Clip recorded”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I go into my captures expecting to see a full 5 minute length video recording of my last game, only to find an underwhelming 15 second clip, that failed to capture anything interesting.</p>
<p>This is a continous problem that I’ve run into since I got my Xbox. I’m not sure why this happens but it’s extremely frustrating. Especially because I often like to share these clips with other people. Does anyone else have this problem? I’d very much like
 it to get fixed. I hate to sound whiny but this is something that happens all the time and it’s pretty annoying. I record clips very often and most of the time they come out much, shorter than they were supposed to. Sometimes it literally records a 6 second
 clip, when I told it to record 5 or 3 minutes. This is a bug that I hope can get patched soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you tried any of the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/games/troubleshooting/recording-problems-with-gamedvr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
troubleshooting here?</a>&nbsp;The first step is a power cycle of the console,. which may fix the issue you are having.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't, does setting the timer to '5 minutes' BEFORE starting the game (and then recording a clip, rather than leaving the game to change the timer and come back) fix the issue for you?</p>

<p>I would Imagine this is due to the sizes of the game downloads. on the 360 your looking at from about 5-7 gb. On the Xbox one, at a minimum these sizes are doubled.</p>

<h2>            Windows Mail won&#39;t sync Gmail Sent Mail folder</h2>
                    <p>I've added a Gmail account in Windows Mail and all folders sync properly except the Sent Items folder which is empty. If I force a sync then it goes through the motions without any errors but still shows the folder as empty. Any suggestions?</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the HP computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />3. Have you ever run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />Chances are (99.99%) your HP computer came with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it. Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.
<br />
<br />4. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.
<br />
<br />5. Do you access the Gmail account on any other devices (e.g., mobile phone; iPad; another computer)?
<br />

<p>Hi PA Bear, answers to your questions are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a.&nbsp; The laptop was purchased in July 2017.</p>
<p>1b.&nbsp; I bought it from a specialist business laptop company that I've used for 10+ years.</p>
<p>1c.&nbsp; The laptop was brand new, I had to wait while it was custom built by HP to my spec.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; To the best of my knowledge, the laptop was not supplied with McAfee or Norton.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I haven't run the McAfee removal tool.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Windows version 1703 (OS Build 15063.674).</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I access the Gmail account (including sent items) on my tablet and phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another piece of information is that I also have a Hotmail account set up in Windows Mail and it syncs the Sent Items folder just fine.</p>
        </p>

            Yes, I access the hotmail account on my phone as well and it works well. The only problem is syncing the Sen Items of my Gmall account in Windows Mail.

            1. Have you enabled IMAP access for the Gmail account?
<br />
<br />In your browser, go to your Gmail account and log in:
<br />
<br />a. Click the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner and select "Settings." 
<br />b. In Settings, click the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab. 
<br />c. In the IMAP Access area, check "Enable IMAP." 
<br />d. Click the Save Changes button.
<br />
<br />2. And did you authorize the Mail app to use (access) the Gmail account?
<br />
<br />a. Go to google.com, log into your Google account, and click on your photo in the upper right corner, then click the "My Account" button. 
<br />b. Next, navigate to Sign-in &amp; Security &gt; Connected Apps &amp; Sites &gt; Allow less secure apps, then set that option to "ON." 
<br />c. Wait for a minute or two for the change to be registered.
<br />
<br />[I assume you've done both of the above but I wanted to double-check.]
<br />
<br />3. Have you tried deleting/removing the Gmail account from the Mail app, restarting the computer, and then configuring it a brand-new account?

            If you (a) delete the Gmail account from the Mail app &amp; restart the computer, (b) download/run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool (ignore the log) [1] &amp; restart the computer again, then (c) add the Gmail account back to the Mail app, does the behaviour persist?

            Same issue as described by others here. Video calls or audio calls will connect for a couple seconds and then freeze. Sometimes they wouldn't connect at all. It keeps saying there is an internet connectivity problem. I did a speed test and my download
 speed is 81 meg/sec, upload was 80 meg/sec. I literally have changed nothing. I then updated to 7.40.0.103 and that made no difference. I just tried again this morning and I still have the same issue. I uninstalled and re-installed the software as well and
 that did not change anything. I went in and delete the config.xml and that made no difference. I reset internet explorer as recommended in other posts and that has not helped. I've tried on 3 different desktop computers and get the same outcome. However, I
 skyped from Iphone to Iphone on the same network as the computers and that worked. Any help would be appreciated. I work at a TV station and we use skype often for interviews. The account I'm using is WHEC.TV1 if that makes any difference. I also tried my
 own account on the desktops and had the same issue so it's not account related. One last thing. I tried turning off my antivirus software and that did not help. Please let me know if anybody has any answers.<br />

<h2>            Project settings won&#39;t change</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I connect my laptop up to my TV my screen goes black. Previously it would work but for some reason it wont work anymore. So i checked the project settings and it was on PC Screen Only, which still doesn't explain why my laptop goes black.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried to change the settings to Duplicate but every time i close out of it it just changes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank,</p>
<p>Mitchell</p>

<p>Not from the unboxing pictures I've seen. The power input on the one from the guy who got his from Target two weeks early showed an input voltage of 100-127v at 50/60hz.<br />
<br />
Best solution is to find a power brick from a compatible region.</p>

<p>The Xbox One is launching in regions with 220-240v power, like the UK. A power brick or a console from one of those regions would work. Discussion of transformers/voltage converters is outside the scope of this forum.</p>

    <title>How do I create a windows 8 recovery disk without using the recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> minjaepark  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I create a windows 8 recovery disk without using the recovery disk feature within the os&#63;</h2>
                    After a windows update recently, my computer will not let me log in. The os loads fine, but it will not prompt me to log in at all. I know the computer isnt frozen because the clock and the network bar changes. I've searched online, but it seems like there
 isn't a way to make a repair disk without using the recovery disk making feature within the os which requires me to be able to actually log in first. I know I should have made the recovery disk asap, but that's too late. So, is there another way of creating
 a recovery disk?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bios appears before Win 8 loads...it's the first thing you see. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would hit something like the Delete, Esc, F11 or F2, for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a feature in Win 8 called fast Startup that skips some of this stuff, but a Restart (if available) will enable it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you do a forced shutdown with the power button, it should then appear.</p>
        </p>

            Tried, but my Sony Vaio wouldn't let me. Being a laptop it also does not have a Restart button.. A forced shutdown did not help either.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also,,,here is a method to get into Safe Mode that may enable you to do a repair or get into windows enough to create the disks you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart your machine....then hit CTRL-ALT-DEL...before the BLUE WINDOW....this causes the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine to restart.</p>

            I feel so stupid. I just checked my Sony Vaio Manual and there is an Assist button that leads me to the System Recovery Options. I am refreshing my computer at the moment. Thank you so much though! You made someone's day brighter sir/ma'am. I will report
 if this lets me log in again.

            <p>Hi user202,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to be signed in to your email account on Live Mail for you to be able to view the contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you've verify that your contacts are available on your Hotmail web based account, if signing in to your email account in Live Mail still does not list your contacts, please re-establish the connection of your email account to Live Mail.
</p>
<p><span>Here are the steps to reconfigure the account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><span>Remove an email account from Live Mail:</span></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Right-click the account you want to remove, and then click <b>Remove account.</b></span></p>
<p><span>2. Click <b>Yes</b> to confirm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><span>Add an email account in Live Mail:</span></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1. </span></span><span>Open Windows&nbsp;Live Mail by clicking the <b>Start</b> button. In the search box, type
<b>Mail</b>, and then, in the list of results, click <b>Windows&nbsp;Live Mail</b>. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>2. </span></span><span>In the lower-left corner, click <b>Mail</b>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. </span></span><span>Click the <b>Accounts</b> tab, and then click
<b>Email</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>4. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type your email address, password, and display name, and then click
<b>Next</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>5. </span></span><span>Follow any additional steps, and then click
<b>Next</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>6. </span></span><span>Click <b>Add another email account</b> if you want to add more accounts, or click
<b>Finish</b> to start using Windows Live Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Notes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>To add a Gmail account, change your Gmail settings to enable POP access before adding the account.</span>
</li><li><span>To add a Yahoo! account, you need to have Yahoo! Mail Plus. </span></li><li><span>If you're asked for server information while adding an account, check your provider's website or contact their customer service to find out what you have to do to finish setting up your email account.</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P</span><span>lease update us with the results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            Even if you add your other email accounts to Windows Live Mail, you do NOT get their Contacts List sent with them. I am having this problem as well and trying to figure out how to get all of my Contacts from Yahoo and G-mail transferred over to Windows

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you add your account in Windows Live Mail, did you check if the server settings is correct? It might be the reason why you cannot see the contacts on Windows Live Mail when you add your account on it. Kindly re-configure your account again and please
 refer to the link below for instruction on how to do it:</p>

<h2>            Any way to track down a stolen Surface Pro 4 other than &#34;account.microsoft.com&#47;devices&#34; &#63;</h2>
                    Hi, unfortunately I had my Surface Pro 4 stolen from me last week. &nbsp;I have been checking the site "account.microsoft.com/devices" but of course it continuously says device offline/try again. &nbsp;I'm assuming the only way this function would actually work
 is if they logged in to my @live.com account/profile, which they will probably not be able to do. &nbsp;Are they able to wipe the whole OS or bypass that login screen somehow? &nbsp;Is there ANY other way to track down this device perhaps by serial number or something?
 &nbsp;I had just purchased it and am so upset it was stolen!! &nbsp;It was $1,000 and going to be my work PC. &nbsp;Any advice on ways to potentially track it down would be much appreciated.. Thx

    <title>Windows 8.1 cursor frozen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freedom2b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 cursor frozen</h2>
                    <p>Bought a new Toshiba laptop, it has Windows 8.1 on it.&nbsp; I've had it 24 hours when this happened.&nbsp; Yesterday afternoon it did a massive update via wi fi.&nbsp; Now, when I turn it on, it goes to the lock screen.&nbsp; I CAN log in; at this point in the process, the
 cursor moves.&nbsp; So I log in and that's it, the cursor is not responsive.&nbsp; I am at the START page.&nbsp; I can use arrows to move across different things on there.&nbsp; I can move to DESKTOP and hit enter to get to the desktop.&nbsp; Still, cursor is frozen so can't do a
 thing.<br />
<br />
There are a few icons on the desktop, one is Firefox.&nbsp; I can use arrows to get on that, then hit enter and connect to the web.&nbsp; But cursor is still frozen, so can't do much once I am on there.&nbsp; Oh, and it insists the web connection is 'limited' whatever that
 means.<br />
<br />
I am on another computer to type this, as the new one is not usable.<br />
<br />
Is this something I can sort myself, and if so how?&nbsp; I am NOT a techy!&nbsp; If this is something I can somehow do here at home, please move slowly and step by step.<br />
<br />
Typically with a new computer, I do all the personalization (load Firefox, set colors, remove some icons I do not use, etc.) and THEN make my restore discs; so I do not have any discs to get it back to when it worked, as I hadn't finished personalizing it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm putting this in "Activate," not sure if that is the proper place.</p>

            <p>Thanks for offering to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I verified the SNMP selection in the ports was turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since another machine can print remotely, I see that it has the port described as "Virtual printer port for USB".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the machine that won't print, the port that I sort of forced to create, is "Standard TCP/IP Port".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, it would be nice if the print troubleshooter would fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a clean slate, I removed the print device, and rebooted the machine.&nbsp; Now, I'm going to determine the first thing that fails trying to add the printer properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add a Printer (The printer I want isn't listed)</p>
<p>Select a printer by name (Select the machine, and then select the printer)</p>
<p>Select next, "<strong>Connect to Printer</strong>" - Windows couldn't connect to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It had no problem displaying the machine name icon and the printer name icon that I selected.</p>

            You can try using Vista drivers. If they don't work, you would need to contact HP to see if they plan to provide drivers for these printers. The hardware mftr. (HP in this case) writes the drivers for its device(s). The hardware mftr. is the *only* one
 who will do this, not the creator of the operating system you're using (Windows).&nbsp;All the hardware drivers that come with Windows 7 were written by the various hardware mftrs. and provided to Microsoft for inclusion. If the hardware mftr. has no plans to write
 Windows 7 (or other operating system) drivers for a particular device, then that's the end of that story.<br />
