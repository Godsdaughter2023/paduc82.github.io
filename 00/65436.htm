<h2>            Cannot send email but can receive email</h2>
                    I am unable to send email with or without attachments. I routinely send my Quick Book Invoices using this medium. I am able to receive mail but can send none with or without attachments. My Internet provider has no answers for me other than my settings
 are correct and Microsoftisn'tbeing helpful. Thanks in advance

<h2>            Windows Update not working in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Desktop running W7 Home Premium 64-bit.&nbsp; About a month ago, realized that Windows Update was no longer working, hangs on "downloading updates."&nbsp; System checked for viruses, etc, and it is clean.&nbsp; No other changes have been made to this machine.&nbsp; Tried many
 suggestions offered here, no joy.&nbsp; My system is set to notify me when updates are available so I can install them.&nbsp; Lately it has been erratic, showing different quantities of updates from one day to another, but I can't get any of them to download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's hoping that someone out there has a magic bullet, or at least a procedure I can follow as a non-tech user, to get back on track.&nbsp;

            Hi,
<br />
<br />No version of Windows Mail is going away, and nobody needs to change to a different email service.
<br />Yes, you may need to change your email settings, but ONLY if you use Windows Live Mail 2012 (the PC email program) with a Microsoft email service such as Hotmail, Live, or outlook.com.
<br />
<br />If you use Windows Live Mail 2012 with any other email service – for example, if you have a BT, Virgin, Comcast, Yahoo, Gmail or other email address – then you don’t need to change anything. You are not affected. This does not concern you.
<br />
<br />Please let me know, if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards:
<br />Engr. Malik Yasir

            Thank you for your reply. AT&amp;T finally got with it and addressed my problem. It turns out that they created my problem, not my e-mail program. Now, they are going to charge me to get it fixed. Sigh!

    <title>Creating a disk image in Win XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pi guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a disk image in Win XP</h2>
                    This is so sad that I have to come here to find out how to do this. Microsoft keeps going out of their way to make their OS's user-unfriendly.
<br />
<br />
I wish to make an .iso image of my netbook running XP. There is no backup utility in Accessories, Administrative Tools, Control Panel, Computer or anywhere else. When I do a search on the MS KB I get results for 8.0, 8.1, Vista, everything except XP even though
 I put XP in the search criteria and filtered for XP.<br />
<br />
So anyway I cannot find the backup anywhere and would like some help from you nice people. I(f anyone can steer me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.<br />
<br />
Computer: Acer Aspire One Netbook<br />
1 GB RAM<br />
160 GB HDD<br />
Win XP SP3<br />

            If you don't see Backup in your XP System Tools could it be that you are running XP Home?<br />
<br />
If the MS Answers forums would prompt for fundamental system information when a new question is asked, we would know these things.<br />
<br />
The XP Backup utility does not get installed automatically with XP Home, but you can install it.&nbsp; Even if you have XP Pro, you can still install it if it is missing.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Backup program is installed automatically on XP Professional, but not on XP Home. If you have the genuine bootable XP Home installation CD, insert it into your system and browse to this folder:<br />
<br />
\ValueAdd\MSFT\NTBACKUP<br />
<br />
Double click the ntbackup.msi file to begin the installation.<br />
<br />
Here is a nice Microsoft article that tells you all about it:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=302894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=302894</a><br />
<br />
Here is another article that tells you how to do it:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.winxptutor.com/ntbackup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winxptutor.com/ntbackup.htm</a><br />
<br />
If you don't have an installation CD and need to download the ntbackup.msi file, here is the link so you can download it:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.winxptutor.com/ntbackup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winxptutor.com/ntbackup.htm</a><br />
<br />
If you are using/relying on the built in NT Backup to backup your system, that is primitive technology (obviously - since it will ask you for a floppy).&nbsp; If you have a disaster (even a minor one), you are going to have a big problem trying to recovery your
 stuff if you don't have a floppy drive.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a backup, it makes sense to use modern technology - and that technology is not built in to XP and it never will be.<br />
<br />
A popular one folks seem to like is from Acronis and they have a free try/buy version that you can purchase later if you like it.<br />
<br />
With the Acronis (free 30 day trial) you backup, you can make a bootable CD or bootable USB (that's modern, huh?) and use that in the event of a disaster. If/when you like it, at the time of this writing the cost for the full version was a mere $49.99.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.acronis.com/?adpos=1t1&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=e&amp;gclid=CKay1a2sxLoCFadFMgodLRMAyA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acronis.com/?adpos=1t1&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=e&amp;gclid=CKay1a2sxLoCFadFMgodLRMAyA</a><br />
<br />
There are many other options if you do a little Googling.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness Al Gore invented the Internet.<br />
<br />
Here are some products that other forum users suggest might be appealing.&nbsp; Use Google to find them and read about their features, and capabilities.&nbsp; Some have free versions or you can purchase them to get more features:<br />
<br />
If you have or purchase a Western Digital drive, you can get a version of Acronis True Image free from WD:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.wdc.com/product/downloaddetail.asp?swid=119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.wdc.com/product/downloaddetail.asp?swid=119</a><br />
<br />
Or you can obtain backup and cloning software separately (this is not a comprehensive list and is no particular order; some are free, others not):<br />
<br />
Marcium Reflect (free version)<br />
Acronis True Image Home&nbsp; (free trial version)<br />
EaseUS ToDo Backup (free version)<br />
Paragon Drive Copy&nbsp; or Partition Manager Personal<br />
Paragon Backup and Recovery (free version)<br />
Casper<br />
Norton Ghost&nbsp; (discontinued)<br />
<br />
Some disk cloning software ideas for you to Google:<br />
<br />
XXClone<br />
Marcium Reflect (Free Version)<br />
DriveImageXML<br />
Acronis True Image Home 11<br />
EaseUS ToDo Backup (free version)<br />
Paragon Drive Copy&nbsp; or Partition Manager Personal<br />
Paragon Backup and Recovery (free version)<br />
Casper<br />
Norton Ghost&nbsp; (discontinued)<br />
Clonezilla<br />
<br />
Whatever method you choose, it is prudent to test your method from end to end to be sure it works.<br />
<br />
You can do something like create a temporary folder somewhere on your system and copy a bunch of files into it, perform your backup, then delete the temporary folder and be sure that you can recover it from your backup.<br />
<br />
The day you need your backup/restore process to work is not the day to find out it doesn't work.<br />

    <title>People App Missing Many Contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithincedarrapids  say:</h3>
<h2>            People App Missing Many Contacts</h2>
                    <p>I use my Microsoft Account Outlook.com account for my primary email, contacts, and calendar.&nbsp; I have it synced to my Windows phone, Surface Pro Tablet, and my primary desktop computer.&nbsp; On the desktop, I use both the Windows Store Aps (mostly)&nbsp;and Microsoft
 Outlook (for complicated stuff only).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem:&nbsp; The people app on my primary computer shows only about half of my contacts, even though it says that it is "up to date".&nbsp; The Outlook contacts, phone people app, tablet people app&nbsp;are all synchronizing fine, and match the contacts viewed
 in Outlook.com.&nbsp; Only my primary computer won't sync correctly.&nbsp; I have tried all the techniques listed in these forums (sync store licenses, re-install app, sfc /scannow, etc. etc.) at least twice in the past two days, and nothing has changed anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a duplicate of previous posts, but I noticed that they are quite old and have not really identified a way to correct the problem.&nbsp; I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me how to force a complete re-sync of the people app on my PC.&nbsp; Re-installing
 the app clearly does not do it.</p>

Virtual PC will not work for this process perhaps, or might but you will go back to default factory settings =

You will have to legibly pay for a brand downgrade to the upgrade hope that you get a system at low cost unless you actually officially owned one. 


  The only way to do this without being one on a situation though it is required to get the stupid software of hackers due to the fact they stole all the keys and Microsoft other situations... though I do not know whether software testing counts here with registry and that what is posted here would be legal or get in trouble the people who distributed the file in the first place. I am not a thief or a programmer but this could work, (might or might not work) 



First in the release of windows there is a CD or whatever... I will not give out the link to this knowing I would be in trouble for distributing if so I had it and willingly gave it out, which I was not the one to do so.

 a system at low cost unless you actually officially owned one. The only way to do this without being one on a situation though it is required to get the stupid software of hackers due to the fact they stole all the keys and Microsoft other situations... though
 I do not know whether software testing counts here with registry and that what is posted here would be legal or get in trouble the people who distributed the file in the first place. I am not a thief or a programmer but this could work, (might or might not
 work) First in the release of windows there is a CD or whatever... I will not give out the link to this knowing I would be in trouble for distributing if so I had it and willingly gave it out, which I was not the one to do so. The contents of the CD contain
 the following (Do not know the size and other files)... (Though unless you burn this... it will not work. (Burning is option = 1 or USB if lucky = 2) [BOOT] AMD64 DOCS I386 SUPPORT SETUP WIN51 WINAP AUTORUN XP64.CORP-XISO (That is right... This is the corporate
 CD to Microsoft x64 bit...) (I cannot say where I got this knowing it might as well be gone, or they go searching for it finding a main distributor and getting a lot of people in trouble for no reason besides that one person. = So good luck with that. Tried
 USB with XP (might as well not be stupid, me being stupid, and burn it.) and it will not work due to some settings or it is not run-able on Windows 8. Yes, I legally owned all copy of Windows at one point from Windows XP-7 and 8 and others had made free open
 source with Windows. Windows official was never a free operating system or so I was told by those of the company and now I can see people do not know besides how to trust an honest hacker and liars messing up systems to that of someone who is actually legit.
 (Not a hacker, I am a software tester.) Professional and the Enterprise tested. that were legit to the point they did that patch thing and screwed people's registry up (as read in other forums or files were missing). The difference between the editions is
 a failure of the company to maintain. You will need also something else, but the file is a certain type of file that the company uses so I cannot say by means who put it out there. For those who knew of the file before all this junk happened where people could
 not recover their system or get the latest protection has to do with file maintenance with service and the fact of non-support after people had legit hopefully had their key lost or stolen used by other people and those hopefully not making better versions
 of quality lacking or fake for the having the latest edition taken for the future which Microsoft said it will no longer distribute keys for its product (as stated by another tech forum). I found a site that makes an illegal windows version genuine but that
 is not allowable (the information to post) here and I forgot what the forum was called but I do believe I might be able to find it again. And whatever mod runs that site = thank you for the information so I saved it knowing the viruses from others that could
 affect the registry distance range or the settings could be fixed if it is legal that you own it, as to say the interface. So I will say it is you have to search the web for that knowing a lot of people would be in trouble for whoever stole besides tried to
 help the public to begin with and society does not agree to the legalities cause nobody follows the actual TOS of web administration without a fight toward ownership for what they have (others so not a good reason). Option 3: Use the XP aio file from a random
 person who distributed it on public domain hopefully knowing that the real one is found which is not an ISO but I hate to mention to the company that it is a keygen because they always have a threat about either a virus (false positive or real), or a keygen
 rather for the conducts of business and yes I understand that reason only for wanting to stay up to date and monitor your products. Some keygens though they had a virus or malware may harm the registry but some will not as they had been tested or validated
 by some developers and others considered just a worm or WS1, which is not serious compared to back then of what my brother had on his own machine a while back. (Side story of worms acting as trojans.) These are not toys but rather some programs hopefully can
 connect without having something that affect another user's machine (and hopefully people have the curious not to bother other people but use their own machine only for educational and not to destroy peoples' effort.) Because without this you will not be able
 to install your windows fresh or rather, to use the machine whether you own it and the machine be legal or not based on license and validity. XP stopped support a while back for it and people were locked out of the image during the year 2013 when there is
 still support or such for it still before the year 2014; well there is only one work around way to recover this for your system and to get the updated stuff that is still on support for your machine as a whole unless they make all these scattered pages and
 cheat people because the company is world wide, so it is unknown who did put it out there or who did not advise people before hand with let others into their own company copy the design. Go back to the support folder of the Corporate CD... and it will have
 some tools if so the right ISO be found and not corrupted or fake. The file is out was there distributed to the public and yes (reasons for why I am saying below.) All I want to do is stop having people being ripped off or let others be aware on how to fix
 this mess of Windows to a point I have no clue what is going on with the high lack of support management knowing why in the heck hackers had the latest version to begin with. Yes everything might be done manual by you or others as they decide we take no responsibility
 or liability for the software you use from us messing up your own machine as so stated by those of Microsoft. So be prepared to have a backup or a legal windows CD that is actually yours (other wise you may forget this I told you). Realize the keys were generic
 originally with their own machines and the product keys could be found in it until the people stole or distributed them from different brands with sort of unlimited license as people used much to cheat, or the company gave us the wrong disc or no recovery
 disc with the install CD. As mentioned retail should come with that but yes so true to the finished product if you use it rightly. For example... My parents a long time ago had a Dell Vista but a HP machine where as the brands were compatible but the right
 manufacture did not show up nor could the product be validated with the hardware due to the fact it would read Dell disc and HP hardware. There was no HP disc at the time that was given instead but an invalid CD for the product (today or later there is a brand
 specific hopefully with all and to say what people actually worked for). I cannot remember the time but surely I do recall. Anyway skipping the rest of that story, my machine had 24.7 support by HP until the operating system was lost and everything had to
 be done through manual measures. I am shocked to even notice my machine is 6 or 7 years old and still compatible with old hardware to new OS Windows 8. I own a HP Pavilion PC with a tower (though the processors and hardware today are better with memory questionable
 with extension shortened or lengthened.) back then were not good or the hardware be improved through settings of much with memory, bios, firmware, memory, etc... The worst thing one could do is end up in the red zone of grub DOS, instead or also of blue screen
 to going dead black and not have a command line to a computer crash or having to reset the PC from a command-line typing DOS (typing the drive requirement in order for the drives to work with paths to unlimited with trial and error) unless you know what you
 are doing or can at least have a backup disc to USB, or perhaps reading zeros to ones. Binary surly will not save one here unless words actually had a meaning to the functions they do in that format. As one could try. (This is off topic but helpful advice.)
 Now they have updated DOS so you do not need to worry about that but do so use on a test machine of yours if you have an extra old machine or just one of your own being extra. Latest was found on the web so good luck again. Windows XP must be installed by
 the method of the sysprep file found in the deploy folder of support tools. (Do not use the factory app here unless added extra files with the right settings or (without factory created setup file) as is will not work on the machine. If so it is not compatible
 with Windows 8, there is a way and you do not want to transfer the files or migrate the settings with the migrate tools found in the cabinet folder. Solution = Use setupmgr and it will show you five editions of Windows pick what you want or what is easiest
 for you or advanced. Steps: 1. When choosing an option on the Type of setup, go to Sysprep setup which is this -------- (setupmgr) 2. Pick from Windows of the following editions: Home XP, XP Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server Enterprise Edition,
 or Enterprise Web Edition. 3. Say yes to a fully automated install. 4. You will see the settings manager and the rest of the settings in order to setup your windows. 5. If you know the information or partial for your PC, you will be able to adjust what is
 in the setup manger. (Some you may not know but be sure to input the right information and advanced settings are optional I think,) Fill in what you can. I cannot explain everything but you might understand. (BASIC SETTINGS) - Name and Organization - Display
 Settings - Timezone (will not work or optional = skip) - Type the product key (Some options or OS versions are not on the list, you will be able to update these later with the tools I mentioned and others on the web. Be sure to use the product key for the
 version that is the correct key) - Computer Name - Network Components - Workgroup Or Domain (Do so put WORKGROUP if you do not have a DOMAIN or a main network of your own or if you are connected to one. Usually this means putting more guest operating systems
 on one machine unless the domain is a machine yourself will affect settings. Otherwise you are the owner and congrats. For DOMAINS I think you need a key from a Microsoft Administrator and I do not think without valid reason that may be provided as was the
 way to recover Windows suggested. Yes I am willing to help out here and this is only for those who actually had a legal version of Windows. Practically everyone does and if not and you have a fake windows then I feel bad for the people who actually never heard
 of much. Oh wait it is better to say this in positive note that one has but they did not get it legal or stole from the company. Like I said before, I do not distribute this nor did I make the programs mentioned. (ADVANCED SETTINGS) -Telephony -Regional Settings
 -Language Group -Install Printers -Run Once -Additional Commands -Identification String 6. When you are done, you should get a file... produced as or called an answer sheet of the type you recommended hopefully not the CD version. (Example Below.) Be sure
 to write down this information of the GUI and the PRODUCT KEY for system only (Using the wrong key = Sorry, wrong key.) = DO NOT TYPE THIS... YOU WILL GET AN ANSWER SHEET IN THE SYSPREP FOR YOUR OWN MACHINE. [GuiUnattended] AdminPassword=(censored) EncryptedAdminPassword=Yes
 OEMSkipRegional=1 OemSkipWelcome=1 [UserData] ProductKey=(censored) FullName="Myself or You" OrgName="Microsoft" (They do own it after all... so I give them credit = no credit is given to those who intended not to help peoples' issues.) ComputerName= (manual
 name) [Display] Vrefresh=(refresh rate of your machine. For this go to screen resolution by right clicking on your screen if applicable.) Go to advanced settings and you will notice your Adapter, Monitor, and Color Settings. Do not mess with these properties
 as it checks some of the hardware, and etc unless you know what is compatible... Feel free if you can get the information into your tower or PC laptop to Desktop and realize what setting is best for your machine) [TapiLocation] CountryCode=1 [SetupMgr] DistFolder=C:\sysprep\i386
 DistShare=windist [Identification] JoinWorkgroup=WORKGROUP [Networking] InstallDefaultComponents=Yes 7. Test the sysprep file. DISCLAIMER: This has not been tested but if I am right it should bring back the XP. You may lose your Windows machine accidentally
 but on purpose, or it will ask you whether or not to continue. Do so type the settings as mentioned from the setup file if you have to. This has not been tested yet besides by the company meaning I have no clue what they do to test operating systems, but do
 so at own risk in hopes I be right to the point Microsoft hopefully does not get mad at me here. But also if it works congratulations for me trying to help the community. I did so mention to write down the GUI (administrator password for system) and the Product
 Key. I do not own a domain unless one means his own PC to that of lets just say this. (I have no clue how I got passed the administrator settings.) I am not a miracle worker but I read the regeistry but I do not identify error messages to know how to type
 it.) Yes there are some legalities here and stuff that applies and I am willing to be a tester knowing I've practically tested every machine OS out there besides set up a server on aspect of it is not for me to code really. I have no need for a server or to
 be critical greedy for network information. Bill Gates, If still around it would be nice to meet the guy. ^_^ - SAMUEL.

 Additional Notes: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Please see help references for setups and other instructions as
 provided by the company and or random forums. The company itself or the developers networks I had known really. To expose something else, for the issues I had gone through with my mind and or how to protect yourself from hackers to FBI global cases , I recommend
 reading the lost pdf file of Anon written by Lulzsec member and those who were involved in crime in a lot of trouble or heroes to some random people based on what motive each one had in order to help others as supported by hacker rings and individuals who
 were screwed into the mess during times people did damage the last 5-10 years that nobody bothered to investigate or moved on from it to that of being why are people so following the examples of modern day to past stupidity. The situations here could have
 been prevented if people were aware instead of propagandize as in a no show of news to local as another place knows more. Higher up and administration did not care or the case was so impossible to prove knowing each sufferer or parts had suffered the insanity
 of the past., so I put this here as reference that it was found a developer host network for free-file-sharing. Good luck tracking these people down that started this mess as they were sneaking into the administration and an example is such of your NSA of
 my region to Blackhat USA 2013 that thinks it knows the law when it does not do the law; that case of who also monitors the public and yes they indeed hate it as we do common people trying to live life according to the idiocy but situations we suffer and with
 a regular working life who cannot afford because of international credit scandals during that time of Nikki Haley and the failure of some others to embed numbers. Also the stupid radicals who divided this nation with such of lets support one race instead of
 each. = These things I notice of each channel to that of such where I would not live life with knowledge to repeat the situations as would others do for the joy ride. Innocent people were hurt who did nothing to other people and you people of the public I
 suggest during a time of sci-ontology and sickly il-minded belief that people turned twisted with principles of people in life and totally went the internet into heck along with the conduct of people to that of admin. But at least there are good people willing
 to take a stand for this and not hopefully only those who were caught. I do not know about the people who were caught though... I know that people forgot or did not know or remembered it the situations which some of us (good people) freely roam free and for
 that I thank you. Who was stupid to abridge the truth and someone explain this to me. I will not forgive the lairs who tried to twist the head of people during a time of logical means but by the perception misunderstood of a man as long as I understood the
 words. Today life would understand as people live an ordinary life and get bored, but then, I could not explain to even the intellectual who became stupid by choice over condition in which such measures were made. This is so one or more has a fresh machine
 but I am not responsible for what people do with the technology besides me with my own machine. I question what the **** I was doing with a bunch of hackers during a time I did not know my own condition as they told me what it was and me understand. There
 are some side stories that were not also explained as the FBI and CIA failed but decided hey lets all people go to the side of the world and be stupid some with Corporate Business over helping the people survive in their own places to that of what did I not
 need to know. I do not need to live or suffer that life of the past to that of being in another's place to cast them aside. I only wanted to see that the real names found in that book... Hopefully my memory rest from this insanity and liars in administration
 as a citizen. Human I was brave to even admit who I was and show my face still to minimal after much cases that did not relate until that history was known but then I figured they twisted it and need a recap of their own; as so did those who abridge. But they
 knew not me as to say would the public even understand as kids (me being 16 with a condition) were influenced during up like others as kids during this time to realize me or others being motivated by stuff like this on gaming and social networks. And you tell
 me who did all this? Or better yet... ask the individual here... to your false admin and hacker rings who supported it. Yes I will take this to the highest of courts to your international board as many suffered it and some farther away. There is proof that
 society knows it and will deny what harm it has done. People ask to be monitored in such that they had harmed others for no reason or tortured those of their memory for us to observe and suffer it. Ask him by the name of... We Are Anonymous_ Inside the Hacker
 Worl - (Olson, Parm) = (PDF File) The case that no one knew or forgot but they had joined of hacker rings all blended, Lulzsec and they split to that of what the **** are people thinking. Hack this, hack that... you cannot find much on the market because of
 it and people over waste supplies to resource of money to conservation of land. And now you know besides what little I had seen on other websites and or chatted about toward some on a gaming social network site as kids talk about nothing but ****. They cannot
 hide from that memory but me I lay it to rest and show them reality of this peace; that of how stupid the war to situations held up in a land, where even both could not see... I will not listen to people not asking me what is my problem when stating in plain
 (if so it be understood) or those who council saying we know everything and did not help people or those not bother in medical to listen to the feelings of one over how compared to the way they think. They led the stupid political garbage besides today's government
 crumble we see today or later on of the ethics on technologies and the behavior of others to a belief misunderstood over practice. To that of the first before my time 1960-2012. I hope with all as a witness society actually cared. Not for me but for themselves.
 And they ask me what education I wanted, or what job... My physical health could not take that over my mind with lack of memory and it regaining stronger. No... I regained it through the eyes of others and what I see as nothing is done by higher administration
 or your web masters let it happen. I understand as others will not understand a common citizen to that of a public which is rich in wealth and not spirit and along with that poor man who is choosing rather to be on the street when one is rich and laugh at
 others poor. People will understand I take no side rich or poor. I was both. But legalities and law lets me do what I do over common sense with rights that should be given to a man or many more for who they are and not what they are capable of. I had seen
 better of people and they could not communicate nor could they be patient to understand as being a brick wall though the outcome I see is positive. They clarified my own, my family to that of understanding the people noble who which you burned the places not
 your own. You shot the kids to my generation or neglected good people with the foot as each one abuses their nature, as I wonder which location had stolen the most of if not all the possibility to live for materialistic people though I be a poor man in a home
 that cannot afford it yet stay. I blame those who do not let people know what they are getting to the distinct lies of it a law twisted. I know not the law whole or subject as to say what academics did i know if one cannot apply them. I do not say the government
 of mine is all at fault nor do I say one region, and I am no betrayer. I ask that this be solved as to say so one can rest his mind from insanity and not have to observe what rebels do with a stupid media involvement in politics to those regions of the world.
 I blame not all people but there had been times I look at myself to see others. They told me what I know and I had heard or talked to better people before internet society with people twisted in their mind demonic to who knows what = from false media to subject
 matter. (With so little known but much more to realize than learned.) A man of true pure man or supposedly pure man example denies not himself for what he is at deep within being over heart and mind with name though he could not claim rights to own having
 to use another or reject with hopefully valid reason as to say others stole it or he could not act it; with purpose over who with such an il-dignity as one of each even in the conduct of right observation. Meaning, that man does not manipulate and the man
 i understood not to be by the nature of failure in law to that of meaning falsely to become it being wicked. I had seen wicked and good at a younger age to be it to that of mind seeing neutral but I could never be one or the other but I claim not myself deity
 or legion like they falsely of thought or a man relive the life true to be oneself at will even many could not corrupt. I recollected what I went through and I thought... but blind to see I acknowledged. And this is not a V-Vendetta or stupid intellectual
 that denies what others claim. I had noticed the way I am and what I see to that of much to see, they could not understand one with knowledge or one with life. Though having both not each one had the other and the living saw them both to see of many becoming
 full to acknowledge a real faith toward that of what defines. </blockquote>

<h2>            Xbox One wont let me launch games</h2>
                    
<p>Can someone out there please help me. I bought my new Xbox One with saved up money last Sunday as an early Christmas gift. It worked fine until Christmas morning when the servers went down in the attack by Lizard Squad or whatever. Now for 4 days straight
 I have been unable to launch any of my three games. NHL and Madden 15 both won't get past the press start menu before shutting down my Xbox completely. And I don't even want to try Destiny. I just bought Madden and Destiny 2 days ago. I can sign in but not
 launch games. I just want to play. Xbox support on twitter has ignored me for 3 days until 20 minutes ago but now they still won't reply to me. Can someone out here help me??!!</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;CaptnCommando12!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about the game launch issues, I can definitely understand how frustrating that could be. As&nbsp;<span>Patjay222 suggested, It would be a good idea to start with the following steps:<br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 10 seconds.<br /></span></li>
<li><span>Once your console is powered off, unplug the power cord.<br /></span></li>
<li><span>Wait 5 minutes and then plug in your console.</span></li>
<li><span>Power on your console and try launching a game.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Give the suggested steps a try and let us know the results. Thanks!<br /><br />Hey there&nbsp;</span><span>takeover5855!<br /><br />It appears that the issue you are experiencing is different. I recommend creating a new thread. This way you can receive support that is specifically tailored to you. Be sure to include the details of the issue as well as any troubleshooting steps that you have tried. &nbsp;Thanks in advance!</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There can be several reasons why you encounter this issue. I'd like to learn more about your concern so that I can determine the appropriate solution or at least, direct you to the correct forum if needed. Kindly answer to the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are there other peripherals connected to your device when updating?</li><li>What method are you using to update, is it via automatic update or using the Media Creation Tool?</li><li>What is the exact error message or stop code are you getting?</li><li>When does the error message appear?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
        </p>

<p>Just got a new Surface Pro yesterday, did the million updates, and overnight a new update came, and getting this same error now. &nbsp; Very frustrating given the OS and the hardware are both Microsoft!!&nbsp; There is no error number or details that I can research
 why this particular update is not accepted.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Found some more info in system tab of eventvwr-</p>
<p>Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0xC1900209: Feature update to Windows 10, version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; Ok, found in another thread that this failure to update is caused by the fact that Microsoft is blocking 1803 for IntelSSD drives... would have been nice to do a proper job of this rather than provide the "fix" option which does nothing, while still
 offering up the 1803 update, I went through 2 full system resets attempting to fix this problem before I found the info elsewhere by a lot of googling that 1803 had issues with IntelSSD so was sort of kind of blocked.</p>

<p>Anyone with a Surface Pro with Intel SSD... be very aware you will likely go through some troubles trying to update.&nbsp; &nbsp;See my post here-</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpronew-surfupdate/windows-10-version-1803-wont-install-on-new/59d85a0c-a106-4616-a125-ade69903ed95</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the resolution after semi-bricking it was to build the Windows 10 installation media on a 8G USB stick (do this before the update if you don't have a second working Windows 10PC to do the download) as you will likely need this to recover when it
 errors out part way through the update.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>i recently got a surface pro 2 from jbhifi. In the beginning, the stylist that came with it worked fine however after updating, the stylist stopped working. (The update might have caused it? )&nbsp;I have tried my stylist on other surface users' tablets and it
 worked. It's definitely not the stylist problem but the tablet's. I have tried restarting, resetting and refreshing but none have worked... please help!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi surfacepro2user328,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community! We appreciate you taking the time to consult with us about this issue with your Pro Pen. I can
 understand how this can be concerning, taking into consideration this started happening after the update. Please know we will do our best to help and guide you towards the best possible solution!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you&nbsp;as well&nbsp;for letting us know about the steps you have taken. Testing the Pro Pen with a different Surface is the best way
 to determine the issue is not with the Pro&nbsp;Pen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, although it sounds basic, if the digitizer crashed and needs to be powered down, a restart will not fix this, a full
 shutdown will. For this reason, we suggest you completely shut your Surface down, wait, and then power the Surface back on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If after doing this, the problem persists, we also recommend you perform the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Turn the Surface completely off.</span></li><li><span>Press and hold the Volume up and Power button at the same time for 15 seconds.</span></li><li><span>Release, wait 10 seconds and try again by pressing the 2 buttons at the same time for another 10 seconds.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, please make sure you have follow the steps presented
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/troubleshoot-surface-pen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We hope this helps! Please keep us posted!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are always here to help!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers,</span></p>

<p>3. Es mucho mas seguro comprar directamente en Xbox LIVE o en Tiendas Autorizadas, asi hay garantia de que el producto que entregan es el que es, y que no va a terminar baneado por usar codigos robados o de dudosa procedencia.</p>

            Having plenty of free space if anything should make your machine faster.
<div>It may be the case that you have some software installed that is set to start as soon as the machine boots.</div>
<div><br />
<div>you can modify this list by typing MsConfig in the start menu search box. Go to the startup tab, and untick any applications you don't want to start when you start your machine.</div>
<div>It's also good to go through all the unwanted applications in your system tray, and set to not run at startup, or not run a system tray monitor... things like Winamp agent, Adobe PDF helper, Skype.</div>

    <title>Foreign Japanese game not installing installshield 1155 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tackdogg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Foreign Japanese game not installing installshield 1155</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a game online from Japan. When I try to install it&nbsp;installs for a few seconds&nbsp;until it shows what I imagine is an error notice.&nbsp;The box says&nbsp;the game is compatible with&nbsp;WINDOWS XP, WINDOWS VISTA, AND WINDOWS 7.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am using a&nbsp;Toshiba Satellite&nbsp;that
 has Windows 8. I understand that this would cause compatibility&nbsp;issues but was wondering if I could get around them somehow.&nbsp;Any&nbsp;help and advice would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;Thank you for your time and have a nice day.</p>

            <p>I followed the advice given and still ran into the same problem. I noteced in the article you posted the link to it said the wizard is not designed to work on files that have a a .msi name extension which I saw on the error message it does have after "premium
 box". If there is any further help it will be very appreciated because as you can tell, computers aren't really my strong points.</p>

            So you have changed the setup to boot into compatibility settings for win 7 and are running the setup as an administrator?&nbsp; If it still will not load or run you need to contact the developer

<p><strong>I keep getting an error code of "error 1325 documents is not a valid short file name" whenever I try to add an update to a previous program that I have installed. &nbsp;I have tried to download the "clean up utility" from Microsoft, but I get the same
 message. &nbsp;I did not have Office XP or 2002 on this computer, I have always had 2007. &nbsp;This is really making my computer use frustrating. &nbsp;What can I do?</strong></p>

<p>Just got the same thing with trying to run, remove or repair Acrobat Reader 9.3.2<br />
gets: Error 1325, Favorites is not a valid short file name.</p>
<p>Fixed it in the registry by changing&nbsp;it to a short name,&nbsp;Favorites="P:\Favorites"</p>
<p>The registry was:</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders]<br />
"Favorites"="\\\\Server1\\users$\\User1\\Favorites"</p>

<p>I have no idea what that window in your screenshot is, it is not something I see on my machine, what are you right-clicking on to bring up that Properties page?<br />
<br />
See if I can explain this a bit better?<br />
<br />
Type Libraries in the Start Menu Search box.&nbsp; Open the folder called "Libraries" from the list in the Start Menu after the search completes, and right-click on the sub-folder&nbsp;"Documents&nbsp;(Library)" , try the Restore Defaults button (make a note of the Library
 locations first).<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't ignore the fact that user profiles do sometimes get corrupted that is why we test with other newly created users.&nbsp; Creating users and then deleting them is easy enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are just for information in case it turns out that other users do not have your current user's problem.<br />
