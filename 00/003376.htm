    <title>N8 - Dukto changes date stamp on transferred files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N8 - Dukto changes date stamp on transferred files</h2>
                    
<p>I downloaded Dukto a few days ago after reading about it on another post on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used it a few times to transfer some data to my phone from a PC but for the first time I have just tried it to transfer data the other way, ie from the phone to the PC.&nbsp; The files I chose were images from the camera and I am very disappointed to realise
 that Dukto has altered the date stamp on the files, to the time they were transferred (rather than leaving it at when the pictures were taken)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way round this, because I was starting to like the speed and ease of use of Dukto but for me, it is unacceptable if it changes what is a major plus point in digital photography, ie an automatic time stamp on images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no way round it, does anyone know of an alternative way of using Wi-Fi to transfer files in both directions, that does not mess with the timestamp info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Did Windows 10 remove Parental Controls on Purpose&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> milkman_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Did Windows 10 remove Parental Controls on Purpose&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So my father set parental controls on my PC way back in july. It was 12 PM to 5 PM and 9 PM to 1 AM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my father wanted me to upgrade to Windows 10 I wasn't really pleased since I thought it would take all day. But then he started the upgrade on 12 PM and it ended roughly on 7 PM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>He was sleeping so I thought I'd try and complete it. I somehow entered the login menu, and I was like "I wonder how the time restriction looks like on Windows 10". So I logged in and it took me to my account. And for a second I was like.</p>
<p>"<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It literally removed all my parental controls, a few days later my father recognized something was wrong and then he told me to log off yesterday, I asked him why, he said because he wanted to put back the parental controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So he went to his account and went to manage my account. He was like. "What. Where is it.", and I was kind of fascinated in a way, but that stopped until he got angry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He was&nbsp;<strong>real</strong> mad. And I was meaning to ask. Did you do it on purpose.</p>
<p>

<h2>            mail merged text appearing in bold when i only need some parts of it in bold</h2>
                    
<p>I have a text with some parts in bold on a&nbsp;cell from an Excel data source, but when i merge&nbsp;it in Word all the text appears in bold, how can i keep the original text formatting or can someone tell me if i can use a code to help me accomplish it.</p>
<p>Any suggestions are well received.</p>

<p>There is no straightforward way to preserve this kind of formatting when using an Excel data source.</p>
<p>One thing you can try, if you do not have more than the maximum number of columns for a Word table, is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. copy/paste your Excel data source with into a Word document, so you have a Word table. The bold formatting should be preserved. Save the document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. use that document as the data source</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. If the column containing the formatted text is called "mycolumn", you would normally insert it using a mergefield like this</p>
<p>{ MERGEFIELD mycolumn }</p>
<p>(use alt-F9 to reveal the field codes as necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. delete the MERGEFIELD so you have a bookmark field:</p>
<p>{ mycolumn }</p>
<p>&nbsp;e. If you update the field using F9, you may see a message saying that the bookmark cannot be found. Ignore that and merge to a new document (say).</p>
<p>&nbsp;f. See if that gives you the result you need. It may not, because this is an old, unsupported merge feature and only some formatting features are preserved.</p>
<p>If your formatted text is formatted in a very consistent way there are a couple of other things you can try, but in essence you are reimposing formatting rather than preserving it</p>
<p>1. Say your text always has 3 words, and the middle one is always bold. Say the first cell has "the<strong>cat</strong> sat". Then the following may work:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. keep Excel as the data source</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. in your Mail Merge Main Document, ensure that your MERGEFIELD has a \*Mergeformat switch, e.g.</p>
<p>{ MERGEFIELD mycolumn \*Mergeformat }</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. Preview the merge results so that you see&nbsp;</p>
<p>the cat sat</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. in the Word document, format "cat" as bold</p>
<p>&nbsp;e. Merge to a new document and see if that works. FWIW \*Mergeformat is also a rather old and not well documented feature, and will not do its job once the word count in the cell gets too large, or if the word count changes, and so on.</p>
<p>2. If your text always has the same formatting, e.g. as in the above example, or say you have a code which is always XXXNNNN, say ABC1234 or XYZ2345 where the XXX part is formatted bold, then split the text into separate columns, use separate MERGEFIELD
 fields to insert them in Word, and format those fields how you need.</p>
<p>If none of those looks likely to work, you'd probably have to have a VBA-based solution that copies/pastes the cell content into Word.</p>

<h2>            C101B000</h2>
                    <p>I just got my Lumia 535 a few days ago. It was just OK. Today, I tried updating my Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 over a WiFi connection. The downloading and installing process was going well. Then my phone restart twice and showed something like 'transferring
 app data'. I didn't even touch my phone and it restarted automatically. After that, I found my phone running Windows 8.1 and was surprised.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought there was a problem and tried to forget about the update. Then I tried downloading app from store and it started showing C101B000 error code while downloading each and every app.</p>
<p>I have already tried reseting, creating new Microsoft account but the problem wasn't solved. I also searched online but found no solution.</p>
<p>Please help me if anyone know how to fix this error. Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>This is a problem with the store on Microsoft's side which reoccurs every few weeks. Unfortunately there is absolutely nothing anyone can do except wait for it to be fixed by MS. There is no point in performing any resets or, God forbid, a complete firmware
 reinstall. This is not an issue with any device, it's on the store servers.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I read this answer to a problem. This is the most common answer. It usually get fixed in a few days.</p>

<h3> msprojectnewbie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dates are reverting to the Project Start Date</h2>
                    <p><span>I am at a loss here! I'm fairly new to MS Project 2010...but pretty experienced with previous versions and I’ve never seen this problem before.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I update the IMS progress using the '% work complete' column. I input 'actual start' dates which automatically changes the 'start date' and adjusts the 'duration' pushing out or pulling in
 the 'finish date' as it's supposed to. I also input 'actual finish' dates when applicable which will take 100% for both '% work complete' and '% complete'. I save the file several times throughout the day (I have auto save reminder on for every 20 minutes)
 in case the program crashes or glitches (hangs-up/freezes). This IMS was created several months ago and I haven't had any problems respective to dates changing on their own, but during this month’s End of Month status it was brought to my attention that the
 dates were whacky and not reflective of the information provided during previous statuses. Acknowledging this error I went in and corrected all the dates that were incorrect and saved the file as a different name. Upon opening the file the next day, a lot
 of dates had again reverted back to the project start date. The problem is random; in that some of the tasks affected are 100% complete and others are less. Some had the ‘actual start’ and ‘actual finish’ dates manually entered and others the ‘actual start’
 and ‘actual finish’ dates were automatically populated by taking 100% in the ‘% complete’ column. So there doesn’t seem to be a rhyme to this madness and my project has over 1,300 lines...so needless to say, when dates change it's a big problem and a time
 consuming tedious task to correct the information again and again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!</span></p>

            <p>MsProjectNewbie,</p>
<p>Okay, let's start with the basics. Do you have SP2 installed? You should also install the June 2013 cumulative update since it fixes some significant issues and was released after SP2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you file is corrupt. Try saving as XML and then re-open in Project. Note, you will lose any custom formatting using this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            There are a few things that you can try first thing go to your settings and sync your phone failing that go to your Microsoft account on a PC and find your contacts there finally backup your phone then go back the about setting and tap reset this will
 bring your phone back to it's original out of the box new state then when you set your phone up set it up not as a new device but as a phone carried on that way when you enter your Microsoft account details it will find your contacts and backups and retrieve
 them

<h2>            UMA&#47;GAN app for Nokia N8 for T-mobile network</h2>
                    
<p>Who besides me is interested in getting a UMA/GAN wi-fi calling app written for a Nokia N8 running Symbian^3 OS. Nokia is advertising the Nokia N8 as being able to be used on the T-mobile network, well first off UMA calling is part of the T-mobile network;
 for those of us who are dedicated Nokia owners are a little besides are selves as to why this new smart phone does not have a UMA/GAN app like the new Android UMA/GAN app that the owners of their phones can down load the app but those of us who own or want
 to buy a Nokia N8 running the Symbian^3 OS can do mo such thing. I for one would want to buy that phone with that option no matter what the cost .Who else wants this and is upset that Nokia is dropping the ball big time?</p>

<p>At the moment it is only an Idea and concept there is no UMA app for the Symbian^3 OS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in negotiations with ISPG out of India to write a UMA calling application for the Symbian^3 OS that runs on Nokia N8, Nokia E7, Nokia C7, Nokia C6-01; there may be others that are running the OS .I have been talking with them for about 4 weeks now and
 I keep letting them know that the price they are giving me is beyond my budget they started out at a price of $5,500.00 USD and so far they have dropped the price about 3 times the offer is now $1500.00 USD .Currently I am trying to get them to foot the bill
 and make the APP available on the OVI store as a download&nbsp; also they are writing the app to be used with T-mobile service in the US but who know it might work with the Orange network you may need to find out the UMA radio frequency for Orange. Then again it
 may have to do with the sim card or network branding that will connect to the Orange network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with time and price negotiation this cans definitely happen let me know what you think, I would like to get others involved to share the final price after price negotiations have gone a low as possible that is if they do not want to put the app on the
 OVI app store. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;unfortunate&nbsp;facts of life are that Nokia no longer has a good product for T-Mobile UMA. &nbsp;I just bought a Nokia E73 and after sending the phone to T-mobile twice and the Nokia service center twice, the UMA and the GSM signals are very weak. &nbsp;I have a
 new Nuron and Side by side,the Nuron has 5 to 7 GSM bars and the E73 has 0 to 2 bars GSM and no pink circle for UMA just a dot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>T-mobile has two types of VOIP calling, &nbsp;UMA and Wifi calling. &nbsp;UMA works for for those people that have the Hot Spot at home service and automatically transfer between the UMA network and GSM network. &nbsp;WiFi calling drops and needs to reconnect between networks.
 &nbsp;Both systems connect to modems if you have the modem code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the N8&nbsp;has the hardware capability but Nokia decided not to include the software or an app in Ovi. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sitting here with a 6086, 6301 and a e73 and I have had to move to a My Touch 4G which has much better reception and Android apps. &nbsp;I wanted an N8 but Nokia has&nbsp;abandoned&nbsp;the US market.I called Nokia support to ask about WiFi calling and received no
 response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll keep the Nokia phones to use when I'm out of the country.</p>

<p>Tmobile USA + Nokia have enabled UMA on the C7-00.1 aka The Astound.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It works well when I am out of the country, but it is flaky inside the USA. Perhaps that is my router.. engenius ESR-9850, but it is hard to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no App which is visible, the UMA function is transparent, except that a new VPN Destination is created when the UMA connection is active, and then the the connection closes, the destination is closed.<br />
<br />
The E73 Mode, also from Tmobile has the same function, but it was more reliable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry you had a cr*ppy experience with your E73 and UMA.</p>

<p>Mine was the opposite. It was bulletproof and rocked and rolled! Never dropped a call.</p>

            You don't say what type of image it is. &nbsp;Perhaps it's an image format that PowerPoint doesn't support, or has been saved from a program that has a slightly non-standard way of saving images. &nbsp;Or the file itself could be corrupt.

            I'll assume that you're using Insert | Picture to bring the picture in. &nbsp;If not, that's what you *should* be doing. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>But try this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Rightclick the image file</div>
<div>Choose Properties</div>
<div>On the General tab, look for an UNBLOCK button at the bottom of the dialog box.</div>
<div>If it's there, click it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Close the dialog box and try inserting the file again.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one of the image (jpg) files I did not have the unblock button, however I did have it on a different jpg, so I clicked the unblock button and said OK. I then tried to insert picture again and got the same error message.</p>

YOu want to look at the jpg file? This is happening on any jpg file that is on this local PC. Unfortunately, it is not my PC and I don't have access to it right now to do this.

<div>Yes, I'd like to see it. &nbsp;If it happens here too, it's likely a problem with the JPG.</div>
<div>If not, it's likely something to do with the PPT installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another thing you might try:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Draw a rectangle or any other shape in PPT.</div>
<div>Rightclick and choose to save the file as a picture.</div>
<div>Save it as a JPG to your desktop or any other convenient location.</div>
<div>Then do Insert | Picture and choose the just-saved JPG.</div>
<div>Does it also error out?</div>

<br />
YOu want to look at the jpg file? This is happening on any jpg file that is on this local PC. Unfortunately, it is not my PC and I don't have access to it right now to do this.

<br />
<div>Yes, I'd like to see it. &nbsp;If it happens here too, it's likely a problem with the JPG.</div>
<div>If not, it's likely something to do with the PPT installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another thing you might try:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Draw a rectangle or any other shape in PPT.</div>
<div>Rightclick and choose to save the file as a picture.</div>
<div>Save it as a JPG to your desktop or any other convenient location.</div>
<div>Then do Insert | Picture and choose the just-saved JPG.</div>
<div>Does it also error out?</div>
<div><br />

<p>I am facing the same problem too. Powerpoint won't let me insert image of any format. I tried drawing a rectangle and saving it as a picture (PNG file). However, when I try to insert image thus saved, it doesn't still work. I'm at total loss!&nbsp;</p>

            And, it certainly isn't a problem with the JPEG file. To me, Powerpoint won't let me insert any image file; I tried several other formats too, including PNG, TIFF and BMP. All those files open pretty well in other applications, such as MS Paint but not
 in Powerpoint.

</p><p>Hi Scott,<br />
<br />
This is expected behaviour in Office 365.<br />
<br />
However, for the 2nd issue occurs if the AllRequestOutOfPolicy property of the room mailbox is set to True. This causes the room mailbox to ignore conflicting meeting requests.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep my Outlook's ribbon hidden so I could get maximum space for emails. Since a month or so, it started turning off by itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I open Outlook, its switches to "Show tabs"</li><li>When I switch mailboxes, its <span>switches to</span> "Show tabs"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This happens <strong>every time</strong>. It looks like it does not store the value correctly or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to fix it?</p>

            If you expand, it stays open until you change the state - but if its changing automatically, it could be an addin doing it as it adds their ribbon or commands. You can test this in Safe mode.  To open Outlook in Safe mode: Close Outlook then hold Ctrl as you click on the Outlook icon. You'll get a message asking if you want to start in Safe mode. Click Ok.  
<br />
<br />You can try adding/editing this registry key:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Toolbars\Outlook
<br />QuickAccessToolbarStyleExplorer - Decimal of 28 here when its autohide, 20 for minumized, Decimal 16 when visible. Each item type has its own setting, also in that location.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I have enabled is "Exchange Add-in" and "VBA" add-in. Disabling both of them does not solve the issue. The moment the ribbon changes automatically the registry setting changes too. Currently it starts okay, but when I change mailboxes for
 the first time after it loads, it changes back. After that it does not change. It means that every day I have to reset this setting. Safe mode exhibits the same behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<br />Yeah, its not a microsoft addin doing it.  No addins from the office store either?

<br />Oh shoot, i forgot about that (sorry!) - those keys are good for setting it at first use. The policy key  won't prevent it either - but on restart it will be collapsed (or hidden) -- that is at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Toolbars\Outlook

<br />If something is changing the policy key, you have bigger problems.. what is happening though is the policy key sets the value when outlook first starts but it doesn't lock down the ribbon setting, so whatever is causing the ribbon changes is still able to change it. If you close Outlook with the ribbon open, it will start up closed (or hidden), thanks to the policy key. 
<br />
<br />The policy key should fix this - unless whatever is doing it is doing it on startup. 
<br />* When I open Outlook, its switches to "Show tabs"
<br />but will not stop this:
<br />* When I switch mailboxes, its switches to "Show tabs"
<br />
<br />I'm not surprised that its ok in Excel (and probably the other applications). 
<br />
<br />So no COM addins, no office addins... no macros? 
<br />
<br />Do you have all of the ribbons (mail, appointments etc) set to hidden/tabs only? If so, are all affected or just the main outlook window ?

<p>No macros or any other plugin.</p>

</p><p>I have just the main window ribbon set like this. I really prefer to find the problem rather than force it from somewhere. These things tend to be forgotten over time and then cause serious headaches :)</p>

<br />That's for sure. BTDT more than once. :) 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; I wonder what would happen if I reinstall outlook... maybe an update has messed thing up when it was installed.
<br />At this point, it won't hurt. Use the Repair option in Settings, apps and features or Control panel, programs and features. I would do the quick repair first - the online repair is an uninstall/reinstall and will require reactivation, which may require your office key if its not linked to a microsoft account. 
<br />
<br />I'll ask my support contact about it too... something is definitely triggering the changes.

    <title>Trouble syncing my 920 with iTunes via Windows Phone app for desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fatbob73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble syncing my 920 with iTunes via Windows Phone app for desktop</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I just my first Windows Phone, the Nokia 920. I installed Windows Phone Desktop App on my Windows 7 laptop. I was able to sync with my iTunes, and it found all my music and I was able to copy my music onto my 920. I was having some sound issues with my laptop,
 so I performed a restore (an Acer application which restores Windows to the way factory default). I had to re-install iTunes and Windows Windows Phone Desktop App. After my re-install, Windows Phone Desktop App no longer sees any music or podcasts or anything
 else from my iTunes library. Why is this happening?<br />
<br />
The first time I ran Windows Phone Desktop App after re-installing everything, I did get this message...<br />
<br />
"We weren't able to do what you asked with some of your files. Here's a bit more detail: iTunes is not responding. Please make sure there is no dialog open in iTunes, or please close it."<br />
<br />
The thing is that iTunes works fine and is not running at the moment with a dialog up, so I'm not sure what to make of this message.<br />
<br />
I tried re-booting my laptop and I even tried deleting my iTunes library and re-creating it. Can it be a setting on my 920?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back and sharing the detailed information with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the screenshot you provided, it seems the uploading process gets stuck when uploading changes in Office files to OneDrive for business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you close the spreadsheet, we suggest copy the content in it, create a new spreadsheet, paste the content and save the new spreadsheet in local computer. This way is used to back up the changes.</p>
<p>Then go to Office Upload Center by typing
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, check if you can open your spreadsheet again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, since you save the spreadsheet in OneDrive for business, we suggest you go to OneDrive for business in the browser, browse to the spreadsheet and check if you can open it in Excel online,
 and try opening it in Excel desktop app by clicking the 3 dots next to the it&gt; Open&gt;Open in Excel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<h3> elayea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading to Windows mobile 10 on lumia 640</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Lumia 640 knowing that it's on the list of phones that will be able to upgrade to windows mobile 10. My phone is currently unlocked, and I don't have a sim card to put in the phone yet (I will use this as my international phone and I
 haven't gotten my overseas sim card yet). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to upgrade to windows mobile 10, the upgrade advisor tells me "Good news!&nbsp;Your phone is eligible for upgrade to windows 10. We are working with your mobile operator and phone manufacturer to make the upgrade available for your phone...". My
 question is, since I don't have a sim card for the phone and it's unlocked, I technically don't have a mobile operator right now. Does that mean I won't be able to upgrade to windows 10? Is there any way I can upgrade without a sim card? (I have perfect internet
 access via wifi).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            I am having the same problem. If you have T-Mobile as your phone service, this may be the case. It took T-Mobile a long time to send out the windows phone 8.1 update as well. It was not sent out until late November and I believe that history will repeat
 itself in this situation

            For me, since i had a tmobile sim card, i just removed it and then tried again, and ran upgrade advisor, which told me i could upgrade. I did get a new phone update and i'm downloading it now, I'll update later. maybe if you get a sim, insert it, and then
 remove it, it might work.

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />5. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<h2>            Error 0x80040201 in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi: I've just finished successfully migrating my old (XP / Eudora) set up onto a new computer running Win7 / Office 2013. I was successfully able to migrate all my Eudora stuff to Outlook (Aid4Mail - Fookes Software - AWESOME!) and had the new Outlook account
 running successfully for about 3 days. This morning I'm getting a SEND error 0x80040201 on all outgoing. I can receive OK. I rebuilt the profile and it is sending test messages to its satisfaction, however I haven't received any of those test messages? Any
 ideas? Thanks!</p>

            Hi GiorgosH: The issue I had with this error code resolved after I rebuilt the profile. The test messages started showing up a few hours afterwards. I don't know if what I did resolved the problem or if it just spontaneously resolved, the same way it spontaneously
 appeared? Anyway I haven't seen this error since then. Good luck, John

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you mentioned "SharePoint Online Type Ahead", do you mean the feature to fill the whole word if you type the first few letters?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, we can use the feature when we are in Quick Edit mode. But the feature is not supported if we click the New button to create a new item.</p>

            ZigZag3143, your last message made me realize that the domain was misspelled. That is why I could send, but not receive emails. Thank you for your help. I really appreciate it.

<h2>            Repair Notification</h2>
                    I keep getting a "We're sorry, but Word has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly . Word will need to close as a result. Would you like to repair now?" message. Of course, I press "Repair Now" but I keep getting this notification
 and I can't do any work using Word because it keeps needing to close.&nbsp;

    <title>Excel Printing Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bevbrennan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Printing Problems</h2>
                    <p>I do a monthly spreadsheet with sales figures.&nbsp; 12 columns and rows depending on number of days in the month.</p>
<p>When I start printing, the message sent to the printer (or the reverse) is to combine 2 rows into 1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I do a print preview prior to printing, everything is as I entered it.&nbsp; 1 day = 1 row.&nbsp; But when I print, rows 1&amp;2, 3&amp;4 etc are combined into a double height row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All info prints,&nbsp; for example, the data for the first is still there; with the data for the 2nd directly below.&nbsp; Then it starts a new "double" row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get back to having it print as shown in print preview?</p>
                </div>

            <p>Looks like ( just guessing ) the print area is not fitting on to a single page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried using the following options:</p>
<p>(a) Print Selection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; see pic-1 below</p>
<p>(b) Fit to 1 page wide by 1 page tall&nbsp; &nbsp;(under Page Setup) &nbsp; - see pic-2 below</p>
<p>
