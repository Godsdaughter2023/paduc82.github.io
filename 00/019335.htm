    <title>Excel - System Has Run Out of Application Memory - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel - System Has Run Out of Application Memory</h2>
                    <p>I am using an Apple MacBook Air and just upgraded from El Capitan OS to Sierra OS. &nbsp;I am having trouble with Excel for Mac, version 15.28. &nbsp;(The same problem is present with Sierra as with El Capitan.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd like to do is format my sheet as a table, so every other row is highlighted, then filter one column. &nbsp;That's IT! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try it, Excel quits responding and I get Apple's rainbow colored wheel of fortune... Finally, I get an error message that says: &nbsp;"MS Excel isn't responding right now. &nbsp;Do you want to wait, or quit?" &nbsp;I've also gotten the error message "System
 has run out of application memory."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled MS Excel. &nbsp;I have tried "Command Option P &amp; R" all at the same time with two start ups - multiple times. &nbsp;I have also tried "Command R" the same way. &nbsp;I have a TON of memory available on my Mac (205GB available of 250GB
 total), so it's not a true memory problem, nor am I running an excessive amount of applications at one time. &nbsp;Excel, Word, Messages and Calendar are all that are running at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the details about my Mac:</p>
<p>Model Name:<span> </span>MacBook Air<br />
&nbsp; Model Identifier:<span> </span>
MacBookAir7,2<br />
&nbsp; Processor Name:<span> </span>Intel Core i5<br />
&nbsp; Processor Speed:<span> </span>
1.6 GHz<br />
&nbsp; Number of Processors:<span> </span>
1<br />
&nbsp; Total Number of Cores:<span> </span>
2<br />
&nbsp; L2 Cache (per Core):<span> </span>
256 KB<br />
&nbsp; L3 Cache:<span> </span>3 MB<br />
&nbsp; Memory:<span> </span>8 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

            <p>Does this affect all Excel Files? Or, only this one? Can you open a New Sheet under a&nbsp;new name?</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The issue with "System has run out of Application Memory" is a Generic error message.<br />
It is equivalent to the Computer saying "I don't know what the heck happen" There could be a possibility the application memory is full. ; but, it could be a billion other issues as well.<br />
<br />
</li><li>If It is only on this one file, It could be corrupt.<br />
In that case, you need to open a new file and copy the information over and save under a new name.<br />
<br />
</li><li>It is possible you put a stray character in a distant cell, and It has to resolve&nbsp;too many cells.<br />
To check for this go to View menu &gt; Zoom, and type in 25% (you don't have to type the % character).<br />
<br />
Now look and see how many sheets it shows as active. If you have more sheets "Active" (not grayed out) than you have actual information you need to go to the very last active sheet and locate that character and remove it. Then delete each sheet until you get
 to the last sheet or page you have information that you are using.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Finally, try&nbsp;using select all (⌘ + A), and change the Font.<br />
It is possible that you may have a duplicate or corrupt font. <br />
Changing to a Different will prove this.<br />
<br />
You can use the new font. <br />
But, you need to Open FontBook and follow these <strong><a href="http://www.phillipjones-cet.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Directions</a></strong> titled
<br />
"FontBook Lion and Above" (click the blue link).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</li><li>Once you have cleared up, all issues try doing what you were attempting, see what happens.</li></ol>
<p>As for the "Ton of memory," actually you have a ton of "Scratch Disk Space." With Actual&nbsp;memory, you are cutting it pretty close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sierra, use 2 to 3 GB of&nbsp;RAM and depending on the&nbsp;size of file and application Office has open, is probably&nbsp;using at least another 2 GB. With today's modern systems. No computer should ship with less than 16 GB. And honestly, to be comfortable, you should
 have on hand 32 GB. But No laptop&nbsp;the way Apple builds computers can handle more than 16 GB.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you, Philip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file I have trouble with is a file I receive brand new from my company each morning, so corruption or a stray character I may have added are unlikely. &nbsp;I checked the most recent file (received 11/18) just to be sure, and there are only 2 active sheets,
 no stray characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your directions for the Font Book and all my fonts passed (221).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I only have 8GB of RAM, is the next suggestion that I should bump that to 16?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

            <p>There is a known crash in Excel in Sierra that has yet to be addressed. It's possible you might be hitting this crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've ruled out fonts as a likely source of the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to focus on the file you're receiving. You've done a good job of updating on your Mac. Is the PC generating these files also up to date for Windows and Office? If not, the file you're getting from Windows may be defective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the file just a data table? If so, you might try some massaging. Save it as .csv and then import the .csv to purge the file of corruption.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, Jim! &nbsp;I'm going to try the CSV trick. &nbsp;I don't know whether the PC generating the files are up to date. &nbsp;They are from our company's headquarters in another state. &nbsp;The file is just a data table, so perhaps the CSV trick will work.
 &nbsp;I have had this problem with Yosemite as well; I updated to Sierra thinking that would help. &nbsp;It didn't...</p>

<p>I have this same problem. It started happening a few months ago on my work computer (dell, running office 365). So I thought it was just a dell issue with memory. But now it has started happening in my MacBook pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it is a memory problem either. I think there is a bug in Excel. All I tried to do was highlight some entire rows in order to insert new rows. When I would try to highlight the row, beachball spins and spins. It is like it is trying to highlight
 infinity's worth of blank cells, instead of understanding that the cells are blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can shed some light on this. Something I used to do in two seconds is now locking up and shutting down both my dell and my macbook, which seems to indicate the problem resides in neither computer nor memory nor file, but in the guts of EXCEL
 itself.&nbsp;</p>

            It looks like they didn't repair it correctly. You should take it back and complain but before you do try a hard reset.<br />
<br />
All user data and programs will be lost from the phones memory when you reset it.<br />
<br />
Hard reset:<br />
<br />
1. Switch off the phone.<br />
<br />
2. Hold down the following three buttons: Green (the call answer button), * button, and '3' button.<br />
<br />
3. While holding these buttons, hold the power button for a second to switch on the phone.<br />
<br />
4. Release when the phone shows the nokia hands logo or shows other signs of life like the language selection screen.<br />
<br />
It may take a few attempts and very flexible fingers!

When you say programs and data do you mean programs such a MSN messenger and data such as saved photos etc?

            Everything from the phones memory will be lost. It will be "as new". Any programs that are installed to your memory card will need to be reinstalled.<br />
<br />
Any data on the memory card such as photos or music will be safe.

Was it an official nokia care point that messed up the repair or one of the dodgy market stalls or phones shops?

            It was an independant phone shop. I went to them because its nearer and not so costly. Plus they give you a qoute upfront. However i am sincerely regretting it now! As the phone shop owner is looking to blame me for his fault! Which means more money!!
 U'oh. :-(<br />
Anyway i would like to thank you very much for your time &amp; support!<br />
Much appreciated!!

Was it one of the muppets on darwen road or the cowboys in the market? (Assuming you are in Blackburn, Lancashire).

            I've not heard of that shop but it's a while since i've been to Blackburn centre.<br />
<br />
Personally I would never trust a shop like that with a repair because as you have found they don't do a very good job.<br />
<br />
Official nokia care points are the best places for repairs but I think the nearest ones to Blackburn are in Bury, Bolton and Preston.<br />
<br />
I hope you manage to get it working again.

<h2>            Onedrive confusion - need documentation&#47;clarification.</h2>
                    &nbsp;Is it cloud or storage on my C: drive?&nbsp; How much do I have?&nbsp; What determines how much I have by default?&nbsp; Does installing Office change it?&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>I've pretty much ignored Onedrive up until now even though I've been an insider since 10/1/2014.&nbsp; However I keep seeing more and more about it - apparently MS is really pushing it, so I'm trying to understand.&nbsp; I always thought it was cloud storage with
 everyone having 15 GB, but just for the halibut, I decided to copy about 70 GB of my largest folders to it on my laptop, which is running the release version of Windows 10 Home (10586.420), fully expecting it to stop with an error when it got to 15 GB.&nbsp; I
 also expected File Manager to show the copied data to go out via WiFi to the cloud.&nbsp; And I didn't expect to see the used space on my C: drive increased because I thought Onedrive was cloud storage.&nbsp;
<strong>None of this was the case! </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So then I decided to try this with my test desktop which is running 64 bit insider build 14383.&nbsp; The only difference was that I got a message that some files were bigger than 2 GB (which was true), but it copied the whole 41 GB to Onedrive on my C: anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So seeing so many contradictions to what I expected, I'm in need of documentation explaining what I've seen.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Task manager showed the data I was copying from an external hard drive going to my C: drive.&nbsp; Why?</li><li>My C: drive used space increased by the 73 GB of data I'd copied.</li><li>I see no evidence of any of this 73 GB being copied to the cloud.</li><li>I've gotten several emails from MS that my Onedrive space is being reduced from
<strong>15 GB to 5 GB</strong> yet I now have 73 GB in Onedrive.&nbsp; ????</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; So am I to conclude that Onedrive is really NOT the cloud but space on my C: drive instead?&nbsp; That would be a duplicate waste of space, since I always back my C: drives up to external hard drives.&nbsp; Both of these PCs have Office installed (2016 on the laptop,
 2007 on the desktop), does that change Onedrive's capacity?&nbsp; I'm really confused about the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">what</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
why</span> of Onedrive and am trying hard not to jump to conclusions, but from what I've seen so far this whole Onedrive thing makes zero sense to me.&nbsp; Can someone help me understand?&nbsp; TIA.</p>

            <p>Not sure how they are handling storage capacity, but basically OneDrive gives you a common place to access your data from multiple devices, as well as serving as a form of backup for files placed there.&nbsp; Because files are replicated between the OneDrive
 folders on a PC and the online storage, OneDrive use&nbsp;does not mean that files placed there do not also occupy hard disk capacity, as you have found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing is that copying files to the PC's OneDrive folder only initiates the upload to the online space.&nbsp; You will see small icons (like a Recycling symbol)&nbsp;next to files that have not yet been uploaded.&nbsp; The Cloud icon in the systray at the bottom
 right of your screen will also indicate how much of what is in your OneDrive folders has been backed up to the cloud so far.&nbsp; So perhaps your 5GB has not yet been used and you will not be notified until that much has uploaded.&nbsp; Upload speed is often only a
 fraction of the download speed offered by your ISP, so it can take a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had opted-in to keeping the 15GB of storage for free at the time when Microsoft changed that to only 5GB, but said anyone who requested before a certain date could stay at 15GB.&nbsp; Yet I see my used space is now at 18.3GB.&nbsp; Perhaps they are like Google and
 do not count certain photos against your cloud storage limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that for some reason I am shown to have 140GB of storage.&nbsp; Sometimes there are offers given for more free storage, such as through your mobile phone due to installing some Microsoft App or from the phone manufacturer.&nbsp; You can check your current limit
 through the icon in the systray.</p>

            From the way I understand it the cloud part of Onedrive can see what you have on your Computer Onedrive. and if you upload it to the cloud you can retrieve it from the cloud to any computer when you login. If you start Edge or any browser you prefer. Go
 to msn.com and the cloud Onedrive is at the far right at least on my browsers. Just click on that and you should be able to upload what you want.

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks for the feedback Don, but neither File Manager nor right-clicking the cloud icon in the taskbar show any icons, and I see very little network activity.&nbsp; I have some photos in Onedrive that've been there for ages, but neither they nor the recently
 copied folders have any icons beside them. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have 35 Mbps download speed, but am aware that upload speed is much slower.&nbsp; Still Task Manager is showing 0 Kbps network activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; What really makes no sense to me is why does Onedrive have to m</p>
<p>ake duplicates on my hard drive of files that are already there?&nbsp; Oh yes, and when I look at my desktop's Onedrive, I never see the files that're on my laptop's Onedrive?&nbsp; I've never thought the cloud made sense, but this sure seems to confirm that perspective.&nbsp;
 I carry a 64 GB flash drive in my pocket that I bought for $14 and I have 3 TB external USB3 hard drives I bought for $80 each.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not sure about why your laptop files are not visible (they might only show on the OneDrive webpage?)&nbsp;but the menu below shows the answer to one of your original queries:&nbsp; "The files you sync will take up space on this PC".<br />

            &nbsp;OK, that helps.&nbsp; It's not enough to just put stuff in Onedrive, you have to set up the folders to be synced.&nbsp; Thanks for the info Don.&nbsp; I'm afraid I have to say that the more I understand it, the more I don't like it!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I have no problem at all carrying
 my 64 GB flash drive around, and my 3 TB backup drives serve my backup needs just hunky dory.&nbsp; :)<br />

<h2>            Bad network Reception on lumia 820</h2>
                    I have been using Nokia phones since 2004, for the first time Lumia 820 has disappointed me. I work in a Telco even in my office my network reception goes off until I restart my phone I don't know if there is any way to fix this.<br />
secondly, the videos sizes are too big make it non friendly work video shooting(is there any way to change the video formats)<br />

<div>Hi, RichardThunder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's start about the poor reception that you're having an issue with. Did something happen to your phone prior to this?&nbsp;<span>Have you tried any workaround on your phone to&nbsp;</span><span>further</span><span>&nbsp;isolate
 the issue? Listed below are fixes we can try on your phone:</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><span>Check the signal strength on the phone screen, and move to an area with better reception. If you continuously experience low signal strength in a certain area, the network coverage there may be insufficient.</span>
</li><li>Remove any accessory covers or shells from the phone temporary to check if covers affect the phone’s signal strength.
</li><li>Set your phone to use&nbsp;<span>2G</span>&nbsp;(GSM) network only (<span>Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>mobile network</span>&nbsp;(cellular) &gt;&nbsp;<span>Highest connection speed</span>) in case the roaming operator does not permit you to use 3G or 4G service.
</li><li>Switch Flight (airplane) mode&nbsp;<span>On</span>&nbsp;and then back&nbsp;<span>Off</span>&nbsp;(<span>Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Flight mode</span>). This resets the active connection.
</li><li>Switch off your phone and take out the SIM card.&nbsp;Put your SIM card in another phone to check if the issue is with your phone or your SIM card. If it is working in another device, you will have to contact your operator to order a replacement SIM card if
 a SIM transfer is not available at the retail point.&nbsp; </li></ol>
Regarding your videos, when you asked "is there a way to change the video formats?", are you pertaining to changing the camera video resolution? Upon checking the phones specifications, (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/lumia820/specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/lumia820/specifications/</a>&nbsp;),
 it supports Full HD quality (1920 x 1080) that's why the video file size is too large. And we're afraid to say, but there's no option to change the video resolution. You can only change camera settings, such as aspect ratio, scene mode, and white balance.
 To do that, go to Camera &gt; tap ... &gt; video settings, and then tap the settings you want.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do not hesitate to let us know the outcome or in any case, need to clarify anything from our response. &nbsp;:thumbup:&nbsp;</div>

            First, can you define what you mean by parameter queries. Are you referring to queries that reference a control on a form for its criteria, or queries that prompt for a parameter when run? I rarely use the latter.
<br />
<br />So if the subform is bound to a table, can you open that table from the Nav pane? Are you sure that there are records in the table that match the record displayed on the main form?
<br />
<br />The generally reason a subform won't open is if there is no data retreived in the subform.

<h2>            I don&#39;t receive the password recovery link and hence my hotmail account is blocked</h2>
                    I made the fatal mistake of mistyping my hotmail password 3 times.
<div>I then followed the link for the password reset, and tried to fill the on-line form: I received an automatic answer that I did not provide enough information.</div>
<div>I did not save a phone number, so I cannot have single use code texted.</div>
<div>I then tried with having a password recovery link sent to me to my secondary email accounts: this link never arrived.</div>
<div>I tried this last option (password recovery link via email) one more time, one week after... same thing, never arrived.</div>
<div>In essence, without the password recovery link, I am stuck.</div>
<div>Of course:</div>
<div>- I checked the spam in my secondary email (gmail), and no email from microsoft</div>
<div>- I checked if my account functions, and it does!</div>
<div>The issue might be that I had 2 password recovery emails - one was my former work email (not working any more) and one was gmail (fully working).</div>
<div>I contacted the live help (call center) but they don't provide voice support.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What can I do?</div>
<div>Any way I can get a password recovery link sent to my gmail account?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PLEASE HELP - it is 2 weeks I am trying to access this account!</div>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I wonder if it's possible to add my outlook.com account (a live.com address) to Outlook 2016 (Desktop) using POP3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I follow the guidelines here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.outlook-apps.com/outlook-com-pop-settings/#!prettyPhoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.outlook-apps.com/outlook-com-pop-settings/#!prettyPhoto</a>&nbsp;<br />
...I just get notified I am not able to log-in to the server although a test message is successfully sent to my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my outlook.com account as well as my Gmail account to use the same inbox in Outlook 2016 and as far as I know the only way to achieve that is to use POP3, or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Replicate the checkbox functionality of a MultiValue Field in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> panamaed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replicate the checkbox functionality of a MultiValue Field in Microsoft Access 2016</h2>
                    <p>My company has a list of 20 technical “Skills” that are used to evaluate potential employees. The list is in my database as table “<strong>tSkills</strong>”.</p>
<p>Many schools have specialized, technical “Programs” that focus on areas of interest to my company. In my database is another table called “<strong>tSchoolPrograms</strong>” that lists all the programs and associated data (school name, teacher name, Program
 enrollment, etc.). </p>
<p>A form named <strong>fSchoolPrograms</strong> is bound to <strong>tSchoolPrograms
</strong>and each record shows all of the data for that Program.</p>
<p>For each Program (each main form record), I want the user to be able to click one or more Skill checkboxes to indicate that the current Program has potential application to one or more of the Skills.</p>
<p>I see this as a many-to-many problem and have based the subform on a junction table
<strong>tjPrograms_Skills </strong>that includes the SchoolProgram_ID and the Skill_ID as the Primary Key and a third checkbox field.</p>
<p>I have created a continuous subform (<strong>sfCompanySkills</strong>) bound to the junction table. It has two controls bound to the Skill_ID and the Checkbox. (Later I will display the actual Skill instead of the Skill_ID).
</p>
<p>I want the subform to always show all 20 Skills in <strong>tSkills </strong>along with a checkbox (checked or not) for each Skill.
</p>
<p>The main form and subform are linked by the Program_ID which is in both tables.</p>
<p>PROBLEM:</p>
<p>It doesn’t work! </p>
<p>When <strong>fSchoolPrograms </strong>opens, all Program info on the main form shows as desired; but the subform displays only a zero for the Skill_ID and an unchecked checkbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help.</p>
<p>PS - I think I can do this with VBA, but suspect there is a way to do it using a variation of the approach above.</p>

            I would do this with a temp table. Bind the subform to a temp table.
<br />tblTempSkills:
<br />ParentID
<br />SkillID
<br />Selection
<br />
<br />When the form opens run code like:
<br />
<br />Dim strSQL As String
<br />
<br />strSQL = "DELETE * FROM tblTempSkills;"
<br />CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError
<br />
<br />strSQL = "INSERT INTO tblTempSkills (ParentID, SkillID) " &amp; _
<br />                "SELECT " &amp; Me.ParentID &amp; ", SkillID " &amp; _
<br />                "FROM tSkills;"
<br />CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, DBFailOnError
<br />
<br />strSQL = "UPDATE tblTempSkill SET Selection = True WHERE SkillID IN(Select SkillID from jProgramSkills WHERE ParentID = " &amp; Me.ParentID &amp; ";"
<br />CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError
<br />
<br />This code should populate the temp table with all skills and set the checkbox to True for any previous selected skills.
<br />
<br />You can then reverse this by updating the junction tale for any selected skills.

            An alternative approach would be to use a multi-select list box rather than a subform.&nbsp; You'll find an example in StudentCourses.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates several possible interfaces to represent a many-to-many relationship type like yours, including the use of a&nbsp; multi-select list box:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3aae1838-c694-418d-ac69-8e1168d6ce7c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3aae1838-c694-418d-ac69-8e1168d6ce7c?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
Code in the form's module reads and writes data from the StudentCourses table which models the relationship type.&nbsp; The disadvantage of this interface, as with a multi-valued field, is that it is not possible to record any non-key attributes of the relationship
 type.&nbsp; In my demo, only the conventional interface of a form/subform caters for the Status attribute, represented by a column in StudentCourses.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have simulated your concern however, I did not get the same result as yours and it works fine when I use&nbsp; Control (Ctrl)&nbsp;key&nbsp;and click the desired photos both in Hotmail and in Outlook. For the simulation steps I did, please refer below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Outlook.com:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign-in to your account. Go to <strong>Inbox</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>New</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click the <strong>Paper clip icon</strong> with<strong> Attach files</strong> beside it.</p>
<p>4. A message box will open and browse for the desired photos you want to attach. Press
<strong>Control (Ctrl) key</strong> and hover your mouse to the image you want to attach and<strong> left-click</strong> your mouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please verify if this will also apply on your concern. If not, please let us know immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Hello again, Anyone got a patch, error started after I got the preview build ending in 56. I originally received windows 10 on the first day of release. shortly after I signed up for preview builds, all was working until I received the last of the preview builds.
 After that received error code on attempts to update preview builds, tried to roll back,then system restore, all ended up same way.... went to support and tried to use two of the manual fixes after "fix it" failed... finally stopped builds and went back to
 original build. but still get same error.. Finally ate my pride and asked for help. Anyone have a "patch" that I can sew in... and again, in advance Thank you.

            You can't believe everything you find on the web.&nbsp; MS may have learned of that key and disabled it.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you have to buy Office!<br />

<b>Buying Office 2010: Summary</b>
<p>This page has similar information: <a href="https://rstlaw.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/may-i-see-your-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://rstlaw.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/may-i-see-your-license/</a> </p>
<p><span>When home users and small businesses buy office, it is my personal preference to insist on the Boxed CD "FPP" or Retail license of your choice of the 3 Office bundles. In the Retail version you get the Installation
 disk built into exactly the same price you would pay for software only in the online download. And, it gives you the best set of user rights of the license. It allows you to install on 2 or 3 machines at the same time and to transfer the installation when
 you want to. The "PKC" or Product Key Card is slightly cheaper, but allows installation on only 1 machine and no transfer rights. If your brand new computer "melts down" in the hardware warrantee period, it will be replaced, but you will have to BUY another
 PKC license!</span></p>
<p>An additional benefit of the Retail version is that by using the DVD for installation, you completely avoid the possibility of MS “sneaking” the “Click to Run” crapware to you.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>no matter how you buy Office you need to keep "physical" copies of 3 pieces of information. The purchase receipt (credit card statement), Product Key, and the installation file on CD/DVD. With the first 2 you can get replacement copies from MS, with
 the last 2 you can re-install at your convenience without talking to MS (ie 5 years down the line when you retire this machine and get a new one).</p>

</span></span></span><b>Q:</b> What are the steps for student verification? </p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>A:</b> There are just four easy steps. If you’re not signed in to your Windows Live ID account, the site will first direct you to the Windows Live ID sign-in page. Next you’ll visit the Academic Verification page where you’ll take the
 following steps: <br />
<br />
1. Verify or select your country from the drop down menu. <br />
2. Select your preferred verification method (3 choices) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. If you select “Get verified through my school”, you’ll be taken to the school search page where you can follow the steps to search for and select your school to complete verification.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. If you select “I have a Verification Code”, you’ll be required to enter the activation code that was given to you by either your school’s administrator or Microsoft.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. If you select “I have an ISIC card”, you’ll be required to enter your student identification card number.
<br />
3. Click “Continue”. </p>

<b>2010 Academic discontinued</b>
<p>The Academic discount is the next best Office deal you will find. For students who can prove they are at MS approved educational institutions can buy Office Pro for $100. Be sure to get the installation disk at the same time, even if
 you have to pay $10-15 extra.</p>
<p>Access , Communicator , Excel , InfoPath , OneNote , Outlook with Business Contact Manager , PowerPoint , Publisher , SharePoint Workspace , Word</p>
<p>Academic is equivalent to Pro Plus. In theory your key should work on any Pro Plus installation file.</p>

</p>
<p>If you purchased an Academic version, you can download the corresponding regular Office 2010 product from any download site. For example, if you purchased Office Professional Academic 2010, you can download Office Professional 2010.</p>
<p>Pro Plus is a volume license version, Academic is one source for “general public” - return to vendor site for downloads</p>
<p>USD100 + USD15 for backup disk (also can get Win7 Pro Upgrade for ~USD30)<span>&nbsp;
</span>Some places the Academic offer is Office Pro and others it is Pro Plus</p>

<p>Just opened my e-mail and had a message back from Digital River:</p>
<p>"Thank you for contacting the Ultimate Steal online store.
</p>
<p>We understand that you would like to have the 64-bit version of your Microsoft Office Professional Academic 2010.</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that 64-bit version is not available.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However most users install 32-bit version of Office 2010 on both 32 and 64-bit Operating Systems because currently many common add-ins for Office will not function in the 64-bit edition. The 64-bit installation of Microsoft Office 2010
 products is available for users who commonly use very large documents or data set and need Excel 2010 programs to access greater than 2GB of memory. There may be technical issues with the 64-bit version and in order to install a 64-bit version of Office 2010
 product users must have a 64-bit supported operating system on their PC.</p>
<p>We are glad to be of service to you."</p>
<p>I have yet to reply to it but I'm already annoyed. I ordered this with the impression that there was going to be an x64 installer (just like the retail copies). They can either give me the installer or give me a refund at this point.
 Yes I know I can run the x86 version in x64 (which is what I'm doing now), but I wanted Office 2010 mostly because it was going to be the first true x64 version of Office.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>For some reason I was not presented with an option to download the x64 installer.&nbsp; There was just 1 download link and it was the old X16-32007.exe.&nbsp; However their download link: https://www2.buyoffice.microsoft.com/usa/unitdownloader.aspx?cache=XXXXXXX&amp;local_only=true&amp;receipt_id=XXXXXXX&amp;dname=O14.download.name.32&amp;id=XXXXXXX&amp;culture=en-us&nbsp;
 you can simply change the download.name.32 to64 and it will start downloading X16-31970.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The XXXXXXX are your particular variables in your shopping session</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi all.
</span>The Digital River backup disk DOES contain the 64-bit folder to run from. Remember you need to uninstall all remnants of any Office 32-bit components beforehand. Microsoft has very thorough unique version-specific uninstallers at the Office support website
 you can run if there is any problem with the usual uninstall.</p>
<p>I tried pretty aggressively to get them to e-mail me the 64.bit exe file to run with the download but no one would. I guess you need to get to the right person. All their e-mails that said they didn't offer 64-bit installation were misrepresentations.</p>
<p>The trial version workaround solution sounds pretty good if it works for everyone--saves having to buy the backup disk.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt; </p>

<p><span>ok, I know I can't run Office on Mac. &nbsp;According to the Apple web page I can "reassign" the program by getting a code and then deleting it from my system. &nbsp;Then to contact the technical manager to check my elegibility and
 reset it. &nbsp;I can then go back in and down load it again by paying the $20 again and install the Mac version. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>

<p>Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in a stack, text and images are always on different cards (except captions) as you have observed.&nbsp; If you want to show the image and the text together inside a larger Sway, you could try making a separate Sway that has the layout that is optimized for
 presentations and embedding it in the other Sway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Very Specific Issue Regarding Activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, run into a bit of an issue with Windows 10 Insider Preview. I had it installed on a Surface Pro 3 since basically last October, and unfortunately my poor Surface Pro 3 started to exhibit some hardware issues so I took it in for a warranty replacement.
 Now I took it in and it had 10240 installed on it, and they cloned the drive over to the replacement device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, because the new device is different enough (I'm guessing it's a UEFI key thing), I can't activate Windows now! So I guess the ultimate question is: will I have to roll back to 8.1 or will the Insider Previews be able to be activated again
 starting this Wednesday?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all!</p>

<p>

<h2>            Best method for &#39;merging&#39; multiple OneNote notebooks into a single OneNote Online notebook&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently built a new dedicated SharePoint Online site, that has the usual dedicated OneNote Online notebook associated with it. &nbsp; From another dedicated SharePoint Online site, within my same domain, there are about 6-7 small individual OneNote Notebooks
 (each a single page) under the default Document Library that I would like to be able to 'merge' into the new dedicated OneNote Online notebook, so that there are just multiple pages in the OneNote Online notebook, rather than having multiple individual OneNote
 notebooks in the document library.</p>
<p>Is there a way to do this, or would I need to make new individual pages in the new SharePoint Online site's OneNote Online notebook, and then copy/paste the contents of the individual OneNote Notebooks from the other SharePoint Online site's document library?</p>

<p>hi qs-it,</p>
<p>to meet your needs, you can move multiple onenote notebooks from one site to another &nbsp;and then move every page into the destination notebook on the site. here are the details:<br />
1. open notebooks of the two sites and click <strong>open in onenote</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24056b3e-cda8-46f8-8136-0527c423c919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24056b3e-cda8-46f8-8136-0527c423c919" /></a></p>

2. both notebooks will be synced to the onenote client. then you can drag a section of notebook directly and put it into another notebook. once it is finished, the changes will be updated to the notebook on the site automatically.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25cc0b19-9aeb-4640-b5ea-c8170f33ac4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25cc0b19-9aeb-4640-b5ea-c8170f33ac4b" /></a><br />
3. go to notebooks on your dedicated sharepoint online site, and drag the page to your destination notebook then delete unwanted sections.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/978b7abb-2a66-43f1-affd-99e76c6aeac9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/978b7abb-2a66-43f1-affd-99e76c6aeac9" /></a></p>

            Are you sure the message you're seeing is in regard to Office 2011?&nbsp; Most people purchased Office 2011 with a perpetual license. I don't think a subscription was available back in 2013. Subscriptions for Office 2011 began in late 2015 with the introduction
 of Office 2016 for Mac where there was an option to install 2011.

            Thanks for your reply. I purchased my Macbook early in 2013 and MS office 2011 was what was available then. I also thought I had purchased a perpetual license. And still do. A month or so ago, I made a complete copy of my laptop's hard drive including
 SW. Could that be causing MS Office issues thinking there are multiple SW copies? Since I only use this SW for personal home stuff, there are many other free options available. Thanks again. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>You can check your license type easily. Open Word and go to the Word menu. Choose About Word. If you have a subscription, the dialog will say Office 365 subscription. I think it is highly unlikely you have such a subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A perpetual license, which is what you probably have, does not expire. My guess is that you have a new hard drive and that instead of using Apple's Migration assistant or a disc image, you used some other method to bring your office install forward. If you
 use Apple's Migration assistant or restore from a disc image using Disk Utility, Carbon Copy Cloner, or some other app, you won't run into licensing issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used some other procedure, you should completely remove, and then reinstall Office 2011.</p>
