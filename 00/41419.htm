            <p>Hello Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are getting an error code 80244018 while installing updates. The error message 0x80244018 is displayed when Windows is unable to reach the Windows update servers due to proxy connection or due to a firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">If you get this error, it may be because you are behind a proxy server.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If that is the case, please try the following steps to fix the error:</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span><span>In Internet Explorer, tap or click on the <strong>

<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span><span>Tap or click <strong>Ok</strong> and then <strong>
Apply</strong> to exit out of <strong>Internet Options</strong> and go back to the Windows Store to download your app again.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">If checking <strong>Automatically detect settings</strong> does not help, then you will need to consult with your network administrators who manages the proxy to identify which URL’s the proxy is restricting
 access to.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If still you are unable to install the updates, this problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Windows Update database is corrupted.</span></p>
</li><li>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A required system file is registered incorrectly.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the below mentioned methods, you may ignore the steps you have tried but it would be great if you follow the sequence of troubleshooting provided below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to run Windows update troubleshooter from the link mentioned below and if it doesn't help try to follow different steps mentioned in the following article.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>If issue still persists I would suggest you to <strong>reset Windows Update components</strong> and for that t</span>ry to run the
<strong>fixit</strong> provided in the following article. If you had already tried the same fixit before I would request you to run the fixit again.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to check if you are able to access Windows Update services and also make sure that the following services are started. If it is not started follow the below mentioned steps:</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type "<strong>services.msc</strong>" (without quotes) in start run box and&nbsp;press

    <title>Caps Lock ONLY Toggles On&#47;Off By Pressing Shift Key While Pressing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -display-name-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Caps Lock ONLY Toggles On&#47;Off By Pressing Shift Key While Pressing Caps Lock.</h2>
                    So for whatever reason, my caps lock can only be turned on and off while I'm pressing the shift (or ctrl) key along with the caps lock key. If someone could help me figure out how to make it so I can turn caps lock on and off just by pressing the caps
 lock key without needing to press the shit or ctrl key, it would be greatly appreciated. (I'm unsure of the category so I just picked windows settings.)

            Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />3: Turn off filter keys in Ease of Access
<br />Type ease in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Ease of Access &gt; Click Make the Keyboard easier to use &gt; Ensure Turn on filter Keys is not checked

            Hi Roy,
<br />
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor
<br />
<br />To prevent Windows from asking for the password every time we turn on the PC, we must change a configuration in User Accounts. The quickest way to get here without battling with menus and the Control Panel is to press the Windows and R keys on your keyboard at the same time. This will open the Windows Run dialog box. Here, type netplwiz and press OK
<br />
<br />The Windows User Accounts settings window will open. Here you can modify some settings of the settings, although it is a vestige of past times as part of its functionality has been changed to the new Windows 10 settings. For now, it is still working, and all you need to do is uncheck the box Users they must write their name and password to use the equipment.
<br />
<br />When you click OK, Windows will ask you for the username and password with which you want to log in to Windows automatically. Your Windows can count on several user accounts, so Windows needs to know which one will log on by itself, without needing you to put the password. Keep in mind that in Windows 10 user accounts are often hotmail accounts.
<br />It is done. The next time you restart Windows, or turn it on, you will not need to enter your password. Instead, the system will open directly to the Desktop, ready to work. If at any time you change your mind and prefer to re-use your password, repeat the steps above but check the box Users must enter their name and password to use the device.
<br />
<br />I hope this can help you

<p>How is this game? I recently bought the Game of the Year edition but due to a recent theft of my Xbox, I am unable to play it. Is this game any good? And are there people looking to start over cuz I need people to play with when I get a xbox again. Also,
 kind of off-topic, but I just changed my gamertag, with all of my saves ect. stay the same? Or will they delete with the new GT?</p>

<p>remember to transfer your xbox account licences if possible from your old xbox to the new one, that is if you can but might be a problem from the stolen one, but it also might help recover your old xbox if they used it to connect to xbox live.</p>

<p>if you don't do this all the market place content that you got on the other xbox you will not be able to use on your new one, and if you do this everything you got on the old xbox will now be use able on your new one.</p>
<p>Good Luck ... see you in the Borderlands.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail app won&#39;t print.</h2>
                    No e-mails in the Mail app in Windows 10 will print.&nbsp; Microsoft XPS writer, Print to PDF, 3rd party PDF writers, and my Epson XP 610 all will not print from Windows 10 Mail.&nbsp; All these printers work fine from other apps including browsers Edge and Firefox,
 Word 2016, Outlook 2016, etc.&nbsp; I can manage to get an e-mail printed from Mail by saving it as a .eml file and then opening and printing it from Outlook 2016.&nbsp; If I try to open the .eml file with Mail it opens fine but there is no print option.&nbsp; I can open
 e-mails using the web interface to gmail and then print from there without any problem.&nbsp; This behavior is occurring on a new ASUS notebook running Windows 10, 64 bit, updated to ver. 1703, build 15063.483. From various threads in this forum, it seems that
 the problem has been going on for quite some time with no fix identified.&nbsp; Also, no one seems to have a direct solution to make Mail actually print.&nbsp; Do we now just have to wait for Microsoft

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. I understand that the presentation you've recorded doesn't recognize in Photo Gallery. You can import any videos in Photo Gallery and it will not limit the size as long as your computer storage have enough space.&nbsp;For
 your issue,&nbsp;make sure that the file type is supported to isolate file type concern. You may check the list on this link:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>What kind of files can I use?</strong></a>&nbsp;(Note: File types that are supported in Movie Maker, are also supported in Photo Gallery).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure also that the folder or path of the presentation is included in your Libraries. To know more, you may refer to this link:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/include-folders-in-a-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Include folders in a library</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, we would need some information from you for further isolation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the file format of your presentation? </li><li>Does the issue occur before? </li><li>Does the issue occur to all presentations or on a specific presentation? </li><li>Are you able to view your presentation using other Video/Photo Viewer? </li><li>Do you receive any error message?</li></ul>

    <title>can&#39;t get stereo sound to work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slickrcbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t get stereo sound to work</h2>
                    Ever since I replaced the hard drives on my OLD Dell Optiplex GX110 system, I've been unable to get stereo sound.
<br />
Could it be connected to the fact that when I ran setup, I'd had the bare minimum hardware connected to the computer, and as such, the speakers were disconnected? I thought it was the integrated sound hardware that was important, not the presence of stereo
 speakers. Yet I've downloaded the 2000/XP drivers from Dell and installed them, yet I still only get sound from one speaker or one side of the headphones (when connecting headphones to the sound-out port on the back of the computer in place of speakers. There
 is no headphone jack on this model). <br />
<br />
Connecting two different sets of headphones in place of the speaker has no effect, and I've connected the speakers to the headphone jack on both my desktop (but not the sound out jack on the back of the desktop)&nbsp; and laptop and they work fine. The speakers
 were working prior to the hard drive crash.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would a repair install of Windows XP work, or would I have to do a clean install? I didn't notice until after I'd reinstalled 90% of my applications and games and decided to take a break and play one of those games. It took all day to reinstall XP and all my
 games (over a dozen). <br />
It took all afternoon to reinstall everything from CDs and then patch them and get them to work in XP: Otherwise this was about as clean an install as you could get, considering that the hard drive had been DoD wiped prior to my booting the XP CD.<br />

            Your link is for Windows 7, there is no "audio troubleshooter" in either Windows 98SE or Windows XP Professional.
<br />
As for checking the hardware, I've clearly stated that I've done so. The only thing I haven't triple-checked is the internal cd-audio cable from one of the the two CD-ROMs to the motherboard. As I didn't touch that when I replaced the hard drives and the audio
 was working fine prior to the crash, I doubt it's the cause.<br />
<br />
I've downloaded the drivers from Dell and reinstalled them from a backup, so I doubt it's that. I even redownloaded them just to be sure.<br />
<br />
I apologize for taking so long and being terse, I've been fighting off a sinus infection for over a week and can't afford to miss any more work as I'm a low-paid temp.<br />

            I found the problem, it was apparently a hardware problem, but a strange one. I'm A+ certified and have been installing CD-ROMS for 20 years, yet this one has me a bit stumped.<br />
<br />
The computer has two CD-ROMs on the secondary IDE controller. The top (primary) CD-ROM failed on me. I replaced it, but when I got everything back together I noticed I forgot to reconnect the audio cable, and I only noticed because it was lying on the table
 where I'd hauled the computer for the "operation". Yet the computer booted up and gave sound from both speakers. I was also able to play music from a CD, read data, and burn a CD-RW from both drives.<br />
<br />
I tried putting the cable back, and I once again got mono sound. Apparently it's a bad cable, as I got the same results on both drives. I must have damaged it when I replaced the hard drives, but why would the bad cable disable stereo sound?<br />
<br />
I can't even recall what exactly it's used for, since the cable is not used on the bottom optical drive and the only difference I see between them is that the bottom drive can also read DVDs (and shows up as a different brand/model in Device Manager). They
 both function perfectly fine without it.<br />
<br />
So why would a bad CD-audio cable disable stereo sound on the computer even when there are no CDs in the drive? Should I bother to get another one? I'm pretty sure I can salvage one from my old broken Powermac that I haven't been able to dispose of yet.<br />
<br />
P.S. Please mark this as the answer. I'm unable to do so since I'm the OP and I can't answer my own question, but a mod can mark it as an answer.<br />

            I ran into this and had a similar problem when I tried it in windows 7.&nbsp; In both cases using disk manager I was able to see the disk but it was reporting it could not manage it without a 'label' but I put it back in the original computer and it worked,
 so I wonder if there was/is some intentional or unintentional modification/key which means the drive's data can't be accessed when removed from the original system.

<p>I had the same problem. I had 3 different SATA drives and tried them all in 2 different USB enclosures and with different cables.&nbsp; All were recognized as USB to ATA/ATAPI bridges and wouldn't show up in My Computer.</p>
<p>In Disk Management I finally got them showing up by assigning them drive letters.</p>

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>

<div>Yes</div>

<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
</p>
<p>Computer hard drived crashed and was replaced. Did recovery on Asus computer to reinstall and everything reinstalled fine except Windows Live Mail. It would install but when upon trying to open the error message would show up. It can't be a calendar issue,
 did the suggestions on site about date and time and that did not solve. Did some other things to see if some files needed repairing and to no avail. There is no way to open the application so that I can setup the email account. Uninstalled and Installed Windows
 live several times, checked forums and found nothing that seem to work. <br />
<br />
So basically all I'm trying to do is setup the email account through windows live as it will come across new but the error will not let me open the program at all.&nbsp; Also not sure which version of Live using as it shows 2011 version with 3 different version
 numbers. I just know it's 2011. </p>

"Windows Live Mail could not be started. Closing windows live mail. Your calendar contains corrupt data that is forcing Windows Live Mail to close<br />

<p>Windows 10 Pro machine. I asked if there was a Microsoft program, such as "Virtual PC," which I had installed on</p>
<p>my Windows 7 Professional machine - so that I could run a program that would not run on any operating system</p>
<p>newer than XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Microsoft's Hyper-V on this Windows 10 machine. At least, I think that I have installed it correctly. When</p>
<p>I click the "Start" button in the lower left corner of the Desktop and scroll down the program list, there are two</p>
<p>entries - in Windows Administrative Tools: Hyper-V Manager and Hyper-V Quick Create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what I need to do next. On the Windows 7 machine, an icon was created on the Desktop, called</p>
<p>"Windows XP Mode" and I went to that and installed the program that would not run on any operating system</p>
<p>newer than XP. Do I need to go out and purchase a (legitimate) copy of the Windows XP operating system and</p>
<p>install it on the Windows 10 machine, or is the computer all ready for the installation of this program that I am</p>
<p>trying to run on the Windows 10 machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for any assistance with this!</p>
<p>

            Hi AnbroBR 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Before you do the steps below make sure you have an ISO of your image.
<br />You can get trial ISOs from the Technet Evaluation Center.
<br />Go to search and type hyper-v
<br />Select the one with quick create.
<br />Click Local Installation Source.
<br />Click change installation source and make sure it is pointing your ISO or you can use a build VHD.
<br />Click create virtual machine.
<br />This will take 5-10 minutes depending.
<br />Click Connect.
<br />You can then start your VM and all set!       
        </p>

            ISO of the image is just a format the image is in. 
<br />VHD is a virtual hard drive.  So creating a virtual drives on your physical drive.

<h2>            How to Delete Information from Windows 10 Home Ed. Mobile Hotspot.</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have Windows 10 Home Edition which has latest updates. I am very sure I have been hacked and have removed spyware with an online scanner after my security suite and Microsoft's in built security ware didn't find it, including an offline Windows Defender
 scan. What I also found was about 8 and growing Microsoft wifi Direct Virtual Adapters in hidden files, which also show up as a long list of connections in network properties. My LAN VPN connection is clearly through TAP adapter. In addition a mobile hotspot
 was activated, and not by me, with a network name that used my surname and some numbers and a password, also "turn on remotely" was activated. I had previously ensured this was all disabled! I should mention that in trying to fight back and secure my internet
 I installed a VPN which is attached to my new Internet Security suite and I installed a USB ac wifi adapter. The latter interestingly showed that when that adapter was active a not so far from me &nbsp;network mirrored that connection and then stopped showing ac
 wifi when `I turned mine off. I also had some strange stuff show up like fake Chrome login page and some issues with my Macbook pro too. I have turned off my wifi from the router and am at present only running ethernet connections, but even then the problem
 did not go away. I have used a number of fixes with regedit, disabled and tried to delete Microsoft Wifi Direct Adapters, and today did cmd NETSH LAN entries to stop and block hostednetwork. BUT in settings Mobile Hotspot, which I have set to off and disabled
 remote turn on, there is still my network name present in "Share my network internet connection from" when I am connected, and the network name and password someone has set up is still showing. When I go into Edit it simply asks for new name password and there
 seems no way to get rid of this. Short of doing a clean install of Windows 10 I am running out of ideas. I've done lots of searching and reading of internet and this forum but I feel I am just picking away at this problem and maybe missing a bigger issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can give me some ideas. I am no tech expert but know plenty of you out there are :)</p>

 because the caller has already been disconnected. If I try to call out, I hear a dial tone, but no ringing... just silence... After about 5-10 seconds, the person I'm calling will receive my call, but they won't hear anything when picking up. On my end, the
 call doesn't appear to connect, I just hear a busy signal when they pickup and then the call disconnects.</span>

<p>Hi Winnie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's odd for your keyboard keys to stopped working after a Windows update. There could be some other changes (software, programs, drivers) that affected your notebook's keyboard. However, let us isolate your concern by providing the answers to these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What <strong>build</strong> and <strong>version</strong> of Windows are you running on your notebook?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Right-click</strong> on the Windows icon on your screen,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and choose System to see the build and version of your </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried using an external keyboard to replicate the issue?</li><li>Have you checked if the on-screen keyboard does the same?</li><li>What was the last update that was installed on your notebook?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may follow the troubleshooting steps in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17417/windows-mouse-touchpad-keyboard-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> regarding
<strong>Mouse, touchpad, and keyboard problems in Windows 10</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Hi Shinupereira!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try using System Restore to restore your system earlier when that software was not uninstalled usually 2 to 3 Days before the deletion took place...To do so (in Windows 7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Open System Restore by </span></p>
<p><span>clicking the <span>Start</span> button , </span>
</p>
<p><span>clicking <span>All Programs</span>, </span>
</p>
<p><span>clicking <span>Accessories</span>, </span>
</p>
<p><span>clicking <span>System Tools</span>, </span>
</p>
<p><span>and then clicking <span>System Restore</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then select the one restore point which suits you....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps!!!</p>

<p>If the uninstaller checks for an existing installation, you can try delete the registry entry for that installer.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Windows 7 to Windows 10 Upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a refurb computer (HP3115m) from Staples that had preinstalled Windows 7 Professional which I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro. I did not use the computer for a while - more than 30 days. When I came back to it I was asked for an activation code, which
 I put in, but the system did not recognize it. I called the refurb people and they gave me another product code, but that did not work either. They told me it was a MS problem and nothing to do with them, but now I am stuck since it will not allow me to revert
 back to Windows 7 and the Windows old files have disappeared from my hard drive. This is so annoying.</p>
<p>

<h3> old 06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting error message when trying to sync Ipod in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just tried syncing my Ipod for the first time after installing Windows 10. &nbsp;Immediately, a window popped up telling me that "this computer is not authorized." &nbsp;I authorized it, and immediately I got another window telling me that "this computer is already
 authorized." I clicked it off, and the "This computer is not authorized" window popped up immediately again. &nbsp;After talking with Apple and running thru a complete uninstall of ALL Apple programs (iTunes, Bonjour, AMDS, Quicktime, etc in the specific order
 they recommended), deauthorizing ALL my old computers and re-installing just the one PC, the problem still exists. Apple's prognosis is a registry error buried deep in the Windows 10 program. &nbsp;They have NEVER experienced this problem, so, apparently, this
 is their Beta case!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
