<h2>            Windows Process Manager 32bit virus</h2>
                    <p>In my task manager I can see anywhere from 2-8 instances of Windows Process Manager (32bit) running which takes up a lot of CPU. If i end the task, it comes back. I used task manager to find the location of it. Its in the local folder of appdata but it tells
 me access denied if I try to select the folder itself. Ive also tried editing permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried running Malwarebytes, avast, windows defender, norton, and malwarebytes antirootkit to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant seem to get rid of it. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

                    <p>It started with Build 14279 and continues in 14291.&nbsp; CPU usage is consistently above 15% and spikes very high.&nbsp; Between Speech Runtime Executable always over 2%, Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation over 1.5%, and&nbsp;WMI Provider Host&nbsp;never under 10%, this
 old Pentium test PC has become very sluggish for the first time, and the fan has been working overtime over the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; What's going on?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Glad to hear your CPU usage went down.&nbsp; Mine's about the same (never below 10%), which is clearly odd since my other devices, on 8.1 and 10 Home, are at 0% when idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine cannot be an isolated case, either, as there are many upvotes to my posting in the Feedback Hub, and many new entries with the same issue as well.</p>

<div>It sounds like you may have mistaken Windows Phone as being an&nbsp;extension&nbsp;of Windows Mobile or somehow&nbsp;derived&nbsp;from it. Windows Phone and Windows Mobile are two different operating systems. Windows Phone being newer does not have the functionality that
 Windows Mobile had accumulated over the past 5 years.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you use Sharepoint you can also add your Sharepoint account onto the phone to access documents too.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Based on the initial presentation for Windows Phone (10 February 2010) consumer scenarios were prioritized over business scenarios. Later in the year at various events it was stated that we would hear more information on plans for supporting business scenarios
 during the 2011 year.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right now the only methods for getting office documents onto your phone are to e-mail them, download them from a web service, or through sharepoint. Demonstrations of the forthcoming firmware update (Mango)have shown that the office documents will get
 integrated into Skydrive which will provide another way to sync documents between your computer an phone. There are still more announcements to come on the user experience in Mango so we'll have to wait to see what other methods of managing Office documents
 get added.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Word 2010&#58; USB Stick-docx file-replaced with xml</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife brought home a USB stick with a Word 2010 docx file on it to work on. She was able to open it, but when she saved it, Word 2010 deleted the docx file completely and replaced it with a "filename.doc.xml" file. Completely removing the original docx
 file....</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click to open it, Notepad tries to open it, but cannot. If you right click on it, select open with: Word, Word tries, but belly-aches about a character error in the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why it would completely remove the original file.....no temp file as a back up either....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jim</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Before she went back to the office to work on it, I did notice some sort of "encriptor" file at the bottom of the file list????</p>

<p>But why would Word (or Windows 8.1 let) completely trash the original and replace it? Usually if it's going to Save it As (which it did) a file with a different extension, the original docx file should still be there.</p>

            This is <strong>not</strong> correct. You should not open the document from the USB stick at all but rather copy it to the hard drive (using Windows Explorer) before opening it in Word.

</p><p>I am starting to think it is that little "encriptor" file on the USB stick (that has the file on it). It was taken to the original PC, and all is OK. It was then taken to yet another PC and the same thing happened. The file "appears" to be re-written to
 an xml file....</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it seems to be working fine on the original system, you may copy over the original file onto the USB stick again. Once you get to the other systems, instead of opening the file directly from the USB stick, copy over the file locally as suggested by
 ‘Suzanne’ and check how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above information helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have the same here from production Windows 10 version 16299.64 on the fast ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue from 17025 to 17040 so I decided to rebuild my test machine with the production version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did your machine hang in booting up when it tried to update to 17046.1000?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What processor and device is this happening on?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is a notebook Dell Inspiron 9300 with a Pentium M @2.3Ghz and 2MB of RAM. I use it to run Windows 7 with old programs and works perfectly after all these years, a true workhorse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine doesn't hang, it does one reboot during the install process and comes back to Build 17040 with the error that the update couldn't be completed. Like I said, this is the first time ever that an update failed on this machine since the Insider program
 started and it runs FCU without a glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Sounds like MS is starting to phase out old hardware with 17046 then.</p>
<p>If the next build doesn't install, that will confirm my suspicions.</p>

<p>Hi MELERIX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to install and run without a glitch up until 17040, the problem started with 17046. I don't have those settings in bios nor I use third party antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On my 32bit machine, as a last resort and to further prove my point, I decided to install a fresh copy of FCU and try to re-join the Insiders Program, but it didn't work either.</span></p>
<p><span><span>After&nbsp;signing up and coming back from the obligatory restart, nothing happened. I tried many times and always the same. I'm not able or should I say "allowed" to join again, and there are no errors to speak of.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>On my 64bit machine, I was using legacy mode and MBR so I reset the bios to factory defaults (UEFI) and I was able to install 17063 without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is further proof that&nbsp;<span>MS is blocking newer builds from installing on older hardware with legacy bios.</span></p>

    <title>Vertical Ruler Disappearing, Double Scroll Bar &#38; Print Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kfrankhauser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vertical Ruler Disappearing, Double Scroll Bar &#38; Print Preview Menu Issue</h2>
                    <p>Recently I upgraded all computers in the office to Microsoft Office 10. When doing this, one computer user in particular started having strange things happen to Word. I have put into the forum already regarding the double scroll bar issue that has been occurring
 in the Print Preview Screen. I took the advice of those who made suggestions; this includes performing a fix on Microsoft Office, Uninstalling and Reinstalling Microsoft Office (twice), using OffCAT and a few others. Unfortunately none of these have worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the reinstall this last time two more issues started to occur for the user in Microsoft Word. The first is that in the print preview screen when scrolling through the pages (while the user still has the double scroll bar) the menu bar to the
 left in the blue section has started to scroll as well, displaying all recent documents rather than staying at the top and keeping the menu (i.e. save, print etc.) present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next issue is that when in regular view the vertical ruler started to just go away after scrolling past one page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below you will find a screenshot of each issue in order of problem listed above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, if you have experienced anything like this and been able to resolve it let me know. We are at a loss as to what to do. Thanks, Katelyn</p>

</p><p>I have tried the steps of running Word in safe mode, and sure enough it does not have the double scroll bar while in safe mode. I then followed your instructions regarding com add-ins and doing so did not make a difference. The double scroll bar was there
 just the same as before, along with the other issues. Any other troubleshooting suggestions?</p>

<h2>            page background &#47; page color &#47; fill effects &#47; picture</h2>
                    <p>In Expression Design 4 I created a new page, 85. x 11 inches, 300 DPI.</p>
<p>I drew a box, turned off the border and filled it with a diaganol two colour gradient. I saved it. I printed it through PDFcreator and the result was as I expected, a diaganol gradient from one corner to the other corner filling the entire 8.5 x 11 inch
 area. I exported it as a png at 200 x 200 ppi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened word, set the margins and header and footer positions to 0 inches, and let the application correct them for the selected printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then went to page background / page color / fill effects / picture, selected my png file and was presented with a single diaganol gradient across the page. I added some text to the top, changing it to a heading 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saved the file, then saved as a pdf within word and then also printed it to pdfcreator. The output was not as expected. I had, both pdf outputs, my text, but the background was a bunch of smaller diaganol gradients reapeated across the entire page in a
 3 x 3 matrix, just as if the image had been too small to fit the page and had to be repeated, YUCK! what kind of bug is this?</p>
<p>The other things to note is that most of the controls in the panel are grayed out,</p>
<p>Lock picture aspect ratio, Rotate fill effect with shape, Transparnecy, From, To.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn't this supposed to work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I click on the ? in the upper right corner of the dialog, all I get is some generic mMcrosoft Getting Started dialog. Hey, the ? is supposed to be a contextual help. What kind of hokey software engineering is this?</p>

            <p>I started once again.</p>
<p>This time, instead of using the page background, which is obviously a feature that Microsoft does not have the capability to impliment, (Too much rocket science for the engineers at Microsoft, what rubes). I went through stupid process of inserting a picture
 into the header. Then, I had to resize the picture, beyond the size of the page and fiddle with all the numbers in the Size and Postion and Format Picture dialogs where any change to a number caused all the other numbers to change was stupid.</p>
<p>FWIW, the ? in the upper right corner for the context sensitive help, it worked in the Format Picture dialog, but not in the Size and Postion dialog, Sheesh, too much rocket science again.</p>

            <p>Yes, I understand that the majority of people here are volunteering their time.</p>
<p>I also understand that the majority of people here have direct links into the responsible people at Microsoft.</p>
<p>I have been using Microsoft products since the early 80's.</p>
<p>I have purchased version after version of application and operating system and over and over and over. My observation is that various products have gotten better over time and other products suffered the fate of a marketing change and still other products
 huge numbers of features have been added and still, there are bugs.</p>
<p>My experience has been that when I need to use a feature that is not used very often it invariably has bugs or doesn't work. Because it's not used very often, it does not get noise, and the lack of noise leaves the product manager complacent that they have
 done a good job. Microsoft, pays people very large wages to do a great job and the loyal customer base deserves no less, a great job.</p>
<p>It is 2012, two years since word 2010 arrived. By now, two years later, all the bugs should have been fixed.</p>
<p>I see that I have been asked in a previous email to give direct feedback and will do so later today when I have more time.</p>
<p>I thank you for your comment, as one of the volunteers you yourself have always been most helpful.</p>

            <p>I tried to input the description of the problems to both links that you had provided, they both generate an error,
<span>The answer of the question is too long..</span></p>
<p><span>So, instead, here is the information for your two links,</span></p>
<p>I wanted to have a two colour diagonal background on a page. I wanted to maximise my use of the page. The output of this project was going to
 go to a printer.</p>
<p>In the ribbon on Page Layout, I set the margins to Custom Margins, all to 0 and the Headers and Footer from edge both to 0. Word offered to fix
 the margins to work with the selected printer, Top Left, and Right set to 0.13 and Bottom set to 0.47. I accepted this.</p>
<p>Then, in Page Background / Page Color / Fill Effect, I selected two colors diagonal down and the result was visually exactly as I had expected.
 A diagonal down, light blue to dark blue page background that covered the full page, edge to edge.</p>
<p>When I save it as a PDF from within Word I end up with something that is not the same as that displayed by Word. The result is a repetitive pattern,
 that repeats itself diagonally 7 times. <span>&nbsp;</span>It does go from edge to edge. I then changed the output method to that of printing to PDFCreator. The result was the same as the Word PDF.</p>
<p>I clicked on the ? in the upper corner of the Page Color / Fill Effects .. expecting this context sensitive help feature to help me and the result
 is some generic welcome to Microsoft stuff. It is also at this time that I notice the Transparency From and To menus are grayed out and non-functional, and the Rotate fill affect with shape is also grayed out and non-functional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I figured there has to be another way.</p>
<p>I made a 8.5 inch by 11 inch diagonal background in Expression Designed and exported that as a PNG file.</p>
<p>I added this to my document as a Watermark Picture, and the result was something that would not fill the entire page, it was inside the previously
 set margins by an approximate 0.13 inches. Not good, as now the page had 0.26 inches of white space around the edge. If I change the Scale from Ayot to 150% the results start to look like what I want and what it looks like in Word, both in the Word Save as
 PDF and the PDFCreator PDF.</p>
<p>This works, but the thing is, this is not a Watermark, it is a background. I also wanted to use the Watermark for text to indicate preliminary
 across the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I figured there has to be another way.</p>
<p>I took my Expression Designed PNG image and inserted it as a picture in the header. I set the wrap to be behind text. There are spaces all around
 the edges, so, I go back and start to change the picture size, using Size and Position with a Right mouse click I expand the Height to 12 inches and the width to 9.5 inches and the height number changed, which I decided to ignore.</p>
<p>I still have a blank edge on the left, the width of the margin, 0.13 inches. Back at size and position again I change the layout position to
 be absolute referenced from the page, setting the positions to 0 and then realize that I can drag the image, which I do and now I have something that again covers the entire page, edge to edge.</p>
<p>Save as PDF in Word produces the output I expected and the Print to PDFCreator also produces the output I expected.</p>
<p>There are three in your face bugs here.</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Page Color Fill Effects does not work.</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Page Color Fill Effects menus do not function.</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Page Color Fill Effects context sensitive help does not work.</p>
<p>There are alternative, and with some futzing around, they can be made to do the job, albeit at the cost of other functionally being usurped.</p>

<strong>not</strong> have any direct links to the responsible people at Microsoft, since the majority of people here are just other users. Even the majority of those who provide answers do not have any special connection. Occasionally Word MVPs are asked

            Paying customers who are paying a LOT (huge corporate customers) probably have some channels of communication. For the everyday man-in-the-street single user, there is no such path. If the feedback sites "Joe's answer" suggested are not helpful, then I
 don't know what to suggest. MS welcomes feedback during public betas; once the product ships, it's harder to get changes made in a current version, though they may be fixed in v.next.

    <title>Archive operation in Outlook 2010 led to several years&#39; lost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnbo2233  say:</h3>
<h2>            Archive operation in Outlook 2010 led to several years&#39; lost emails in Outlook.com</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks to all for fielding this question!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use Outlook 2010 to read my Hotmail.com (now outlook.com) email, thanks to the Hotmail Connector. Over the years, my inbox grew to contain about 40,000 items, so I recently decided it was time to perform an archive operation in Outlook 2010. &nbsp;Auto-archive
 has always been disabled.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have long been wary about doing so because I didn't know what effect a local archive in Outlook 2010 would have on my web Hotmail account after the two had been synced.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In any event, I went ahead and archived everything in my Outlook 2010 inbox from before one year ago. This operation was performed successfully. However, I started noticing sync problems between the web version of Hotmail and my Outlook 2010 inbox almost
 immediately. Some messages only appeared in one or the other, etc., and "Send and Receives" took forever and began to hang. When I logged into my Hotmail account through the web, I noticed that all messages received before 2007 had disappeared from my inbox.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As this was worrisome, I decided to un-do the archive. I copied the messages from the designated archive folder back into my inbox in Outlook 2010. My local Outlook 2010 inbox once again contains around 40,000 messages, but "Send and Receives" continue
 to hang, and, more importantly, my online Hotmail account &nbsp;has still lost years of emails and correspondence I would like to continue to have access to. With the sync between Outlook.com and Outlook 2010 no longer working, the local program has become unusable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My questions are as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>* Is there a way to repopulate the web version of Hotmail/Outlook with the older messages I retain copies of locally but which disappeared from the web after the archive operation? In other words, how do I populate the web version of Hotmail with the messages
 I "un-archived" locally?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>* Is there anything else I can do to re-sync the local inbox with the web inbox? Above all, I don't want to lose the messages for which I now retain only &nbsp;a local copy.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks again!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

                    <p>I am running El Capitan 10.11.2 and MS Office 2016 for Mac 15.18. &nbsp;I have three email accounts I use with Outlook 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;Two are Gmail and one is Yahoo. &nbsp;I've set the Yahoo account as my default account. &nbsp;When I select new mail or reply, a Gmail

<p>
</p><p>I've read about previous registry fixes but they are for Windows. &nbsp;They "fix" also causes problems with replies and requires an account be selected every time an email is composed. &nbsp;How can I get Outlook 2016 to honor the default email account setting? &nbsp;</p>

                    Hi<br />
<br />
Can somebody please help me out? I have been able to start syncing with an ATT 8525, but it hangs up after transferring about a quarter of the files. There appears to be plenty of memory on the PPC. I installed the 6.1 version of the Mobile Device Center, and
 the PPC is running Windows Mobile 6.<br />

<p>Hi Irving</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an 8525 and sync it with two PCs so maybe I can offer some help (at the very least some consolation .... just a little levity)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you have a partnership and it does start to sync, so that is good IMHO.&nbsp; We know it connects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are you trying to sync?&nbsp; Have you tried just unchecking everything and then check just one item, like contacts?</p>

                    <p>I have My subscription through TechNet and it will expire soon.&nbsp; I want to get Office 365 Home as my new subscription level because I only have two users and do not need enterprise features.&nbsp; But I have not been able to find definitive answers to one issue:&nbsp;
 With an Office 365 Home subscription, can I still receive email at my own domain.&nbsp; Currently my domain is hosted under the mydomain.onmicrosoft.com account... my account home shows me this description:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Office 365 account comes with a domain name—<em>contoso</em>.onmicrosoft.com—but if you have your own domain name already, you can use that domain name with Microsoft Online Services services too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to know is: Does the Office 365 Home subscription also allow me to use my own domain name with Microsoft Online Services?&nbsp; Also, if I try to renew my existing E3 subscription with a Home subscription does it &nbsp;just automatically change the service
 levels available?&nbsp; Or do I need to start anew with a separate account and a new setup?</p>

 need the typical quantity of licenses that come with the business accounts, nor is their expense welcome.&nbsp; The only capability I really want to use from the Office 365 subscription is to have our mail store in a single location, such as on an Exchange Server
 for instance, where it can be accessed from my primary workstation, a tablet and from my Windows phone for my mail account; and the same for my wife's mail account from her workstation and mobile devices.&nbsp; (I want to NOT have anything like a POP server for
 mail because the mail does not stay on the server and it can only be read by multiple devices until&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;device first downloads it) &nbsp;The only approach that will work is server based / cloud based storage of the account primary mail store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software and other services from Office 365 are just wasted on us as we really do not use any of it, at least not yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some economical plan / subscription under the Office 365 family of plans that provides the capability I am looking for?&nbsp; Or does Windows 8 / 8.1 / 8.1 Upgrade keep a Microsoft Account User's mail store in a 'Cloud storage location' accessible from
 multiple devices?&nbsp; That might work like I want.&nbsp;&nbsp;If so I would just need to go to a mail hosting provider for my mail domain and set up a forwarder to the Microsoft account.&nbsp; If I did that, what would I be getting from&nbsp;an Office 365 subscription?&nbsp; Office software
 is something I already have that was installed and in use long before I had an Office 365 subscription, so the software subscription&nbsp;is only a way to keep always upgraded to the most current version.&nbsp; Which is probably worthwhile at the cost of an Office 365
 Home subscription.</p>

 if i <strong>completey </strong>copy <strong>all</strong> files from the current 4GB card to the new 8GB one and start using it? will the phone system experience some problems if the total capacity of the card changes while the contents remain the same? thanks

<p>They do. At least it worked in my case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rules of thumb:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make sure all the files are selected on the source card by making the hidden and system files visible from windows file settings.</p>
<p>2. make sure that the target card is formatted the same way the source card is.</p>
<p>3. use xp not vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my sandisk 4 gb works with no problems.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Office365 Outlook Message Windows Opening Slightly Off - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Office365 Outlook Message Windows Opening Slightly Off Screen</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having an ongoing problem with Microsoft Outlook in Office365, which for me is currently version 1808, build 10730.20344 (Click-to-run), though this problem has been going on for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; This is on a Microsoft Surface Pro
 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I open a new or reply message window the window is shifted slightly off of the right side of the screen such that I have to drag the window back to the left to be able to see the right side of the message window.&nbsp; I have tried all of the usual known
 tricks to get the message windows to open normally fully on screen, but all to no avail.&nbsp; I have control-clicked the X to close the window and force Windows to save the window position, but after about three or four messages, it has shifted to the right again
 and if I restart Outlook it always will open new message windows slightly off screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of things that occurred to me today that may be impacting what is happening.&nbsp; First of all, I run the task bar on the left hand side of the screen.&nbsp; I have noticed that when Outlook pops up a meeting reminder that the reminder window is
 opened all the way to the left side of the screen with the left portion of the reminder window underneath the task bar.&nbsp; Also, when I really closely examined the message window it was shifted to the right and partially off screen by approximately the same
 width as the task bar.&nbsp; The X and the full screen box of the window controls are just off of the screen and the rest of the Window is visible.&nbsp; So, it would appear that having the task bar on the left is the ultimate cause of the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is the only app that has this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated as it is extremely annoying and the small amount of time and effort that it takes to reposition the window each time really adds up over the day.</p>

<p>Hi BanditoB1C,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have I few ideas regarding the behavior you are facing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are using Surface, do you use it in Tablet mode On or Off? Try to switch between the modes a few time to check whether makes a difference
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/4027960/windows-10-turn-tablet-mode-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/4027960/windows-10-turn-tablet-mode-on-or-off</a>.change semi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try different display settings - Right click&gt; Display&gt; Display. Change the size, Resolution and Orientation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your Office 365 version, you are using semi annual channel. Please try to switch to monthly channel and update to version 1905 -<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/3185078/how-to-switch-from-semi-annual-channel-to-monthly-channel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/3185078/how-to-switch-from-semi-annual-channel-to-monthly-channel</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end, you could try to create a new Windows profile to check whether the step could fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you use 32 or 64 bit Windows? Office? Also, please send us a video of the issue. To protect your privacy, please send it to me via

<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

He measn that you need to connect your phone to the PC via the USB data cable. From there you can access both the Phone's internal memory as well as that of the SD card. You can easuly delete any files in the SD card that way. :smileyhappy:</p>

            @Shahroznf, ok. I got your point. But where could i find folder that filled with those other files ? If you mean i can easily delete any files in my SD card anyway.. I think i can do it just on my phone with " Files " app. I just want to delete all those
 " others " files on PC that can't be deleted on my phone directly . Sorry, I'm confusing. XD I'm new user...

<h2>            Removal of Windows Defender</h2>
                    <p>Because we do not have the ability to turn off windows Defender or deactivate it I removed it.</p>
<p>The process for removal was simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pulled the HDD from the PC</p>
<p>Used an alternate OS And booted to it</p>
<p>and attached HDD to PC with other OS Widows 10 or Other)</p>
<p>selected the Defender folder</p>
<p>and removed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We Users want control over our systems.</p>
<p>this is an example of extremes people will go in removing, disabling or other wise getting rid of Defender.</p>
<p>it is time I am posting this to see what corrective measures will be taken so I can begin work on counter measures. I won the system I should decide what runs and what does not run You Microsoft have incorporated ensures that even prevent the use of reg
 edit to prevent us from disabling Defender which leads me to believe that it is a data &nbsp;gathering tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will how ever incorporates other means of Protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I urge Microsoft to reconsider there stance on forcing this on us.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it is Microsoft sole purpose to wage war on the user and disallow them to have control over their machines.</p>

 in advance! All the devices are below 10.1 inch and have more then 1gb of ram.

<p>Hi Simon, </p>
<p>
</p><p>When using Word for Android device, creating and editing documents should be free with screen sizes 10.1 inches or less. To troubleshoot this issue, we suggest that you try to sign out of your Microsoft account on Word Mobile. Once you're signed out, close
 the Word app and relaunch it, then sign back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the steps provided worked for you. We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

It seems end users were trying to perform an activity which they do not have any permission. We'd like to verify if this issue has been resolved. If not, we suggest checking this
