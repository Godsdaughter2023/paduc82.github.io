<h2>            Name is stuck with an old nickname</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my account settings my name is set up how I want it and my picture is what I want, however when I send emails out and log in to apps and such like, for some reason my name is something that I set up many years ago with a very OLD picture of me. I don't
 know how to change this and i would really like it to not be there anymore. It might have been linked to use of MSN back in the day, under this email address. Any pointers on how to reset this would be lovely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Redistributing ActiveSync&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Redistributing ActiveSync&#63;</h2>
                    <span>Howdy,<br />
                    <span>Howdy,<br />
I am trying to find out if I can supply ActiveSync on a CD with my application that needs ActiveSync to be installed on the end users system. It is a Pocket PC app and I use CEAPPMGR to download the app to the Pocket PC from an Installer MSI built using Visual
 Studio. It also uses RAPI to then read files back to the users system from the Pocket PC for graphing using Excel. It seems that including the setup.msi on my CD does the same thing as directing the end user to microsoft.com for a download as they still have
 to accept the EULA that is displayed by your setup.msi before it can be installed on their system.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The users of this application most likely do not have access to the internet from their PC to download ActiveSync from Microsoft which is why I want to just include it on my installation CD for them. They will be literally 'out in the field' using their Pocket
 PC to download data from devices in oil fields using the IrDA port. The data is then copied from the Pocket PC to the PC so that Excel can graph the data. The PC being used is far from any telephone line connections etc so there's no internet available!<br />
<br />
Please let me know if anyone knows if&nbsp;this is ok or not, as I can't tell from the EULA itself. It seems ok as there is no attempt to modify, sell, lease etc the product and it is free to download anyway! Also, the Compact .NETCF files that are embedded into
 the CAB files to update the end users Pocket PC seem to fall into the same category, and I know that they are 'redistributable', so why not ActiveSync? Hmmmmm?????<br />
</span><br />
Thanks!<br />

    <title>unable to pin apps to app launcher in office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasondennness  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to pin apps to app launcher in office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am unable to pin apps to my office 365 app launcher.&nbsp; On the view all my apps page I can see all the standard apps and the custom apps I've created, when you click on the ellipses (the 3 dots ... ) I only have the option to see app details, not pin to
 app launcher option, nor can I unpin&nbsp;the apps already pinned.</p>
<p>Version of IE is 11.0.10240.16724CO and using windows 10 x64.</p>
<p>If I try using an in-private session I can see the options to pin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use my surface RT which has IE version 11.0.9600.18231 installed, I can see the options to pin the apps.</p>
<p>Any idea why I can't access the pin app feature on my PC?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>I have tried the above already and it had no effect. &nbsp;I have tried again just now and I'm still unable to pin or unpin an app.</p>
<p>Looking at the thread you shared, that offers the same fix.</p>

<p>Hi Jason,<br />
<br />
To help us identify the issue, can you confirm the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you having the issue on the App Launcher or the My apps page? Please take a screenshot and upload it. To upload a screenshot, please click on Use rich formatting and select the Insert Image icon.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does this issue occur with other browsers on the same PC?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As InPrivate Browsing disables toolbars and extensions by default, can you please try disabling all your toolbars and extensions in normal browsing.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I would also like to confirm that you have selected “Delete personal settings” when resetting IE. The reason I’m asking this is because your “pin apps” option is showing when using InPrivate Browsing, which indicates that your IE cookies and cache may
 be preventing them from showing. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we would like to collect some information to further investigate the issue. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a PM. You can access it
here.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sheen</p>

<p>Sorry for not replying, I didn't see there had been an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have that update installed and the feature is still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The engineer this was escalated with gave up and told me to contact IE support.&nbsp; So I did, they gave up and told me to contact you guys again, said I already had so they said contact the windows 10 support team.&nbsp; They said contact you guys, nothing to do
 with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft support is playing tennis with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways this is not working, a number of other users I work with also have the same issue.</p>

    <title>Pivot table with COUNTIF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supernova29  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot table with COUNTIF</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a huge sheet with a list of products, their brand/category/model, and their status in each country. The status can be "done", "in progress", "to be done", and "exclude".</p>
<p>I'd like to create a Pivot table where I can easily see the overall status by country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brand/category/model will be the base of nested row groups of my pivot table (I'm planning to create a table by brand and one by category).</p>
<p>
</p><p>With row groups collapsed, I'd like to see the percentage of items under that group whose status reads "done", over the sum of items in that group whose status is anything other than "exclude". I would use a COUNTIF to do this, but I can't find a way to
 integrate this in a pivot table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>That's already more than enough, I'll try and draw inspiration from your sheet, thanks again ;) I just hope all of that is replicable on Excel 2016, we don't use Office 365 at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW my idea is to have a column for each country so I can see five % of done for each group/row. Maybe that was not clear.</p>

<p>Where is the country identified that you want counted? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've added another pivot to your example. It lists a couple of countries. Is this the direction you want to go?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the country identified somewhere (that I apparently missed) then you may be able use a slicer on country to make the table more readable</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I too am just learning Pivot tables. They are a really useful feature.&nbsp; If you are a "visual learner" to help you get quick information about them here are links to a bunch of Webinars and Courses.&nbsp; The webinars are free, some have replays you can look at
 now, some you have to wait until the webinar is offered again.&nbsp; Many of the webinars are provided as introductions to paid courses that the web site offers, but you don't have to take the courses if you don't want</p>

</span><span>In this video we finally help Andy put the dashboard together. &nbsp;This dashboard will help communicate our findings and tell a story about the performance of our business. &nbsp;<br />
The great part about using pivot tables and pivot charts is that they are very easy to update. &nbsp;When next month rolls around, we simply paste the new data to the bottom of our source data sheet, update the source range, and hit the Refresh button. &nbsp;It will
 only take a few minutes a month to maintain. <br />
</span><span>This video is packed with tips for working with Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here are some of the topics covered.<br />

<br />
This issue is the beginning of an ongoing series on </span><strong><span>Excel PivotTables
</span></strong><span>and why they're so damn useful. &nbsp;Why? Our newest contributor,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Mayurakshi</span></strong><span>, started writing a 'short' article about</span><strong><span>Excel
 PivotTables</span></strong><span> and we managed to stop her (for the moment) after 45 pages! Some of you will be familiar with PivotTables but we know there's many others who have been scared off by their apparent complexity. &nbsp;A lot of Microsoft's
 PivotTable coverage seems to assume people are familiar with the concept, leaving a lot of people 'in the dark'.<br />
<br />
<strong>2017 10 16a- Why bother with Excel PivotTables? <br />
</strong><a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/excel-pivottables/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office-watch.com/2017/excel-pivottables/</a>
<br />
PivotTables really are great. The original PivotTable feature was clumsy and difficult so you’re forgiven for trying them and giving up in disgust.</span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span>Personally, I feel PivotTable is one of the most useful tools in Excel if your work demands you to play around data. Even if you are not a data analyst or data scientist, you can impress your boss by creating some amazing
 PivotTable or charts to represent a larger set of data.<br />
In this starter, we’ll explain the basics of a PivotTable with many examples of how they can be used to turn a list of information into something summarized and understandable.

<br />
Making your first PivotTable can be scary so here’s a quick ‘How to’ to get you started and past the scary bit.<br />
It’s a PivotTable starter article for anyone who hasn’t dived into PivotTables already and before we start with the tricks and tips for this important part of Excel.<br />
PivotTables and PivotCharts can summarize lists in many different ways. <strong><span>ET MR PivotTables.docx</span><br />

<br />
We started with a <a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/make-first-pivot-table-excel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
simple Excel PivotTable</a>, now let’s move on to a multi-column or two dimensional PivotTables. &nbsp;They aren’t a lot more complicated than a basic PivotTable, just add a few more fields.
<strong><span>ET MR PivotTables.docx</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2017 10 23b- Make an Excel PivotTable with multiple or nested rows <span>

<br />
A list with groupings (like Product Type, Country, Region or Staff pay level) can become a nested PivotTable.&nbsp; The sub-totals are created with &nbsp;+ – signs to show/hide the groupings.

<br />
You will always find Excel either summarizing your data by adding the values together (SUM) or Counting the number of items. Nobody is stopping you from changing the type of calculation that your work demands to include averages, maximum, minimum, standard
 deviation and others. <strong><span>ET MR PivotTables.docx</span></strong><br />

<strong>2017 11 06b- Rearranging PivotTable Rows and columns <span>&nbsp;</span><br />

<br />
Moving or swapping fields around in a PivotTable is both amusing and addictive at the same time. You cannot stop yourself from rearranging your data in different ways. Each time you move a field, the Pivot Table will restructure to the new field configuration
 and you see the same data in a different alignment. May be that’s where the idea of creating Pivot comes from.

<strong>2017 11 06c- Rename Excel PivotTable headings <br />
</strong><a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/rename-excel-pivottable-headings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office-watch.com/2017/rename-excel-pivottable-headings/</a>
<br />
By default, PivotTable provides custom name such as “Sum of Amounts” or Count of Numbers” etc when you add a field to the table. You may not be always happy to use these default custom names for your PivotTable, so feel free to modify the headings to something
 you like. <strong><span>ET MR PivotTables.docx</span></strong><br />

<br />
Excel allows you to sort a PivotTable in alphabetical order or from largest to smallest values. &nbsp;They are similar to the standard Excel sorting options but worth looking at separately because there are automatic sorts, custom sortings and a manual sorting option.

<br />
Sometimes you want to sort a list or PivotTable in a special way that doesn’t fit the usual ‘A to Z’ or number order. The most common need for this are days of the week or months in a year.&nbsp; Neither of those orders make sense to a literal computer.

You’re not locked into the PivotTable sorting options provided by Microsoft.&nbsp; Excel lets you arrange a PivotTable into any order you like.

<strong>2017 11 27a- Excel Slicers for PivotTables <br />
</strong><a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/excel-slicers-pivottables/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office-watch.com/2017/excel-slicers-pivottables/</a><strong>
<br />
</strong>27 November 2017<br />
From Excel 2010, Microsoft added Slicers to Excel’s PivotTables.<span>&nbsp; </span>
From the hype, Slicers sound like some complex Excel feature but they’re really a more useable, friendly and showy way to do something already in Excel – Filtering.<br />
For me it’s more of a visual filter and a collaborative tool that can help you figure out what items are selected within a PivotTable. Yes, they are always associated with PivotTable.<br />
On the left is the PivotTable.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the right are two Slicers with selections to filter what’s shown in the PivotTable.
<strong><span>ET MR PivotTables.docx</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2017 11 27b- Multiple Selections in Slicers for Excel PivotTables <br />
</strong><a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/multiple-selections-slicers-excel-pivottables/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office-watch.com/2017/multiple-selections-slicers-excel-pivottables/</a>
<br />
Rarely do you choose a single Slicer button.&nbsp; More likely you’ll want to select multiple filters or buttons, here’s the various ways to do that. You can press the filter icon next to Beverages and then select multiple items if you want to see both.
<strong><span>ET MR PivotTables.docx</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2017 11 27c- PivotTable Filters in Excel<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
</strong><a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/pivottable-filters-excel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office-watch.com/2017/pivottable-filters-excel/</a>
<br />
Simple PivotTable filters let you limit the table display to a part of the available data.<br />
They have a place in PivotTables, especially for semi-permanent filters that you want to apply broadly.&nbsp; Instead of filtering the original data feed or list, the PivotTable can use a large list which is narrowed down to what you want to see.
<strong><span>ET MR PivotTables.docx</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>2017 12 11a- Timelines for date filtering Excel PivotTables <br />
</strong><a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/timelines-date-filter-excel-pivottable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office-watch.com/2017/timelines-date-filter-excel-pivottable/</a>
<br />
Timelines are a special form of Excel Slicer for PivotTables, to make filtering dates easier. Timelines are slicers that allows you to filter date fields and only date fields in PivotTables. The feature shows you a series of events grouped by time. The best
 thing about timelines is that it is in the form of a graphical representation, which makes it easy to understand critical milestones. Timeline filters do not add any new filtering proficiencies to PivotTables.&nbsp; Just like Slicers, they just make your life simpler
 by filtering the data in the PivotTables in clearer ways.<br />
<br />
<strong>2017 12 11b- Using Slicer and Timeline together <span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</strong><a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/using-slicer-timeline-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office-watch.com/2017/using-slicer-timeline-together/</a>
<br />
PivotTable <a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/excel-slicers-pivottables/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Slicers</a> and
<a href="https://office-watch.com/2017/timelines-date-filter-excel-pivottable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Timelines</a> can be combined to filter by time and other criteria in Excel.</span></p>

<h2>            New software update for Nokia Asha 310 &#40;RM-911&#41;&#58; v. 8.13</h2>
                    
<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia has started rolling out a new update for Nokia Asha 310 (RM-911): v. 8.13. The update is already available to most countries/regions via FOTA and Nokia Suite. Find the update instructions from here:
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/software-update/asha-software-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.nokia.com/global/support/software-update/asha-software-update</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key changes compared to previous 7.37 SW version include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements for video streaming. </li><li>Launchers for Mail For Exchange, Whatsapp and Youtube link added. </li><li>Updated versions of Nokia Xpress Browser, Nokia Store, Notifications and News and Offers applications.
</li><li>Updated versions of Email &amp; Chat applications. Available via Nokia Suite. </li><li>Updated versions of Twitter and Facebook. Available via Nokia Suite. </li><li>10 new Gameloft games. Available via Nokia Suite. </li></ul>
<p>The updated Twitter, Facebook and eBuddy versions are expected to become available in Nokia Store later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you plan to update the phone using Nokia Suite, make sure you install the latest Nokia Suite 3.8 client version first. You can get it from here:
<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note:<br />
<br />
if you update your Asha 310 to 8.13 SW version with Nokia Suite, you will get a new Email application that does not support Push Email Notifications and Email Scheduling. FOTA update on the other hand would keep the old Email application. If Push Email Notification
 and Email Polling are important features for you it is recommend to update the phone SW via
<strong>FOTA</strong>.<br />
<br />
If Push Email Notification and Email Scheduling are <strong>not</strong> important features for you, the phone SW update can safely be installed using Nokia Suite. With this new version of the Email application you can get Self-Updates when Nokia releases a
 newer version.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Understand Why Music Won&#39;t Match in Groove Music</h2>
                    Does anybody know why some music matches and other music doesn't?&nbsp; I am in the process of fixing metadata but can't figure out why some tracks on an album match and some don't.&nbsp; I have changed all info to match the catalog exactly but some tracks on an
 album come back as matched and others don't.&nbsp; I understand that those that don't can be added to OneDrive but it's silly to me to split the albums up, half on my hard drive and half on OneDrive (and why should I have to anyway?).&nbsp; I have been meticulous in
 making sure everything matches down to the genre, capitalization, year, etc.&nbsp; But still some tracks within an album match and some don't.&nbsp; Is there any way to force the software to re-match?&nbsp; Is there any secret to getting this to work that I'm not seeing?&nbsp;

            Okay, I guess nobody can answer this.&nbsp; Just another point, if I select "find album info" for these albums I get checks next to all of the tracks and select finish.&nbsp; But when it's done the same half of the album still says that I have to add to OneDrive
 to play on other devices.&nbsp; The fact that these tracks, in fact, matched (hence the check mark) should have added them to the collection in the cloud but they have not.&nbsp; This does not make any sense.&nbsp; Can someone from Microsoft answer why this is happening?&nbsp;
 Please?

<p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Nokia N8 and recently am having some network issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is whenever Ii end the call (dial or receive call) the network goes down and I have to wait for 1 or 2 min to get back the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in the impression that there is a problem with service provider, but got confirmed that no issues from their end. I have also the changed the SIM card (old to new) and having same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can any share some solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;AjithN8,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Nokia discussions board!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to fix this issue, I advise you to perform a soft reset on your phone: type *#7780#. Default lock code is 12345.&nbsp;If the issue persists, perform a hard reset. First of all, back up your data using&nbsp;<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-ovi-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Nokia
 Suite</span></a>&nbsp;(Tools &gt; Back up). Once your data is fully backed up, &nbsp;type *#7370# on the keypad.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you may also check for updates on Nokia Suite (by going to Tools &gt; Updates).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know how you get on and feel free to post any other questions you may have.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook freezes with &#34;delayed write failed&#34; after resume from hibernation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running Outlook 2010 32-bit on a Windows 7 SP1 64-bit laptop. Outlook is connected to a Exchange 2007 Server and has an archive pst-file on a networked drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I resume my computer after a hibernate with Outlook running, Outlooks hangs and I have to terminated it using Task Manager. When I look in the System Event Log, I find these messages:</p>

<p>{Delayed Write Failed} Windows was unable to save all the data for the file \;H:0000000000045bc9\myserver\users$\myaccount\Archive\~archive.pst.tmp. The data has been lost. This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection.
 Please try to save this file elsewhere.</p>

<p>If I remove the archive pst-file from Outlook, the problem is gone. I want to have the archive file on a networked drive because that drive is backed up, unlike my laptop drive. Sometimes the networked drive isn't available, but even when it is, I get this
 error. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any tips?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>there is a new feature that has an "autosave" &nbsp;toggle per document opened. i have 1000s of excel files since the 1990s and do not want to turn off autosave for all of them. how can i disable this by default? id like to turn it off completely if possible,
 it's something that is not only unwanted, it's actively negatively impacting my workflow. i'm &nbsp;considering trying to download an earlier version of excel that does not have the 'autosave' toggle. this is not to be confused with autorecover.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
The AutoSave is a new feature available for Office 365 subscribers wherein changes made on the file are saved in every few seconds. Regarding your concern, we cannot turn off the AutoSave feature by default in Excel 2016. However, we can turn this off to a
 file and Excel 2016 will keep it every time you reopen that file. To know more about the AutoSave feature and the FAQ's about it, feel free to check this

do you offer legacy downloads of older versions of excel that do not have this ruinous feature? this is not something that works for me and will likely cause me to cancel my subscription. can you send this to the product team so that they can offer an option
 to turn off autosave toggles entirely?&nbsp;

<p>Users who turn-off AutoSave should also check that AutoRecover is enabled for the file - it may be disabled for that specific file.</p>
<p>Note that users should be aware that each AutoSave operation will also clear the UnDo list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS originally developed&nbsp;AutoSave in the 20th Century and implemented it in Office XP. It had similar issues as the new version added into Office365 and it took years for users to persuade MS to adopt the much better AutoRecover - and now we take another
 step backward (yes I'm aware that AutoSave improves collaborative working for the small minority who use it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When will Microsoft learn not to mess with the default settings that users have got familiar with.
</p>
<p>If MS have a new 'better' facility to add to Office they should provide it as a selectable option, not as a default.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completely agree.</p>
<p>Not giving the option to set it on or off by default is ridiculous. And worst of all, I am sure that it was thought of and&nbsp;discussed when this functionality was planned. So it's a deliberate choice. MS Office is NOT free software, we pay for it.</p>

</p><blockquote>Hi Jonathan,<br />
<br />
The AutoSave is a new feature available for Office 365 subscribers wherein changes made on the file are saved in every few seconds. Regarding your concern, we cannot turn off the AutoSave feature by default in Excel 2016. However, we can turn this off to a
 file and Excel 2016 will keep it every time you reopen that file. To know more about the AutoSave feature and the FAQ's about it, feel free to check this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-AutoSave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Last time I checked this was the 21st century. Did the good old checkbox become obsolete all of a sudden?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You turn this off for a file and Excel 2016 will keep it every time... unless you rename the file (then it will be reset to autosave) or relocate it (then it will be reset to autosave) or make a copy of it (then it will be reset to autosave).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why, oh why, is this necessary?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason that makes ANY sense (and yet...) for not having this option to disable AutoSave by default&nbsp;is that&nbsp;Microsoft decided to build their user-behaviour analytics at the expense of the people who pay for the product. Shame on you, I already had
 Google for that. Shame on you, again, shame on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;attitude ("we know better than&nbsp;or&nbsp;moronic customers,&nbsp;so why giving them the choice to decide how they work") is the sort of thing that that makes once-loyal customers give a try to competitor products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, shame on you.</p>

<p>"we cannot turn off the AutoSave feature by default in Excel 2016"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ugh. Frustrating. I have exactly the same issue. I keep all my docs, etc, in OneDrive by default. Everything has been fine until this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the autosave is not syncing properly, and I end up with 2 copies of everything. The fix is clear: turn off AutoSave by default. But no. Apparently this cannot be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We pay (I think) a fairly high fee p.a. for Office. And now an update I didn't want has been foisted on me, and I can't even opt out? Perhaps opting out of Office365 is the only way to clear this mess.</p>

<p>I had the exact same problem. Two copies, messages from OneDrive that it "can't sync". I just want to save files to OneDrive so they are backed up and accessible from other locations. I don't need all of the "sharing" capability turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was all good until the latest Win10 update and then it started defaulting to Autosave and being difficult to turn off.</p>

<h3> doghouse25  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveSync Problem</h2>
                     


Is there any one can help out there. 


I have a HTC P3600 running Win Mobile 5 which has worked well up to a few days ago apart from one or two times I have had to reset in the last 6 months. 


I dont know what hapened but the alarm function has stopped working and I can no longer make a connection with Active Sync. I have tried the reset button and as soon as Windows Mobile 5 starts all **** breaks loose with all sorts of musical noised comming from the PDA for 1-2 minutes. I have no problems linking to my WIFI hub and all other programs seem to work OK. I have Windows XP and Vista operating systems with Windows Mobile software, neither sync anymore. Any suggestions what to try.

            This sounds like homework, so I'll keep the solution general.<br />
Since 1000 may change, put that in a cell, for example B1. Then solve for a:<br />
<br />
(a*0.35)-300=B1<br />
<br />
This will give you a formula: a=???. Put the =??? part in, for example, cell B2.<br />
Now you can change the number in B1 and in B2 you'll see the different solutions for a.<br />

            The problem is almost certainly either with the data, or with the way in which the subreport is linked to the parent report.&nbsp; The LinkMasterFields property of the subreport should be the name of primary key of the parent report's recordset, and the LinkChildFields
 property should be the name of the corresponding foreign key in the subform's recordset.<br />
<br />
In cases like this the problem is more commonly with the data, however, so firstly can you give us the details of the tables involved, their names and the names and data types of their columns, indicating which are primary and foreign keys.&nbsp; Secondly, what
 are the RecordSource properties of the report and the subreport?&nbsp; If these are queries open the queries in SQL view and copy and post the SQL statements of each into your reply here.<br />
<br />
Once we have this information, hopefully the dog will be able to see the rabbit and we'll see where the problem, and its solution, lies.<br />

            I've looked at your file but many of its objects are not immediately accessible.&nbsp; More relevant to your current issue, however, is that when I try to create enforced relationships on what appear to be the keys, in all but one case I cannot do so, which
 means that the tables contain bad data.&nbsp; This is presumably why you are not seeing all the rows you expect in the subreport.&nbsp; Also, the columns which appear from their names to be corresponding primary and foreign keys in one case seem to be of different data
 types.<br />
<br />
You need to correct the data in the unmatched rows in the tables so that you can then create the enforced relationships.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office custom templates can be saved in any location and be accessed by multiple devices.</p>
<p>Since you want to sync the Office templates across all PCs, laptops, tablets and phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In previous versions, when saving as a template from an Office application (.dotx, .pptx, etc.), Office would automatically change the location to C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in Office 2013 this location is used to store templates from Office.com.&nbsp;To separate personal templates from Office.com templates, the default personal location has been moved to
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can choose to override this setting by specifying a
<font><span style="font-weight: bold">Personal Templates</span> Folder.&nbsp;This can be done by going to
 will create the <span style="font-weight: bold">Custom Office Templates</span> folder the first time you save a template, and will set the
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also save the template to SkyDrive as said in the following thread link to use it on multiple devices:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_storage/how-do-i-automatically-sync-custom-office/5327c7af-978e-4aaa-af5b-49439221fc57"><font>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_storage/how-do-i-automatically-sync-custom-office/5327c7af-978e-4aaa-af5b-49439221fc57</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when you launch the Office application, the template will not load by default, you may have to open it from the location where it is saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>It is very much possible indeed :) As I struggled to solve the same functional issue and got a few useful tricks here and there on the forums, my turn to suggest a solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to synchronize the user templates</span></p>
<p>- chose a folder where to store your personal templates</p>
<p>- check that it is synchronized with OneDrive across all devices</p>
<p>(that's what has been explained above)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to create default templates</span></p>
<p>Now, because the default templates are to be stored in C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates, you will have to make a copy of your default templates in this folder for all your devices. For Word and Outlook, they are respectively:</p>
<p>- Normal.dotx</p>
<p>- NormalEmail.dotx</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Shortcuts to personal templates</span></p>
<p>If you don't create personalized default templates on each of your device,&nbsp;you will need to chose a personal template every time you create a new document or email (new doc/email, select from personal template). This is a viable option if you create shortcuts
 to the templates:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;in the Windows task bar (like any recently open document, right-click and pin)</p>
<p>- in the Office application Quick Access toolbar (display all commands and select "new document or template")</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Two remarks:</span></p>
<p><em>For Microsoft</em>: I would expect a setting in OneDrive and/or Office that would do this automatically (i.e. synchronize \appdata\... and override the default templates when there is a user template of the same name).</p>
<p><em>For the users</em>: <strong>The Design tab&nbsp;is a super convenient and powerful&nbsp;tool
</strong>for 1. customizing the overall appearance of the documents (fonts, colors, layout = styles) and 2. saving the results as the default if you like it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to look at websites below.&nbsp; They should answer most of your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/office-certification.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/office-certification.aspx</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>As for study guides, you might want to look at the MOS 2016 Study Guide series by Microsoft.&nbsp; What I did many years ago was I looked at what they were testing for and looked through the tables of contents until I found one that matched closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a personal note, I earned my Microsoft Office Master certification.&nbsp; The tests I took were Word Expert, Excel Expert, PowerPoint and Access (elective).&nbsp; Quite frankly, it didn't do me any good.&nbsp; I added it to my resume and there wasn't one hiring manager
 that inquired about it and I interviewed with four dozen managers over the years.&nbsp;
<strong>However</strong>, I would encourage you to pursue the MOS Master certification anyway if for anything self-edification.&nbsp; Good Luck!</p>

            Looks like it defaults to 1 hour before your end of day in Options - Calendar.&nbsp; So if you set end of day to 5pm, the reminder will default to 4pm.&nbsp; You also need to restart Outlook for the change to take effect.

    <title>Outlook Startup issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Startup issues</h2>
                    When I start up Outlook 2010 Pro, I get the following message concerning the mscoree.dll file. Outlook security notice says this application add-in has been disabled. &nbsp;Addins might contain viruses or other security hazards. This message just started, outlook
 has been working fine before then. I assume that the file was ok before, but now it isn't. &nbsp;How can I enable the file without having to do it each time?

            <p>If you are getting a warning msg, why would you want to disregard that msg and not ascertain the cause?</p>
<p>mscoree.dll is a Net runtime file, once outlook has started, without ignoring the err, under File&gt;Options review the add-ins to see what third party add-ins you have, the offending one which may have been disabled.</p>
<p>And once you have ascertained the cause either uninstall the program that added it to Outlook, or visit that program makers site to see if there is an update available</p>
