<h2>            Blockquotes in Microsoft Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to figure out how the below has been created in a Word Document? It's like a blockquote, how do I get the coloured line along the left hand side / indented? Look forward to hearing any advice / ideas.</p>
<p>

<h2>            bug in Outlook on Windows Phone 10</h2>
                    I have a Lumia 830 with Windows 10. in the outlook-app for gmail backspace doesn't work so you have to mark the word and rewrite the entire thing if youf spell something wrong. That's the small bug. The big bug is that you can't send the mail. Nothing
 happens when you press send.

            Hi, To edit a misspelled word you have to tap and hold on the word and put the cursor to the wrong letter so you can delete it. Were you not able to send email on all mailboxes? If this is not the primary Microsoft account have you try removing and re
 setup the email? Does the problem occur regardless of the connection you are using?

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
I was facing same issue, but after long hit and trial I found the reason causing this wifi issue. The DNS server in the router is the culprit for causing all the issues. In your router settings (192.168.1.1), change the "Static DNS1" server to any google DNS
 server like 8.8.8.8. This should resolve the issue, as it worked for me.

<p>Hi Brigitte Vonck,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re right. Connected accounts is no longer supported in Outlook on the web and after October 30th, all connected accounts will stop syncing email. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continue seeing emails from Gmail, you can set up automatic forwarding of emails to Office 365 on the Gmail side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more detailed information, here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connected-accounts-is-no-longer-supported-in-outlook-on-the-web-office-365-for-business-accounts-5cc526bf-e928-4a99-8b9f-5e089df7d887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>Can you change the "Leave on Server" length of time on Office 365 Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to help a friend at a distance. His Outlook 365 syncs with a business webmail in-box address and he needs to change the length of time mails can be left on that server. I know the steps to change this for all earlier versions but when I try and
 talk him through it, things seems things seem different for Outlook 365. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that the case? Any advice or link would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Graham</p>

            No, not the case, the "Leave a copy of email on the server" setting is the same and in the same place.&nbsp; This setting is only available for POP accounts, you won't see it with an IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync, or Exchange Server account.&nbsp; What kind of account
 does your friend have?

    <title>Finding the intersection in a table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hark2k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finding the intersection in a table</h2>
                    I have a list of cities and values in table 1. I am trying to find a way that I can fill in the Area in field by going to table 2 and finding the row with the corresponding city and then finding the closet value that is greater than the value from Table
 1 and returning the corresponding column header. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So to get the Area for Tucson in Table 1, I would go to table 2, and see that the value of 82.7 from table 1 would fall under Area 3 on the Tucson line from Table 2 so the formula would return "Area 3".
<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This; to me at least isn't clear so let's look at a couple of table lookups based on the very simple table shown below which is A1:E8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lookup1. Let's say we want to look up&nbsp;B in Col 1 and E in row 1 and find the intersect which is 16, We can use this with lookup value in F1 and G1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX($A$1:$E$8, MATCH(F1,$A$1:$A$8,0), MATCH(G1,$A$1:$E$1,0))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lookup2. Let's say we have a value of 10 and want o find the column header which is W, we can use this ARRAY formula with the lookup value in F2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX($A$1:$E$1,MIN(IF($A$2:$E$8=F2,COLUMN($A$2:$E$8)-MIN(COLUMN($A$2:$E$8))+1)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lookup3. Once again let's say we have a lookup value of 10 and want to find the row header which is C we can use this ARRAY formula with the lookup value in F2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX($A$2:$A$8,MIN(IF($A$2:$E$8=F2,ROW($A$2:$E$8)-MIN(ROW($A$2:$E$8))+1)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raed this on how to enter ARRAY formula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

    <title>Office 2010 and Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 2010 and Office 365</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I've been referred here by a Microsoft support person from the Office 365 forum.<br />
<br />
I was chatting online to a Microsoft representative at the end of March who said that with an Office 365 subscription you could install Office 2010 instead of 2013. On the basis of this advice a small business went with Office 365 - the supplier of one of their
 main LOB applications isn't supporting 2013 until October.<br />
<br />
However Office 2010 is no longer provided with new subscriptions to 2013. Does anyone know if earlier versions of Office are provided anywhere which can be set to get their licence from Office 365?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.<br />
<br />
Rob/<br />

Yes, I understand you can associate 365 with Office 2010. MS no longer sells 2010. Some volume/site licenses allow you do "downgrade" to 2010. I don't know if they would allow it for newly purchased site licenses or if the downgrade right is limited to existing
 contracts. <br />
<br />
Some vendors have "old stock" Office 2010 they are still selling. Be careful of who you give your money to online. Investigate their history, has the store existed long, have they owned the web site for long, any better business bureau complaints etc.&nbsp; The
 only online store I have heard offering 2010 is Amazon. Apparently they are charging more than list price because the demand is high.<br />
<br />
Here are instructions on how to associate 365 licenses with Office 2010:<br />
<b>2012 06 27 - Get started with Office 365 - Connect 365 to local install - associate 365 - link 365</b>
<p><a href="http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-ca/office365-smallbusinesses/gg584196.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-ca/office365-smallbusinesses/gg584196.aspx</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>If you have Office 2010 or Office 2007 on your computer, you can use it with Office&nbsp;365. If you use a Mac, and you have Office for Mac 2011 Service Pack 1 or a later version, or Office 2008 for Mac 12.2.9 Update or a later version, you
 can use it with Office&nbsp;365 also.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>If your company has bought Office Professional Plus with Office&nbsp;365, you can download this latest version of Office from the Office&nbsp;365 Downloads page. Otherwise, if you already have Office 2010 or Office 2007 on your computer, you can
 set it up to work with Office&nbsp;365. Versions of Office that are earlier than Office 2007 cannot connect to Office&nbsp;365.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>You can also install Lync (or Lync for Mac 2011 if you use a Mac) and use it for instant messaging, online meetings, sharing your desktop, and other tasks.</p>

<p>You can set up Office 2010 and Office 2007 to connect to Office&nbsp;365. An online tool that you can run from the

            Many thanks for your detailed and very quick response, Rohn007.<br />
<br />
I have already tried most of the steps above - other than purchasing a whole second set of licences Office 2010. The existing setup had been built up piecemeal, and was all on 2003, so we can't even use those.<br />
<br />
It's annoying as the only reason they're in this mess is because a guy from Microsoft said that you could do this with Office 365.<br />

            Rohn007,
<div><br />
<div>Could you clarify the above?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am happy about setting up and using an existing Office 2010 installation with Office 365, but can you transfer the 365 license to cover the existing installation? &nbsp;And does the above process replacing the licensing information held by the existing installation?</div>
<div><br />
<div>To put in context, our 2010 volume license is expiring and 365 looks promising for the exchange support, and keeping our existing software would cause less implementation issues with applications/users.</div>

            Specifically what do you want clarified?<br />
<br />
I don't know the terms of your 2010 volume license, but I would guess that when it expires you will no longer have the right to use the software (I could be wrong about that).<br />
<br />
If your new 365 license includes the "SA", Software Assurance, feature it generally includes "downgrade" rights to use the earlier (2010) version.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to the current (I think) documentation for Office 2010 Downgrade rights (I haven't found the 2013 documentation yet):<br />

<p>
</p><p>Back to your question I don't see a reference to the specific quote you cited.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having a factory installed free trial (of any version) and a user owned and installed version of Office WILL cause activation problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer does have a factory installed Office 365 "free trial", then yes you MUST "uninstall" it, not just simply "delete" it.&nbsp; I have to make the distinction between "uninstall" and "delete" to make sure we are talking about the same thing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling 365 you MUST also do an Office Repair of your 2010 installation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you should be able to activate your copy of 2010. </p>

            <p>Some context:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You used to be able to download and use Office 2010 with an Office 365 subscription. By the time we'd bought the subscription and activated it, these rights had been removed and you had to use Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is currently a similar situation (as I understand it). With Office 365 (one of the editions with the rights to download) you can either use Office 2013 or 2016. At some point in January next year you will no longer be able to use Office 2013, only
 Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have media and licence for Office 2010, you should have no worries, just uninstall (definitely uninstall, not delete) Office 365 and install Office 2010 from your media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

    <title>Can&#39;t navigate workbook tabs using left&#47;right arrows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lui79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t navigate workbook tabs using left&#47;right arrows</h2>
                    <p><strong>Issue</strong></p>
<p>When using the left right arrows to navigate the worksheet tabs a helper text box appears with instructions on how to use the left/right arrows to get to the first and last worksheet tabs quick. Problem is that this helper text box covers the left and right
 arrows, preventing subsequent arrow clicks to get to a worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitely a bug because it didn't appear in the last major Excel versions, but it's been here in every iteration of 2016. It's only a problem for me now because I have a workbook with approximately 15 worksheet tabs and this issue causes me to [
 click / move mouse away / move mouse back / click ] just to get one more click in. This renders the arrows useless.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use keys ALT + Left/Right to navigate worksheets. This is problematic when you have objects in a worksheet and continue pressing - the objects will begin to rotate (ex. a picture).</li><li>Right-click the arrows and get a pop-up box with a list of all unhidden workbook tabs in your documents.<br />

<h2>            &#39;550 5.7.708 Error Service unavailable. Access denied, traffic not accepted from this IP when Sending from Wordpress website</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently bought Micorosoft Exchange Online. Everything works fine, except for the fact that E-mails from our Wordpress website aren't send. I use a SMTP-plugin to send e-mails, connection with smtp.office365.com seems to work, but when I send a test e-mail
 I get an e-mail with:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups:<br />
Your message wasn't delivered because the recipient's email provider rejected it.<br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Remote Server returned '550 5.7.708 Service unavailable. Access denied, traffic not accepted from this IP. For more information please go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526653 AS(8561) [DB8PR09MB2892.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com]'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is, when I send e-mails from the Wordpress website through PHP mail, it works. But when trying to send through SMTP, it doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried:</p>
<p>1. I tried to unblock the IP of our website (hosted at Kinsta), but it wasn't listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that you have a solution for this problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Date field problem with Link to CSV</h2>
                    I am linking to a CSV file. One of the fields is a date. I select Date/Time as the field type in Access. However, when I open the table, I get "#Num!" as a value for all records. What am I doing wrong?

<p>CSV files are merely text, and Access does have trouble interpreting date/time values and other fields that have symbols (such as currency or percent.)</p>
<p>The best solution might be to import that file into a table that has only Text type fields. Then you can create a query to massage the values so they get interpreted correctly and outputs them as valid dates, true currency, or valid fractional (percent)
 values. You can then use an Append query to write the data&nbsp; to a table that has the appropriate data types.</p>
<p>Not sure if I've run into the dates problem more frequently than others as a result of living in a country that uses a non-US date format, but it certainly is an issue.</p>

<h2>            Trouble with Emails sent out by ComputerEase through Outlook 2010</h2>
                    I am looking for a solution to the old winmail.dat attached file issue.&nbsp; An accounting program we use called ComputerEase allows us to send out paystubs by email.&nbsp; We have had trouble with a lot of our people getting instead of the .pdf file a wonderfully
 useless winmail.dat file.&nbsp; I know the cause of this is the Rich Text format (and also HTML does it too) so we went through and defaulted Outlook to send all emails as Plain Text.&nbsp; We have it setup that all new messages are composed in Plain Text (in File&gt;Options&gt;Mail&gt;Compose
 Messages)&nbsp;and also have the box check for converting to plain text when sending rich text to internet recipients (in File&gt;Options&gt;Mail&gt;Message Format).&nbsp; It is even setup to send only plain text by the individuals through contacts and suggested contacts.&nbsp; We
 have explained all this to ComputerEase techs and they insist that it is an Outlook issue as they go through it and use whatever settings it has.&nbsp; Howeve

Nevermind. I just discovered this feature IS AVAILABLE. I'm not sure if I simply didn't see it before, or if it was just added. But this is how you get to it:
<br />
<br />
[Gear icon] -&gt; More mail settings -&gt; Your email accounts -&gt; Accounts you've added -&gt; Details -&gt;Edit -&gt; Outgoing (SMTP) server information (update the account) -&gt; Advanced options ----&gt; from there you can enter in your SMTP server address, port, username/password.<br />
<br />
I'm very glad this feature was added to outlook.com. It means I can fully move away from Gmail (I'm leaving because of their new chat-like "Compose"), and I can start using outlook.com as my primary email UI.<br />

    <title>Word 2013 file will not open some files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> servantoftheking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 file will not open some files</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem that when I open some of my Word files the blue start up screen comes up like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3695ce56-50b2-454f-aa35-5b0293db8c34" />but it gets no further. On one occasion, I left it for nearly two hours, and it kept on cheerfully working at it i.e. those
 dots kept sailing in from left to right to encourage you that it was doing something, but nothing happens. No error report or any such thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The file I am trying to open is not the name that you see on this screen snip, but it was created off of this custom template. So far nearly all of my errors have been with files created off of a custom template, but I can't prove that that is a connection,
 because I have been working almost exclusively with those files. Once I lose hope that it is getting anywhere I click exit until a window comes up to say that "Office is not responding" then I choose "close the program." The next time I open Word there is
 a box to warn me that "Last time you opened Word it did not start correctly. Would you like to open in Safe mode?" I choose yes, and it opens fine in Safe Mode. I exit and open again. Everything seems to work fine. But when I try to open that file again it
 warns me that "Last time you opened this file it caused a serious error. Do you still want to open it?" If I choose yes Word locks up again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This all would seem to indicate a corrupted file. But the strange thing is, at the same time that word is unsuccessfully trying to open the file, I can go to another computer (also with Windows 7 and Office 2013) and open the same file (it is on my OneDrive).
 The file opens fine and informs me that my other computer is currently working on this document (even though it still hasn't managed to even get it open). I can save this open file with another name and then my first computer is able to open that file.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't run into this error every time I open Word. It works fine for a while, then for no understandable reason it comes again to this place of spinning its wheels.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought maybe my template was the problem, so I created a new template and just brought over my four custom styles from the old one. That didn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried the route of deleting the Data and Options registry key. Again no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried repairing Microsoft office both the thorough and the quick fix. Again no help.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems like since the other computer opens my "corrupted file" without a problem, it must not be a corrupted file but rather something with this copy of Word. Actually I am wondering if it is something deeper than Word. A while ago I was also having
 a problem with copying mp3 files to micro SD cards via the built in card reader. I insert a micro SD card into the included SD card adapter and that into the card reader. These are 4GB cards and I am copying more than 1,000 files totaling very close to the
 capacity of the card. I take all of the files at once and drag them to the card. For some cards everything worked fine. The transfer completes in about 20 minutes. But for several of the cards it would copy for a while then suddenly pop up with an error that
 read something down the line of "The semaphore timeout period has expired." Sometimes it would copy quite a few files before coming up with that error. Sometimes it wouldn't get far at all before coming up again. I used a different computer to copy the files
 to the cards, and it did the job fine with no complaint, so obviously the problem was with my computer and not my cards. Now I don't know if this problem has any connection to the problem with Word, but I thought I would mention it in case it might be connected.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, the template is located on the same machine. Usually I simply open Windows Explorer, go to OneDrive, go through the correct folder sequence, then open the Word file, so it is starting Word at the same time. However, I did have it lock up one time
 also when I already had Word open and then, with Word minimized, went back to OneDrive and opened a file.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I will try to completely uninstall and reinstall Office. How will I be able to know for sure if the problem is fixed? Can I open one of my "corrupted" files? Since it opens fine on a different computer (or I can also open the "corrupted" file in Wordpad
 and copy the text out) it seems to me that the file must not actually be corrupted at all. It must be only my copy of Office (or something deeper) that is corrupted. But could I be "corrupting" my clean install of Office by opening one of those files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Later...</p>
<p>I followed the steps you outlined to use the FixIt tool to completely remove Office then reinstall it. When I opened a Word file for the first time it worked fine, but the second file I opened locked up just the same as before. Neither of these were formerly
 "corrupted" files. Is this perhaps a problem related to Windows and not just to Word. Can you tell me where I should go from here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried following one or two of these routes―the only ones that seemed to be relevant to my problem. Most of them did not seem to me to be related to the problem I am having. I haven't figured anything more out, but I am planning to be gone now for two
 to four weeks and will try to take it up again when I get back.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did think of one more thing that might or might not be related. I did not like the spell check in Word 2013, and I found
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/can-i-use-keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-word-2013/47dca017-528f-4c1d-a755-b786479a83d2">
another thread</a>&nbsp;that explained how to use the following macro to run the familiar old spell check dialog box from Word 2007 in Word 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sub SpellCheck()</span><br />
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I created this macro several months ago, and assigned a button to it. But recently when I tried again to use it an information box said that the macro no longer exists or else it is disabled
 (but I tried enabling all macros and that didn't fix it so it must have gotten deleted). I recreated the macro, but it did not seem to work smoothly, and somewhere along the way it again&nbsp;disappeared. So I don't know, is this macro-disappearance-malady a result
 of the same root that is causing my other problems in Word, or is this macro perhaps a cause of the problem?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for your help, and I will hope to take up this problem again in two to four weeks.</span></span></p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;My Microsoft Word is still working (or rather not working) the same way, that is, it works fine on occasion and then randomly it just locks up at the splash screen. It seems the problem cannot be Addin related because, as near as I can tell, I do not
 have any Addins at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Doug, you mentioned the option of updating the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">dlumd32.dll" file if&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">“Office 2013 applications crash on launch at the splash screen”. That
 does seem to describe my problem, but I looked in the specified places and it appears that I don't have that "dlumd32.dll" file at all either.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp;So what other options do I have for fixing this problem?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp;I mentioned in the last paragraph of my first post about a potentially related problem I was having with copying files to a microSD card via my computer's built-in card reader. That problem seems to
 have taken care of itself, so apparently it was not related.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone has a helpful suggestion, because I don't know what more to do.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have not faced anything similar with any other Office programs. I do use Word a lot, though, and I don't use any other Office program very much, so it is possible that I just have not found out about a problem with the other Office programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;On Wednesday I did spend several hours with a Microsoft technician. We did not get the problem fixed, but we did figure out that the problem is with OneDrive, not with Word. It is when I open a Word file from the OneDrive folder on my computer that Word
 freezes up. If I take that problem file and drag it onto my desktop first, it opens fine. Or if I exit OneDrive so that it no longer syncs with the server, my files open fine. I can also go to my online OneDrive account and open the problem Word file with
 the free online Word viewer. From there I can choose the "Edit in Word" option, and the problem file opens fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So from this I think we can conclude that the issue is with OneDrive and how it relates to the server. The problem does not seem to be directly with Word after all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried uninstalling and re-installing OneDrive, but that didn't fix the problem. I even tried uninstalling OneDrive, deleting my entire OneDrive folder, and then re-installing OneDrive and giving it overnight to re-download the 2.8GB of files. That didn't
 seem to help either.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday for the first time, the problem also spread to another of our computers. Somehow in the mix-up of opening different files on different computers, OneDrive decided to duplicate a problem file and add our other computer's name to the end of it.
 Apparently that indicated that that computer had made changes to it. When that computer tried to open its "personalized" copy (the one that had its name added to the file name) it froze up just like my first computer has been doing. That is the first time
 that that computer has ever had that problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I looked in Event Viewer and found the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program WINWORD.EXE version 15.0.4691.1000 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Action Center control panel.<br />
&nbsp;Process ID: 1d4<br />
&nbsp;Start Time: 01d0522a3fc7748f<br />
&nbsp;Termination Time: 15<br />
&nbsp;Application Path: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\Root\Office15\WINWORD.EXE<br />
&nbsp;Report Id: 8b83200f-be1d-11e4-ad92-5cff350730ab<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand all those codes, but perhaps you can understand it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p />

<h2>            Can I rename my &#34;Skydrive Camera Roll&#34; Album on Skydrive&#63;</h2>
                    Can I rename my "Skydrive Camera Roll" Album on Skydrive and have it still sync correctly and still receive automatic uploads to skydrive via Windows Phone?
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Update:</span>
<div>
<br />

<div>
You can rename it!</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I renamed the folder within the desktop client and gave it a few seconds while it pushed the changes to my skydrive online...</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Only one caveat: It doesnt actually rename the folder in the Windows Phone albums.</div>
<div>
This makes me think that once we take a photo using the phone, instead of sending the photo away over the network it might just place it into the "Skydrive Camera Roll" folder on the phone (which in turn uploads to skydrive immediately).</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
This would imply that the folder path master is dictated by the phone, but allows renaming within the web and desktop clients.</div>

            I don't think so. The phone will create another folder called SkyDrive Camera Roll and start uploading to it.

<h2>            Making one page landscape</h2>
                    I am using Microsoft Word 2013 and I am trying format ONE page into landscape while keeping all other pages in portrait. I had no problem doing this is prior versions of word. The only options I get are apply to: this section, this point forward, and the

            <p>If you want portrait oriented pages after the landscape page, you will need to insert two Section breaks and then change the orientation of the page in between them to Landscape, selecting This Section from the Apply to: drop down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Absolutely nothing has changed in this regard from any prior version of Word.&nbsp; While the layout of the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog has changed slightly from that of Word 97 (shown below), the functionality has not changed.</p>
