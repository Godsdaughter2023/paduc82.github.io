    <title>Issue with Logitech z506 speakers after upgrade to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue with Logitech z506 speakers after upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded yesterday to windows 10, and noticed this morning that I wasn't getting sound out of my speakers (logitech z506).<br />
<br />
Sound however comes out of my monitor which is connected by an HDMI cable to my tower (Alienware R51). I didn't have this problem before, and with the new layout I'm having trouble finding out where to fix it. I've already tried through the playback device
 settings and that doesn't seem to help. Has anyone else had this problem, or know how to fix it? Thank you in advance.<br />

            I found a solution, I managed to get it working by downloading my drivers for version windows 8.1 and installing them manually by opening device manager scrolling down a right clicking on my High Definition Audio Device to open up the update driver software...
 from here i chose "browse my computer for software", then on the next window i chose "let me pick....." and in here i only had one choice(but if you have multiple versions you have downloaded then you will see more than one) i chose that item and it propted
 me saying "it may not work properly.......blah blah blah" tried it anyway and boom now i have sound! But granted i had to reconfigure it the way i like it. But at least there is sound.

                    <p>I have been faithfully backing up my hard drive every two weeks using the Windows 10 File History utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually I see under Backup Options a message like "Your last backup was XX/XX/XXXX."&nbsp; But tonight I am seeing "Your data is not yet backed up."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to "Restore files from a current backup," I see "There isn't any history of your files, folders, or libraries."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on here?&nbsp; It's as if I have no backup of my data whatsoever.</p>
<p>

            Hi  nsmrb18 
<br />
<br />The information below I provide is thorough and verbose, but its the truth regarding Backup in Windows 10. and the alternatives you will need to consider. 
<br />
<br />File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

            Hi NS.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version.  But they're not the best choices anyway because after ten years in forums I've seen countless times that files are lost trying to restore them, so  feel obligated to recommend choices that work much better and are 100% reliable.  
<br />
<br />The safest and most reliable method is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag or copy them to external or another hard drive.  
<br />
<br />Then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can also choose to sync the Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders (only) in Settings &gt; Autosave.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  
<br />
<br />There is an easy way to mount the System Image to extract files if needed.  Some prefer to move their User folders off of C to make the image smaller so they stay current if you need to reimage C.  Here's how:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Windows backup &amp; maybe in the future file history are being deprecated &amp; will eventually be removed, what you’re experiencing may be related to that. 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/w8cookbook/windows-7-backup-and-restore-deprecated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deskto...</a>
<br />
<br />Microsoft recommend using third party software:
<br />“System Image Backup (SIB) Solution
<br />We recommend that users use full-disk backup solutions from other vendors.”
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034825/features-that-are-removed-or-deprecated-in-windows-10-fall-creators-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403482...</a>
<br />
<br />I recommend moving to third party imaging software now before it is removed permanently  if you prefer backing up your PC rather than using File history.
<br />Many users recommend Macrium Reflect free:

I have looked at the security settings as I realise there may be some difference but I cannot find anything major.

<p>Thanks so much for reply. Prob is I have not touch any of the files they are in one folder, all that has happened is that it has been copied to my ext drive (whole directory windowsimagebackup then back again. I had to format the D: drive where they were
 stored but was able to copy data to ext drive first and then back again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read somewhere that windows backup image files CANNOT be moved to another drive once they had been stored ? I think that this is a security issue, perhaps in moving them some flag or sec permission or owner was changed.&nbsp; I guess that this is the prob,
 but its years since I worked in com sec so I have no idea how win 7 sec works ! Of course it might be something else completely ! What I do know is that new images work fine and all old ones that were moved cannot be seen !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more thoughts greatfully received</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many many thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simon</p>

            You need to click the button "Select image" at the bottom in order to see all image files. It is essential that all file and folder names are the same between the original and the copy. A moment ago I tested it myself: I created a copy of an existing image
 folder, then checked Image Restore to see if it was available. It was.

    <title>No Sound After Installing Realtek Audio - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No Sound After Installing Realtek Audio</h2>
                    I use Audacity to record streams or music so I looked for stereo mix but couldn't find it. It seems windows 10 removed stereo mix so I installed realtek audio drivers from my motherboard's manufacturer's site. After installing it all sound was dead. I
 could see my headphones active (connected with jak) but no sound. I uninstalled and reinstalled the realtek drivers which gave me sound but whenever I turned on stereomix, changed the volume or tried to record with Audacity sound was completely gone again.
 So Pretty much I had to uninstall and re-install realtek drivers about five times today. At the moment I have sound but I can't touch the volume button, can not use Audacity nor turn stereo mix on. I've looked for some fixes but nothing worked.

    <title>Windows 10 loses local usb printers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bracesllc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 loses local usb printers</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10 in August,&nbsp; I have 4 users who lose their local usb connected printers about 10 times per day.&nbsp; The only way to get the printers back is to restart the computer.&nbsp; They are not able to print from any software (Word, Wordpad,
 excel, etc.) when they are lost.&nbsp; If I look at printers on these machines when it happens the only printers showing is Microsoft Virtual and Nova -not the printer that is directly connected to their computer.&nbsp; I have reinstalled the printers, I have checked
 to make sure that spooling services are set to automatic and I have looked at the printer setting to make sure it is not set to sleep.&nbsp; This is extremely frustrating for a business who prints all days.&nbsp; All printers are the same model and did not have the
 problem prior to Windows 10 install.&nbsp; Please help!&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

            Hi Braces.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Admin, copy and paste in the following command and press Enter:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash). 
<br />
<br />4 Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  
<br />
<br />5) If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Manis.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by the April Version 1803 Update you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Warranty ends when&#63; - not sure of day&#47;month format on Microsoft website</h2>
                    <p>The Microsoft Canada warranty site, specifically the "Device service and repair" page, indicates "<strong>Manufacturer Warranty ends 09/01/2018</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SurfaceBook does not need warranty service; I'd just like to know if "<strong>09/01/2018"
</strong>means Sept 1, 2018, or Jan 9, 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it means the former, ie Sept 1, 2018. But I could not find anywhere the day/month format that Microsoft uses.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Games Cannot Sign Into the Xbox Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason zimmerman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Games Cannot Sign Into the Xbox Account</h2>
                    
<p>I posted this in the Windows 10 community, who then pointed me here....</p>
<p>When my Son logs into our Windows 10 PC and tries to access&nbsp;games, the games&nbsp;cannot connect to his Xbox live account.&nbsp; When the games are launched it prompts to access his account.&nbsp; Clicking "Allow Access" gives no errors,&nbsp;the prompt&nbsp;disappears as expected&nbsp;and
 the games continue to launch and are playable, but the games never connect to his account.&nbsp; A few games I'm referring too are games such as&nbsp;<em>Cut the Rope</em>,
<em>Rayman Fiesta Run</em>, and <em>Ilomilo Plus</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When&nbsp;I log into the same&nbsp;PC all those same games connect just fine to my Xbox live account.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>There are only two games that allow him to connect to his Xbox live account: Minecraft and Solitaire.&nbsp; So why do these connect ok?</p>
<p>I checked the region and date &amp; time settings.&nbsp; All are correct across the accounts.</p>
<p>I also tried to temporarily disable the firewall and antivirus.&nbsp; That had no impact.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>I had a theory that it was not allowing my son connect to Xbox because the games were purchased under my account, which may be why I can connect just fine to Xbox through the games but he cannot. &nbsp;To test this out, I uninstalled one of them, then signed
 in as my son and purchased and downloaded the game under his account. It still did not allow him to connect to Xbox through the game.</p>
<p>Also, when I try through a game like Angry Birds: Star Wars it reads, "Sorry, we can't sign you in. Try signing in at Xbox.com, then start this app again." &nbsp;Well, I tried that and it didn't work.</p>
<p>I don't think it is a problem with the apps. &nbsp;The only games that my son is allowed to sign in to are the two Xbox games that were preinstalled on this tablet at the time of purchase. &nbsp;Coincidentally, when he logs into his account on Xbox.com, then clicks
 on his profile, it says "Uh oh....that shouldn't have happened. It appears you've found a glitch in the system. Please try again later."</p>

<p>I've also been having this same problem for the last 2-3 days. &nbsp;I have no problem signing into my computer and going online and I can 'open' my Microsoft games, but it never signs me into my Microsoft account, so I can't play the daily games. I can't even
 get the weather app to work correctly. It's very frustrating trying to find out how to get help about this problem. I even ran some sort of app/troubleshooter, but it didn't find anything wrong on my end. So this has to be a Microsoft/Xbox problem.</p>

<p>I have not been able to sign into the MS games for over a week now. have uninstalled and reinstalled all of them and even installed the Xbox (Beta) app. Nothing helps. It shouldn't take this long to fix the problem. it seems the problem is quite widespread.
 The only MS game that works is an "Xbox Live" game. All my broken games are "Xbox" games. Very, very frustrating!</p>

<p>Also am seeing "Sorry, we can't sign you in. Try signing in at Xbox.com, then start this app again." when trying to run Microsoft Minesweeper, Mahjong, Jigsaw, Bingo and Jackpot, but no problem running Microsoft Solitaire. It seemed to be after the update
 earlier this month. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling without a positive result. Using an HP Touchscreen laptop that came with Windows 10 installed if that makes a difference. I know the development team is aware, but reporting anyway. Hate to see my perfect
 streaks end on several of those games.</p>

                    Suddenly when I try to launch Google Chrome, I get "Runtime Error R6016 -not enough space for thread data?" as Chrome shuts down. Plenty of hard drive space, disk defragged, no viruses or malware. Never seen this message before.&nbsp;

            I think you are on the right track to reinstall Chrome...&nbsp; but they have a preferred method for the best results and that information is here:<br />

<br />
Just FYI, running sfc /scannow will not help, but it will waste your time and you will not be able to determine which file is causing the issue because...<br />
<br />
When sfc /scannow runs successfully, you will only see a starting and complete message in the Event Viewer System log.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It can take a long time to run and slow your system down.&nbsp; When it starts and stops successfully you only will see events like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64016<br />
Windows File Protection file scan was started.<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64017<br />
Windows File Protection file scan completed successfully.<br />
<br />
There is no information about what it did or what it didn't do.<br />
<br />
Even if sfc /scannow finds something to do, you will not know about it.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
That makes trying it even more of a waste of time.<br />

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow the steps from the article given below:</div>

            <p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Sticky Note is open on the desktop during Windows shutdown, it will/should re-open automatically on Startup. If this doesn't happen; then, you can create a desktop shortcut of Sticky Notes, and place it in your Windows Startup folder.Use
<strong>%windir%\system32\StikyNot.exe</strong> for the location field.<br />
</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            I wouldn't worry, 'Get win10' is a marketing ploy, if the icon shows in your task bar your system is ready for win10 and it will be deployed via windows update, when released<br />

            <p>I've been chasing this problem for weeks now. &nbsp;Search here on some phrase like "get windows 10 blank". &nbsp;There are a great variety of solutions that work for some.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For many of us, the windows 10 reserved shows up on the regular Windows update page some hours to days after the icon shows. &nbsp;I do not know if clicking on the blank window about where the button is, or right clicking on the icon and Get Win 10 in the menu
 matters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I am still concerned, not about getting Win 10, but about why I get the blank window. &nbsp;Is some Windows file corrupted?, &nbsp;Is it a vestige of some malware attempt?, configuration of my system, or just some Windows setting somewhere ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure would like to know why the Get Win 10 window is blank.</p>

            I have download new updates recently for my win 7 OS and security and I still see a blank screen when I open the get windows 10 icon. I checked for more updates and no more are available at this time. I am running an older computer and most of my drivers
 are out dated, but win 7 works fine on my computer. I just see a blank screen when I open the get windows 10 screen. I'm sure windows update will still get me the windows 10 install.

            I had this same problem (on a Dell studio).&nbsp; I had the Windows upgrade icon in the lower right corner of the screen, but when I clicked on it, I got a blank screen.&nbsp; In the course of making sure that I had all the updates (which I did) I opened Windows
 Update from the Start menu.&nbsp; The Windows Update window had a button to update to Windows 10.&nbsp; I hit the install update button and the update started right away.

    <title>ordinal 3109 missing from the dynamic link library LIBEAY32.DLL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iamlightvv  say:</h3>
<h2>            ordinal 3109 missing from the dynamic link library LIBEAY32.DLL</h2>
                    One day i got this error while turning off/on my laptop. At first i thought it was no big deal since i could simply press "Ok" and the computer would do as i wished (shutdown, start) but it became an issue as my fingerprint reader would not work on start
 up. I cannot restore it to a previous state in which it doesn't have this issue unfortunately and have already checked my Windows/system32 to see if LIBEAY32.DLL is there and it is. Any ideas?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message you have received?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span>
<b>Perform clean boot and check.</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean
 boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow

<p><b><span>Method 2: Re-register libeay32.dll and check.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</span></p>
<p><b><span>regsvr32 libeay32.dll</span></b></p>

<p><span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might
 occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how

<h2>            All browsers slow after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    The issue is NOT my internet connection. &nbsp;It is hardwired and speed tests just fine.&nbsp;<br />
Every browser I try is slow to load &amp; lagging. &nbsp;Chrome, Firefox, Edge all the same. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I've cleared everything, reset, disabled any add ons or extensions, still the same. NOTHING has fixed this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All drivers are updated. Though that should not make EVERY browser slow!?? Something is not right with Win10.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What is the solution here? &nbsp;I can barely stand to use my laptop at this point yet need to every day for work.&nbsp;

            I am having this problem and it sounds like many are having this problem. &nbsp;I followed the instructions and it didn't work. &nbsp;It's not my internet connection. &nbsp;I turned off Norton and that didn't work either. &nbsp;This is a Microsoft problem. &nbsp;It started happening
 around the same time Microsoft decided to push an update that won't let the user disable that bothersome Cortana.

<p>I have the same issue. I have tried disabling services, malware software, antivirus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All browsers are extremely slow to load, websites are slow to load. when scrolling webpages the pages become jumpy and erratic. Videos are choppy. This certainly appears to me a Win 10 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way too many services are running. I have over 65 svchost.exe running at any given time, superfetch constantly running disk usage overtime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 is no longer just an OS, it has become a software with WAY too much bloatware and too many "included" apps that never get used and run in the background whether you want them or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has become a burdensome OS with features no one wants or needs, not to mention all the Microsoft spyware included in those apps and features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to leave our computers alone and let us run what we want to run and not force us to run what you want us to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us back the speed and stable OS we need and want.</p>

            Exact same issue after the update. I thought it was my Internet connection but that was not the problem. Windows what the heck, why does all the updates keep messing with the system.&nbsp;

<p>Why is Microsoft ignoring this problem? More and more people are having the same problem and you haven't added anything to this forum. After I posted some negative feedback, your tech support people took over my computer (with my permission) and tried to
 kill Cortana via registry settings. The first person didn't get it done and the second one seemed to get it done, but after more Windows 10 updates, it's back in a more limited fashion. This wasted over 3 hours of my time and Cortana is now taking over 35
 Mb of my memory even though I NEVER USE IT AND NEVER WILL. You need to pull all your developers who are working on the latest useless, intrusive "features" like Cortana and put them to work making Windows into something with useful performance along with testing
 your updates to make sure they don't cause more problems than they fix. They should also add a feature that allows users to permanently uninstall Cortana, OneDrive, Edge and other useless Microsoft apps from OUR computers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, after several more Windows 10 updates, the browser performance issues have been fixed on my system. I'd suggest that everyone make sure they have all the latest updates installed and send feedback to Microsoft if they're still having problems.</p>

<p>Well the last upgrade that was f forced upon me has totally messed up both my laptops. I am so upset I am. I am so upset I want to ditch Microsoft and start buying a Mac products. I can't get anywhere right now on either of my laptops. One is an older pc
 and the other is maybe Two years old! Bith are super slow and they won't do anything when I'm on the Internet. I cannot even get help online because of these issues. &nbsp;Right now I am on my Apple iPhone asking for help for my Microsoft laptops .......that is
 so so dumb. &nbsp;I need some solutions soon. And here are the same questions....'why is Microsoft not addressing this and why are they constantly forcing updates for Apps I will never use?' Frustrated as</p>
<p>hell on my trusty iphone!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox One &#34;Original Avatar&#34; won&#39;t load.</h2>
                    title says it all. Using the new avatar editor, i go the the menu option to import my original avatar, and it will not load. This occurs on both Xbox One and on Windows 10 versions of the app.

<p>Hi Wiles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the Forums! </p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand this is frustrating since it will not allow you to access the original Avatar. We want to help as best as we can. We have not received information that there is a known issue currently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When signed into another account, does it allow access to both the Xbox original and Xbox 360 Avatar?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, let us try troubleshooting on the console. Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the apps?

yes, another account on the same Xbox was able to load both the new Xbox One and old Xbox 360 avatars with no problem.

<h2>            list of apps or games with game mode enabled</h2>
                    <p>Hi, yesterday i installed creators update and tested game mode. When i pressed win+g in watch dogs 2 toolbar appeared and i could enable game mode. But in arma 3 the screen get brighter twice in second (blink) but no toolbar appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, if there is some tool or registry where i can see apps or games with game mode enabled or eventually turn on /off game mode for games without entering them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted in Windows forum, as it is related more to game mode functionality and management.<br />

            <p>Hi Tomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can see here that you want to play games with Game Mode enabled. Regarding this concern, the official release of Windows 10 Creators Update will be on April 11, 2017. Having said that, you can enjoy playing games with the said mode once you got the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us should you need further assistance.</p>

            hi, but I already have creators update using &nbsp;MS Update Assistant tool. But I need to enable game mode for arma 3 manually as game bar dont appear in that game. &nbsp;The question is, if I can manage / enable game mode without entering the game - I mean edit
 some registry or using some tool.<br />

                    <p>My account Nurce was banned for solicitation which I never did and a person named <strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>changed my accounts password to get on it whole I was on summer break in Florida and then reported me to get me banned forever because he harassed me and hated me thinking I was gon a quit xbox in a whole while he just went on to PS4. I want either my account back or a way to buy it back because this makes absolutely no sense if maybe I could just change my bio because that's what I was banned for. I understand I had 3 other bans but this is unnecessary if I never even sold the account. Thanks.</p>
