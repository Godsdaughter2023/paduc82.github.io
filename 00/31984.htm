<h2>            How to fix broken xbox 360 achievements&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>So a long time ago, around may 2009, i recovered my gamer tag to another xbox, losing some achievements in the process (i didn't know at the time that would happen) but that's not my issue. the problem is that i have recently gone back and redid them
 and still don't have them. for example, today i was playing ninja gaiden 2, and yes i have xbox live and full internet. i beat the 6th, 7th, and 8th test of valor and only got the 6th test of valor achievement. i am sure that i lost these achievements when
 i recovered my gamer tag back in 2009 but since then i have started a new game, this time beating it only use one weapon, and i still didn't get my achievements anyway to fix this? thanks for any help on this issues.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uklv.info%2fg.gif" /></span></p>

<h2>            EVENT 1001 BugCheck and Critical EVENT 41 Kernel-Power</h2>
                    <p>I've had my PC since January (completely new + running Windows 10) but ever since February it has been restarting without any warning for seemingly no reason. It's happened around 10 times since and seems to be on some kind of count down, restarting after
 a certain amount of hours use. Just yesterday it rebooted 10 minutes after I had started the PC up, and half an hour from me writing this it rebooted again. I finally dived into the Event Viewer and found that there has been a consistent chain of Critical
 errors, namely Event 41 Kernel Power, with Event 1001 BugCheck sitting right underneath it every time. I've been scouring the net to try and figure out how to fix the issue, but I'm not really sure what's going on and I am fairly new to all the deep-seated
 technological terms. Any help would be greatly appreciated (and relayed in simple terms) because I'm honestly clueless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Select Program to Open File With</h2>
                    Hi - In Windows Explorer, I am trying to select a program to open a file with.&nbsp; I right click and then select "Open With", then select the program's .exe file.&nbsp; However, when I click open, the program I selected doesn't show up in the "Other Programs"
 list.&nbsp; Also, once I do get it to show up in the "Other Programs" list, will the program automatically show up when I right click and select "Open With"?&nbsp; It does on my other computer.&nbsp; I am trying to open a photo in Photoshop Elements (as a shortcut) and would
 like the program to show up when I right click as well as show as an option for a program to open the jpeg with from Windows Photo Viewer (as it does on my other computer).&nbsp; Thanks for the help!<br />

<h3> russgarside  say:</h3>
<h2>            task bar icons blank</h2>
                    <p>After applying the november windows 10 home update three of my task bar icons have become blank sheets. &nbsp;The ones changed are edge, store and wunderlist. &nbsp;The remainder are fine. &nbsp;The icons of the three appear correct in the all apps list. &nbsp;I have tried
 unpin and re-pin with no change. &nbsp;The three applications work correctly and start fine from the task bar. &nbsp;It is just hard to remember which application is which blank. &nbsp;Note this has happened on my hp laptop which was upgraded from windows 8.1, &nbsp;My desktop
 which has windows 10 professional &nbsp;does not have the problem. &nbsp;It was upgraded from windows 7 professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response. We appreciate the time and effort that you have invested in to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you remove all the icons from the task bar, reset icon&nbsp;cache and check if the issue still persist. To reset Icon Cache follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong><span>1.</span></strong><span> Close and save anything that you are working on before proceeding.
 The next steps will involve killing explorer and restarting the PC.<br />

<strong>DEL "%localappdata%\IconCache.db" /A</strong> <br />

<h3> davidsenesac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell XPS 15 9550 Window 10 One Note cannot login and or sync</h2>
                    <p>Set up a new Dell XPS 15 9550, using Windows 10, last fall and was not able to set up One Note so ignored it.&nbsp; Then a couple times since it somehow was involved in blocking my Internet access through my home router.&nbsp; I was eventually able to get by that
 by using the One Note reset password function.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently upon booting the OS, a MS warning window appeared tersely relating my MS Account needed to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main interest is not in using the OneNote app but rather fear it will for unknown reasons in the future lock out Internet access as it has twice.&nbsp; So am trying to straighten whatever out.&nbsp; But when I bring up the application it wants me to login but either
 I set up an account I don't recall in the original debug process or I never set up an account and it is confused.&nbsp; So today tried to set up new MS accounts and it complained my XPS 15 device already has an account.&nbsp; I can login to my MS account for my desktop
 pc.&nbsp; Would contact MS except all I get on their site is a customer support robot with useless information or it sends me to the user support forum the is a black hole with no responses.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I need Dell to do is to have someone at MS fix my account issues.</p>

            <p>Hi David,<br />
<br />
It is unusual for OneNote to cause any issues with your Internet access. To assist you better with this concern kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How were you able to determine that OneNote is blocking your Internet access?</li><li>Have you tried running your PC on safe mode? If yes, do you encounter the same issue? If you haven't tried it yet, we suggest you to run your PC on safe mode.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we would like to request for a screenshot of the prompt/error you are getting.<br />
<br />
We look forward for your reply.</p>

            The issue may be somewhat resolved.&nbsp; I apparently have at least 2 Microsoft Accounts, one for my old HP desktop running Vista and the other for the Dell XPS 15 9550.&nbsp;&nbsp; I say at least because during debug I tried to set up new accounts more than once and
 am uncertain if their are garbage accounts left open?&nbsp;&nbsp; I went into my account on the Dell and performed password resets then went in and looked at what that showed, capturing screen displays with my cellphone camera along the way so I can repeat doing so
 in the future if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that OneNote and OneDrive seemed happy as I was able to login once booted up into Windows 10.&nbsp; However subsequently upon power off on rebooting, a warning message still shows indicating there is something wrong with my account.&nbsp;
 I need to capture that message and look into it further.&nbsp; Will update this post later.<br />
<br />
At the time months ago when my Internet access was blocked, the connection to OneNote was that after I was able to get into that application's configuration setup, the issue went away and I once again had normal Internet access.&nbsp; Thus either it was related
 to OneNote directly or more likely OneNote provided a pathway to fixing something incorrect in my Microsoft account associated with Windows 10.&nbsp; Here is what I posted on the Dell Support forum:<br />
<br />
http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19998331<br />
<br />
As you can see no one answered.&nbsp; I have since complained to Dell customer support that their support personnel should occasionally look into what users are posting in their forums because there are many posts for which no answers are being provided.&nbsp; When one
 buys a Dell system a one year Basic warranty is provided.&nbsp; However upon having this issue, I was not able to actually ever connect up to a Dell customer support person but rather just got routed around in circles by their support telephone service robots.&nbsp;
 Accordingly one ends up posting in their support forums.&nbsp; I did not post anything at Microsoft because until I got into OneNote did not know what the issue was.&nbsp; However as someone that has worked in Silicon Valley computer hardware engineering several decades
 found it annoying that there was not a parallel work around setting up Internet access even though Windows 10 had an issue.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Printer Spooler Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottblosser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Printer Spooler Failure</h2>
                    I have 3 computers. All 3 were erroring on my printer spooler. I cannot get the printer spooler to maintain operation. It will continuous flick on and off. They are all upgrades from w7. I have found a way to put up with it for the last year and am rather
 upset the Windows has still failed to issue an update to resolve this.<br />
<br />
Have followed the steps as outlined from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/print-spooler-on-windows-10/d56ee75b-5c54-441b-a4b7-72ad20282fbc?auth=1">
Prabhavathi's previous post</a>&nbsp;linked in multiple threads. I have also tried&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/print-spooler-will-not-start-error-error/07f0d2fd-2658-4df9-8b1f-e492dfff3338?auth=1">eVollo's
 Registry Edit suggestion.</a><br />
<br />
Step 2 from Prabhavathi solved issues on 1 computer. Other 2 still maintain issue. Neither has files in C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS. When I check my Computer management event view applications, the spoolsv.exe shows error.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a fix for this yet?<br />

<br />Under hardware keyboard, turn off  'show text suggestions as I type'

<p>Hi Winston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping me. By the way, I have tried both of your suggestion above. However, it still not solved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Open&nbsp;device manager and check if you are viewing the properties of valid network card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press Windows key + R. </p>
<p>b. Type 'devmgmt.msc' and hit ENTER. </p>
<p>c. Expand 'network adapters'. </p>
<p>d. If you have 2 network cards&nbsp;in there (which happens fairly frequently), you may be trying to modify the properties on a disabled card. If you see one that says "device is working properly", modify the TCP/IP settings for that one.&nbsp;

<p>I experienced the same issue. I found just one solution to change the Internet Protocol&nbsp;TCP/IP 4&nbsp;properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Start your pc in safe mode with network support. </p>

<p>
</p><p>- Then you&nbsp;can change&nbsp; the properties for TCP/IP</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try the methods to diagnose this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

<h2>            I don&#39;t understand the &#39;left pane&#39; of File Explorer. Can someone explain it all to me&#63;</h2>
                    The list of all my folders is seen in what is called the "Left Pane" of 'File Explorer'.&nbsp; I have created a folder named "Documents_PC". My user name is "Di Co".&nbsp; Why do I see&nbsp; three folders named 'Documents' and WHY is my "Documents_PD" folder listed under
 "Di Co" but not "This PC".&nbsp; I don't understand File Explorer and I worry I will lose my documents.&nbsp; It is fine to use search to find them when one wants to open them but it is not so good when one trying to save a file and is searching for the folder one wants
 to put it in.&nbsp; Is there a comprehensive guide to File Explorer somewhere online?&nbsp; PS I don't use 'Libraries' because I find that even more confusing.&nbsp; Thank you.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c18633a-3ed6-4cc6-bb6c-bab03741f04a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c18633a-3ed6-4cc6-bb6c-bab03741f04a" /></a>

            <p>You see Documents_PC under Di Co because (I assume) that is where you created it.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, I guess I must have put that folder there.&nbsp; The reason I made a folder called 'Documents_PC' was because when I went to save something I was getting confused seeing 3 or 4 folders named 'Documents' - one or two of which are inside what appears to be
 the One Drive folder. (The folders in 'Documents' on 'This PC' appear to be a mix of folders on One Drive, AND on my PC.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to upload all my documents to One Drive and I don't want to make the mistake of accidentally putting a file in the wrong 'Documents' folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want complete control and understanding of where my files are stored, which ones are on cloud storage, which ones are the 'master' copies.&nbsp; A filing or organizational system is only effective or useful if one has complete trust in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when I just used 'Save As' from Word then chose 'This PC', the Save As window just went to C:. So I had to go looking in the 'Left Pane' at the folder list to figure out where I really wanted to save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried renaming the 'user shell' folder 'Documents' but it didn't take right away, so then I created 'Documents_PC' and put everything in that and put that in 'Documents'. Then all of a sudden I had Documents_PC&lt;Documents_PC. So then I just moved MY 'Documents_PC'
 or some such silly thing.&nbsp; nevermind.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Can I rename the 'user shell' folder called 'Documents'? I am afraid to try again for fear of losing all my docs.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, Windows is automatically naming at least two folders 'Documents' and it is confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is a "boilerplate reply"? lol</p>

<p>
</p><p>One Drive: Some of these are not uploaded to One Drive - don't show up on One Drive through my browser. But some of them ARE on my One Drive!</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>User Di Co folders also contains a Documents folder - which is the same as in the photo above for the 'One Drive' folder. And it seems to be the only TRUE place with the files that reside on my computer.</p>

            <p>You can rename the folder, but it might cause more confusion.&nbsp; Windows has a way for folders to have a display name that is different from the actual file system name.&nbsp; The display name comes from a hidden file within the folder named desktop.ini.&nbsp; The effect
 of this is most easily seen in the 'Public folders.&nbsp; Notice how the display name in Explorer differs from the file system name viewed from a Command Prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/965394b7-8e14-458d-9be3-411f592b4da0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/965394b7-8e14-458d-9be3-411f592b4da0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So until you're sure of what's pointing where, you might want to hold off on renaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of the file system, a user by default has folders for Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos, Downloads, Contacts, Desktop, and OneDrive.&nbsp; Everything under OneDrive gets synchronized with the cloud.&nbsp; Looks like Documents, Pictures, and Music are subfolders
 there by default.&nbsp; So you essentially have two folders named Documents on your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you have shortcuts to Documents under This PC and Quick Access.&nbsp; To determine which folders these refer to you should check the Location tab in the folder's Properties dialog.&nbsp; Here, This PC Documents points to C:\Users\USerName\Documents while Quick
 Access Documents points to C:\Users\UserName\OneDrive\Documents.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afdd01e5-dbbf-4d2e-bada-2ae1757145ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afdd01e5-dbbf-4d2e-bada-2ae1757145ce" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This was the result of changing the Auto save settings for OneDrive which are accessed by right-clicking the OneDrive icon in the Notification Area &amp; selecting Settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef904d65-d161-4adc-a8b7-2be23474174b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef904d65-d161-4adc-a8b7-2be23474174b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally keep them set on This PC only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let's make sure everything is saving where you want it to first.</p>

            <p>Yes you are probably right in saying not to go into that code stuff and change the name of any folders named 'Documents'. I don't trust myself with understanding the implications of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then you said:</p>
<p>"This was the result of changing the Auto save settings for OneDrive which are accessed by right-clicking the OneDrive icon in the Notification Area &amp; selecting Settings:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the task bar 'Notification Area', I wondered. (I searched online - did not find a picture showing me, gave up)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, bottom right, maybe. I clicked on the 'Notification' icon - but that is apparently not the same thing as the 'notification area on the task bar' since what popped up was not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm, I still didn't see a One Drive icon - oh wait: I then clicked on the little up arrow / claret shape between the Drop Box icon and that yellow triangle icon so I could 'Show hidden icons'.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98ccfc94-69ae-4fb1-a77f-271d4454b4e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98ccfc94-69ae-4fb1-a77f-271d4454b4e8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Eureka!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary: lower right of screen &gt; 'little up arrow' &gt; right click on 'One Drive' icon &gt; click on 'Settings' = see&nbsp; the One Drive settings dialogue box with four tabs as per your screen cap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh ****. What is this stuff under the "Account" tab?&nbsp; Now I see that One Drive is synching some folders I did not know about. I am innocent! I don't know those folders got into One Drive!&nbsp; Anyway, first things first: tab 'Auto Save'</p>
<p>
</p><p>tab 'Auto Save':</p>
<p>Ok, as in your instructions to which I am replying, I have left unchecked the boxes saying "Automatically save ...."</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I change the gray drop down boxes to 'This PC only', what are the implications?&nbsp; What exactly does that mean "Choose where you want to save your documents and pictures"?&nbsp; Is that just for 'auto-saved' things? What things are subject to 'auto-save'?&nbsp;
 Confused. Does this only apply to files already on One Drive or all files I work with on my PC. Brevity is cause of confusion, as usual. A pop up or 'more info' would be nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, plunge: changing it to 'This PC only' and see what happens.</p>
<p>I will test by editing a document for which I do in fact want the copy in my 'One Drive' folder (i.e. cloud storage One Drive Live) to be the master copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't mind me - I am in my own itty bitty little world and appreciate your patience so far.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dare I go to the next tab to deal with on my own? the "Account" tab and the gray box called "choose folders".&nbsp; I may have to.&nbsp; As long as I don't make it any worse.</p>

            <p>Changing from OneDrive to This PC only changes the target for the 'Documents' and 'Pictures' shortcuts under Quick Access.&nbsp; It also means that when well-behaved programs 'ask' Windows: "Where are files for this user stored?", they will be pointed to the
 Documents or Pictures folder in your User folder rather than your OneDrive folder.&nbsp; As most programs remember the last folder you used for open/save actions, you may only notice this on newly installed programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Accounts tab &amp; the Choose folders button, this is for selecting which folders
<em><strong>from</strong></em> your Cloud storage&nbsp;will be&nbsp;replicated&nbsp;<em><strong>to</strong></em> your OneDrive folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;More for those users that want their 'master' file collection in the Cloud on only selected items on their local&nbsp;device&nbsp;due to storage limitations.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I leave them all checked.</p>

            <p>Thank you Keith. I am still digesting your most recent reply and hope to discuss more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you mentioned double checking the Location of a folder/file using the Properties Box to help one save things where wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I just noticed that the various places file paths are given or displayed don't always show the same thing.</p>
<p>Places where file paths are shown in the following two photos include:</p>
<p>-the Left Pane of File Manager</p>
<p>-the address bar of File Manager - two kinds of views</p>
<p>-the Properties Box of the selected file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that in the address bar of File Manager, if you click the 'folder icon' to the left of the path, the path displayed changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you compare these three areas in the following two screenshots, paying attention to "Documents_PC", you will notice the differences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the <strong>first photo</strong>, in the address bar its says the file is in "Documents_PC" under "dicoo".</p>
<p>In the <strong>Left Pane</strong> it is the same as the address bar</p>
<p>But, in the Properties Box it says it is in just "Documents" (no Documents_PC) under "dicoo".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the <strong>second photo</strong>, after I clicked the little folder icon to the left of the path in the address bar, "Documents_PC" has disappeared and the<strong> path ways match</strong> - the location listed in the Properties Box is the same as what
 is displayed in the address bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's up with that?</p>
<p>It makes it look like MY folder has disappeared. Confused! Where is my file actually located?&nbsp; Where is my folder "Documents_PC" actually located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to laugh at my Apple friends when they couldn't understand their storage tree to find things on their computer. Not anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for listening. Computers really are wonderful things - fascinating tools.

    <title>W10 ignoring device installation settings&#47;forcing driver updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnsmithwp  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 ignoring device installation settings&#47;forcing driver updates</h2>
                    <p>As many of you already know, Windows 10 appears to allow the user the freedom to control how device drivers are handled by Windows Update through the device installation settings panel under advanced system settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this setting appears to be nothing but a placebo - the OS simply ignores this setting. It would appear Microsoft introduced this simply to act as a placebo to mollify power users. While I am all for spreading the reach and accessibility of
 technology to those who would otherwise be too intimidated to use computers, I believe it is a mistake to design such a mainstream OS for novices to the degree where you outright alienate technologically competent users. Forcing OS updates without negotiation
 can be justified; forcing hardware driver installations cannot (especially when you introduce a setting that should control this behaviour in order to maintain appearances and then proceed to ignore it). Regardless of update policies, this behaviour is simply
 underhanded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Observe the following scenario: A user performs a clean install of Windows 10 Professional 64-bit (w/ ethernet cable disabled so as to install drivers of the user's own choosing and in the order of the user's own choosing). User installs all latest provided
 driver revisions directly from the device manufacturers, proceeds to disable W10's device installation handling by selecting "Never install driver software from Windows Update" under the device installation settings section and also unchecks the "Automatically
 get the device app and info" box. If the user then proceeds to reboot the system and connect the computer to the internet, the expected result should be that Windows Update does not force installation of Microsoft-selected drivers over the user's own preferred
 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the case, however. In my case Windows Update proceeded to ignore my system settings and force a re-installation of Microsoft's approved Intel VGA drivers over top my Nvidia GeForce drivers. This is a system with a 980 Ti and an i7-4790K, having
 previously manually installed Intel's drivers first and then Nvidia's during OS setup. I was not expecting Windows Update to later force an Intel VGA reinstallation over my GeForce drivers in an attempt to make my system use integrated graphics processing
 rather than my dedicated GPU, <em>especially after I had specifically disabled Windows Update driver installations prior to rebooting.</em></p>
<p>As if that weren't bad enough, Windows Update's version of the Intel VGA driver is
<em>significantly</em> older than the genuine current revision!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the meaning of this? Is Microsoft so adamant on their customers doing things "their way" that they are blind to the software conflicts and other consequences of such heavy-handed tactics? I have another system I was forced to drop Windows 10 from
 as well, as I require a very specific revision of AMD's Catalyst driver software on that machine (where AMD's more recent drivers introduce problems under some specific conditions), and Windows 10 would continually force that I use the driver release approved
 by Microsoft. It's disappointing that they've decided to adopt this attitude, but hardly unsurprising - the old saying is true that other OS' require you to prove your stupidity to the system whereas Windows simply assumes you are stupid and gives you no choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will make a final observation that just because a company provides a technology that is needed in certain fields (DirectX 12) does not mean that specific market niche is going to be very happy with them if they decide to take a deliberately belligerent
 stance towards that subset of users.</p>

            <p>This is highly annoying. I cant even begin to understand why Microsoft thought this was a good idea, especially when it comes to GPU drivers. Two times have I uninstalled the broken driver that Windows keeps downloading, and just yesterday I started having
 the same problem with extremely poor performance in games. Lo and behold, Windows YET AGAIN installed the latest GPU driver which I dont want to use BECAUSE IT'S BROKEN!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to pull my hair out currently.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Now these latest updates will reinstall the AMD driver. I refuse to allow any part of the latest update. I have run the Show Hide troublemaker, oops, I mean troubleshooter; however, it doesn't recognize the AMD update at all. I can't

<p>Glad I stumbled on this as I have the exact same problem AMD driver 17.3.3 give me 10-15fps more in FH3 than any driver since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listen up MS STOP FORCING US TO INSTALL STUFF THAT IS BROKEN, DOESN'T WORK or we JUST DON'T WANT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sick to death of playing a game to have win 10 shutdown mid race to install an update I never got a notification about when I personally set "notify me before installing"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Christ even STEAM downloads stop when I'm gaming not win 10 because MS in their total arrogance know JUST what needs to be installed on my pc to Bork it just when I got it running perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIX UWP and it's total lack of support for any hardware older than 2 years, add multiple device inputs, add multi gpu to win store games. Stop leaving fixes to people like 1stPlatoLV who added more wheels to Forza games than the last official patch did.
 despite MS/T10/PGG saying it can't be done. someone else is working on a way to get multiple USB inputs accepted as we speak, not MS, nor T10 and PGG all they care about is flogging the next DLC</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want, no we DESPERATELY NEED these MASSIVE oversights sorted but get completely IGNORED yet you're happy to stealth install things behind my back and WITHOUT MY EXPRESS permission. DESPITE my personal preferences and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is as bad or WORSE than the pain in the **** hackers who attack sites to get at "THE MAN" when all it does is banjax a service and disrupt the lives of end users who have to fix the damned issue if they can figure out what the **** happened in the
 first place!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS is getting as bad as EA for total ignorance of what customers actually want!!!!!!</p>

<p>"In my case Windows Update proceeded to ignore my system settings"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience, too. W10 persists in ignoring my settings in Admin Tools. I've been into the Registry and blocked Port 443 in the firewall. All to no avail - W10 just carries on with its updates that mess up my settings and cost me a fortune in broadband
 fees (I have a metered connection and no built-in wifi). Have had to revert to the previous build 5 times now. A waste of my time. Considering going back to W8!</p>

<p>Same problem here, Windows keeps downgrading from Win10-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Adrenalin-Edition-17.12.1-Dec11 back down to an old driver from April, I have it set not to:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e0144dd-2607-4e58-900e-050c4e4c6538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e0144dd-2607-4e58-900e-050c4e4c6538" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's ignoring, this is both frustrating and completely unacceptable. I can rollback the driver but that doesn't fix it, it then corrupts AMD settings and will crash every time I use it, so the only option is to do a clean install and go through the inconvenience
 and rigmarole of that.</p>

            Like I mentioned in previous posts, I spent hours with the upgraded level tech support @microsoft, they did all that and a whole lot more! I also mentioned earlier that the camera app starts, the indicator light comes on but the is no image in the box
 ! Maybe that will help. Thanks for the reply.

            <p>So definitively is a DRIVER issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Lenovo ______?&nbsp; (Exact model)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can still roll back to the previous OS (the license for 10 is still tied to that system for the life of that system - so you could always upgrade again if you later find out a proper driver has been made available for it.)<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are into tinkering... You could perform a full system image *as is* and then install Windows 10 CLEANLY on it and get the device drivers installed to see if it works that way.&nbsp; If it still fails, you have pretty much proven that drive just is not
 Windows 10 ready. hah</p>

            Did the system image, also complete re-install. Like I mentioned before, I spent over 3 hours connected with microsoft tech and they went through everything you could think of. Rolled back, deleted, reinstalled drivers, deleted and reinstalled camera apps.
 Checked intel graphics and display driver. I thought it was the display as the camera app, skype and others will start but there is never an image from the camera, just a blank screen. Its a serious issue and it is definately embedded in windows 10 because
 everything was perfect on 8.1. I am now trying to get Lenovo to send me an 8.1 recovery disc I can start from scratch. Still hopkng for a fix though before I have to go back.

            <p>Again: model of the Lenovo system in question, please...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to look up what Windows 10 supported drivers Lenovo is supplying for that system to see if the actual manufacturer of the camera in question might be supplying a driver Lenovo is not (if the manufacturer of the camera is not Lenovo...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 would possibly require a different driver than Windows 8/8.1 for full functionality of any given hardware component, so it working before in Windows 8.1 means very little other than that system was built and supported with Windows 8.1 in mind.
 &nbsp;Usually you can go several versions of Windows (2-4) before the hardware ceases to be supported by the manufacturer, but that is not always the case. &nbsp;This is a hardware device driver issue for sure, and yes, it is because of a change in Microsoft Windows
 code - but it has always been the prerogative of the hardware manufacturers to provide (or not) properly working drivers for any OS for their devices.</p>

            If only Lenovo would provide anything! I contacted them, the 3rd party support, they said it was up to Microsoft and the newest driver they had was 2012 which was already used. Pointing fingers doesn't resolve issues so I'm just going to retire this one
 and go back to my trusty 8.1 on other laptops. I blocked updates on those so the "10" virus wont affect those units. I went to Best Buy and looked at brand new Yoga and Dell and sure enough, they all have the same issues!!! Go figure, or not. Thanks for all
 the trying but if Microsoft and Lenovo have given up then so am I. Besides, all my android stuff works great and are starting to look better all the time!

            <p>Per Shenan's request, it's crucial we know what the device model of your laptop and camera is so we can assist you with investigation. I understand your frustration at this point, we really are interested in tracking down this issue to assist you and other
 customers that may be facing similar issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So in the interest of assisting you, <strong>please post up your Lenovo laptop model. You usually can find this via a sticker on the bottom of the laptop. Also, what would really help would be to know what
</strong><strong>camera device you are using and what driver is loaded. I've included steps below to gather this information.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">How to determine&nbsp;your camera&nbsp;driver: </span></p>

<h2>            Skype Notifications - Orange Blink</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to the new Skype for Windows 10 (regrettably) and found that Skype no longer blinks orange when I get a notification, but instead sends the message in a notification box on the bottom right of the screen. I would prefer not to have my
 personal conversations flash across the screen while at work and am trying to get the orange flash back. I know how to disable the notification center box, but I cannot figure out how to get the orange flash back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know?</p>

<p>Well I've run into this problem and I see a lot of people asking this question, but I've figured out what my issue was, perhaps this will help you if you are still having the problem or others have the problem.</p>
<p>The problem I was having is that it didn't really look like "Help and Support" was saying anything, but it was, it was telling me that it was trying to open an unsupported help file (something we install shows a help file when you login after a reboot).&nbsp;
 So basically, if you are using an older program that has help files that aren't supported by Windows 7 or Vista it comes up with a general Help and Support screen saying it couldn't open the help file, but not telling me which one or giving me any idea as
 to which help file was having issues.&nbsp; I've worked with our software quite a bit and knew what help file was being pulled up so I was able to stop it, but I'd suggest looking at your software's help files to see which ones might not be working.</p>

<h2>            My Bios not support UEFI secure boot, what can I do to install Windows 10 from Windows 7 64 bit&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! My Phoenix Bios in a Fujitsu Esprimo P2560 computer does not support UEFI secure boot, what can I do to install Windows 10 from Windows 7 64 bit! I have now tried several times to upgrade my pc to Windows 10. All goes well until the pc reeboots, then
 it do`n´t boot anymoore and in next boot resores the Windows 7 system.</p>
<p>The problem is the Phoenix bios that not support secure boot and UEFI.</p>
<p>My harddisk boots now with mbr and has the NTFS filesystem on the hardisk.</p>
<p>What kan I do to get windows 10 installation to start without secure boot and UEFI. Can I partition the harddisk to corectly run windows 10. In many discussions I have seen instruktions that I should be able to install windows 10 without secure boot and
 UEFI in bios.</p>
<p>But how I could do that nobody has shown. Something was written about to get the harddisk to GPT mode, but how can I do that.</p>
<p>I have 2 harddisk and one has all files on it and the other is now empty. I can use the empty harddisk to experiment with the case to see that I can install Windows 10 and then do the same upgrading my harddisk with windows 10 from windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody help me with the case, or it is not possible to use Windows 10 on my computer without secure boot and UEFI facilities?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regaards</p>

            <p>The BIOS is not an issue as Windows 10 can run just as well on Legacy BIOS as on the new UEFI FIrmware.&nbsp; Was there an error or anything else that made you think this is UEFI related?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>More likely the Upgrade is choking on corruption or bloat in the present install which is the biggest cause of failures.&nbsp; The secondary drive may also be interfering so unplug it and all other peripherals.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>You should have been presented by Get WIndows 10 app with a Compatibility Report informing you of any possible issues before it ran the Upgrade.&nbsp; If confident your hardware is modern enough to meet

<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>If you want to really maximize chances for a successful Upgrade, then choose to Save Nothing so the Upgrade has much less to choke on.&nbsp; Make sure your files are backed up separately and you have your program installers

<p>

            <p><span>The problem is that you have converted your hard drive to Dynamic which is only meant to span a single partition across two or more hard drives. Are there two hard drives installed?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;If you wish to keep the install there is a method to convert the hard drive back to Basic&nbsp;non-destructively. &nbsp;You will need Partition Wizard 4.2 which is the last version which offers as a free feature to convert a Dynamic Disk to Basic.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Back up your files then follow &nbsp;the steps in Option One of this illustrated tutorial:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/26829-convert-dynamic-disk-basic-disk.html?ltr=C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/26829-convert-dynamic-disk-basic-disk.html?ltr=C</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once the disc is converted, for it to be correct it needs to have the System label on the 1 GB Active partition which is apparently booting the OS now. If it does not show the System label after a reboot then boot into your windows disc or Repair CD to run
 a few <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/startup-repair-faq#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Startup Repairs.</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If you do not have the Windows 7 disk then make now your System Repair disk &nbsp;in Control Panel&gt;Backup Center as it may need a repair to start after conversion depending upon how much other corruption there is.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then post back another Disk Management screenshot.</p>

<p>I'm using a Surface 2, that where it fails. Before I was using a Surface RT 8.0 and it was working perfectly. The Windows 7 machine were a Lenovo Desktop and a Dell Latitude. Don't have right now the model numbers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is a link that shows the issue</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At the beginning you are going to see me doing&nbsp;a right click in the desktop of the remote computer.
</p>
<p>The expected behavior is to see the top left corner of the contextual menu in the place where I was&nbsp;touching&nbsp;the screen with my finger. What we see is the menu jumping up&nbsp;to a different location.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To illustrate better I opened later the file explorer&nbsp;and did a right click using my finger in that&nbsp;txt file at the end of the list. The prompt jumps up and the contextual menu never opens.&nbsp;<br />

<p>In the Surface RT when I connected I remember that the resolution during the connection was a lot lower.

I can't test this exact scenario myself but on W8.1 Preview when I had problems with right-click (in particular on the Start button)&nbsp;I used the Touch Magnifier.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to act as some kind of buffer between the actual Touch or pen action.&nbsp; Mouse generated
 right-click (wireless or Touchpad) always worked fine.&nbsp; I suppose there must be some diagnostic trace we could try activating but I don't know what it would be.&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I would start looking at&nbsp; Xperf...&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; RT.&nbsp; How do we do diagnostics on RT?&nbsp;&nbsp;
