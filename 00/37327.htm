<h2>            Does a Windows 7 Installer Cleanup Utility exist&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I want to clean up past attempts at installing Itunes before I reattempt.&nbsp; It appears that there is finally a 64bit version of Itunes available and I know previous attempts have probably left the software residue of my previous attempts, so I'd like to
 erase those files and try again.</p>
<p>The associated question "Downloading itunes for Windows 7 64 bit" leads to:</p>
<p>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7programs/thread/a26b8f76-83bb-4153-a1f5-769b18e1b0a1/</p>
<p>which does not work for Windows 7.</p>

How is that helpful? Don't be that person.<br />
<br />
Anyway, depending one where you bought the game from your answer may change. I assume it was a digital purchase through either steam or the Microsoft store? Id make sure you are properly logged into whichever service you purchased it under. Start with that
 and give as much detail on the result as possible if the problem persists.<br />
<br />
As to the reason for the 'hassle'. If a game could be freely copied and played, a developer would only ever sell one copy of the game before it was spread over the internet. The game development, servers upkeep, employees wages etc, are dependant on the sales
 of the game being fair. DRM (digital right management) is one of the most common practices to protect against piracy.

            Unfortunately you are not able to create Modern App shortcuts to the desktop, I understand it can be achieved by using a program 'Start8', plus a web search reveals registry hacks that are suppose to work.

<h2>            Windows 10 OEM Partitions</h2>
                    I have 2 OEM partitions on my windows 10, Disk 0. Both are small; one 350MB and the other 450MB (drive G). The later is within 10% of being full and I am constantly getting a system message making me aware of this space issue. Please can anyone tell me
 what these partitions are used for and if I need them? If they are required how do I increase or move drive G? thank you.

            Microsoft is aware that previously-hidden partitions are improperly being assigned drive letters after installing the April 2018 Update.  As a result, they now appear in Disk Management and File Explorer.  These partitions are typically recovery partitions used by the Windows Recovery Environment or by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  It is not recommended that you attempt to delete or reformat these partitions as this may have adverse effects on your ability to recover Windows.  Microsoft is currently working to address the issue in a future Windows Update, and we’ll update this thread when a solution becomes available. 
<br />
<br />(Update 5/14/18:  The solution that will soon be released via Windows Update will only prevent this issue from occurring for devices that install the April 2018 Update after the solution is released.  If you've already installed the April 2018 Update and are experiencing this issue, you'll need to follow the steps below if you want to hide these partitions.)
<br />
<br />Although you can safely ignore these partitions, if you prefer do away with the low disk space warnings and hide the partitions so they no longer appear in File Explorer, you can do so by manually removing the partition’s assigned drive letter.  To do this:
<br />
<br />1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator:  Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove.  For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “G”, note the volume number for Drive G.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter. 
<br />
<br /> select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4.   In the example above, if the volume number for drive G is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />

    <title>Microsoft sends back Xbox One X console unrepaired 5 times and demands - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> braxnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft sends back Xbox One X console unrepaired 5 times and demands 6th chance</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to share my story with you all how unfairly Microsoft its customers service have treated me. I have never experienced such arrogance, incompetent and bad support as this. In fact, when I think about it, I can hardly believe I have really experienced
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally purchased an Xbox One X (scorpio edition) at launch day. This device started to suffer from the 'loud jet engine noise' bug a couple of weeks later. When I was playing Xbox One X randomly (almost every few minutes) the console's its fans went
 crazy loud for a few seconds. Very annoying, so I send it in for repairs and got a replacement console back a few weeks later.
<strong>This became the first repair.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months later, at the day RDR2 released, I booted up my Xbox One X again to play RDR2. But instead of booting RDR2, I was shown a NO SIGNAL message. Only thing I could do was rebooting Xbox One X to get a signal back, but every time I booted RDR2 the
 NO SIGNAL message was displayed... I changed the HDMI cable multiple times, but nothing worked, I had to send it in for repairs again and received the console back a few weeks later.<strong> This became the second repair.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it turned out NOTHING was repaired at all. Exactly the same issue, still a NO SIGNAL directly after I tried to boot RDR2. I contacted Xbox Support Chat to complain and I was promised when I would send in the console for another repair they would
 make 100% sure this wouldn't happen again. I didn't need to worry and was promised a compensation for my trouble
<em>AFTER</em> I would have received back my FULLY succesfull repaired console. So I send in the Xbox One X console in for another repair and received it back a few weeks later.
<strong>This became the third repair.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I had received a replacement Xbox One X. I connected it to my tv (Philips 65pus8102/12) and booted RDR2 successfully. Finally I could start playing RDR2. Before starting playing I contacted Xbox Support Chat for the compensation I was promised.
 It turned out I wouldn't receive a compensation at all... only thing I received was an extension of Xbox Live Gold for the months I missed for what I was given the circumstances already legally eligible for. I felt pretty upset to be honest at that moment,
 I was promised a compensation for my trouble but Xbox Support Chat wouldn't say in advance what this compensation would be and now it turned out to be nothing at all.<em> Pretty misleading.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I continued to play RDR2 and after about half an hour to my big surprise my screen turned black and there it was again... NO SIGNAL. I was stunned, how was this possible? A few second later the NO SIGNAL message disappeared and I had signal again. However,
 this continued to happen randomly. Sometimes I could play for a few minutes, sometimes for an hour, but always a NO SIGNAL messages popped up every now and them. I found out it helped when I used a shorter HDMI cable, with a HDMI cable of just 20cm I didn't
 have NO SIGNAL messages anymore, the longer the HDMI cable was the more frequent the NO SIGNAL message popped up. I asked a friend to connect his Xbox One X to my TV to make sure it wasn't my TV or Receive that caused the NO SIGNAL, turned out his Xbox One
 X played perfectly all the time. So this Xbox One X was definitely faulty to.. so I went back to Xbox Support Chat to complain, received lots of excuses and send in my Xbox One X for repairs again to have it received back a few weeks later.
<strong>This became the fourth repair.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It turned out the Xbox One X got replaced again, I connected it to my TV and you won't believe what happened when I booted RDR2.... NO SIGNAL. I went absolutely crazy. Exactly the same problem as with the previous one, when I connected a HDMI cable of just
 20cm there wasn't a problem at all and the longer the HDMI cable got the more frequent the NO SIGNAL popped up. So I went back to Xbox Support Chat AGAIN.... same excuses, same apologies. I was promised again 100% sure this would't happen again, I was an exceptional
 case, never ever this happened before and I was asked to send it in for repairs again and got it back a few weeks later.
<strong>This became the fifth repair.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again it turned out to be a replacement, connected it to my TV and you won't believe it... NO SIGNAL. I really exploded at that moment. In less then 1 year I have send in my Xbox One X for repairs 5 times, of which 4 times in the last 4 months and all 4
 with the same NO SIGNAL bug. How on earth could this happen? After all these useless promises it wouldn't happen again it again happened. 4 Xbox One X consoles in a row that have the NO SIGNAL bug. It started to look like this repair cycle would never end.
 So I went back to the Xbox Support Chat and complained. Same reply from Xbox Chat Support, same excuses, same apologies and same promises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked to send my Xbox One X for the SIXTH time. I told them I would only agree if I was promised this would be the last repair, if the sixth one failed to I demanded to receive a full refund. Given the circumstances and after 4 failed repairs in a
 row I don't think that's an unfair condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still can't believe what happened after that. I started to get treated extremely unfairly, rude and ignored most of the times. I was promised replies that didn't follow, I was promised deadlines that weren't met, I was promised another compensation if
 I would cooperate with a sixth repair but again they wouldn't discuss in advance what this compensation would be (of course its obvious and was confirmed later to me this would be another few months of Xbox Live Gold for the time my Xbox One X was away for
 repairs, so again no compensation at all, again I was lied to by Xbox Support.) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
The most bizarre comment one of the Microsoft employer's made was the NO SIGNAL bug was definitely related to my modem/internet connection</span>. Even though I explained carefully it was a video signal, he was convinced I should change my modem in order to
 fix the issue. I demanded a conversation with his superior after that and his superior called me and to my big surprise his superior took it up for him, telling me his employer really did the best he could and was an excellent employer.
<em>The incompetence is stunning, the NO SIGNAL bug is a huge problem on Xbox One X, many people on different social media (even this forum from Microsoft) experience this bug and Microsoft has employers that seriously relate this video issue to a modem/internet
 connection related problem and superiors actually defend this. Microsoft should really be ashamed to have this low level of employers working at the customer service, it's no help at all, it's an insult to every customer that experience this issue!!</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In total I have contacted Microsoft more then 150 times on e-mail, chat and twitter only to be ignored. I now just send a reminder on twitter every day, only to continue to get ignored of course. Every e-mail I send, every tweet I tweeted, every chat I started,
 whatever I wrote I didn't receive a substantive reply. The only thing I received was a rude monoloog of the customer service what basically said I had to cooperate with a 6th repair with no consequences. If this 6th repair turned out to have failed to, I had
 to cooperate with a 7th repair, 8th repair, 9th repair and so on. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you believe the arrogance after having failed 4 times in a row to successfully repair my console they don't want to bind to a final last repair? And on top of that only sending me a monolog, not replying to my mails at all. Today Microsoft even had the
 arrogance to cancel the 6th repair order!<em> I truly feel insulted, this treatment is given the circumstance below every you would've expected.</em> I have already contacted a lawyer and we're preparing to go to court and I will make sure my story will get
 published in the newspapers as well and known to the world. How Microsoft is handling this really goes back to the time when customers didn't have rights by law at all, luckily I have the EU law at my side now to enforce my rights. People should be aware Xbox
 One X has an obvious bug in its design what causes the NO SIGNAL bug so many people experience and people should also be aware how badly Microsoft treats this problem.
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If you're one of the unlucky many with a faulty Xbox One X console, don't expect reasonable support at all and keep in mind you could be walking into an infinite amount of repairs and be prepared to be treated like
<strong>[Mod removed-profanity]</strong> by the customer service.</span></em>&nbsp;Especially one employer really treated me badly, the first employer of a company I really started to hate because of the arrogance. Normally I never get mad at employers of a company,
 after all they're only doing their job, but this one... I have all the e-mail conversations saved and if you would take a look at that you will most likely understand why this is an exceptional bad employer. When I purchase a premium product for a premium
 price I'd expect a premium customer service too and if Microsoft isn't able to fix my consoles in a reasonable amount of time I have every right to demand a full refund. After 4 unsuccessful repairs I would say I have given Microsoft more then reasonable chances
 to fix it, really looking forward to what the judge will say about this.</p>

            This is pretty shocking. On the Xbox Chat the employer I was just chatting with told me in his experience people sometimes have to send in the Xbox One X in for repairs
<strong>EIGHT</strong> times. This basically confirms Microsoft really has a huge problem and it's a flaw in the design.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab5d9a42-e791-44ea-8b68-c6b2906c55ad?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab5d9a42-e791-44ea-8b68-c6b2906c55ad?upload=true" /></a>

            Electronics can have issues, Sometimes multiple ones. You may have bought the unlucky one. Since yours is limited edition and can't be replaced that narrows things down as well. I'm sorry you've had a bad experience, This is not a common thing at all.
 You could request a free call back and speak to someone directly again if you think that would help.

            Did you try the console on anther television. Sounds like it could be part of the issue. its very unlikely that all consoles developed the same issue

<p>With all due respect, but you Ambassadors should really stop downplaying this issue in favor of Microsoft and look at it from the customers point of view. This is a huge issue and lots of customers experience the NO SIGNAL bug, trying to downplay the issue
 by trying to make it look like there's no issue at all by blaming other devices to be the cause of it instead of the Xbox One X is insulting. I have dealt with a few Microsoft Ambassadors on twitter too, all trying to downplay the issue.

            Hi Trevor -
<br />
<br />Click the Settings gear at the bottom of Inbox left hand panel.  Open Manage Accounts.  Do you see more than one listing for the Outlook account?  If so I would delete the one that is not associated with your Microsoft Account.  
<br />
<br />Can you click on both Outlook accounts to confirm they are identical?  
<br />
<br />Also in Manage Account you'll see Link Inboxes to check if a linked Mailbox is already set there to delete and recreate it.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

    <title>No sound through 3.5mm headphone jack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sirquss  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound through 3.5mm headphone jack</h2>
                    <p>I'm using an HP pavilion 17 laptop running windows 8.1</p>
<p>http://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-Pavilion-17-e100-Notebook-PC-series/5401229/model/6787970?ssf=144</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, after shutting down and restarting my computer I discovered the headphone jack to be working incorrectly, and by that I mean not at all. Sound continues to come through the onboard speakers regardless of whether I have a headset plugged in or not.
 This is a problem for me because I need my headset in order to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First things first I checked that it wasn't an issue with my headset by both testing the same headset on another device, and using a separate pair of headphones on the computer. The original headset still played sound through them when connected to the other
 device, and the second headset did not when connected to the computer, so the issue is not with my headsets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly I made sure to check that the device is enabled in the playback devices menu, it is and shows green bar variation when I play sounds, and the sounds successfully plays though through my onboard speakers. No sound comes through my headset whilst
 plugged in and clicking on test. No other devices are listed despite having hidden and disabled devices set to show.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/328b0f7f-ae79-471d-b516-d8ddcaf23a97" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Device Manager for any conflicts, and found none.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9c063b4-18af-48d6-8080-0b88daa129f9" /></p>
<p>I uninstalled the sound managers and devices, and restarted windows to load the generic windows sound codecs, and tried it again. No dice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I suspected a driver issue. I used device manager to check for updates, but find this to be unreliable so I checked myself on the HP website. I had an outdated driver, so I uninstalled the previous version and installed the most recent driver from HP's
 website I supplied above. At the time of posting this is</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
Realtek High-Definition (HD) Audio Driver</p>

</td>
<td>
6.0.1.7004</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>After that was installed, I restarted my computer and tested again. Still no sound in the headphones, but sound is coming out of the speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Realtek's website and downloaded and installed their most recent driver, which at the time of posting is Version R2.79. Restarted the computer and was still having the same issues. I uninstalled it, and reverted back to the driver from HP's website
 as I suspected one from the distributor to be more suitable than one from the manufacturer I randomly downloaded to try on a hunch. It is currently running HP's recommended driver.<br />
</p>
<p>I've also tried loading the into the computer's BIOS menu, and restoring defaults in there (Following advice I saw on another forum) to no effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might note that this only started after I installed the KB3079904 update upon shutting down the computer, but from what I've read about said update it was a major security update so I don't really want to uninstall it if I don't have to. Besides that,
 the issue should be unrelated to the security update as from what I've read it effected a text function, not a sound function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried going to restore points before I installed the update, and multiple days before the update/shutdown in question, but the issue is still present when the OS reloads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running the troubleshooter for audio playback, it finds nothing wrong and directs me to further reading in the windows help section in the hopes their generic topics will provide insight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ordered a USB sound card to hold me over until this issue can be resolved, but I'd be interested to know if anyone has any solutions for this. Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>No other changes other than the system update upon shutting down the computer on 25/07/2015. Everything before that point had been working perfectly, through the same port and with the same set of headphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No headphones are listed when I have disabled and disconnected devices, that screenshot included in my original post already has both of those ticked and they don't show up. They never have so far as I can remember. The "Speakers/HP" is the only thing that
 shows up both when I have a headset connected, and don't, and it is enabled and set as default, as shown in my included screenshot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(we do not often get them)</p>

</p><p>You have obviously done most of the basics and given that when you switched the problem stayed on the same computer it is not the headphones.&nbsp; Can we assume these headphones never needed a driver?</p>

            <p>Hello, and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, you're welcome! I'm a graduate Software Developer, so I understand the annoyance in receiving reports with "It's not working", or some other vague explanation. I did my best to look around and find what I could before making my post, and when I
 did, I tried to include all my steps of everything I tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, yes that's a correct assumption. They're plug and play, never needed anything installed for them to work in the past. It's only after the restart that installed the update that I've been having issues with the same pair of headphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might be a little off topic, but do you think force updating to Windows 10 will fix this? I'm not looking to update for another month or two (As this is my main study laptop and I don't want to risk losing it), but if it would fix this issue I'd consider
 it. My thinking being that a new OS would come with a set of new, probably working drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>SFC /scannow&nbsp;</em>just completed with this result. </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a038c334-f84e-4f40-806f-62fa6fb14571" /></p>
<p>Obviously some files are corrupt, but I was expecting this because of this</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b36c0e83-5964-4292-81ee-df1068fd55fc" /></p>
<p>I've made a post about this before, but it was auto-marked answered by a representative and was never actually resolved.&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1eOmJu6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>&nbsp;is the windows log file SFC /scannow generated. Does this mean
 I need to do a repair install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question regarding the DISM command, it says to replace the X in the suggested command with the drive in which the recovery ISO is saved; my laptop came with a recovery solid state partition built in -- containing a single recovery ISO file. Would I
 supply that, or do I need to download a Windows ISO and use that once it's mounted?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The SFC results were expected.&nbsp; As a first step you should run DISM to repair the corrupt data.&nbsp; I suspect that will fix most if not all.&nbsp; Only if you are prompted with the "cannot find source files" do you need to mount a win 8.1 image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu items can be repaired and I think your assumption that updating to win 10 might indeed fix the modern app issues.&nbsp; If it does not there are powershell commandlets that can repair/recover/re-install them</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gut feeling is there is something corrupt in registry preventing the hfones from working and if that is the case updating will probably fix it.</p>

            <p>Well fancy that! Good to see people still contributing to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the DISM command in an elevated command prompt instance, and it completed successfully. Reports back that it repaired the corrupted files. I tried the same pair of headphones again and the issue is still persistent. No sound through the headphones
 despite them being plugged in correctly, but sound still comes through the on board speakers just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, the DISM repair install also didn't fix the metro apps. Still showing their unlocalised names, and fails to open the window for more than a millisecond before minimising itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c17c3c2-770c-45d7-9da6-730d4a88d618" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps aren't such a big issue, I didn't use them a whole lot, but I do agree with your idea of a corrupt registry value(s) which could be causing the issue. Perhaps they contributed to the loss of headphone functionality in some way. Aside from a complete
 windows recovery install, I'm not sure I have a lot of options left, do I? And if I'm doing that, then I may as well upgrade to Windows 10 while I'm at it. Still, I would like to figure it out for people who possibly find this thread in the future and have
 the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your continued support, it's greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm considering it -- especially now the update has become available to my machine just moments before making this post. The fact that it's very new out has me hesitating, as well as some personal concerns about privacy/safety regarding the inability to
 disable auto-updates. I like to know what gets installed on my machine, and have the option to say no if I so wish. Will be looking into the pro version, probably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through your steps as you instructed, I ran the command within an elevated Powershell window, and it completed successfully. I then launched the windows store and tried to redownload the Mail, People and Calender app per your instructions and was
 presented with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6e93b73-eed4-4583-823b-2d004fb5d67d" /></p>
<p>I google'd the error code and found&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/910336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>&nbsp;help article. Followed the instructions for Windows 8.1, and the fix-it tool completed successfully reporting to have fixed
 the three issues it found.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/160fdbc9-799a-4feb-83f4-bd7d2ca4fc68" /></p>
<p>I relaunched the windows store to try again, optimistic that it was finally solved (Had the metro apps issue for many months now), but was presented with a new error code I can't find information on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78580622-7890-45f0-aea4-7c3379cc2d1d" /></p>
<p>It would seem my computer hates me! :P As you can see here it effects more than just those tiles I showed in the original screenshot, those were just the ones pinned to my start window at the time it broke. This is it now.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/538d114c-4470-4fcf-94fe-5152e6d32df5" /></p>

</p><p>You can see now why I'm seriously considering the upgrade</p>

            <p>Something is borked in the system.&nbsp; I do understand your concerns both about updates &amp; privacy.&nbsp; I think we are all exploring our options for changing/disabling the features that concern us.&nbsp; I have found several privacy concerns in the default settings
 and there are ways to disable/circumvent them all so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates can be deferred in win 10 Pro (up to 30 days)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you I would upgrade to qualify for the free update, then clean install.&nbsp; Once you have updated your activation is stored in the cloud so you can clean install and I think that the only way to get rid of all the niggling problems you now have is
 a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO (even in its current state) win 10 is far more stable than win 8.1 ever was.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rudolph,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We&nbsp;regret the inconvenience that you are experiencing.&nbsp;We will definitely assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate the steps you have performed. Since those steps did not work let’s try other troubleshooting methods and check if it helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods provided.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to check if Virtual Disk and Volume Shadow copy are working on the desktop background. Follow the below step:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and type <strong>
services.msc</strong> and hit<strong> enter</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now locate for <strong>Virtual Disk</strong> and <strong>
Volume Shadow copy</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the program are not running right click on the program and click on
<strong>start</strong> to run it.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the above method does not fix the issue try the below method provided.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I&nbsp;recommend you to run check disk on the hard drive to see if there are any corruptions.&nbsp;<br />
Follow the below steps:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Windows</span></strong><span>&nbsp;key +&nbsp;</span><strong><span>X</span></strong><span>, click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin).</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong><span>, type the following command, and then press&nbsp;</span><strong><span>ENTER</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><strong><span>chkdsk /f</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: While performing check disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found then check disk will try to repair that sector. Any data available on a bad sector might be lost.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Once Check Disk completes, boot the computer and then check.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This is really important. I lost a database file and when I recover it through shadow copy (ShadowExplorer) it's corrupted, even when recovering from date when everything was OK and working. So I'm hoping it would recover properly that file when I do system
 restore..</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW is it possible for shadow copy to compress a file who has no extension ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The particular file was without any extension, but I didn't find 'compress' option checked in that file and parent folder (google chrome folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's strange that every shadow copy version restores corrupted sqlite 3 database file.. The most oldest shadow copy I have is from Nov. 25th, and then everything was OK, but when I'm recovering it now - it's corrupted. I also checked it with Recuva and it
 showed that there were no overwritten clusters or anything like that.</p>

                    Will the new Microsoft Flight Simulator be on the Xbox 1 or is it a Xbox 2 exclusive. Also, Do I need any other tools to play that game like a yoke or something like that, or can I just use my controller? Thanks.

            yes, it will work with the xbox one and you can just use your controller to play it.

<p>From what I understand it will be launched on the Xbox One and yes, you will be able to use your controller. I think they will also probably launch a special yoke/joystick to enhance the gameplay.</p>

<p>I really hope to see a yoke, flying games with thunbsticks is difficult for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they don't release some kind of flightstick I will invest in the adaptive controller and a thrustmaster.</p>

<p>Monitors can support resolutions that are lower than their native resolutions, but text won't look as sharp and the display might be small, centered on the screen, edged with black, or stretched. It is recommended to set the screen resolution of the display
 to the <strong>(Recommended)</strong> native resolution to get the best display on your monitor. Your screen resolution needs to be at least
<strong>1024x768</strong> to have multiple windows and apps on your screen at the same time.</p>

<p>It's words...nothing more.</p>
<p>[/quote]Maybe.&nbsp; I wonder though.&nbsp; Good competition brings out the best in good people and helps everyone, including the companies.&nbsp; I would hope that all the companies sincerely wish the others the best because they will try to beat them by being better
 themselves.&nbsp; I understand they each want to be the market leader, but that doesnt mean they cant truly appreciate each others work.&nbsp; #ImSoNaive</p>

<p>They're both making tons of money, why would each company fight each other. Yes they're competition, and technically they're still competing against each other, but competing doesn't have to be a fight. I'm happy to see they're respecting each other, they're
 all in the same business afterall. </p>

<p>For the most part, yes it is imo.&nbsp; The companies are obviously in competition with each other but they don't hold the same resentment towards each other as "fans" do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Heck, a lot of people in the industry jump around from different jobs on both sides of the fence.&nbsp; Trim away all the fat and we're just gamers who like to game.&nbsp; I'm a MS MVP awardee for Xbox and a common misconception is that I must've had to sacrifice a Playstation Fanboy on the Altar of MS but in reality, I play games on a lot of systems and on PC and happen to enjoy it.&nbsp; (like NES Remix on Wii U)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Competition is good because it drives both companies to do more to make us happy gamers, but we don't have to waste energy fighting about it.</p>

<h3> tincanguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            WLM will not open because i get a &#34;Your account is locked because of too many attempts to sign in with an incorrect email address or password&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to open WLM for Hotmail on my Windows 8.1 computer&nbsp;because of&nbsp;"too many tries with the wrong email or password".&nbsp; However, when I select "cancel", WLM opens as an agent for my Yahoo mail and Comcast mail but will not work for my Hotmail even
 though I have added Hotmail to my list of active accounts in WLM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have Outlook.com active as a stand alone email client and it works just fine for Hotmail. The fact that&nbsp;Outlook.com works for Hotmail tells me that my Microsoft account is activated which should also&nbsp;be the case with WLM since it uses my Microsoft
 account and password to open -- but it doesn't!&nbsp; I have tried all of the proposed "fixes" by Microsoft - changing passwords, etc.&nbsp; None have worked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have Windows 10 on the same computer, but on&nbsp;a separate SSD, and WLM works fine as does Windows 10 mail, Outlook.com, Comcast, and Yahoo mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, some one tell me how I can get rid of the "locked out" status of&nbsp;WLM on my Windows 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, I still do not have a solution to my problem.&nbsp; Please read my original post carefully.&nbsp; Note that if I click on "cancel" when trying to open WLM as the host for Hotmail, Comcast mail and Yahoo mail, it displays Comcast and Yahoo mails just fine&nbsp;but will
 not open for Hotmail as it gives me the "too many tries with wrong password" message.&nbsp; Note also that I have Outlook.com as a stand alone client and it works just fine for Hotmail.&nbsp; You might say what's the big problem, you can receive all 3 of your email
 clients.&nbsp; The problem is that in the past, I have been able to receive and display&nbsp;Hotmail, Comcast and Yahoo emails all on Windows Live Mail which I cannot now do.&nbsp; Please, someone -- anyone, &nbsp;help me regain this capability!</p>

<p>Do you have a spare Microsoft Account? If not, create one using the <em>Sign up</em> link at

<p>
</p><p>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options, and on the <em>
Connection</em> tab click <em>Stop signing in</em>. Dismiss the warning and close the Options dialogue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click on the Hotmail account name in the folder pane and select Properties. On the Server tab, deselect
<em>Remember password</em> and make sure the password box is empty.&nbsp;Close down Windows Live Mail and wait a few minutes while the program stores the new settings.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; Still couldn't get rid of the "locked out" message except by going to "options&gt;stop signing in".&nbsp; When I tried to sign in at the top right of the page using an alternate MS account (Comcast.net), it still would not open Hotmail
 in WLM.&nbsp; Also, with "stop signing in" selected,&nbsp; my Comcast and Yahoo mail clients which are hosted on WLM (even though Hotmail will not open) now have lost their "Contacts" lists.&nbsp; Unless you have some additional suggestions, I am about to give up on WLM
 and just use Comcast and Yahoo mail via their individual opening pages and use Outlook.com with its stand alone opening page.&nbsp; As the King would say, "It's a puzzlement".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, it galls me that I can't get WLM to work with Windows 8.1 as it has in the past, and as it does on my Windows 10 alternate SSD.</p>

<p>What happens?&nbsp;An error message you see when you try to synchronize your Hotmail account will give us clues to what's wrong. Did you perhaps enable two-step verification for the Hotmail account when you changed the password?</p>

<p>That's what signing in does. The contacts list is the one belonging to the Microsoft Account you sign in with, and available at
<a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contacts.live.com</a> when you sign in there with the same account.&nbsp;Signing in has nothing to do with sending and receiving mail.</p>

            Hi john,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for reaching out and posting your issue to us.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the issue description I understand that you are not able to open the GoPro Studio on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the exact version of the GoPro Studio software?</div>
<div>2. Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to check if the software is compatible with Windows 8.1</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            I'm scanning from my HP printer to my email address and that address is longer functional. I need to change the address to one that is. I believe it's an HP issue not a Microsoft one. Do you agree?

<p>
</p><p>Dear Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just deleted the email account that I have been using for the last 5-1/2 weeks. this is a brand new computer, with win 10 apps. I was using the supplied outlook product, and I was trying to get my company email (<em>***email address is removed for privacy***</em>)
 to come up in the outlook and the outlook app on my cell phone and I had installed another gmail based account on the computer earlier. I thought that was account that was being deleted from the machine. Is it possible to recover the WHOLE account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
