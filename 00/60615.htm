<p>So I let it sit there While Halo 3 Downloaded to my xbox But when it got to 100% it said "Can't Download Halo 3"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its not in my Game&nbsp;Library And if i go to my Memory It says "Corrupted File"&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i Downloaded it again and it still says "Corrupted File"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Downloaded 3 times Already. :|&nbsp;</p>
<p>So How do i Get it To Download so i Can Play it!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Help :(</p>

<p>The download might be Region Locked. However I know next to nothing about how the xbox rules concern regions so don't quote me on anything. My best guess is since it was bought in the States, the license for the game is for the United States. So im pretty
 sure now to be able to play it you would have to download it while in the States(or on a US version xbox if yours is not). That is my best guess, but like I said, I'm not well versed in Region issues.</p>

 and they never came back to me :) i guess ill just nag them since i got 4k MS-points on there :)</p>
<p>and couple of months of gold, i wont wait a whole year to change to South Africa :)</p>

<h2>            Tracking stolen lap top</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>My lap top was stolen in a burglary last week. It has the 'find your device' on it but so far it's still only registering the last time I used it at home. Is it possible for the 'find my device' to be removed if the people who stole it wipe the lap top clean
 - or will the tracking device remain regardless of what they do to try to clean the laptop for re-sale?</p>
<p>Any hep appreciated - absolutely gutted it's been stolen and hoping I may recover it at some point.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            Hi Sarah
<br />
<br />I'm afraid there is not much we can do and the Find my Device feature is dependent on Wi-Fi. So, unless that computer is started up and connects to an open Wi-Fi network, there is not much to be done.
<br />
<br />Your best course of action is to report it to the police. Keep in mind, criminals usually format the drive when the steal a laptop and it will often scrap it for parts.

            Thanks - already reported to police - just gutted about losing laptop and expensive software on it I need for my work. If they scrap it for parts, will the things I kept on desktop be removed?

            There is always the potential they could use sophisticated tools to hack it and steal passwords and data. 
<br />
<br />I recommend at least letting your bank know, change any passwords, enable two factor authentication on your Microsoft Account:

<br />Let friends and family know on social media, they should not accept any request begging for money or disclose sensitive information, since someone might be pretending to be you.

            Hi Sarah, I am sorry this has happened to you.
<br />
<br />The Find My Device option will only work if the thieves put that laptop on the Internet, if they do, it will appear on that web page
<br />
<br />Sadly though, if they just wipe that for resale, then the Find My Device will not function, it will also be wiped . . .
<br />
<br />The best you can hope for is for them to connect to the Internet, then form that page, immediately choose the 'Lock My Device' function, which will keep your data safe
<br />
<br />The reality is, those thieves generally wipe a stolen laptop so they can then sell it on, so they generally have no interest in your data.

<h2>            After Update KB2919355 Tablet does not reboot or shutdown when connected to AC adaptor</h2>
                    <p>Dear all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I updated my Tablet (Gigabyte S1082, OS: Windows 8.1 pro) with KB2919355.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the successful update (also sfc did not find any problem) the Tablet does not reboot or shutdown, when it is
<del>docked in the (original!) docking station</del> connected to AC adaptor. Even if I remove all USB connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs that way: the tablet is supposed to be down ... but it does not switch off or - if reboot - does not start new (hangs before BIOS Screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out that it works, when the AC adaptor is not plugged <del>into the docking station</del> ... or even&nbsp;if removed while above situation. Then it works. But that unplug and plug again cannot be the solution for ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has been changed with the Update, or how can that be solved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and kind regards</p>
<p>Thorsten</p>

            <p>Dear Mahesch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the machine there is already the latest BIOS (I flashed it by myself). I am relative professional in PC Hardware and Software. But for this Problem I have not really an idea about the final cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate, if I could receive (technical) Information from Microsoft&nbsp;on how the update could have made the change, because I would like to send a request to Gigabyte. Maybe they could help to solve with creating a new BIOS (I do not think they have
 reacted yet, cause the Windows update is not that long available).</p>

<p>
</p><p>That is a very <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hard</span> work ... for a it will help
<p>
</p><p>And what will be if it does not help? The description of the update tells it is necessary to get further updates in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know, that the whole unit has cost over 1500 USD? And now it do not know if there is a solution, but get advise to put hours of work in it without knowing if it helps.</p>

<p>Since the update, the Windows is shutting down normally until the docking (no, better say both..tablet+docking..but because the tablet, when not in the docking is switching off without problems, I wrote the docking) should be switched off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technically, I think the Operating System is waiting for a signal, that any component has been shut down, and then it is giving the Power Off command or signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there are two possibilities:</p>
<p>1. The OS does not read or translate all the signals correct anymore or is waiting for a signal, that is not available</p>
<p>2. The OS does not give the correct or not the complete command for shutdown to all (in my case the docking)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both variants do not make me sure, if a reinstall is really helpful (as I am advised then to update again!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would expect a help or support, if there are (and if yes, where to find .. for example registry keys) the settings for above power control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In between, I will try to find out, if some of the components of the docking could be switched off (or disconnected .. I am not sure about the LAN and DVD), to find out - if possible - with which component the OS is not 'speaking'.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I tried now a clean install (took quiet some time!) ... but it did not help!!!!! &nbsp;[Dear users with same problem: save your time]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even on a clean system - only the chipset drivers and MS updates - the problem returns after the mentioned Update&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB2919355.</span></p>

<p>Actually, I cannot recommend doing this update. I highly request you - Microsoft - to check this update. I am now pretty sure that many Laptop / Tablet owners will have this problem, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is very unsatisfying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking of telling this to as many computer magazines as I can, if there is not a quick re-check and as soon as possible solution.</p>

</p><p>Ouch.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had seen this thread earlier because it reminds me of what happened to me a while ago on my Surface RT.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm copying a previous comment because the thread it comes from is too unwieldy&nbsp;to provide a helpful citation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I had been working with an update impending and stupidly ignored it.&nbsp; So, a bit too late I came back to my machine and found it powered off and unstartable.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get it working again I had to unplug my powered USB Hub and&nbsp;then plug in
 just my USB wireless receiver for my mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Then I had to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;why my USB hub had suddenly become a problem.&nbsp; Every time I plugged it back in W8.1 RT&nbsp;rejected it.&nbsp; Not even disconnecting the power and waiting a while to try to reset it
 made it acceptable.&nbsp; Then (elsewhere) I found tips about removing the USB hubs and USB controllers in Device Manager.&nbsp; I removed them all and then powered everything off to reset and powered it back up but without the USB hub.&nbsp; I had read the suggestion that
 it might be better to let the OS discover the "new" hardware when it was running, not at boot time.&nbsp; Then I replugged the way that it had been working and everything was finally back to normal.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; (But I was cursing updates all the while I was researching
 and testing this "solution".&nbsp; WTH happened?)</p>

            <p>Dear Robert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in my case there is nothing connected to the Tablet than the AC adaptor. (except all the onboard/integrated components ... which I cannot remove).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to excuse me for my first impressions, where I guessed it is only in Docking Station. That is why I wrote later on : "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">One (maybe for you, Mahesh important) additional information. The problem occurs
 at my Tablet, too, if I connect the AC adaptor directly to the Tablet"</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Like I wrote, I installed it twice! The first time I installed it from clean, too,&nbsp; and I allowed KB2919355. After this I have the Problem, that the Tablet is shutting down but does not power off (and also restart hangs before new BIOS run). Only the AC
 adaptor is connected. But when I remove the AC adaptor, shutdown and reboot is OK. ...ok, but that is not a solution for me.</p>
<p>

<p>Ok.&nbsp; I was just thinking that you might see something similar in Device Manager and be able to adjust accordingly.</p>

            Bit weird if the same driver was working without that message before the last patch round, though I don't know if it prevents me from accessing the internet, cause it uses another network adapter for that. My pc is custom built btw, so no make/model.

            <p>The message is irritating me no end. The Sony Vaio laptop still has something working the Broadcom card, but generates these messages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver is up to date or insists it is anyway, I found it and tried to update it. The problem only started in the latest round of Microsoft updates to Windows 10 - working perfectly beforehand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't help thinking it's related to the previous round of updates where the same laptop insisted it was in aeroplane mode when it wasn't. That was fixed by addressing the internet settings direct from the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with that one, the first reply from MS assumed you hadn't got the latest driver... I had and I bet most folk with the problem did too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bookmarked this page but I won't hold my breath.</p>

    <title>GTAV purchase not completing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> littlebigbro  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTAV purchase not completing</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;originally purchased the GTAV bundle with the Whale Shark Cash Card and it wouldn't download. After contacting support I was told that it was a licensing issue so the title was refunded and I&nbsp;was told to repurchase it after 24 hours.&nbsp; I&nbsp;then spent around 7 hours chatting with customer service to determine that it wasn't a licensing issue, but a hardware issue with my Xbox One (now in for repair).&nbsp; Since the bundle I&nbsp;tried to get was on sale I decided to go ahead a repurchase it after the 24 hours were up so that I&nbsp;could play it when I&nbsp;get my xbox back.&nbsp; I was unable to purchase thru my xbox or the app on my iPhone and was told to contact support.&nbsp; The promotion ended before I&nbsp;had a chance to do that so that now the price has increased from $44 to $99 and their advice was basically to post to the forums and hope for better advice.&nbsp; Anyone got anything?</p>

<h3> allanboyd01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password required to login when starting Windows</h2>
                    <p>Have a new HP computer with Windows 7 Home Premium and for the first week the computer opened up without asking for a password, straight to the "Desktop"screen.</p>
<p>Now it asks for a login, which I have and it opens up as before in the "Desktop"screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: (1) Why has this happened, I can not recall changing anything. (2) how can I go back to the way it was originally.</p>

            Hi Snickersnee <br />
<br />
Yes, for some unknown reason the Office installer does not create shortcuts to the applications . . .
<br />
<br />
Open any Office Application <br />
<br />
Open Task Manager <br />
<br />
On the processes Tab find that Office App, right click it and choose Open File Location
<br />
<br />
In the resulting File Explorer window, right click each Office Application and choose 'Send To' - Desktop (create Shortcut)

<p>Many thanks, BulldogXX, </p>
<p>Exactly what I needed!!</p>
<p>I am a computer Luddite, so when my hard drive failed a month ago, and I had to recreate everything with a new computer, I found myself confronted with Windows 10 instead of the familiar Windows 7, I was flummoxed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference in your instruction was that I had to go into c://Program Files", not "c://Program files(x86)"&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sure what the difference is, but the X86 file only had something called Microsoft.net in it, while the "Program files" folder had the
 full suite of Microsoft programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated!</p>

    <title>Windows10 failed to migrate &#40;or keep&#41; my old login account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kdxpert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows10 failed to migrate &#40;or keep&#41; my old login account settings, after having upgraded it manually to the newest anniversary version &#40;1607&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Everything worked correct previously (after my first upgrade from Windows 8.1 Home to Windows 10 Home).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having upgraded manually to the newest anniversary version (1607) on August 2, I however&nbsp;observed 1 critical&nbsp;error, namely that my upgrade work created a "login account info" corruption (perhaps at the registry level or perhaps just at the "user folder"
 level on my harddrive). The mess might have been created, because I chose to upgrade manually through the "windows installation media creation tool" - in combination with going down the route of attempting to upgrade directly from my harddrive (rather than
 from ISO-file on an USB flash drive; which most people I spoke to tend to recommend instead). However, now when I have created and discovered this "account bug", how can it be solved ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do not want to solve the problem by rolling everything back at my Computer to its previous state (i.e.&nbsp;by using the&nbsp;option in the settings menu to "Return to the previous build" or "Reset"). Instead I hope someone here in the community, now&nbsp;can
 help me how we can solve this bug (either by using auto correct tools, or doing it manually somehow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Here you have a detailed description of my&nbsp;"account confusion bug":</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>My lock screen (after windows has started a login session), work correct without any bugs (namely only giving me one option: to login by my one and only Administrator account - with picture and account info being correct). I only have 1 administrator account
 installed at my computer (being my Microsoft account).&nbsp;The PC bootup setting (chosen at: Windows+R&gt;<span>netplwiz</span>), is to automatically boot me up by my administrator account, without asking me each time to type in the administrator password.
 This worked perfect for me in Windows10, as the&nbsp;PC automatically logged me in while showing my Microsoft account name+email beneath my Microsoft account picture. After the upgrade, it&nbsp;still automatically logged me in, but now&nbsp;it only did so,&nbsp;while displaying
 a grey circle (instead of my Microsoft account picture) - with the account name now being a new&nbsp;invisible "shadow user-account" (only showing&nbsp;a copy of the correct account name - without showing my Microsoft account email beneath).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Result of my first attempt to solve the bug:</strong></p>
<p>My first attempt to solve the above bug, was (inside the&nbsp;settings menu) to convert my "Administrator login by Microsoft Account" to now being an "administrator login by a local standard&nbsp;account". Then I renamed my Microsoft Account to a slightly different
 account name at Microsofts webside (while I kept the attached email and password to be the same), followed by a visit into the same "light settings menu" (inside upgrade &amp; security), where I chose to reconvert my administrator login from the working local
 account to again being my Microsoft Account (now slightly renamed). This however did not solve anything. When rebooting my system, Windows10 now still attempts automatically to boot me into the old non-existing "shadow account" (meaning that I still see a
 grey circle, and now the automatic login fails, because it attempts to login by my previous Microsoft account name - and not the new slightly renamed Microsoft account name". To be exact Windows aborts the attempt automatically to login by prompting the message:
 "There is an error in your username/password. Please try again". When clicking OK, the&nbsp;boot login screen claim I have two accounts: 1)&nbsp;My Microsoft account (which is the correct one), and 2) my old non-existing local user account (automatically being chosen
 by Windows in its automatic bootup process - and now still automatically attempting to log me in by&nbsp;my old user name existing before I renamed my account). Funny enough, If I type in the correct new username at the second login option (with greyish picture)
 accompanied by the valid password; windows correctly logs me into its operating system (just as well as if I instead selected to login by the nr.1 login option; which now by the way automatically also display the correct&nbsp;Microsoft Account name+email+picture).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A possible solution for the account confusion bug:</strong></p>
<p>I believe the trick that can solve my "account confusion bug", is to somehow get rid of the incorrect non-existing shadow account (which Windows by error always automatically attempts to login to,&nbsp;upon its first boot). As mentioned previously, the "lock
 screen" works perfect without any flaws - after my first boot into Windows (only displaying I have 1 administrator account; represented by my correct Microsoft Account name+email+picture). When I visit the path:
<em>"Control panel\user accounts\user accounts\Administrating accounts", </em>my PC also confirm I only have this 1 account activated in my system. When visiting my "File explorer" under the folder
<em>"This PC\(C:)\Users"</em>, it however might explain why I now have this boot-up problem. The name of my active user folder&nbsp;displayed here (on the harddrive) is still my "old user name" (before I renamed it) - while it strangely only was the "user folder
 icon" placed at my desktop being renamed to the correct renamed account name (while hitting the correctly named icon&nbsp;opens the file explorer content of the incorrectly named
<em>C:\Users\"old account name"</em>). Inside the folder <em>"This PC\(C:)\Users"</em>, I can also see a completely&nbsp;empty user account folder named "default.migrated" (containing 0 files an 0KB). This piece of visible migration trace, however does not bother
 me, as long as its existence&nbsp;does not create any bugs for me (so I will leave it as it is).
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But how do I now continue from here, in order to fix my confused account information bug?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>PS: When I visit the "Computer administration" tool, the logfile of the "Microsoft Windows User Profile Service", indeed confirm my visual observation described above, by showing me these 3 lines of info recorded during its boot-up attempt:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Logontype: Regular</em></li><li><em>Address of local profile: C:\users\"old account name"</em></li><li><em>Profile type: Regular</em></li></ul>
<em>
<p>PPS: Just to be save I also ran the following commands as administrator in the commando prompt window:</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;sfc /scannow&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3. DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Checkhealth<br />
&nbsp; 4. DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p>
<p>None of the above commands found/solved any bugs, which I guess also indicate my problem is isolated only to be&nbsp;about "account info confusion"?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have tried to resolve the issue. <span>
I suggest you to boot the Desktop system in <strong>Clean Boot </strong></span><span>and check if the problem exists.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></p>

</p><p><span><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks. But my problem was 100% identical, in the "Clean boot" mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my "scanner problem" (device not able to be removed), I have&nbsp;deleted it as something to look into in&nbsp;this thread, as I solved the problem myself.&nbsp;It was a typical HP printer+scanner driver issue, where an old scanner driver sometimes continue to exist
 on the computer - despite having removed it as an installed printer device (which is supposed to automatically remove it also as an active&nbsp;scanner; but often the HP removal software just fails to do it). This problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;was however easily solved when I visited "device management", where I selected it to display "hidden devices", then making me able to see it - and remove it effectively here. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my <em>account confusion bug</em>, I am ready to troubleshoot&nbsp;more (and hopefully fix it) - upon&nbsp;further guidance!&nbsp;:-)</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span>I now have no more time to wait for good advice/guidance, and will kick on with my on attempt to fix my "confused account". My own instinct tells me, the bug can be fixed plain and simply by creating a new local 2nd administrator account with a new
 username. Afterwards I will simply safe boot the computer to login with the computers hidden system account, and manually copy past all my files (incl. all hidden system files, except for: ntuser.dat, ntuser.dat.log, ntuser.ini) from the "old corrupted account"
 to my new "fresh perfect account". Afterwards I can logon with that, and delete the last traces of the "old corrupted account".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>I will post you the result of this above bug fix attempt, as soon as I done it. :-)</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>For your information, I have no less than 2 versions of my ntuser.dat.log file floating around in my user folder:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>ntuser.dat.LOG1</span><em><span>(changed 02-08-2016 23:48)</span></em></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Along with 4 versions of my NTUSER.DAT file:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>NTUSER.DAT </span><em><span>(changed 09-08-2016 17:14)</span></em></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>NTUSER.DAT{1bef7b8b-5902-11e6-9a6a-c95ba6d23b49}.TM.blf
<em>(changed 04-08-2016 00:01)</em></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>NTUSER.DAT{1bef7b8b-5902-11e6-9a6a-c95ba6d23b49}.TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms
<em>(changed 04-08-2016 00:01)</em></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>NTUSER.DAT{1bef7b8b-5902-11e6-9a6a-c95ba6d23b49}.TMContainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms
<em>(changed 02-08-2016 23:48)</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suspect the multiple version of these files, perhaps could be related to my experienced bug. Anyway, I know the trick to create fresh ntuser files by creating a new account, and utilizing the above described copypaste procedure for the old account
 files, was Microsofts recommended bugfix guide on how you could solve "corrupted user accounts" in Windows 7. So now I just take my chance, that it will also work in Windows 10 Anniversary.
</span><span>I will soon let you all know. :-)</span></p>

<h2>            New Task View - View windows side by side</h2>
                    In a recent update Microsoft changed the task view. In tablet mode it seems you cannot swipe applications to dock them to the side of the screen and allow side by side view?? Is there a way to re-enable that feature? I almost always am using two apps at

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
There are several ways to snap active applications to your desktop. You can do so with Snap Assist, you just need to drag the title bar of an active window application to the side, and Snap Assist will display a thumbnail view of other active applications that
 can fill the empty space next to your active application. I was able to emulate these on systems running the latest 1803 update in tablet mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you still have issues, I recommend that you check your multi-tasking settings by type in
<strong>Multitasking</strong> in the Cortana search bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Make sure the appropriate options are set to
<strong>On</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

                    <p>The program (Bible Library 7)&nbsp; worked on this PC when I first installed it.&nbsp; After some updates were installed on it around 5/18/12 it has not been working. I have uninstalled it at least 3 times now and it will not work, it says application incompatible.&nbsp;
 Another thing I did was select the run as adminisrator button I believe I made it worst. I don't no how to unselect or undo&nbsp;that. It is selecting
<u>XP 2 pack</u>, it does not work. I don't see<strong> Window 7</strong> in the compatlble list.</p>

<p>It's from a file-share site that's worked ok for months till now. I think the problem might be with my save as or library settings but I've checked that my music library is optimised for music.</p>

            <p>Right - I have tried that link and the site was very slow to load up (and not recognized by my Secure Search as 'safe' - nor was it marked as dangerous I hasten to add) and when I clicked on track links they weren't working at all so it may be an issue with
 the site rather than your computer...Try doing something from this site (which is shown as secure and working ok for me) and see what you get.</p>
<p>http://www.mp3raid.biz/</p>
<p>NB I was asked to download a Media Player 12 update - I wouldn't do that until Windows Update suggests it, but it could be a reason why things aren't working properly.</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on - or mark as answered if you think this is the solution.</p>

    <title>No drivers for Sony Camcorder HVR-A1U - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael_n_meyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            No drivers for Sony Camcorder HVR-A1U</h2>
                    &nbsp; My Sony HVR-A1J high definition camcorder does not work on Win7100 RC 32 bit, and I've been unable to find any compatible drivers.<br />
Will any drivers be available for my camera for Windows 7 in the near future? I edit video professionally, this is a feature that can not be missing.&nbsp; Are there any other drivers that might be compatible?&nbsp; Does anyone else have a similar camera that works on
 their Windows 7 system?&nbsp; The camere shoots DV or HDV to mini-DV tape in MPEG2 format. Input is Firewire 1394.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

            Hey Mike,<br />
<br />
I would have thought that the camcorder would have alerted Windows 7 to install it's drivers for the 1394.&nbsp; Have you checked in BIOS whether the 1394 device is enabled?&nbsp;&nbsp; If the 1394 is not in BIOS, or, enabled,&nbsp;then you cannot use that 1394.&nbsp; Do you have a
 USB connection cable?&nbsp; It might not be as nice as the 1394 but it will get you there.<br />
<br />
Finally, did your camcorder come with an installtion disk that might have the right driver files?<br />

            Hello Billion,<br />
<br />
I downloaded the game directly from the MS Store. It worked very well for months. I changed nothing on the machine. The other day, I clicked on the game and the opening screen came up briefly, then it went back to the desktop.
<br />
<br />
I tried both of your ideas shown below. No updates were available. It looks like this game was updated last month on the 18th.
<br />
<br />
The Troubleshooter showed no problems. <br />
<br />
Do you have any other suggestions? Where would this game appear in the Registry? I can't seem to find it.
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Jim

<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you reset the Windows app store and check if this helps.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you the issue still persist, I recommend you to boot the system in clean boot state and check if the issue still persist.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The issue that you’ve encountered regarding the zip file on your Windows 10 device may be caused by the application that you’re using to compress it. To sort out your concern, we’d like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the troubleshooting steps you've done so far?</li><li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>If there's an error message, can you provide us a screenshot?</li><li>Which app did you use to compress your files?</li></ul>
<p><br />
We’re looking forward to your response.<br />

<p>Hi Joseph,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I did not do any troubleshooting (I am not very tech-savvy...)</p>
<p>What happened is that I did not like 7zip and uninstall it to go back to default. Since I was not able to open any zip files at all, I reinstalled 7zip and now the files have this awkward look (fpls see the screenshot). I tried to change in Properties (according
 to advices in the Forums, but it only got worse...)</p>

<p>Prior to this, Windows has automatically installed the updates.</p>

<p>And if your version of win7 is 64bit and the program was written for 16bit then it wont work.</p>

            <p>You must tell&nbsp;us the *name* of the game. Some games of this era were using Windows (98) only as starter for a pure DOS process, others were using built-in graphical features of Windows (Win32). As Palcouk said, the bitness (16- or 32-bit) is also to consider,
 16-bit games will only run on a 64-bit system in a sandbox where all hardware/software functions are emulated (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.dosbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dosbox.com</a>). There are even community patches or game-specific emulators for games which still enjoy interest among their fans (e.g., Exult for Ultima VII), allowing to play the old games on a modern computer.</p>
<p>As a last thing - as long as we don't go into details depending on the game in mention -, don't forget that the OS and its restrictions/features aren't the only thing to be thought of. The "replay" of some old games ("productivity" software is much less
 picky) is confronted with massive hardware changes, too. Too much RAM or too powerful CPUs may cause an old game to go nuts, if the game publisher - or you - didn't adjust some parameters to today's standards.</p>
<p>That said, don't be pessimistic. For nearly every problem in this area, there is a known and proven workaround. If you keep in mind that things possibly won't be so easy like inserting a CD/DVD, installing and playing, your chances to get even the most exotic
 game to run on Windows 7 aren't bad. It may need knowledge and preparation, that's it.</p>

            There are many "Boggle collections" available. Most are advertised as working with "Windows 7: XP compatibility mode". This sounds reasonable as all those games were made for XP.
