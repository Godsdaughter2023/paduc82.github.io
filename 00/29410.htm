<h2>            PHOTO SCREENSAVER MINIMIZES MY OPENED WINDOWS</h2>
                    Hi friends.&nbsp; My photo screen saver works fine but when I return from it, I found it has minimized my maximized windows.&nbsp; It does not minimize to the task bar, just reduces them to a smaller size.&nbsp; I have to maximize them each time it returns from the screen
 saver.&nbsp; This is a hassle.&nbsp; Does anybody knows how to solve this situation??<br />
<br />
Thanks!!

            ANGEL OCASIO,<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
I assume your photo screen saver is photos you took and downloaded from your camera.&nbsp; What resolution are those pictures in?&nbsp; How much does it reduce the window sizes?&nbsp; How many windows do you typically have open when this happens?&nbsp; What kind of computer do
 you have - desktop or laptop, how much RAM, what processor, what kind of video card?&nbsp; What version of Vista do you have?&nbsp; Is the screensaver set to fit to screen size?&nbsp; What type and size monitor do you have - LCD or CRT and size in inches?<br />
<br />
This information will help us better assist you as it is not clear at this point what is causing this issue.<br />
Thanks,<br />

            HI Gloria.&nbsp; No, they are not photos from my camera, they are photos downloaded from the internet.&nbsp; More specifically, they are celebrities wallpapers, so they are big.&nbsp; They fluctuate&nbsp; a lot in sizes, from 34 kbs and 3736 kbs.&nbsp; Resolutions are very variable
 as you surely know.&nbsp; I have a 17"w&nbsp; x&nbsp; 11"h&nbsp; [viewable screen size] Lenovo Thinkvision flat LCD monitor, Standard PnP, the machine is new, less than a year.&nbsp; When returning from the screen saver, all opened active windows are reduced to a 11-1/2"w&nbsp; x&nbsp; 7-1/2"h
 [measure on the screen].&nbsp; Usually, I have 3 active windows opened and all of them are minimized to the same measure.&nbsp; Then I pass my cursor over the maximize button. right to the left of the X [close program] and before clicking it, I note the symbol has two
 small squares, one behind the other and a small window shows "Restore Down" in lieu of "Maximize".&nbsp; Then I click it to maximize but the window does not maximize, instead, it minimizes the window 1/8" inch more, and now the maximize button changes from two
 small squares to one square that says "Maximize" when I pass on the cursor over it, now it does work, when I click it, it maximizes the window until the screen saver starts again and returns, the same story.&nbsp; This is a little weird.<br />
<br />
My machine is a desktop ACPI x86-based PC Lenovo Thinkvision, processor is Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 @ 3.00 Ghz, 4 GB RAM, display adapter is Intel G33/G31 Express Chipset Family, hard drive is ATA Hitachi 250GB, Realtek High Definition Audio controller.&nbsp; I have
 Windows Vista Business, Service Pack 1, 32-bit operating system.&nbsp; The photo screensaver I am using is the one that comes as default in the operating system and I do not see a setting to fit the screen size.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps!!<br />
<br />
Thanks!!

<h2>            Make a file unmoveable by myself</h2>
                    When collecting my teaching files I sometimes search for a key word and drag them all together but sometimes move things I shouldn't. To stop others doing it you would use permissions, but is there any way to do this to stop yourself moving/deleting something?

            Hi Graeme.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To do that you'd run under a separate standard User account instead of Admin account which you'd save for other uses.  I don't recommend this though as it will cause you to spend a lot of time approving things you're intending to do by inserting your password.  But that's how you'd restrict yourself if you really wanted to.
<br />
<br />See how to create a Standard Local Account here:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought as much, but that's not a very good solution. It would be so easy to have a lock in folder function. Of course it would preserve the file structure (which could be a use for it in itself). The only other way i have seen is to zip the top folder
 but this is not good if you want to continue editing and adding things. I find it daft that this simple feature is not available. :-(</p>

<h2>            Using Google Chrome with MS Family</h2>
                    <p>I would like to give my son access to Google Chrome on his PC however I realize that websites and inappropriate content will not be blocked through MS Family.&nbsp; However, looks like I can set up profiles within MS Chrome to block content. A few questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) My son already has a google account.&nbsp; Can he use this google account as log in for a new user I create in chrome with controlled content?&nbsp; Or do I need a whole new one?</p>
<p>2) Will he be able to access all his google docs that he uses for school even with these controls on.</p>
<p>

            Your best option is to discard the family account he is currently under, setup a new user account in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; other people
<br />
<br />Click Add someone else to this PC
<br />
<br />Setup a new account and sign into it and he should be able to access Chrome.

 things to work so I could talk to family and friends in the United States - I could hear them but they could only hear their own echos and the odd syllable of what I was saying...before they couldn't hear me at all.</p>

<p>If you are having compatibility issues with your camera with Windows 10 Apps, including the Skype for Windows 10 App (Skype 12.x+), I suggest you try the latest version of Skype 8.x. It is desktop-based and should be on a similar compatibility level to the
 7.x release. It would seem that Skype 8.x is now an option in the current releases of Windows 10. I anticipate they will update the system requirements, at some future time, to reflect this recent change.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 font stuck on bold&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jazzy singh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 font stuck on bold&#63;</h2>
                    So I have clicked default fonts and tried changing every default font to SenseUI (normal) but it still comes on bold or italic on some places. As far I can see, I think this is the Tahoma font. No matter what I do, it stays bold or on some places italic.
 I tried doing the default fonts thing but that didnt help. I am running Windows 7 64 bit Intel i3.

<p>According to the engineers' blog about this on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.msdn.com/e7</a>, some elements of the Windows 7 interface, especially when using Aero themes, are hard-coded to use a specific font and style to preserve the intended&nbsp;ascetic. &nbsp;ClearType, which can sometimes result in a bold appearance (especially
 on CRT tube monitors), is also hard-coded into the interface in some areas. &nbsp;Do you think these may be attributing to the behavior you see?</p>
<p>If not, could you take a screenshot for us?</p>

<p>ClearType is on in that screenshot, at least partially. &nbsp;You can see the subpixel positioning in the fonts of the dialog title bar, instruction text, and drop-down menus. &nbsp;Although it looks horribly blurred. &nbsp;If it wasn't for the crisp rendering of the close
 button and border, I'd think this image had been resampled to a new DPI.</p>
<p>However I don't know why the tab and buttons would be drawing with bold font. &nbsp;While probably unrelated to ClearType, this certainly seems to be quite corrupted. &nbsp;When did the issue begin?</p>

            Hi Dsk27,
<div>This can result from a few possible circumstances.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A) If you have deleted a system font, such as Segoe UI, the system will use a default generic font for all text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>B) If your visual style settings are set to display bold at all times, the system will do so.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try right-clicking your Desktop, choose Personalize, and then click the Windows 7 theme under the Aero themes section. &nbsp;If that doesn't work (or you don't want to choose a theme) you can click Window Color at the bottom. &nbsp;From there, choose the link for
<i>Advanced&nbsp;Appearance&nbsp;Settings</i>, and make sure none of the items are set to display as Bold.</div>

    <title>Recent Chat is either &#34;Sort by Time&#34; vs &#34;Sort by - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srservices  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recent Chat is either &#34;Sort by Time&#34; vs &#34;Sort by Unread&#34;... but chat not appearing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>The New Skype desktop offers, Recent Chat as either "Sort by Time" vs "Sort by Unread"<br />
</p>
<p>I miss so many incoming messages, opportunities to talk to clients, because I'll have 'Sort by Time' open, but new chat requests do not appear there.&nbsp; Instead......</p>
<p><br />
Later, I look at 'Sort by Unread' &amp; there are messages that don't show-up under the 'Sort by Time'!!!!&nbsp; I could have chatted with them, but their chat is only appearing in "Sort by Unread"!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't see both at the same time, so we miss out.<br />
<br />
Is this a glitch, or you mean it that way? We can only see one or the other?<br />
<br />
Why can't I see ALL my text messages &amp; requests all in one place?<br />
<br />
PS: I'm on a Win7 PC, with the Win7 version of NEW Skype installed (community guide told me to install the Win7 version of Skype..... but it's made no difference)<br />

            Hi SRservices
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />I couldn't replicate this behaviour in my Skype client for Desktop. As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>OK, I think I've figured out the problem.... with the NEW &amp; disfigured Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that only people on my 'Favorites List' appear at the top of my chat log (of which I have 100's).&nbsp; So neither option of 'by Time' or 'by Unread' chat log will display NEW CLIENTS WHO ARE REQUESTING ALLOWING THEM TO CHAT WITH ME.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL new client chat requests are being dumped waaaaaaay down the chat log, after my 'Favorites'!&nbsp; This is horrible!&nbsp; We need to be able to QUICKLY SEE our new client's conversations AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE, BEFORE FAVORITES!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are the settings to make that happen, having both Favorites &amp; new client chat appear at the top of the column?</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 controller on Windows 10 error</h2>
                    <p>Hi community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use an xbox 360 controller to play various games on my laptop, but as of recently, everytime I plug it in I get Error Code 43. Upon going to device manager, I don't see "Xbox 360 peripherals" like it normally shows. Instead, it is under USB controllers,
 and it gives me "Unknown USB device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)". I tried uninstalling the device then restarting my computer, but it persists even then. I've tried updating Windows 10 (it was already up to date), and updating the USB devices under
 device manager. Sometimes if I'm really lucky, it'll work for 30 seconds and be listed properly under devices, just to stop working and give me this error after plugging it back in. Anyone have any fixes?</p>

            <p>Hi Edwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assis us with the following information related to the query on "C compiler":</p>
<ol>

                    <p>I've been running windows 10 for going on a year now, and my Quicken software has been operating without a hitch...until now.&nbsp; When I try to start it up I get the following error:</p>
<p>"Quicken requires Microsoft.Net version 2.0 </p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest version of Microsoft.Net Framework is 4.6.1 on Windows 10. It is possible that the version of Quicken installed on your PC is not compatible with your Windows 10 computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s check if the Microsoft.Net Framework is installed and enabled on your PC, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Programs and Features</strong> from the <strong>Small icons</strong> view.</li><li>Click <strong>Turn Windows features</strong> on or off.</li><li>Look for <strong>.Net Framework 4.6 Advanced Services</strong> and make sure that the box beside it is filled.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If settings are correct, proceed with performing clean and reinstall .Net Framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all browser windows and programs.</li><li>Download the <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">.Net Framework Repair Tool</a></span></em></strong> and save it on your desktop.</li><li>Double-click the downloaded tool on your desktop to <strong>Run</strong> the tool.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Download and install the <strong>.Net 4.6.1</strong> from this <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=49981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></span></em></strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Quicken</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you may try running Quicken in compatibility mode. You may visit this article for the steps:

    <title>My computer freezes when I play an Audio CD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zalzator  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer freezes when I play an Audio CD</h2>
                    I am using windows 7 ultimate (and another PC with professional), at first I could play an audio CD, but as time went on, I couldn't... and I cannot rip the CD's either.&nbsp; I've got 8GB ram in this PC (and 4 in the other), using a Samsung SH-S223C SCSI drive
 (SATA).&nbsp; I've tried downloading newer firmware.<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player freezes as soon as I try to play an audio CD, which causes my system to crash, and the only way to resolve is to do a hard reboot.&nbsp; I downloaded Winamp and now I can play cd's again, but I would rather use Media Player.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas?

<p>Hi Zalzator,</p>
<p>1) Do you get any error message or error code when you attempt to rip the CD or when the Media player freezes?</p>
<p>2) Does the issue occur with both the computers you mentioned?</p>
<p>3) Does it happen with all the CD’s you play or is it only one, if it happens with only one CD then what format is it?</p>
<p>4) Does it happen only when playing CD, or does the issue occur even when you play files on the hard disk?</p>
<p>Make sure you have the latest drivers installed. For now I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and see if any third party applications are interfering with the normal performance of the Media Player.</p>
<p>To perform a clean boot on a computer that is running Windows 7, follow these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>If your issue is resolved, follow the How to Determine What is Causing the Problem section in the KB article to narrow down the exact source.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a><strong> .</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode.</em></strong></p>
<p>Make sure you follow the steps completely as in the link; it seems to have fixed a similar issue.</p>
<p>Let us know if that did not fix the issue and we will proceed with further troubleshooting.</p>

            I do not get an error message.&nbsp; It just goes straight into "Not-Responding" as soon as I try playing an audio CD.&nbsp; PLaying MP3's, DVD's... everything else works.&nbsp; It seems to only happen with audio cd's, not installation disks nor anything else.&nbsp; After
 a clean Boot, I could then play a CD.&nbsp; However it didn't play full stream, it pauses every few seconds, like it was loading the next section of song.&nbsp; As soon as I tried to rip the CD, it went straight into Not-Responding.<br />
<br />
<br />
I downloaded third party software to see about burning/playing CD's.&nbsp; Real Player could play CD's, as could WinAmp, but trying to rip caused the computer to freeze.<br />
<br />
I cannot even bring up task manager to force programs closed to continue, and find out any further details.<br />
<br />
So, I then need to hard reboot.

<p>Just seen this post. I have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">exactly the same problem</span> with audio CD's and am also using the Samsung sh-s223c drive. It only affects audio cd playback and rip. DVD and all other functions are normal. The drive
 sees the cd info and tracks but as soon as play is attempted the player fails to respond and 'greys out'. The PC freezes and needs a power off reboot. A soft reboot and the PC no longer 'sees' the samsung drive. I understand from my pc supplier that there
 is a problem with this drive and windows 7. I will be replacing the drive soon and will report back.</p>
<p>I am using the generic windows driver. I can find no other driver for this. Samsung don't supply one on their site. My vendor also advises the generic driver for this device</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just replaced the drive with a ATAPI iHAS124&nbsp;&nbsp; Y SCSI CdRom unit without making any other changes. All problems with audio are now resolved. This unit works fine with data, audio and DVD. Solution is an alternative drive to the sh-223c.</p>

<p>I had the same problem. Audio Cd's used to work fine, then it stopped working after a couple months. I resolved this problem by disabling the audio auto-play under the Control Panel -&gt; then autoplay In the Classic view Or it can be found under "Hardware
 and Sound -&gt; Autoplay in the default control panel view. My default action was set to auto-play audio in Winamp; it could be a winamp error -- or a drive error, I don't know for sure, either way this fixed myproblem.</p>

            I have a similar(probably the same) problem. I have sh223l in windows 7 home premium (64bit). Winamp hangs in kernel mode as soon as I try to play an audio cd. I can tell the hang is in kernel mode because the process can not be terminated and the system
 will only get to "logging off" when trying to shut down, because it cannot safely terminate that thread that is stuck in kernel mode. I have to press reset at that point to get the system down. This happens with every audio cd i have, but dvds and software
 cds work just fine. Somehow Windows media player plays the same disk ok, but will also hang the same way if winamp has already tried and failed to play it. I've even gotten my explorer to hang if i touch the drive in it. Other symptoms include the drive not
 opening when i press the button on it. I've even tried the mechanical emergency open, but it doesn't solve the problem. I have the latest firmware (SB02) installed and there seems to be no drivers available besides the microsoft one.<br />

            You can try uninstalling the CD drive in Device Manager. Then reboot Windows, the drive will be reinstalled automatically. Does that help?<br />

<p>I have Windows Vista on my home PC. At work we have Windows 7. I love the sticky notes &amp; was wondering if there is a safe way to put the sticky notes onto my home PC without getting Windows 7.</p>

<p>However its not quite the same as in Windows 7 - you have to use hand writing rather than typing (its part of Tablet PC features).</p>

<h2>            Slow running computer, slow typing response, many internet pages are slow, several will not load &#38; indictate &#34;Server can not be found&#34;, ... Does PC need an Exorcism&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings Ya'll,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; My Windows 7 system has been running very well, (More than 4 months), since my last appearance in the Community, &amp; my many thanks to all that helped me work out the past issues that I had.&nbsp; ^5s</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; This issue started slowly several days ago, &amp; it seemed that many "Buttons" when clicked upon, such as in Facebook, took many seconds before any operation would proceed. At that point, I thought that it was a "Facebook" issue.&nbsp;Now, after I ran Malware
 bytes, The Full Microsoft Essentials virus scan, &amp; "CCcleaner", over-nite, .... The issue seems to have compounded, as to where it doesn't matter what Internet page I go to.</p>
<p>&nbsp; This A.M., the operation response on Facebook was so slow that I&nbsp; realized that I would "Grow Old very Quickly" while waiting for Facebook to respond, so I shut it down, .... I then noticed that loading pages such as "The Drudge Report", or "Google News"
 was also taking a considerable amount of time, &amp; even worse, several sites such as Accuweather.com, initially showed "Server not available", yet after several attempts it did load. Intellicast.com also would not fully load it's current radar, &amp; yet it eventually
 ran, with several rectangles of "pixels" remaining white, ..... WTH!</p>
<p>&nbsp; I then began running a search for "Diagnostics" on these issues, &amp; found several "possibly" helpful pages, but when I went to C&amp; P these pages to a new document, it refused to load. When I went to C &amp; P the pages to notepad, it refused to save them. I
 then tried to C &amp; P these pages to the new document again, &amp; that time it did Save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One problem that "May be contributing" (????), to these issues is that yesterday morning, a Construction crew cut through Frontiers phone/ internet cables, &amp; my phone &amp; Internet were&nbsp; both down approx. 5 hours.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I'm going to go through my system later today, as I have to get ready for work, &amp; will not be back for at least 4 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Could this be some kind of virus that Microsoft Essentials failed to pick up, or&nbsp; some kind of Internet speed issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I am astounded that where it took around 2 minutes to type&nbsp; a word in Facebook, ... here, I have Absolutely no problem typing.&nbsp; SMH!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, I have to run to a meeting for my work, so I'm pre-emptively Apologizing, if it appears that I'm taking a long time to respond to any questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shalom Ya'll!!</p>

<em><strong>Which Antivirus product to choose?</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><em><strong>The “Security” software installed on your computer may be causing problems that can not be diagnosed or fixed.&nbsp; Try removing it temporarily.</strong></em></p>
<p>his is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user
 you are:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Download and read the 2015 summary report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.&nbsp; A view of this chart will illustrate this point quite well:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart1.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart1.php</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am speaking from a great deal of experience.&nbsp; I support 150 client computers.&nbsp; I have been doing this for 14 years.&nbsp; My clients NEVER have infections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em><strong>only products I will use or recommend are ANTIVIRUS-ONLY products</strong></em>.&nbsp; Any product that is called complete protection, Internet security or deems itself to be a comprehensive security product is prohibited on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have good reason for this. Over the years and hundreds of PCs, I’ve learned a lesson well.&nbsp; That it is very difficult to diagnose and fix the problem(s) when components of an Internet Security product are actively working to prevent that diagnosis.&nbsp; The
 software sees the technician (me in this case) as a threat.&nbsp; I discovered that if I uninstalled that software, I am able to much more likely and&nbsp;quickly discover an fix the problem.&nbsp; Antivirus ONLY products do not behave like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the Antivirus software that you need.&nbsp; It is actually <em><strong>all</strong>
</em>that you need with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the big name suppliers much prefer to sell their all-in products because they can sell them for a higher price.&nbsp; Some do not offer an antivirus only product.&nbsp; Some push their all in ones and still sell the AV only product, but you may have to look
 for them.&nbsp; There is at least one and it is either the best or close to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beware of products that try to actively engage you in the security process by asking your permission to run a program named xd43_45d*.exe, or the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better</strong>.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk.
<strong>Remove everything that claims to be there to prevent infections</strong> or claims to make your computer run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</p>
<p>Note well.&nbsp; You should <strong><em>never have more than one protection product installed</em></strong>.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.&nbsp; That includes software that may have
 come pre-installed on your computer when new.&nbsp; Some products will conflict with one another, causing yet more problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a “removal tool” that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it, it will cause very hard to understand and
 diagnose problems.</p>

            <p>Greetings Canadian Tech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have Antivirus already, as I stated in my post, .... it's "Microsoft Essentials". I chose it because at the time, approximately a year ago, it was rated very high as far as performance, by several independent sites, not affiliated with Microsoft, &amp; the
 added "plus", was/is it's "Free".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I will ck out the "ADWcleaner" that you recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I also have to bring Ya'll "up to date" on what has occurred since my initial post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; My phone service went out also shortly after making this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I then spent approximately 5 hours on my cell phone, working my way up the "Chain of Command", through Frontier's Tech Service/ Customer Service, &amp; realized that the plague of Lunacy had spread even in&nbsp; to their Corporation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; For some reason, an "Order to disconnect" had been issued without merit, even though my account was current, &amp; strangely even though the "disconnect" was allegedly in effect, the Internet/ phone were still functioning. WTH?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; On top of this, I then became aware that a Contractor had cut through the phone lines approximately 2 miles down the road, which then caused a total failure of my Phone/ Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The phone/ Internet repair then received a work order that was to be performed by July 15th, 2016, ... And upon that info, I kinda, sorta, went Ballistic with the&nbsp; Techs/ Customer Reps that were in Connecticut, &amp; had no idea of what actually was "happening
 on the ground" here in Ohio.</p>
<p>&nbsp; As we worked our way through my records, &amp; proved that this "disconnect" was unjustified, &amp; as the cables were repaired, I also requested from a Supervisor's SUPERVISOR, that line tests etc. be ran on my line, for I am LITERALLY at the very end of it.
 This Supervisor apparently caused something to be improved, for my system is now running as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The only additional act that i had performed, other than running a full virus scan, Malware scan, &amp; CCCleaner, was a Disk cleanup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Canadian, I sincerely appreciate your help, although my experience has shown that a few of these additional programs, do have benefits, for "Malware Bytes "did catch several "pup" codes from a site that placed them on my PC, &amp; they were immediately quarantined,
 whereas my "Microsoft Security Essentials" didn't have a clue about them being on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I also realize, that Big Brother, can, will, &amp; has, the ability &amp; intention of being able to do whatever he wishes with any PC out there in the world, &amp; that No Program can Absolutely Protect one against malicious attacks, nor our being Monitored. With
 that said, one either has to "live in a dark corner", without Th' Net, nor any Electronic means of Communication, or, ...... One has to keep "chugging along", &amp; do the best that we can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Theoretically, .... would the buried cable being cut, as well as some "out-dated" card, in the Telephone sub-station approx. 41/2 miles from my location, as well as my being at the "very end of the line", all combined, ...... would that have been enough
 to have caused my problems that I posted???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shalom Canadian!</p>

            <p>Actually Canadian, your reply spoke of "software problems", not hardware, but that isn't an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I am indeed most thankful for your input Sir. ^5s</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another "possible" cause of this problem, that I had forgotten to mention was that a Top, out of an Ash tree, had fallen down on top of my phone line, &amp; forced it down to about 8' off of the ground. To me, that should've stretched the cable, &amp; quite possibly
 loosened the connection at the telephone pole, there by causing a weak connection. I've seen this happen with House Services, where a customer would lose their 220 volt service &amp; only have 120 volt service in their home, due to a tree limb hanging on their
 tri-plex house line. Could this have also caused the issues that were going on?</p>

            <p>Greetings Ya'll,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; This may be related, or it may be a separate issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my reply &amp; thanks to Canadian Tech, July 3rd, 2016, my system has literally crashed 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I've had 3 "freeze ups", where I finally got the system back to the desk top, &amp; then ran A.V., etc., &amp; thought that I had it taken care of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I've also had a weird incident where I went to log in, &amp; was denied, where upon I cut the power to my unit, &amp; then got it to start in "Safe mode".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Since, then, I had another incident, where upon start up, I had a "Black screen", &amp; then it started to do a "Repair", where it stated that it needed to make repairs &amp; recover files.&nbsp; After about ten minutes, the unit went to the log in&nbsp; &amp; everything then
 was fine. SMH</p>

            <p>Cutting power to a Windows computer is a very bad thing to do.&nbsp; It is a bit of a roulette game that CAN cause serious corruption of the system.&nbsp; Your computer does not have an OFF button.&nbsp; It has on ON button.&nbsp; Windows should only be shut down by clicking
 the button offered by the system.&nbsp; Windows does a lot of stuff during the shutdown and if it is not able to do those things, your system can be left with corrupted operating system files.&nbsp; Consequently the next time it is turned on, it will not properly start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a lot of great stuff built-in that helps it repair the damage but that does not always work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are incidents when the only way to shut down a system is to cut power, but they should be rare and with full knowledge that you are taking a risk.&nbsp; In most cases, use of the Task Manager to shut down an errant program works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your system is up and running, create a System Repair disk.&nbsp; It is simple and fast.&nbsp; You need a blank recordable CD or DVD.&nbsp;&nbsp; Start globe, Maintenance and you will see it there.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your system is not up and running, you can make it on another Windows
 system as long as its bitness (32 or 64) matches yours.&nbsp; The System Repair disk is designed to be booted from.&nbsp; It takes a while for it to load its own version of Windows 7, but will then offer you some repair options.&nbsp; Sometimes people make the mistake of
 thinking the System Repair disk is not working.&nbsp; That happens when the system has not in fact booted to that disk.&nbsp; To make sure it does, you need to get to a start up options screen.&nbsp; That usually happens when you press F12 key about once per second on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to your service interruptions, I still think you have a problem with "protection" software conflicts.&nbsp; I recommend you re-read my previous post and take it seriously.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I appreciate your response, &amp; suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sir, I take life, &amp; a great deal of what I do "Seriously". I also set up those programs, after a great deal of Research, &amp; discussion with people that know more about Computer systems than I do, from Microsoft, PC Forums, C-net, &amp; even physically. I will
 check for a "conflict" that may have arose on my system approximately the same time that the initial problems arose, but I'm not going to drop these programs just upon your say so, especially after many people on the Net, &amp; Physically , recommended them, &amp;
 also when I have already seen for more than a year how they have stopped all kinds of Malicious software, that Microsoft Essentials didn't even detect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I will go through the system, as you suggested, once I get caught up with my work.</p>

            <p>The test you refer to in Windows checks for data integrity on the drive.&nbsp; It does not test drive hardware.&nbsp; I suggest you download and run your hard drive manufacturer's drive tester software that is used to test the hardware functions of the drive.&nbsp; It
 is commonplace for drive hardware to start to fail, long before you will see data integrity problems.&nbsp; This is software designed by companies like Seagate and Western Digital to determine if they must replace a drive under warranty.&nbsp; That test software works
 well whether the drive is under warranty or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, go forth and be happy. I have offered my advice.&nbsp; You certainly do not have to take it.</p>

    <title>In Windows 10 The file explorer no longer displays &#34;Open Compand - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fishjd  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Windows 10 The file explorer no longer displays &#34;Open Compand Prompt Here&#34;.   Not context menu.</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 (1703&nbsp; Build 15063.296)&nbsp; The file explorer no longer displays "Open Command Prompt Here" options.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In <strong>Previous versions</strong> of Windows 10 in File Explorer the file menu looked like:
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb8444b8-0288-4ad3-8c31-b679b6ef7b4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>In the current version it looks like :</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2deb642b-c828-4326-a2e8-63f4c4e100ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2deb642b-c828-4326-a2e8-63f4c4e100ed" height="107" width="229" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now it is missing "Open Command Prompt"&nbsp;&nbsp; and "Open Command Prompt as Administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not on the 'Right Click' context menu but on the "File -&gt; Open" menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the steps to restore the "Open Command Prompt" dialogs to File Explorer?&nbsp;

<p>Yup</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS replaced Command Prompt with Powershell there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that the command prompt commands work in Powershell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways to return Command Prompt into the right-click options (see Google/Bing), and it is a taskbar personalisation setting under Settings, Personalisation, Taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to find a way to return it to the File menu.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 dont restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shanthanjodavula  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 dont restart</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought HP 15 ac101TU notebook which came with preloaded Windows 10, which was later activated. Everything was going fine for few days. But later on whenever I restart my laptop, it never restarts, rather it&nbsp;stucks on the hp logo screen and the
 loading circles go round and round continuously, never ending. If I forcefully switch it off and start again it shows "Automatic Repair", then "Diagnosing PC", after which it shows windows cannot repair, and gives some folder path on C drive. This happened
 around 10 times in past 1 week, and I am afraid when it happens next. Someone please help me out of this</p>

            <p>Hi Shanthan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Do not be afraid. We are here to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the computer is in a"preparing automatic repair" loop ". This indicates that there is a corrupt file on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to download the Windows 10 ISO file and then try upgrading to Windows 10 and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Microsoft Community Wiki article provided by Andre De Costa to upgrade from previous versions of Windows using Windows 10 ISO file.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/wiki/31722B30-1DA9-42BB-B331-0EDC4649BF43"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/wiki/31722B30-1DA9-42BB-B331-0EDC4649BF43</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to suggest you to keep the ISO file, so that you can use this as an Installation Media which can be used in future to fix issues with Windows Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to visit our website for any help with Windows Operating System.</p>
