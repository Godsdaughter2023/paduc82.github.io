<h2>            Nokia Suite 3.2.100 installed - SMS are gone</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there. I just installed the new Nokia Suite 3.2.100. Nice colours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First problems:</p>
<p>1. The manually defined directory paths for photos and movies are gone without notice. Nokia Suite simply reestablishes the default directories, but retains the monitored directories. You can easily overlook the fact that new fotos might now be stored outside
 your backup directories as both are displayed as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Much more annoyingly: Nokia Suite does not find any of the SMS stored on the PC. I know (hope), that they can not be vanished but the Suite does not display any of them. Does anybody have a solution for that already? Many thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nokia Suite softeware frustrates so very much. Almost every update is mainly an update on very time consuming problems then anything else.</p>

<p>Some time ago Nokia Ovi Suite started to store the messages in a SQL database msg_db.sqlite (before that ist was MDataStore.db3)<br />
<br />
The new Nokia Suite does just the same.But the upgrade just ignores the existing database</p>
<p>and creates a new one in a new directory.<br />
Solution: Replace the new empty msg_db.sqlite in the new directory with the old msg_db.sqlite. As a result Nokia Suite displayes all the old messages. Bfore doing this shut down Nokia Suite (completely) and create backups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Navigating to the directories is not that simple as Windows 7 hides the partly. Also there are similar directories that may confuse the search addtionally. For me copying the following strings intoi the explorer works convineintly:<br />
<br />
Old path for Nokia Ovi Suite:</p>
<p>C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Nokia\Nokia Ovi Suite\Messages\Database<br />
<br />
New Path for Nokia Suite:<br />
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Nokia\Nokia Suite\Messages\Database<br />
<br />
Result: All messages are back in the suite again. Thanks you Nokia for wasting my&nbsp; time!</p>
<p><br />
By the way: There is a Firefox plugin available that makes it possible to query those Databases easily via SQL. Once the date/time conversion is solved it is very easy to create clean csv-files for reuse in Ecxel, upload to other applications and so on.</p>

<p>Thanks for informing this and finding a solution to it also. Suite should have changed the folder automatically during update. Did you had any problems with update that could explain this?</p>

<p>There were no problems at all during installation.</p>
<p>What makes you think the folders should have changed during the process? There is no indication for that at all. The new folder structure is similar but not identical to the old one.</p>

<p>When we changed the application name from Nokia Ovi Suite to Nokia Suite we also changed the name of the folders that the application uses. So far you are the only one&nbsp;who has reported that this change has failed. We are investigating if we can find the

<p>Thanks for the detailed explanation and solution. However, I have checked the folders as mentioned by you and noticed that my previous folder (under Nokia Data Store) is having only MDataStore.db3 file and not the newer msg_db.sqlite. Seems Nokia Ovi Suite
 used to use MDataStore.db3 file while the Nokia Suite uses msg_db.sqlite file, which are two totally different file types. Have also tried copying the old MDataStore.db3 into the new folder as mentioned by you, but seems Nokia Suite 3.2 doesn't recognize this
 db3 filetype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems Nokia Suite devt team didn't anticipate this issue. Hope they provide a fix for it as all my messages have disappeared from my phone (from all folders). If anyone has a workaround or solution please share the same. Thanx.</p>

<p>Hi rameshiyer,</p>
<p>a few months back Ovi Suite seemed to have switched from MDataStore.db3 to&nbsp;msg_db.sqlite. This change also happened without notice or any data conversion. I was really mad to have lost all messages once again. A very bad habit of Nokia PC software!</p>
<p>Anyway there is at least one way to salvage the messages in MDataStore.db3. You need to have some expertise to do this.</p>
<p>1. Create a backup copy of MDataStore.db3</p>
<p>2. Get &amp; install SQLite Manager Firefox addon</p>
<p>3. Open database MDataStore.db3</p>
<p>4. Query table &gt;MessageEx&lt;. All your synced messages are in that table.</p>
<p>5. Select all the messages and export into a csv-file (actually the best way is to export to csv but give the file the extension .txt)</p>
<p>6. Open the file with Excel, make sure to give columns with numbers the type "text", date columns --&gt; date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major problem is the message date which is stored in SentReceivedTimestamp. This field needs a conversion. I was not able to really understand what field type that is and how it is converted correctly. By adding a generic constant it worked okay with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So instead of step 4 above you can try to copy the following SQL-Statement into the the adequate field in SQLite Manager and run it. Maybe that helps you as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With some Excel formatting you could also try to create an import file for Nokia Suite and import the old messages. I did not do that yet.</p>
<p>Good luck! Always make backups!</p>

<p>Hi ParlaBaneAgain,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed explanation and technical details to recover messages from DB3 file. However, though I installed the said FF add-on and queried the file, it found no records, which suggests that I had not synchronised data between my phone and the
 Nokia Ovi Suite, but just backed up data using the Backup option. My sql_db.sqlite file is just 7 kb, while the MDataStore.db3 file is 307 kb which suggests that the db3 file does contain some data. It's just that I can't retrieve it through the methods suggested
 by you.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint 2013 Online &#34;Sorry something went wrong&#34; when clicking on &#39;Images&#39; library folder</h2>
                    <p>My company has an Sharepoint 2013 Online Internal Intranet site for employees only. &nbsp;I am one of the "sys admins" and has such have the ability to edit pages, permissions etc. &nbsp;Recently when attempting to click on the 'Images' library under Site Content,
 for our News page, me and another admin have been getting the "Sorry something went wrong" error. &nbsp;Previously we both had been able to access this 'Images' library. &nbsp;The permissions look good. &nbsp;I have a member of the Intranet Owners group, which has Full Control
 permissions on the library. &nbsp;Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts?</p>
<p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To clarify the issue, I’d like to confirm the following.</span></p>
<span>1. Can you access other picture libraries in other site collection? Does the issue only occur in a specific site collection?</span><span><br />
2. Can other site collection admins access the picture library in the site collection?</span><span><br />
3. If you change a browser, what’s the outcome? If you are using IE, I suggest you sign out of Office 365,
</span><span>clear IE caches via Tools&gt;Safety&gt;Deleting browser history,
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset IE</a> and then </span>
<span>re-sign in to the Office 365 portal to see the outcome(Do the similar steps in the other browsers if you aren’t using IE.).</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, if you have backed up the images, I suggest you delete the picture library and then re-create it to give a shot. If you can access the new library, you can use
 the OneDrive for Business client to upload multiple images to it.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;I have tried it in Chrome, IE and Firefox. &nbsp;All give same error with different correlation IDs</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have to look into the backups. &nbsp;Not sure if these images have been backed up or not.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I found that the Correlation ID in the logs expires and we can’t find some information from it. To investigate the root cause, I suggest you reproduce the issue and give
 us a screenshot like the one above. We should get a new Correlation ID to move forward.</span></p>

<p><span>Moreover, I’d like you to confirm whether the issue occurs if you create a new picture library in a new site collection and whether the issue persists after you re-create
 the affected picture library(if you backed up the images).</span></p>

</p><p>&nbsp; I apologize, but I just saw the last part of your above response from two days ago. &nbsp;Yes the issue persists even if I create a new 'Image Library'. &nbsp;It is only appearing to be affecting 'Asset' Libraries at this point. &nbsp;The 'Picture' Library is not the
 issue. &nbsp;It is an Library that is an 'Asset' Library ( either new or existing ) for which this issue occurs. &nbsp;I can create a Document or Picture Library and they function correctly.</p>

<h2>            how can i find the original creation date of an email&#63;</h2>
                    I know all emails are time stamp but that can&nbsp; be changed in the body of an email. I want to know if there is a way to see when the email was originally created? Sometimes people change the dates to make it seem like&nbsp; the email was created before it really
 was to try to get out of paying for services they used. I want to be able to catch the lie by finding out when the email was actually made.

<h2>            All Microsoft apps working except Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Well,everything was working fine till I tried to update windows through my college proxy server.For that I first adjusted my proxy settings in the ie LAN tab and then used the following command:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Netsh winhttp import proxy source=ie</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This was intended to change the update HTTP protocols to the proxy settings explorer was using.Now,the update did not work for me...I tried many steps but it just didn't work.</p>
<p>But to my shock,windows is not even updating in my home network now!!I disabled the proxy settings,rebooted my pc and even tried closing and restarting the windows update service through the following commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong><span>net stop wuauserv<br />
<br />
net stop cryptSvc<br />
&nbsp;<br />
net stop bits<br />
<br />
net stop msiserver<br />
<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
<br />
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old<br />
<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
<br />
net start cryptSvc<br />
<br />
net start bits<br />
<br />
net start msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span>Still I am not able to update and windows gives me the following error:</span></strong></p>
<p>
We couldn't get online to download your updates. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I have tried all possible ways with no success.What is more surprising is that all other windows services such as edge,explorer and others are working just fine.Only win update is encountering problems.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kindly help me in this matter.</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Thanks!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3> bloodandfootsteps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Asha 220 not connecting to internet after firmware update</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I updated the firmware&nbsp;of my Nokia 220 to version 20 series [it would not update it beyond this to 30+].
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that the browser has reverted back from Opera Mini to Xpress, and since I cannot connect to the internet now I cannot update it to Opera Mini. When I attempt to connect to the internet it&nbsp;now&nbsp;comes up with&nbsp;a notification saying something like "trying
 to establish secure connection" and then it says "cannot load page at the time, try checking your signal" or something along those lines.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly there is something in the settings that has changed since the update. Can anyone help so I can get the net working again should I need? Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same here. If I close the browser fast enough, I see an G or E with a frame. Consequently, the settings are correct. Either Nokia Xpress was turned off finally – or it is a temporary outage. Which firmware variant (Nokia Product Code: 059…) do you have?</p>

            I am not about the firmware version (20 or 30) but the firmware variant (059…). The firmware variant determines which firmware version you get. The firmware variant is identified through the Nokia Product Code. That Code starts with 059… and is shown in
 the Recovery Tool. The same code should be printed on your phone, underneath the battery. Which one do you have?

            Ah ok, it's 059V909. Is that right? I'm getting the feeling that this will not be sorted out, since the settings all seem correct. No idea what the problem is.

            <p>You did not do anything wrong. This is the fault of Microsoft. They disabled the proxy severs for Nokia Xpress but did not release the latest firmware version 30 for your firmware variant&nbsp;059V909 (Great Britain). Therefore, you do not have or get Opera Mini.</p>

another firmware variant</a>, like 059V1N3 (RM-969), 059V1S1(RM-970), or 059V150 (RM-971), which offers firmware version 30 and therefore Opera Mini out of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I would return this phone to my retailer. He in turn sends it to a local but authorised repair facility. That way – if you include a qualified bug-report sheet – they might wake up and find an official solution which benefits all Nokia 220 users
 in Great Britain.</p>

            Thank you so much for your help. Returning the phone is a problem since it was bought from Phones 4U which went into administration. Could I use any retailer to return it? Crazy that Nokia didn't enable the update for that firmware version.

<p>I do not know the consumer rights of Great Britain. Therefore, does <a href="https://www.gov.uk/consumer-protection-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this help</a>?</p>
<p>Anyway, you might have a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/mobile/support/care-point/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Care Point in your region</a>.</p>
<blockquote>Crazy that Nokia didn't enable the update for that firmware version.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is crazy because I do not understand it either and we are not told why this is not done. However, this is actually quite normal for Nokia – a lot of firmware variants did not get updates in the past. It does not relate to country. Sometimes, Great
 Britain was even first to get updates. With some models. Other models did get their update very late or even never.</p>

            Sir, Microsoft says that the latest version of your phone will be installed after using this tool. If you have downloaded Recovery Tool from any other website instead of Microsoft Website, it might result in lower software. To download &amp; install the approved

            Hello JimmyLewe, <br />
<br />
I am sorry to hear that you are having difficulty logging into your Hotmail account after you have initiated deletion and you want to restore it since it is less than 30 days… without your phone verification.
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it is important for you to keep your security information up-to-date because in the event of losing access to it, these security info play a key role to decide whether you should regain access to your account or not.
<br />
<br />
Since you no longer have the phone number associated in your Hotmail account to pass the verification, and since the account is in process to be deleted, I reckon you should let it be deleted and open a new account with that namespace 30 days later after it
 is deleted. That is the easiest method. <br />
<br />
Of course, you can try to appeal to Microsoft Support by email here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12401</a> (it may take up to 30 days or more)
<br />
<br />
I am sorry that I cannot help you to resolve this issue, but I hope I have pointed you the right direction.
<br />
<br />
Best regards, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

 data file was created. &nbsp;the old pst data file having a size about 1.8GB sits in the user folder. &nbsp;I have tried various ways to open it, but it only displayed latest three emails and all the old emails before I switched to the new server, they could not be
 displayed. &nbsp;Please help if you can.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Hanson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per your post, you had the account setup as IMAP. Let me explain you how IMAP account works.</p>
<p>IMAP which stands for Internet Access Message Protocol, is a method for retrieving email messages from the mail server. As the email account was setup using this protocol, the email software does not
 download the messages to the local computer hard drive, but allows the user to read the message directly from the server. This helps to view the messages in multiple locations/machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the data was not stored on the computer, there is nothing much that can be done. You may have to contact your email service provider to somehow try to retrieve your email data from their damaged
 server. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However you may search online for available software which claim to retrieve data from pseudo data files like IMAP.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> Microsoft does not endorse any of these products.</p>

<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I don't see why not! There's lots of different ways you could organize it. What comes to mind for me is having one notebook per year, one section per month, and then a separate tab per each day you keep your diary. You can add rule lines so it feels like
 you're typing on paper. And there are just tons of features in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try searching OneNote + diary or journal to see some examples of how others use it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't get send/recieve email from my phone unless I'm connected to my Vista laptop.&nbsp; Isn't the point of these Smart Phones to be able to send/receive when you're
<em>away</em> from your computer?&nbsp; My phone is a BlackJackII, carrier is AT&amp;T wireless.&nbsp; Sync's fine with the computer through a cable and am about to get a bluetooth adapter to syn wirelessly.&nbsp; My email is set-up through Outlook (comcast.net is ISP). What
 am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Laura, so you have setup your device to sync via activesync ... correct?&nbsp; And you chose to sync your email with Mobile Outlook ... correct?&nbsp; If that is so, then when you create an email, it will only send when you
 are connected because it is affiliated with the Outlook on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be able to send/recieve using your data connection you will have to setup the email on your device ... just like when you set it up on your PC.&nbsp; Open email on your device and choose New Email Account.&nbsp; Enter the info and it will most likely
 do an automatic setup and you will be sending emails quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any issues, get back to us and we will try to assist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What device do you have BTW?</p>

<p>I have aso set-up a second, non-outlook-affiliated account on my phone for my same comcast.net email to see if that made a difference, and it didn't.&nbsp; I still am not able to send/receive unless connected to my PC.</p>

<p>You did not indicate in your initial post that you had Vista.&nbsp; You are correct in that Vista uses a new version of "activesync" called Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC).&nbsp; I used the word activesync as sort of a generic term referencing the
 ability to sync.&nbsp; Sorry for any confusion.</p>

<p>So I assume you do have a data account with your device.&nbsp; When you setup the email account, did it setupo the account automatically or did you enter the setting manually?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incoming mail server</strong>: mail.comcast.net<br />
<strong>Outgoing mail server:</strong> smtp.comcast.net</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you set thae outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication and that it uses the&nbsp;same settings as&nbsp;your incoming mail server.</p>

    <title>Nokia C5 - Microphone not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harsha_raj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia C5 - Microphone not working</h2>
                    
<p>When ever i used to talk someone over my phone from past 2 days, the other person over the phone was complaining to me that my voice was hardly audible. I thought it was a network problem and it would resolve by itself. But still people used to complain
 so i tried using the earphones so as to get to know if it was really my phone's or the network problem. Then when ever i used the microphone, the audibility of the sound was normal. I feel that the phone's microphone is damaged. It is a brand new phone, took
 it just 2-3 weeks back. Is giving the phone to nokia care center is only the option?? Would they exchange a new c5 for this defective piece?</p>

<p>sorry to hear that a brand-new phone has a problem like that.&nbsp; before taking the phone to Nokia Care, check your firmware version

http://europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/device-software-update/can-i-update</a> . if your firmware is the latest, you will have to take the phone to a Nokia Care point.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I do have the latest firmware. Today evening before giving it to nokia care point, i wanted to test it one last time. So i tried recording my voice with the in-built app and it recored very clearly and then made some couple of phone
 calls and none complained about my voice not heard kind. I will see for fews days and then if problem still persists give to nokia for repair.</p>

            The problem has come back again. One time the microphone will be crystal clear, the other time its not at all proper and the other person over the line curses! I will just take it to nokia care point on monday. Hope they can fix. This was the first new
 phone which i had brought, pity that this is how it ended up.

<p>Some examples</p>
<p>- Problem occurs both in outlook and in OWA</p>
<p>- Will receive an email, which is followed up a minute or two later with the NDR</p>
<p>- Upon sending an email, will receive an NDR a minute or two later</p>
<p>- Emails are sent successfully and arrive at recipient (Tested across multiple recipients)</p>

<p>Things I've checked</p>
<p>- DNS is checked and correct</p>
<p>- MX record is correct</p>
<p>- SPF record is correct</p>
<p>- Cleared outlook autocomplete cache</p>
<p>- deleted/created new outlook profile</p>
<p>- Multiple users on domain however this is the only email account that has the issue.</p>
<p>- All NDR's are for legitimate messages only (both received and sent)</p>
<p>- Checked using OWA only, problem still occurs</p>
<p>- This is affecting new emails. Original import was PST 18mths ago and have had zero problems to date.</p>
<p>- No forwarding or OOO is set.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Problem seemed to originate on the same day a password was changed for another user, seemingly unrelated though.</p>

<p>Hi Antony,</p>
<p>We notice the information “X-MS-Exchange-Inbox-Rules-Loop: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (removed the domain to protect the provicy)” in the Non-Delivery Report (NDR).<br />
Could you please confirm if Kross has set one inbox rule to forward the received email to an unreachable address? If so, please uncheck the rule to see if there is any improvement.<br />
You can check the rules not only in Outlook client and OWA (Outlook Web App), but also using PowerShell<br />
1.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a><br />
2. Run the commands below.<br />
To get forwaring information for the mailbox</p>
<p>Get-mailbox -identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;|FL “Forwardingsmtpaddress”</p>
<p>To check the inbox rule and disable one inbox rule</p>
<p>Get-InboxRule -Mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Disable-InboxRule -Identity "MoveAnnouncements" -Mailbox "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" (MoveAnnouncements is the rule name)</p>

<h2>            Lumia 650 Firmware Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>So I happen to hear the news about a firmware update being released to Lumia 650 handsets. This update includes the 'Double tap to wake' feature I've been waiting for a while. I live in Canada and I have not received it yet.&nbsp;I am aware that you can get the
 firmware through the Windows&nbsp;Device Recovery Tool, but I don't want to reset my device. I currently have a Dual-SIM L650.&nbsp;Do I just continue to wait? Or is there something preventing me from receiving the update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am running the Anniversary Update (Build 1607)</p>

<h3> estonlb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 won&#39;t recognize Office 2013 activation code</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. Under Windows 7, I have been using Office 2013 for a few years just fine. After I finished the upgrade to Windows 10, I opened Excel and was told me that the program was not activated. I chose the "Activate"
 button, entered my 25-digit activation code I used when I first purchase Office 2013 and was told that the key was invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since tried to open Word and the exact same thing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I try to open either Excel or Word, I get an information dialog that says "Setup needs to configure your Microsoft Office program". The screen is displayed for a couple of minutes and then finally says that the configuration failed and the program
 closes. While the configuration screen is being displayed, I can't close the screen or move it around - I'm basically stuck until the attempted configuration fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm stuck with a valid version of Office 2013 that I can not use because something in the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 went screwy. I NEED to use office, especially Excel, since I am a mathematician and rely heavily on Excel. I know my activation
 code is valid because that is the same code I used to install Office 2013 in the first place. Right now, I'm pretty disgusted that the upgrade to Window 10, which I had read was supposed to be a seamless upgrade, screwed with my Office 2013 programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I get Office 2103 up and running again, I have resorted to using Google Docs because I have to be able to work with Excel and Word files. I definitely prefer Office over Docs, but right now I don't know of any other choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks for letting me know how to run the command prompt in administrator mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running "sfc /scannow", I received the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Beginning system scan. &nbsp;This process will take some time.</p>
<p>Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.<br />
<br />
Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For<br />
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not<br />
supported in offline servicing scenarios."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read through the log file and there was nothing there that made sense to me (I can post the file if you would like me to). I have since tried to open an Office app and now I get something very similar to my original problem.... I get a splash screen immediately
 on startup that says "Please wait while setup prepares the necessary files". After a minute or so, I get a dialog box saying "Microsoft Office can't find your license for this application. A repair attempt was unsuccessful or cancelled. Microsoft Office will
 now exit."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since running the sfc command didn't work, I thought about trying your alternative approach: login to the Microsoft account and try to manage my installation there. Unfortunately, I purchased Office 2014 from a 3rd party dealer (lookoutdeals.com) and therefore
 I can't manage my Microsoft products with my Microsoft account. I sent a reply to the email I originally received from lookoutdeals when I purchased the product and am waiting to see if they can maybe provide me with a new activation code. If they do, I will
 then try to uninstall Office 2014 and reinstall it using the new activation code (I don't have high hopes of this happening, though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep you posted if I do get some help from lookoutdeals.</p>

<h2>            Problems opening .pub files directly.</h2>
                    I have a folder containing a large number of .pub files created many years ago on a different computer with an old version of Publisher.&nbsp; I now have a new computer&nbsp; and have just bought Publisher 2010.&nbsp; When I click on a .pub file in my folder it will
 not open. The only way I can open any .pub file is to first open Publisher and then open the .pub file within the program.&nbsp; Surely there must be a way of getting the .pub files to open&nbsp; directly by clicking on them with our having to open the program first.
 Can anyone tell me what's wrong? <br />
I had already installed&nbsp; Office 2010 Home and Student some tiime ago and have only just installed Publisher 2010. It seems to have insatlled itself correct;y within the existing Office.<br />
<br />
Am I expecting too much of Publisher? Perhaps one must always open the program first and then open the ,pub file within it.&nbsp; This is certailnly not the case with other Office components such as Word and Excel.<br />

OK, then the key is to find where 'mspub.exe' is on your C drive and then you will be able to drill down to it and reassociate it with .pub files.</p>
<p>You can try using Windows Explorer (windows key + E) and look perhaps in:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 2010\Office14\mspub.exe</p>
<p>or search your C drive for the file.</p>

Might be worth a try to reset the default file association <br />
for the older .pub files to your current version of Publisher.

<h2>            how to change the font size of all the in-text reference numbers in a document in ms word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I've tried changing 'reference' font, blocking off the entire document and following all the 'styles' rules for changing font but they never work. I've got some numbers in font 10 and some in Font 12 with no idea how they ended up that way. I'm trying to
 get word to automatically change all in-text reference numbers to 10 font.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen the answer:&nbsp; </p>
<div>
<p>The Footnote Reference style is a character style which is used, by Word, for both the reference in the main body of the document and for the reference in the footnote area.
</p>
<p>To modify the size of footnote text, what you should do is&nbsp;modify the Footnote Text paragraph style.</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>But doing so has no effect on the size of the&nbsp; footnote numbers in the text. This is a 300 page book with hundreds of footnotes so this is a problem.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            By default, the Footnote Reference style does not specify a font or font size but only applies the Superscript property to the Default Paragraph Font. This means that footnote reference numbers will be larger or smaller depending on context but will be
 superscripted unless that property is removed from the Footnote Reference style. It is not a good idea to specify a font or font size for this character style.

</p><p>Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, when I press control/shift s it shows the reference number to be in a 'body style' or 'normal' format ( 12 font). How can I change all those reference numbers in body format into reference format (10 font). And why would the reference number in the text,
 which was initially in 10 font be changed sporadically into a 12 font? Only some of the reference numbers get changed, others do not.</p>
<p>Certainly I can change the size of the font by highlighting each reference number individually and clicking the reference style button but there are numerous instances where this must be done and it gets rather tedious. I'm looking for a way to change all
 reference numbers in the text to the proper font (10). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Following is some of the text. Don't know if the formatting will come with the text just by copying it here, but can't see how to attach a file, so hope this will suffice.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

Chapter 2 Freedom &amp; Self-actualization: History
<p style="text-align: justify">
This idea of self-actualization as part of a broader process of evolution has been a consistent thread of thought within many traditions historically.<sup><span><span><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup><sup>
</sup>In religion, philosophy, psychology and even the ‘harder’ sciences, across both East and West, ‘teleological’<sup><span><sup><span>[2]</span></sup></span></sup>
 theories of progressive expansion of consciousness toward total freedom as an innate aspect of evolution are easily found.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
In this section we shall take a short excursion through a few of the better-known theories and theorists of teleological cosmology to provide a historical platform for the idea of self-actualization as a road toward expansion of consciousness and ultimate freedom
 as cosmological processes</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
We begin with some rather generic, philosophical theories on cosmology and work toward the more detailed science-based ideas which tend to support the more philosophical theories. Together these two differing but related perspectives should provide the needed
 background for what is to follow. </p>
<div style="margin-left: 45pt">
<span><span><span>Teleological</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Philosophers
 and Cosmologists</span></span></span></span> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
One of the ‘giants’ of Western philosophy, Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel<span>&nbsp;</span>(1770-1831) especially advocated a teleological view of human history in which through a dialectical process<sup><span><sup><span>[3]</span></sup></span></sup>
 of <em>thesis-antithesis-synthesis </em>humankind gains deeper and deeper insight into its perceived universe and the
<em>processes and relationships</em> from which human reality is built. Hegel<span>&nbsp;</span>believed that in the dialectic process of searching for answers, humankind also gains deeper insight into
<em>its own awareness</em> and what resides within that awareness, an awareness or consciousness that contains from the beginning, deep within, all of reality. Through a slow progression of personal and collective evolution the consciousness of humankind, individually
 and collectively returns to the complete freedom of pure consciousness from which it came, much enhanced by the journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
This ‘slow progression’ of evolution takes place individually as self-actualization and collectively as the progression of ideas, knowledge and the ‘states’<sup><span><sup><span>[4]</span></sup></span></sup>
 that derive from the passion of daily life of individuals in pursuit of personal goals. This process is at first instinctive, and then increasingly sophisticated as deeper realizations lead to more freedom of thought, experience and societal structure. Self-actualization
 then is a process of discovering the infinite wisdom within oneself and expressing it individually and collectively on the physical plane of existence in the form of a more ‘cosmopolitan’ ‘self’, and more advanced cultures and societies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Hegel<span>&nbsp;</span>felt there was a <em>causal</em> relationship between mind and the ‘real world’, and it was in the tension between opposites, of conflicting duties, desires and needs in the ‘real world’, and the mental dialectic that comes out of
 that tension that lay the impetus toward greater insight, realization and subsequent expansion of consciousness back toward ‘absolute awareness’ of Itself.
<sup><span><sup><span>[5]</span></sup></span></sup><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
For Hegel<span>&nbsp;</span>then, the mind has a progressive role in the creation of the ever-evolving world the individual perceives as ‘reality’. Alternatively, the ongoing, dynamic relationship between mind, awareness and the ‘perceived world’ is where
 realization and self-actualization progress toward more expansive states of freedom and an ultimate reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
A more holistic view of teleological cosmology<strong> </strong>was offered by<strong>
</strong>Helena Blavatsky<span>&nbsp;</span>(1831-1891), purported mystic and clairvoyant, and a controversial figure in her time. Blavatsky studied the wisdom of the
<em>ermetic</em> tradition<sup><span><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></span></sup>,
<em>Neo-Platonism</em> and <em>prisca theologia,</em><sup><span><sup><span>[7]</span></sup></span></sup><em> (</em>all of which
 greatly influenced Renaissance esotericism),<sup><span><sup><span>[8]</span></sup></span></sup> as well as Eastern sources of
 wisdom as revealed in <em>Vedanta</em> and <em>Buddhism</em>. She then combined these ancient teachings with the Western science of the day to create a cosmology detailing the source of the universe and humankind’s evolution toward higher states of awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
In <em>Isis Revealed </em>and<em> The Secret Doctrine</em><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em>Blavatsky describes a teleological evolution for humankind, one with an unfolding universe with three ‘streams’ of intertwining, fluxing, living energies; the
<em>spiritual</em>, <em>mental </em>and <em>physical</em>, all three of which have their separate sets of laws governing their manifestation and evolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
The universe, according to Blavatsky’s sources arises from an undifferentiated ‘Source’ (Ultimate Reality) and through the constant intertwining of the three streams of ‘energy’ becomes a cosmos of infinitely differentiated flow of evolutionary forces. These
 ‘forces’ manifest themselves in the form of differing expressions of energy, creating the multiplicity of inorganic and organic matter,
<em>all of which</em> is suffused with the energy of consciousness.</p>
<span>The three streams of living energy interpenetrate each other completely from the very beginning, with evolution occurring
<em>synergistically</em> across all three streams toward heightened states of awareness. In other words, the spiritual, mental and physical ‘streams’ of living energy are all in constant states of inter-relational, creative, evolving flux, from which the multifaceted
 universe with all its variety of ‘beings’ comes into existence. Each ‘being’ lives out its destined lifespan, then melds back into the fluxing stream, taking with it, its experience and accrued wisdom, which it contributes to the creative wisdom of the three
 fluxing streams</span>

Chapter 2 Freedom &amp; Self-actualization: History
<p style="text-align: justify">
This idea of self-actualization as part of a broader process of evolution has been a consistent thread of thought within many traditions historically.<sup><span><span><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup><sup>
</sup>In religion, philosophy, psychology and even the ‘harder’ sciences, across both East and West, ‘teleological’<sup><span><sup><span>[2]</span></sup></span></sup>
 theories of progressive expansion of consciousness toward total freedom as an innate aspect of evolution are easily found.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
In this section we shall take a short excursion through a few of the better-known theories and theorists of teleological cosmology to provide a historical platform for the idea of self-actualization as a road toward expansion of consciousness and ultimate freedom
 as cosmological processes</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
We begin with some rather generic, philosophical theories on cosmology and work toward the more detailed science-based ideas which tend to support the more philosophical theories. Together these two differing but related perspectives should provide the needed
 background for what is to follow. </p>
<div style="margin-left: 45pt">
<span><span><span>Teleological</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Philosophers
 and Cosmologists</span></span></span></span> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
One of the ‘giants’ of Western philosophy, Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel<span>&nbsp;</span>(1770-1831) especially advocated a teleological view of human history in which through a dialectical process<sup><span><sup><span>[3]</span></sup></span></sup>
 of <em>thesis-antithesis-synthesis </em>humankind gains deeper and deeper insight into its perceived universe and the
<em>processes and relationships</em> from which human reality is built. Hegel<span>&nbsp;</span>believed that in the dialectic process of searching for answers, humankind also gains deeper insight into
<em>its own awareness</em> and what resides within that awareness, an awareness or consciousness that contains from the beginning, deep within, all of reality. Through a slow progression of personal and collective evolution the consciousness of humankind, individually
 and collectively returns to the complete freedom of pure consciousness from which it came, much enhanced by the journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
This ‘slow progression’ of evolution takes place individually as self-actualization and collectively as the progression of ideas, knowledge and the ‘states’<sup><span><sup><span>[4]</span></sup></span></sup>
 that derive from the passion of daily life of individuals in pursuit of personal goals. This process is at first instinctive, and then increasingly sophisticated as deeper realizations lead to more freedom of thought, experience and societal structure. Self-actualization
 then is a process of discovering the infinite wisdom within oneself and expressing it individually and collectively on the physical plane of existence in the form of a more ‘cosmopolitan’ ‘self’, and more advanced cultures and societies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Hegel<span>&nbsp;</span>felt there was a <em>causal</em> relationship between mind and the ‘real world’, and it was in the tension between opposites, of conflicting duties, desires and needs in the ‘real world’, and the mental dialectic that comes out of
 that tension that lay the impetus toward greater insight, realization and subsequent expansion of consciousness back toward ‘absolute awareness’ of Itself.
<sup><span><sup><span>[5]</span></sup></span></sup><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
For Hegel<span>&nbsp;</span>then, the mind has a progressive role in the creation of the ever-evolving world the individual perceives as ‘reality’. Alternatively, the ongoing, dynamic relationship between mind, awareness and the ‘perceived world’ is where
 realization and self-actualization progress toward more expansive states of freedom and an ultimate reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
A more holistic view of teleological cosmology<strong> </strong>was offered by<strong>
</strong>Helena Blavatsky<span>&nbsp;</span>(1831-1891), purported mystic and clairvoyant, and a controversial figure in her time. Blavatsky studied the wisdom of the
<em>ermetic</em> tradition<sup><span><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></span></sup>,
<em>Neo-Platonism</em> and <em>prisca theologia,</em><sup><span><sup><span>[7]</span></sup></span></sup><em> (</em>all of which
 greatly influenced Renaissance esotericism),<sup><span><sup><span>[8]</span></sup></span></sup> as well as Eastern sources of
 wisdom as revealed in <em>Vedanta</em> and <em>Buddhism</em>. She then combined these ancient teachings with the Western science of the day to create a cosmology detailing the source of the universe and humankind’s evolution toward higher states of awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
In <em>Isis Revealed </em>and<em> The Secret Doctrine</em><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em>Blavatsky describes a teleological evolution for humankind, one with an unfolding universe with three ‘streams’ of intertwining, fluxing, living energies; the
<em>spiritual</em>, <em>mental </em>and <em>physical</em>, all three of which have their separate sets of laws governing their manifestation and evolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
The universe, according to Blavatsky’s sources arises from an undifferentiated ‘Source’ (Ultimate Reality) and through the constant intertwining of the three streams of ‘energy’ becomes a cosmos of infinitely differentiated flow of evolutionary forces. These
 ‘forces’ manifest themselves in the form of differing expressions of energy, creating the multiplicity of inorganic and organic matter,
<em>all of which</em> is suffused with the energy of consciousness.</p>
<span>The three streams of living energy interpenetrate each other completely from the very beginning, with evolution occurring
<em>synergistically</em> across all three streams toward heightened states of awareness. In other words, the spiritual, mental and physical ‘streams’ of living energy are all in constant states of inter-relational, creative, evolving flux, from which the multifaceted
 universe with all its variety of ‘beings’ comes into existence. Each ‘being’ lives out its destined lifespan, then melds back into the fluxing stream, taking with it, its experience and accrued wisdom, which it contributes to the creative wisdom of the three
 fluxing streams</span>

            OK, that means it's certainly Word, and we need to figure out what Word is doing with all that power.
<div><br />
<div>I agree with Jim, it could be a font. &nbsp;But let's try the Normal.dotm template first, since that is easy to eliminate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Stop all Microsoft applications (quit, not minimised).</div>
<div><br />
<div>In Finder, Go to&nbsp;<b>/Users/&lt;your name&gt;/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates</b>, find the file Normal.dotm, and delete it. &nbsp;If you are in OS 10.8, that path is hidden, you will need to hold down the Option key and then use the Finder's
 Go menu to open the Library folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Empty the trash.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now start Word: It will create a new blank copy on startup, and the startup may take a little longer this once.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it's still slow, check with Activity Monitor to make sure it's Word, then come back.</div>

            Thanks for your advice. &nbsp;It is working now but very weird on what happened. &nbsp;I had originally been signed up for the Office Insider Fast Updates and the system was trying to update to 16.23. &nbsp;That kept getting hung up on a Powerpoint install for some reason.
 &nbsp;So I resorted back to just regular updates which took me back to 16.21. &nbsp;When I did that the Stock data type wasn't available in Excel. &nbsp;I called MSFT tech support and we forced install an update, which gave me again 16.21. &nbsp;It then worked properly. &nbsp;But
 when I accessed Excel the next day, I had the same issue again, in which the Stock data type wasn't available. &nbsp;I then decided to try the Office Insider Slow Updates, which gave me 16.22. &nbsp;And now things are working properly. &nbsp;I have no idea what happened
 along the way, but I do know this all started when I got a 16.23 update via the Office Insider Fast, which wouldn't install. &nbsp;I hope this information is useful for others, and th
