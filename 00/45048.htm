<h2>            Hacked GamerTag and modded Gamerscore.</h2>
                    
<p>First of all, excuse me for my english ! I hope you will understand me, and help me to resolve my problem.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was playing with my account, everything was ok, and suddenly I get a message : "your gamertag is connected on another xbox" (I don't know the message in english, I translate it from French)</p>
<p>So, I tried to recover it during hours, deleting it and redownload it ! Nothing was working ! I tried one more time, and I succed to get it back ! I changed everything, informations, passwords, etc; but something was wrong with my account ! My gamerscore
 was changed ! So I did some research, and I heard about GS modification, and I know that you can be banned for that ! I haven't done anything with my GScore, no modification, nothing at all, for various reasons ! I don't to be banned for this type of thing,
 and because i'm on the xbox live since 2006, i knew a lot of people who where banned for that ! So I know what you can get if you're doing stupid things with GScore ! Now, i'm trying to know what I got to do ! I called the support, they told me that they can't
 do anything for me... &nbsp;I got a credit card on my account too, and no transaction was done; everything seems to work great on my account !</p>
<p>So i'm asking this to you : what can I do ? I'm kinda lost, i'm going to buy my Xbox One in a few days; and I want to use this gamertag (it means a lot to me, it was my first account) I really don't want to be banned because of something I've never did !</p>
<p>Thank you a lot; excuse me again for my english, and have a nice day !</p>

<p>you will not get banned for a modded game score the only thing that will happen is it will eventually get the reset/cheater brand applied to those who can see your account on xbox.com. &nbsp;now if a score is modded again after a reset THEN that account gets
 perm banned. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I know that, but I don't want it ! I haven't done anything, i don't want my GS reset because of something i've never done ! If it's possible to delete the modded achievements, i'm ok, but if they want to delete all the achievements (the modded AND the
 achievements unlocked by me) i'm not ok; I don't want to be banned branded as a cheater and never have the possibilites to unlock the reset achievements because of someone else, you know...</p>

<p>sorry it will happen they cannot remove individual ones its all or nothing. &nbsp;once the reset happens (and it WILL happen) all you can do is open up an unauthorized access claim by calling up support if they find out that it was not you that modded the score
 they can work with those who reset the score and have the cheater removed but the reset will stay sadly. &nbsp;if you want to get that score back on those games after the reset your ONLY option is to create a new account :(.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer; but seriously, if this happen, I think that Microsoft and the xbox are done for me ! I'm on the xbox live since 2006, spend a lot of money on games, gamertag change, subscription and other things ! And if I got reset because of someone
 else, i think that gaming is done for me; or maybe on PC, or next gen, but not on xbox one ! I mean, i've been on the live since i'm 12, i'm 20 now ! 8 years ! It's really sad...</p>

<h2>            microsoft arc touch mouse scrolls randomly</h2>
                    <p>The newest arc touch mouse is annoying.&nbsp; Love the idea, works fairly well but scrolls up or down the page randomly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the touch pad responds to my 3rd finger when it should only respond to my index finger.&nbsp; The mouse surface is wider than the space between my index and 3rd finger so there's no other place to put my third finger in order to stop it from
 randomly causing the mouse to scroll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Super annoying to be reading a document and then have the mouse randomly scroll away from the content I'm reading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to take my hand off the mouse if I don't want it to that unless someone knows of another way to disable the right half of the mouse's touch surface (I kinda doubt it)</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you referring to the device's own touchpad in addition to the Arc device?  If so have you tried disabling the device touchpad to use only the Arc mouse?  This can solve many problems.  
<br />
<br />Update the touchpad software from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.
<br />
<br />Then check the controls to adjust as necessary at Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad.
<br />
<br />Also there under Additional Options click the touchpad tab on Mouse Properties to adjust any settings needed there, including ticking the box to "Disable touchpad when external pointing device is attached" to avoid palm-drag on touchpad causing cursor to jump.
<br />
<br />If the problem is other than this please clarify so we cyan move on.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hey there Aprince, unfortunately there is no way to disable half of the scroll pad, but perhaps if  you use only two fingers (pointer and middle) on the mouse at a time the issue would be resolved? Just keep a wide enough space between fingers and use your pointer to scroll.

<h2>            I can&#39;t print a test page</h2>
                    <p>My printer won't print a test page or anything else when connected to my Windows 7 laptop, but it will print from other computers.&nbsp; When I attempt a test page I get an error message telling me that I can't, even though the printer appears to be online.&nbsp;
 I've tried to run a Microsoft automated fixer, but am told that I don't have permission, though I'm the only user and administrator of the computer.</p>

<p>Any suggestion for overcoming this issue will be appreciated.</p>

            <p>My computer&nbsp;is a Dell Inspiron (N5110) running Windows 7 Home Premium&nbsp;and the printer is HP Photosmart C5180.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;made no changes to the system of which I'm aware since owning it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem first appeared about two weeks ago and I have been unable to print since. &nbsp;There are no error codes given, but only a message indicating that I'm unable to a test page.&nbsp; After the computer is disconnected, then re-booted and re-connected, a
 test page will print, though very slowly.&nbsp; Subsequent attempts to print the page produce the above message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other attempts to print result in no messages and no response from the printer.&nbsp; Documents appear to remain in the spool.&nbsp; Other computers connected to this printer&nbsp;operate&nbsp;as expected and print as normal.</p>
<p>The Print Troubleshooter finds no problems.</p>

            <p>Yes, HP support was the first thing I tried.&nbsp; The fault is apparently not in the printer and none of the Troubleshooters, HP or Microsoft, can identify a problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As noted earlier,&nbsp;all but&nbsp;one of three computers here work with the printer, and that one computer won't print on either two printers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"Can't print the test page", or words to that effect, is the only error message that's produced by the non-functioning computer..&nbsp; Any attempt to print from an app, such as Microsoft Office, produces nothing but a spooled document and no print.</p>

            <p>Yes, the problem persists, though seems to have expanded.&nbsp; At one point all USB ports, one through which the printer is connected and two others, had failed to function.&nbsp; After following advise here, I opened Device Manager, uninstalled USB functions and
 re-booted the computer.&nbsp; As expected Windows re-installed all the USB ports, and while&nbsp;all of them now work, the printer still won't function from any of them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As noted above, I've tried using other computers with this printer, both Windows 7 and 8.1, and find that all will print.&nbsp; Only the subject computer fails to function, so the printer or its connection seems not to be the problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The HP "Print and Scan Doctor" utility shows nothing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also note that McAfee SAAS will not update nor can I cause it to&nbsp;scan the computer.&nbsp; I've run a Malware scan and found nothing of note, so I'm not sure if this is a related issue or not.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any further advise will be appreciated.</p>

It has no name.&nbsp;<br />
It doesn't open.&nbsp;<br />
Right-click produces menu consisting of:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; Cut<br />
&nbsp; Create Shortcut<br />
&nbsp; Delete<br />
<br />
Delete doesn't work. &nbsp;<br />
Trying to delete from Explorer doesn't work&nbsp;<br />
Trying to delete from desktop doesn't work&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are no properties, no file path, no nothing listed for this folder. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Have run anti-malware, anti-virus, etc several times.&nbsp;<br />
No result. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
What is this thing and how can I get rid of it???<br />
<br />
Thanks

<h2>            How do I enable DIPM for one internal SATA Hard Drive, but not the other, on Vista Home Premium 32-bit&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I own a 17 inch gaming laptop that contains two internal hard drive bays, purchased in June of 2008.&nbsp; It came with only one hard drive (traditional spinning-disk).&nbsp; It runs Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit, Service Pack 2.</p>
<p>My SATA controller is an Intel 82801GBM/GHM (ICH7-M Family); I believe it is a first generation SATA controller (1.5 gbps).</p>
<p>I recently received a 160 GB Intel X-25M SSD (second generation SATA, but fully compatible with first generation controllers, with no additional configuring or jumpers) as a gift from my wife.&nbsp; I removed my first hard drive completely, installed the SSD
 in the primary bay, and installed Windows, drivers, and the Intel SSD utility.&nbsp; I then reinstalled my original HDD in the second bay, wiped it completely, and reformatted it as one partition; it currently contains my music and other media files.</p>
<p>The Intel SSD utility tells me that I should enable DIPM for my SSD, as opposed to HIPM.&nbsp; This appears to take a bit of tinkering to do in Vista, and my situation is further complicated by the presence of my secondary (original) HDD, which would rather use
 HIPM.</p>
<p>I did read the article on the Microsoft support website about editing the registry to enable DIPM, and that is something I would feel comfortable doing; however, I only want my SSD to use DIPM, my HDD should continue to use HIPM, and I was afraid that the
 the suggested fix would enable DIPM for all drives.</p>
<p>If someone could let me know how I can enable DIPM for my SSD while continuing to use HIPM for my HDD, I would be much appreciative.</p>
<p>EDIT: My SSD Maintenance utility simply says that the status of the DIPM/HIPM settings "could not be determined." if Vista automatically chooses the correct setting and the SSD utility just didn't figure that out, that makes my life much easier; but it would
 be nice to know for sure, so I can either forget about the whole thing (if Vista already set it for me), or change the setting (if Vista didn't automatically choose the appropriate power management mode for each drive).</p>

            <p>You will need two SATA controllers: either both onboard or one onboard and one on PCI-E.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configure the one that doens't need TRIM/DIPM (not using an SSD drive) as non-AHCI (IDE/ATA-6 compatible) in the BIOS and the other (where TRIM/DIPM will be used) as AHCI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plug the drive for which you need DIPM to the AHCI controller. See <a href="http://www.abxzone.com/forums/f155/tip-how-enable-dipm-ssds-windows-120968.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Motherboard died and now can&#39;t activate Windows 10 - MS not interested&#33;</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I was without a PC for some eight or nine days whilst I replaced my motherboard which had died. Not a job I enjoyed and I took my time over it to make sure I did it right. Anyway, once it was up and running I installed Windows 7 and activated it with a call
 to Microsoft. I installed all my main software and got it all set up.<br />
<br />
Then came Windows 10...<br />
<br />
From Windows 7 I downloaded the Media Creation Tool and created a Flash Drive. I then installed Windows 10 Home and attempted to re-activate it. This is as far as I have got and currently MS have no interest in helping me any further! Why? Because I told them
 I was on the Insider Program and this was a technician who told me this. I was also told I would have to get help from the Insider Team or something like that.<br />
<br />
I have had Windows 10 Home on my PC since a few days before it went live in 2015. As far as I can see my PC was linked to my Microsoft account since I can sign-in to my account and can see it there. I have tried activating using the Troubleshooter and clicking
 on 'I made a hardware change to this computer recently' (or similar phrase) but it doesn't work as it comes up with error code 0x803F7001. I can definitely see the computer with my previous motherboard but MS is apparently finding nothing. Something I do note
 is that it it has 'Windows 10 CoreN (10.0.14393.321)' against it or at least it seems to. But what the blazes is it - I'd never heard of it until I saw that!<br />
<br />
So again I ask - where do I go from here? How do I get Windows 10 activated when currently MS won't talk to me because I was an insider and where do I get help from?<br />
<br />
Any help to get my Windows 10 activated would be most appreciated. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Tracey<br />
<br />
PS I have no interest in retaining my Insider Membership. When my motherboard died I was just waiting for the next general release and then dropping out of the program.

            Hi<br />
<br />
Thanks for your responses. Somehow I'm not surprised at Microsoft's attitude about this. Just think about it - they ask for people to join the Insider Program to test their programming, i.e. we the public are effectively working for them for nothing. We are
 then unfortunate enough to have a motherboard die and suddenly they forget about what they have got out of us and can't even let us continue using Windows 10. In the meantime those who have done nothing other than install the general release and use it are
 permitted to re-activate Windows 10 for free if the same thing happens to them whilst the former Insider has to
<strong>BUY</strong> a copy of Windows 10 in order to get up and running again!!! What a con! So perhaps someone can defend their position? Why have they adopted this position? What would it cost them to let those who have been doing their testing for them
 continue to use Windows 10? After it's still Windows 10 whether someone is on the Insider Program or not. No wonder Microsoft is not as popular as they would like. They certainly don't do themselves any favours with this attitude.<br />
<br />
Andre: I may have got the wrong end of the stick but entering <em>slui.exe 4</em>&nbsp;got nothing back when I pressed ENTER. However, having read your post again, maybe I needed to upgrade my Windows 7 installation to get any response from the command. Instead
 I did a clean install of Windows 10 to regain my dual-boot system. Anyway, albeit reluctantly, I've now ordered a Windows 10 Pro retail version (from a reputable source) which hopefully will sort me out.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again for your responses but I would be interested in comments to what I have said in the first paragraph above if anyone has any. I'd be very interested in how Microsoft justifies their attitude.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Unexpected reboots - How to fix repeated Windows 10 unexpected reboots</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I'm hoping someone may be able to help resolve a problem that has only started happening in the last two days - my laptop has unexpectedly rebooted twice in the last two days. I have not installed any new software or hardware, and at time of reboots
 I was doing nothing more than browsing the Internet (only a couple of pages open), and a couple of Word documents open – so nothing new and certainly nothing to 'exercise/stretch' the cpu! After reboots all documents or internet pages open are lost (if the
 Word documents have not been saved by me prior to the reboot - which suggests to me a type of forced reboot).&nbsp; The laptop is about a year old, and I've not experienced any rebooting/shutdown problems before.&nbsp; I have not installed any new software or hardware,
 and when I try to learn what may have caused the problem via the 'System Event Logs' it just states 'unexpected reboot' but shows no expansion on what may have caused the reboots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power supply is not abnormally hot, so am assuming I can discount this as a possible cause. The laptop is also not running any hotter than normal, and when the reboots happen, I have not done anything to trigger a reboot - in fact, it often happens after
 I have left the PC for a few minutes...which suggests to me that it may be due to problems going into sleep mode or idle...but even if this could be the problem, I wouldn't know how to resolve it. One other possible culprit could be the last Microsoft Windows
 10 Update which occurred on the 19/12/17.&nbsp; I am running Norton Antivirus...nothing seems to be showing any problems here either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or advice would be appreciated,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Steve</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My laptop is a standard HP Envy, AMD Quad A10, 8GB RAM, 1 TB HDD, AMD Radeon R6 Graphics Card, on Windows 10 (as shipped - no upgrades...and up to now, has been a joy to use)</p>

<p>Hello Stevie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are multiple possible reasons why a computer will restart by itself, from hardware to operating system issues. To assist you with your concern, we suggest that you perform a System Maintenance troubleshooter to isolate the issue. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> key on your keyboard.</li><li>Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click-on <strong>View all</strong> on the left side panel.</li><li>Click on <strong>System Maintenance</strong> and follow the onscreen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We would also suggest that you run the <strong>System File Checker tool</strong> to scan and fix corrupted system files. You can refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Jay Jap....thanks for getting back to me over the festive period!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press the Windows Key it generates the Windows 10 equivalent to the old fly-out menu and programs. So I typed troubleshooting in the taskbar search bar.&nbsp; Troubleshooting was not available, but 'Troubleshoot' was,&nbsp; After clicking on Troubleshoot, it
 opened Troubleshoot in 'Settings', but again, I was not able to find any 'System Maintenance' tabs or links...a search for System Maintenance in the 'Settings' search bar gave 'No results for System Maintenance'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Control Panel I did find 'Automatic Maintenance' (Control Panel\System and Security\Automatic Maintenance)...but as this is done automatically on a daily basis, I suspect this is not what you are suggesting I try.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running the sfc scan tool in Command Prompt (running as Administrator)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will update 24 hours after it has run (as the PC is unexpectedly rebooting on a daily basis, if it doesn't reboot tomorrow, running the sfc tool may have resolved the issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for taking the time to help me Jay Jap...much appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Stevie, thank you for the feedback. Since it is not showing through Cortana search, try searching
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in <strong>Control Panel</strong>, you will see and an option that says
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Then choose <strong>View all</strong> on the left side panel, then you should be able to locate the
<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</p>

<p>Hi Jay Jap, sorry for the delay in getting back on this post. Unfortunately, I followed the advice given, and spent hours/days when time was available Googling/searching for additional possible causes/remedies...and have to admit defeat on this quest!</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I am not experiencing daily random/unexpected reboots/shutdowns, I am still experiencing them...but too much time has been wasted on trying to resolve the problem. I suspect it all kicked off with a Window Update (set to automatic...and possibly therein
 lies my folly, but with all the malware etc, it seems like we're all between a rock and a hard place with deciding whether to allow auto-updates or getting caught out by exploitable outdated software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry I wasn't able to provide a possible solution for others experiencing this difficulty, but if it's any consolation to anyone, the unexpected reboots/shutdowns do get less and less...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now adopted a 'paranoid' system of opening a document I already have saved as 'unexpected reboots-shutdowns' each time I start the pc, I open it and copy/paste URLs as I browse to or&nbsp;web pages I open. I also regularly save each document that I have
 open, along with print-scrns of what docs I have open....which may seem like a lot of unnecessary faffing, but as absolutely nothing is saved by Windows when it closes/reboots (not even web pages) - you'll be glad you did!&nbsp; If nothing has happened, I just
 select 'all' in the document, then 'delete', then save and close - where it's ready for the next time I start the pc. It now takes me less than a minute to get all that I had open back up with little frustration when I do experience the reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Stevie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As what Jay Jap had mentioned, there are several factors that could trigger your computer to restart such as hardware problems or software conflicts. You may try the following troubleshooting steps to further isolate this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible hardware failure or system instability may cause the computer to reboot automatically. You may run the
<em>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter </em>to help identify what might be causing this problem. Please navigate to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot</strong>. Click <strong>Hardware and Devices &gt; Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try to start your computer in safe mode. This will help identify whether or not the issue is caused by
<span>your computer's default settings and basic device drivers. Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</a>
 for the steps.</span></p>
<p>You may also try rolling back the device drivers as it may have also triggered the problem. To roll back the drivers, just right-click the
<em>Windows key</em> and click <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Locate the device that has been updated recently. Right-click it and click
<strong>Properties</strong>. Click the <strong>Driver </strong>tab and click <strong>
Roll Back Driver</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update this thread with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When do you get the error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What happens when you try to update the printer?</span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the printer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Msvcr71.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the msvcr71 DLL file. In some cases,
 msvcr71.dll errors could indicate a registry problem, a virus or malware issue or even a hardware failure.
</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
</span><span>run the System File Checker utility:</span></p>
<p><span>Steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to desktop, Move your cursor to bottom left corner and right click on your mouse.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Command Prompt (Admin)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>A pop up window called “User Account Control” will appear.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Yes.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “ sfc&nbsp; /scannow “</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Enter button.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Check in Clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software
 conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </span></b><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1
 and step 2 without selecting the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility,
 and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these
 steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>
‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to
<span>Run a online virus scan:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Alt-Print Screen Captures Active Screen But With 2&#34; Black Margin on the Right.</h2>
                    After a hard drive crash and restore, my Alt-Print Screen does not work the same (Windows 10).&nbsp; While it captures the active window, it now has a 2" black margin on the right.

            What happens if you use Windows key + Shift + S then make a selection? Does it still capture the black border?
<br />
<br />This might be related to your display driver.
<br />
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

<p>After performing the steps you suggested, I still had the same issue using the "Alt-Print Screen" keys.&nbsp; However, in the process I learned how to better use the Windows Snipping tool to accomplish my objective. &nbsp; It just takes more key strokes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend told me Microsoft wants to discourage users from using the "Alt-Print Screen" keys and to use the Snipping tool instead.&nbsp; I'm not sure I buy that because the "Alt-Print Screen" feature works perfectly for me on other computers.</p>
<p>

            Thanks again for your help.&nbsp; Problem was finally solved after I mentioned it to a Tech Support person who helps me from time to time.&nbsp; He had me move the active window I was attempting to copy to my laptop screen and voila!, it didn't have the black border.&nbsp;
 Then after scaling my 2nd monitor to more closely match my laptop, the black border issued disappeared.

    <title>External speakers not working after factory reset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External speakers not working after factory reset</h2>
                    So I decided to factory reset my Toshiba Satellite L755 because I had a lot of junk on it. After the whole reset I wanted to put my music back on it so I ripped a CD to Windows Media Player and when I tried listening to it, I couldn't hear anything. I
 figured it might have been a problem with the media player so I went to YouTube and tried listening to music there but no luck, still no sound from my external speakers and I want to cry in the fetal position on my floor :(

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update Blew Away User Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> --aaron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Blew Away User Profile</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Box rebooted overnight to finish up the anniversary update install.&nbsp; This morning upon logging in, I get an error on the desktop folder, "You don't currently have permission to access this folder. Click Continue to permanently get access to this folder."&nbsp;
 Clicking Continue, my desktop remained completely empty.&nbsp; The same occurs for all other data folders - Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, etc.&nbsp; Requesting access to those folders, they too are empty.&nbsp; ALL of my data is gone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at my user profile folder (C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;) it is basically nothing, as if a brand new user were just created.&nbsp; All of my settings - obliterated.&nbsp; However, I do see all of my data under C:\windows.old.&nbsp; It appears that the Windows 10 update didn't
 complete fully and failed to migrate my data.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other problems that are likely related.&nbsp; I cannot click the start button - I get the doughnut for ~5 seconds, and nothing.&nbsp; It will not come up.&nbsp; The search bar - can't even click into it.&nbsp; Hotkeys work still.&nbsp; I am also unable to launch any settings
 apps (I wanted to look at Windows Update history and see what the result of this update was, or try running it again) using
<strong>ms-settings:</strong> it just throws an error "Package could not be registered" and then returns to a cmd prompt with "Access is denied."&nbsp; I tried to do a rollback to previous build - and get errors when doing that too.&nbsp; When attempting Restore: No
 restore point available.&nbsp; Running startup diagnostics: unable to diagnose "but I can shut it down for you if you'd like."&nbsp; Virtually all of these fail immediately...&nbsp; Not&nbsp;a few&nbsp;seconds, but immediately.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it seems evident that more than just my profile got destroyed; something is very wrong with the OS after this anniversary update.&nbsp; I've searched around and haven't been able to find a similar issue (closest is pieces and parts of this, but not the whole
 enchilada).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Thanks Jerry.&nbsp; Because the start menu is inaccessible/unresponsive, and because I cannot access Settings via "ms-settings:" the only way I could access a rollback option was by doing a Shift + Restart at the logon screen, Troubleshoot &gt;&nbsp;Advanced &gt; "Go back
 to the previous build."&nbsp; It reboots, asks for bitlocker creds, recovery key, then I click "Go back to previous build."&nbsp; Unfortunately, after just a second or two, I get: "We ran into a problem and wont be able to take you back to the previous build.&nbsp; Try resetting
 your current build instead."</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good try. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you didn't image the drive before all this. If you have important files to retrieve, that should be first order of business. Use the command prompt in the recovery environment to Copy C:\Windows.old to external media.</p>

            <p>I'd like to save that as a last-ditch effort.&nbsp; That effectively is reinstalling the OS from scratch; it won't do any good to mark "Keep my files" since Windows doesn't know of any files I have (they're all still in Windows.old and my user profile/folders&nbsp;are
 empty).&nbsp; And resetting would basically mean that this stupid anniversary update rendered my system totally worthless (which it's looking more and more is the case).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way instead to re-run the update, so perhaps it would pick up where it left off?&nbsp; It clearly failed at some point, though the system logs show no such error.&nbsp; Or, any ideas how I can get WU repaired (ms-settings:windowsupdate) so I can at least
 take a look at the history there and see if there's any feedback?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I copied the Windows.old directory off-box first thing (well, after falling out of my chair&nbsp;when realizing what happened and spewing profanities at this disaster)...&nbsp; Was glad to see my files were at least still nearby.&nbsp;

            <p>Reset&nbsp;shouldn't interfere with Windows.old (the previous build). But it's likely you're right that it would interfere with the setting which offers the return to previous build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know of a way to preserve that setting because I don't know where it is. Maybe somebody else here does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can't hurt to run things like sfc from the command prompt. But I'm not optimistic.</p>

            <p>Jerry - thanks for the replies. &nbsp;At this point, I'm likely to just start from scratch and reinstall everything from ground up. &nbsp;Needless to say, I'm extremely underwhelmed with how Microsoft handled this upgrade. &nbsp;Hopefully they are learning from the shortcomings
 (such as this one) for future upgrades. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
So since last time... &nbsp;</p>
<p>I eventually got *some* capability back by re-registering packages:</p>
<pre>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</pre>
<p>Lots of errors, but was enough to allow me back into settings. &nbsp;WU history showed that the Anniversary Update failed 5-6 times a full week ago! &nbsp;I was never notified of that. &nbsp;It didn't even show the update that occurred yesterday morning (success or fail).
 &nbsp;Which got me thinking... And I checked my version... &nbsp;Despite the "Welcome, we have some exciting new changes for you, let's get started..." screens I saw yesterday morning, it was still the old version!! &nbsp;This may be why there was nothing to rollback to
 (did a clean install of Windows 10 originally). &nbsp;Suffice it to say, it started the update, backed up *some* (later realized that even Windows.old didn't have everything in it) of my data, then apparently crashed during update and just gave up. &nbsp;In reality,
 my profile was basically a brand new profile on the *older* version (1511). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up adding a new local admin acct (had to use cmd line; UI was still hosed); used that to copy my profile contents (including registry) over from Windows.old, rebooted, and things looked much more promising. &nbsp;Still myriad issues, but looked better.
 &nbsp;Then I went in and forced the upgrade using the upgrade assistant (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=821403) since WU kept saying I was already up to date (ironic, since it had failed a number of times, surely it had to know I was NOT up to date)...
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That upgrade was successful, and things looked much better. &nbsp;However, I still have issues - some of my permissions are just jacked (like Favorites - I had to take ownership of them just to get access back to them), start menu search is not including my apps,
 etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already fixed a number of issues successfully, but I'm afraid of what else may be lurking under the surface that will come back and bite me, in typical Microsoft fashion, if I don't just wipe it clean and start fresh. &nbsp;Unfortunately, that sends me to
 2 days of reinstalling all of my apps, reconfiguring EVERYTHING, and hoping I remembered to salvage everything I need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short... &nbsp;This Windows 10 Anniversary Update, at least for me, was a complete and utter joke, waste of time, and disaster. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Whew! You certainly gave it a good try. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Windows.old didn't have everything in it</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm surprised at that. Not helpful to roll back to less than you had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; I'm likely to just start from scratch and reinstall everything from ground up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what I would do. Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's particularly unhelpful at this point to say this. But there is the future. We image our whole C drive to external media&nbsp;for every computer in the shop&nbsp;at least once a day (usually at 2am) - and especially before any significant change. We retain
 the most recent 30 images (mostly to recover from human errors). You can't be at the mercy of Microsoft.&nbsp;It's saved our bacon many times.</p>

            I got the same treatment. I don't have the time or skill to hunt all the things that could be lurking, so I'll just reload. I think I'll go back to Windows 7. I resent that unless you get the pro version that they can and do update YOUR machine any time
 they choose without warning. So, If you have open projects, documents and any CAD files open or simulations running poof they are all gone and when do you find this out why the next time you log into YOUR/their machine and it has been rebooted. Microsoft has
 turned home machines into useless Chromebooks, just a cloud machine, nothing serious like design or engineering. What a crock and they make you pay for it and make you think this is ok.<br />

    <title>Unwanted Speech Services - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmartin32  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted Speech Services</h2>
                    <p>When I "swipe down" using a touchpad on Windows 10, I often get a pop-up bar at the top of the screen that says, "To use dictation, go to settings and turn on speech services." I don't want this. I don't have a microphone enabled. Sometimes the service hangs
 up, and the unwanted bar cannot be closed. This blocks access to my browser tabs until I log off or restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I disable?</p>

<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Ease of Access - Speech
<br />
<br />On that settings page, is Speech Recognition turned on ?

    <title>new Skype version only accepts Microsoft accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elena angry  say:</h3>
<h2>            new Skype version only accepts Microsoft accounts</h2>
                    <p>hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated to the newest version of Skype and to my surprise I couldn't figure out to log in with my account. I have an old-school Skype handle, and while older versions let you log in
<em>with Skype or Microsoft account</em>, the newest seem to accept Microsoft accounts only. Is it there hidden somewhere or am I being forced to create a new Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back cause I could not figure it out, and now every time I open my Skype I see this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ac7bc33-1929-48aa-8e10-d2b72751bb5b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ac7bc33-1929-48aa-8e10-d2b72751bb5b?upload=true" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>what should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6e98ecd7-2e90-409c-aed1-52588612542f" title="Elena Angry">
<p>
</p><p>You may proceed with using your Skype name when logging in to your old or original Skype account the same way you log in to the previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why you are being asked to enter a Microsoft account is because Skype is under Microsoft services and the updated version 8.x&nbsp;is originally developed by Microsoft. Hence you can use your old Skype account log in. Just use your Skype name instead
 of the email address to log in to the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to uninstall the version you updated Skype with and use the classic version until you are unable to use it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the downloader link for the classic version of Skype: <em><a href="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi Ctrl+Click or tap to follow the link"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi</span></a></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the new Skype version 8.x is for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. For Windows 10 Anniversary update 1607 and higher, the version compatible with it is 12.x, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft store and is also originally developed by Microsoft.</p>

<p>This Stop Error has to do with the video card. Either the drivers are wrong or the card is failing. If you can get into Windows, uninstall the video drivers and install the correct ones. See below for where to get them. If you can't get into Windows Regular
 Mode, see if you can get into Safe Mode and uninstall the drivers from there. More details about your computer, your hardware, the machine's recent history, and whether you can get into Windows will help get you more focused troubleshooting. If uninstalling/reinstall
 drivers doesn't help then the video card may have failed and will need to be replaced.</p>
<p>Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />

            <p>Hi Anand,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>As I understand you are not able to connect jbl flip 2 speakers to your Lenovo laptop and this might happen because of the following reasons:-</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Bluetooth drivers need to be updated.<br />
2.&nbsp;Device not turned on.<br />
3.&nbsp;Your Bluetooth device is not added on your computer.&nbsp; </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I would really appreciate if you answer the following question:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is this issue specific to jbl flip 2? Can you use other wireless devices on the
<br />
computer?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I suggest the following methods for the issue and check if it helps:-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Run the hardware and device Troubleshooter</strong></div>

4.&nbsp; Run <strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If your problem still exists, proceed to <strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Start Bluetooth service</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I would also suggest you to start the Bluetooth service and set it to Automatic:</p>

<h2>            Japanese Language Pack cannot install. Computer is Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    I try to install the Japanese Language Pack on my Surface Pro 3 but it simply doesn't work. I tried all the way I could to download it but it doesn't download. It starts to download and then just stops by itself.

            This did not work. Let me explain the issue. I try to download the language pack and it starts, but after about 20 seconds it stops and I try again. It still doesn't work. For step 2. It simply just says 'These updates were not installed' and lists the
 language pack. I have an assignment due on Monday and it is frustrating not being able to type and finish my assignment.
