<h2>            Outlook notification are no longer automatically clearing from the action center</h2>
                    Just recently (maybe an Office update) but we have found Outlook notifications are no longer automatically clearing from the action center when they are viewed in Outlook. Since moving to Windows 10, when a user reads an email in Outlook it is cleared
 from the action center automatically.

</p><p>They keep giving all these answers back about how they're working on it and looking into it and suggesting we roll back to old versions of Outlook and other non-helpful suggestions.</p>

                    There are only 2 Speech Recognition training sessions that you read while training your computer to better understand you.<br />
I am really improving my English like this, and also Speech Recognition and I was wondering if there are any more speech recognition training sessions available for download?<br />
<br />
It would be really nice if you could take an article off Wikipedia and read it aloud while training your Speech Recognition. That way you are

improving reading</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">training your computer to better understand you</span>.<br />

<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker credits problem</h2>
                    I have created a movie with credits in movie maker.&nbsp; When I play it in the preview, it looks fine, but when I save it, the credits cut off.&nbsp; Roughly the last page of text does not appear in the scroll, but the movie is still playing.&nbsp; So, instead of seeing
 the last part of the credits scroll by, all you see is an empty&nbsp;black screen for about 6 seconds until the movie ends.&nbsp; I've tried saving the movie twice, and this happened both times.&nbsp; Can anyone help me figure out what's going on here or how I can fix this?

            <p>I believe this is a known bug that there is an internal limit to the amount of text you can scroll in your final movie.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Here are a couple other posts on this same topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-av/problem-with-credits-at-the-end-of-a-video-live/a58e510d-e3e3-4487-8108-13215d798e0b">Problem with Credits at the end of a video in Movie Maker</a></li><li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-program/credits-become-vertical-lines-in-1080hd-in-windows/f879f5b2-cc17-47f7-ae47-d610ae0a0a51">Credits become vertical lines in Movie Maker</a></li></ul>
<p>The best I can suggest is adding your symptoms to those threads and also <a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submitting feedback</a> to the Movie Maker team about this issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>By the way, are you using the <a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">latest version of Movie Maker</a>?&nbsp; I wonder if the issue might have already been fixed in the later version.&nbsp; The latest version is Movie Maker 2012 (16.4.3508.0205).</p>

    <title>Windows Updates Put Restrictions on My Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bb_954  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Updates Put Restrictions on My Laptop</h2>
                    After the latest Windows "Critical" Updates (Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2719857, KB27411355, KB2735855), Rollup for ActiveX Killbits for Windows 7 x64-based systems (KB2736233), IE-9 for WIndows 7 64bit (KB2744842) are automatically installed on
 my personal laptop, I can no longer click on hyperlinks in my email messages. I get security message to talk to an administrator because of restrictions put on my own laptop. This is my personal laptop so there is no administrator (just me). When I go to my
 security settings, I can't find where to turn that restriction off. Nothing works. It is frustrating because I only click on links in my email that I trust, so I don't need that restriction imposed. By the way, I'm pretty sure it is the Critical update that
 is the source because after performing a System Restore, then the links in my email messages work. Does anyone know how to turn that restriction off? I can't find where to change it in my Norton security either.

<h2>            Microsoft LifeCam Show Color Issue</h2>
                    
<p>I just received a new Microsoft LifeCam Show, and the color is off. I am wearing a dark brown shirt and its showing up as light gray. Other colors seem to be grayed out too.</p>
<p>I tried playing with the properties, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>

<p><span><span>If it persists on a different system also then, it might be that the product is defective. I would suggest you to return the product and exchange it for

<h2>            Unknown device with location &#34;on Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System&#34;</h2>
                    I have an unknown device with location "on Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System". Under the Hardware Ids, it's value reads "ACPI\INT33A0".
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an ASRock H77 Pro4/MVP, a Zotac GeForce GTX 670, an Intel I7 3770, Team Vulcan 16GB (4 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM 1600, and a Mushkin Chronos SATA 3 MLC SSD. All of these are accounted for in the device manager, except for the memory, of course.
 Furthermore, all of these should have the most up-to-date drivers already installed, but I could somehow be wrong.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know what the device is? Where I can get drivers for it? And what to do?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hopefully my answer isnt too late. But i ran today in the same problem. The unknown device is part of the Intel Smart Connect Technology. If u dont need it just turn it off in the BIOS/UEFI of the board.</p>

<h2>            Using Windows Live Mail with Gmail</h2>
                    <p>I recently replaced a DELL laptop. I am using Windows 7 professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to make folders in windows live mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use a Gmail account through windows live mail.</p>
<p>I want messages to come into Gmail <u>and</u> windows live mail. I wish to delete in either account
<u>without</u> losing the email in both accounts.</p>
<p>In windows live mail when I delete in my inbox my emails go in duplicate to unread mail.</p>
<p>Sent mail goes into all mail as well.</p>
<p>I also want messages to come into my desk top computer as well as my laptop computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have called Microsoft but because Windows live mail is free it is not supported by Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <blockquote>

<p>I am unable to make folders in windows live mail.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
Gmail doesn't use folders. It uses labels instead, so any message can have a number of labels. The default setup for Gmail accounts in Windows Live Mail is IMAP, so what you see in folders in the client is a mirror image of what you see under labels in webmail.
 You can choose which Gmail labels to be available in WLMail.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>I want messages to come into Gmail <u>and</u> windows live mail. <br />
I wish to delete in either account <u>without</u> losing the email in both accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
All messages sent to your Gmail address will arrive at Gmail. Using IMAP, they will also all arrive in Windows Live Mail. Because IMAP synchronizes Gmail labels with WLMail folders, a message deleted in the client will be deleted in webmail and vice versa.
 If you want to retain a message in the client but remove it from the server, move it to a folder under Storage folders. If you want to retain a message in Gmail but remove it from WLMail, apply a label that is not synchronized.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>In windows live mail when I delete in my inbox my emails go in duplicate to unread mail.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
I'm not quite sure what this means.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Sent mail goes into all mail as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
All mail is included in the <em>All mail </em>label. It's not usually a good idea to synchronize the
<em>All mail</em> label, because you will see duplicates. For example, any message in the inbox will also appear in
<em>All mail</em>.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>I also want messages to come into my desk top computer as well as my laptop computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Use IMAP in both places to see the same on both machines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;i purchased one year protection product of McAfee online yesterday but i couldn't install the&nbsp; product for my laptop.After then i contacted to&nbsp; McAfee technical support team who can help me. They also were being viewed online for 2 days at my laptop. They
 also couldn't install their product on my computer. I asked them that what happened to the product?&nbsp; They said to me that it depends on my windows system. I think their free trial version was completely working on my computer when i install the free trial
 product of McAfee before. After then&nbsp; when i finished to use the trial version, i purchased the one year proctection product of McAfee that's why i thought it didn't depend on my windows system.&nbsp; So what will i do?&nbsp; Are you possible to make sure my windows
 system online?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You should get your money back from McAfee. Make sure ALL versions, trials and others used or<br />
unused, are uninstalled and totally removed using the Removal Methods and/or the makers<br />
special instructions.</p>

<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi annigirl00,</p>
<p>a. Do you mean to say that while changing the track from one track to another there should be no pause in between?</p>
<p>You need to turn on shuffle and repeat items to get continuous playback.</p>
<p>When you turn on repeat, all items in the list pane will play once and then begin playing again.</p>
<p>Refer this link to turn on ‚ÄúShuffle and Repeat items‚Äù:</p>
<p><strong>Shuffle and repeat items in Windows Media Player<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Shuffle-and-repeat-items-in-Windows-Media-Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Shuffle-and-repeat-items-in-Windows-Media-Player</strong></a></p>
<p>To have a less pause use the Crossfading effect:</p>
<p>1. Right click on the playing video file, click on "Enhancements"-&gt; "Turn on Crossfading". Change the slider level to 1 sec of overlapping.<br />
This will reduce the pause between the two files.</p>
<p>If you are playing audio/video from CD/DVD, then there will be a pause of about 1second between tracks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Server 2016 Updates Failing</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows server 2016 which is failing updates. this was built as a terminal server and is 'identical' (not cloned) to another terminal server which is being updated successfully</p>
<p>I have used the Windows update troubleshooter.</p>
<p>I have deleted the software distribution folder and the catroot folder.</p>
<p>I have used DISM and SFC to scan and verify the system, neither came up with any issues.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the failing updates from the Catalogue and tried a manual install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can try to get updates to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Display issues after installing some Windows updates</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 screen tearing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello. A few weeks ago my PC received some Windows updates. After they were finished and reboot was done, I noticed some weird screen tearing on my display, wether I was on my desktop, browser or playing a game. First thing I did was update my video drivers,
 but problem remained. I decided to wait and see if it was an issue planned to be resolved in the next update. So after another update, problem remains, so here I am. I'm running 2 displays, the main one with AMD video card and the secondary one on the Intel
 integrated card. Everything on the Intel display seems to run fine, the tearing is on the main AMD one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a Windows issue? Or a driver issue? I have updated everything so I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3220 CPU @ 3.30GHz (4 CPUs), ~3.3GHzOperating System: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 10586) (10586.th2_release.151121-2308)</p>
<p>DirectX Version: 12AMD Radeon R7 200 Series Version 15.300.1025.1001</p>
<p>Intel(R) HD Graphics Version 10.18.10.4276</p>
<p>I'm uploading a sample from what I'm talking about. You can see the tearing on Firefox.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Tomas,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue you are facing seems like due to the graphics driver. Let‚Äôs try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps on resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1. </span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to go to the below link and try installing the latest updated AMD graphic driver</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows+10+-+64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows+10+-+64</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to boot in safe mode and check if you encounter the same issue. Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer with only basic service and functionality. If an existing problem doesn‚Äôt reappear when you
 start windows in safe mode, you can eliminate the defaults settings and basic device drivers as possible cause. Visit the below link on how to boot in safe mode:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Keep posting us with the status we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            Ok, so I downloaded and installed all drivers from Method 1 and I'm still experiencing screen tearing. But when booting in safe mode, it would appear that the tearing is gone (at least for the time I tested it). What's the next step then?<br />

            <p>I tried to manually go back to installed drivers. The problem is if I get an old driver version that used to work fine for me, the installation recognizes it as outdated and completely ignores it. So I tried uninstalling my current drivers in order to install
 the old ones and apparently Windows 10 automatically realizes I'm not running my drivers and downloads and installs them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. I too think this must be a driver related problem, since I've had issues with them in the past. I guess I'm going to move my discussion to amd support forums and see if they know what's going on.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Wireless controller receiver disconnects controller after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericwilson216  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Wireless controller receiver disconnects controller after some time</h2>
                    <p>I've been searching forums and trying all the solutions found but nothing has worked so far. The problem is this: I can connect to my controller, and most of the time it will be recognized as player 1. However, with both drivers (used wireless receiver 10.xxxxx
 from 2016 and 2.xxxx from 2009) the controller will usually work for a short period of time like 1-10 mins and then get stuck in a loop of sorts, where the last input state is repeated until the receiver is unplugged. i.e. If I am strafing left in a game,
 it will continue doing that, If I'm doing nothing it will continue doing that. </p>
<p>After this, the controller will still display as being player 1, but trying to connect the receiver and controller will result in the controller picking up the signal immediately but never setting as player 1 (or any player) needless to say, it also doesn't
 receive any further input. This indicates it should be a driver issue of some kind but I can't imagine what as it worked just fine until it stopped. Unplugging and replugging the receiver can sometimes fix this, but it starts the same short cycle and stops
 working soon or immediately after. Switching to a different USB port with the same driver has the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few possible things that occurred which the controller disconnected after, like tabbing out of the game, switching focus to a different monitor, but it seems like time is the main thing that results in the disconnect.<br />
<br />
I've tried switching between driver versions, running the driver installer in compatibility mode, restarting when the drivers prompts it, switching to the Xbox 360 controller driver for the **** of it, but nothing has so far seemed to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
This is a labtop that came with windows 10, using USB 3.0 ports, using it on Dark Souls 2, not that that matters but it does increase my level of despair at having to use PC controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions are welcome, I've run out of options and really want to get this working, especially since it did work with few or no issues at one point and I can't think of anything that has changed that would affect the receiver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Jay,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />

<p>Thank you, Anish.</p>
<p>I just saw your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are the answers of your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Yes. it is acually, 2136*2848 resoultion and converted into 400*533 when I see it on TV. On PC, I can see full size, full screen photo.</p>
<p>2) <br />
CPU: intel i3 4150<br />
VGA: ATI HD5770<br />
motherboard: asrock Z97<br />
OS: windows 8.1 x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked Samsung, and they said they don't know about this issue. they just added it might be a OS issue. When I use USB memorystick to see the exact same picture above, it goes well; full screen with full resoltion. Only "play to" features are bad.(no full
 resolution, no full screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked DLNA certification official administration, they said there would be some "TRANSCODING process" on trasnfering Photos from PC to TV.</p>
<p>

            <p>I¬¥ve got the exact same problem here, with an Samsung F8500 (Smart HDD recorder).</p>
<p>Play To any JPG picture will result in the F8500 will display the picture in 640 x 4xx on the TV set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I¬¥d test the same picture from my Xperia Z3 phone, play to the same Samsung F8500 device and TV. And it displayed just fine, (full screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something is wrong between Windows 8.1 using Play To, and the Samsung F8500, and probably several other Samsung products as well, but only when Playing pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung F8500 as well as several other Samsung products are Windows certified.</p>

</p><p>I was having the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But photoshop your image to 5000 x 2416 in dimension and save it as JPEG.</p>
<p>you should be able to see it full screen.</p>

<p>Sender of a recent email has been stored in Windows Mail somewhere.&nbsp; I don't need the contact any more, but it keeps appearing when I create a new email and the contact I'm sending to starts with a similar letter.&nbsp; Went into my address book, and cannot find

            Windows Mail maintains an auto-complete cache of the last 29 addresses you sent email to.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can delete the entire auto-complete list:<br />

<h2>            Update downloads progress bar &#39;stuck&#39; on 4&#37;.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron.&nbsp; Operating System windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 01 December 2015 my updates started downloading.&nbsp; My settings are for automatically download and install updates.&nbsp; There were about 15 updates notified.&nbsp; The progress bar reached 85% but I had to go out and turned off my laptop which prepared my computer
 for&nbsp;installing the updates, etcetera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next day however, only&nbsp;5 updates had been installed leaving the following:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586 with a message underneath saying -&nbsp;Waiting for Install.</li><li>The remaining 9 other updates relate to Microsoft Office Suite, for example, Excel, Word etcetera.&nbsp; They all had the same message underneath - Waiting for Download.</li></ul>
<p>The Windows Update page tells me that Updates are Available.&nbsp; Underneath the progress bar it says Downloading updates 4%.</p>
<p>It has&nbsp;displayed this information&nbsp;since 02 December 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time I have had this problem.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>Thank you for your email and prompt reply; much appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have Windows 10 installed (build 1056, the November update).&nbsp;&nbsp; The upgrade&nbsp;I mentioned in my original email, which is waiting to install,&nbsp;is an upgrade to that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the links you sent and as far as I can determine the instructions do not apply to my situation because I have the November update already.&nbsp; As a matter of interest, what is an ISO file?&nbsp; I do wish people would not use in-house/techo abbreviations
 and assume everybody knows what they mean.&nbsp; I was taught that when you ASSUME, you can make an **** out of U and ME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards and thanks again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ter 53</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just had another check and the Progress Bar is still displaying 4%.</p>

            <p><span>Hi RB</span></p>
<p><span>When you say ‚Äònot like Windows 7‚Äô, do you mean that you do not like Windows 7, or the Operating System you have is not like (as good as) Windows 7?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have Windows 7 you might be eligible to receive the FREE upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Look for the Windows icon in your taskbar.&nbsp; It should read ‚ÄòGet Windows 10‚Äô when you 'point' at it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By changing your Updates Settings to Receive Automatically, you will not have to run the Check for New Updates.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the System Restore you did worked, and if it did I would suggest you make a System Restore Point now, if you have not done so.</span></p>

 all new software. I am not impressed with Windows 10.looks like the system restore did not do the trick... Where do you live? I live in Seattle, WA. Talk to you soon. Thanks again...</p>

            <p>The game is recent enough not to require any Compatibility settings on Win10. </p>
<p>If you still have an older Windows version selected it would be best to clear this setting. Using compatibility unnecessarily has been known (rare) to prevent some games from launching (the 'Run as admin' option is

            <p>The game most likely ran OK on Win7 because HP has Win7 drivers available for the HD3000 graphics</p>
<p>on your machine from their web site.</p>
<p>There are no 'proper' ( from HP ) Win10 graphics drivers for Intel HD3000. The graphics are using MS's generic</p>
<p>Win10 graphics drivers. Not having suitable graphics drivers can result in lowered performance, or even</p>
<p>the game not recognising the graphics processor.</p>
<p>Add lower performance to a graphics processor that is only just capable of running the game when at it's best,</p>
<p>and you are likely to have problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel have posted is disclaimer on their site ( well there was one back when MS was pushing 'free' Win10 )</p>

<h2>            Font too small and re-sized Game Boards</h2>
                    <p>New Windows 10 upgrade... now Microsoft Mahjong and Sudoku are not showing properly.&nbsp; The main menu which shows the Daily Challenges is very small and to the upper left of the screen, the fonts on the games are too small to read and have been unable to resize.&nbsp;
 The problem also affects add-on chat boards, where fonts are too small and not legible.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Have made sure all updates are in place.&nbsp; Sadly, the "upgrade" erased all points/records of Daily challenges and Star Club Statistics.&nbsp;

<h2>            explorer.exe error, Normaliz.dll is missing</h2>
                    When I try and start my computer I get the above error. I get the same when booting in safe mode. The only thing that works is Task Manager. No desktop icon just a blank screen. Where do i start
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            From Task Manager, you can click File, hold down the Ctrl key and click New Task and that will open a Command Prompt (or boot into Safe Mode with Command Prompt).<br />
<br />
Then if you have your copy of normaliz.dll on a USB thumbdrive that is drive D (for example), and XP is installed on your C drive, you could type in something like this:<br />
<br />
copy d:\normaliz.dll&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
When the copy completes successfully, you will see a message like:<br />
<br />
1 file(s) copied<br />
<br />
You can <i>still </i>do it from Task Manager though:<br />
<br />
If you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
Explorer.EXE - Unable To Locate Component : This application has failed to start because Normaliz.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.
<br />
<br />
This will be in the Event Log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application Popup<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
Application popup: Explorer.EXE - Unable To Locate Component : This application has failed to start because Normaliz.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.
<br />
<br />
The normaliz.dll file is required for explorer.exe to start.&nbsp; If explorer.exe is not able to run, you will not be able to do much with your system until normaliz.dll is replaced.<br />
<br />
You can click OK to the errors and eventually get into Task Manager where you can try to fix it.&nbsp; The message may keep popping up from time to time while you are fixing it, so just click OK to close the message.<br />
<br />
If normaliz.dll is missing, you can copy it from a working system to the afflicted system with the same version of XP and Internet Explorer.
<br />
<br />
You will need to get a good copy and put it on a thumb drive, floppy, etc and copy it onto your afflicted system using Task Manager.<br />
<br />
The normaliz.dll file needs to be in the c:\windows\system32 folder and is not a Windows Protected File, therefore when the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" suggest running sfc /scannow, that is just another one of their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">wild goose chases</a> that will not work, it will never works and it will only waste your time (and they don't tell you how to run it either - if explorer.exe will not start).<br />
<br />
Then the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" will suggest you expand a copy of the file from the XP installation CD you probably don't have but it is also not on your XP installation CD, and you will have the same problem trying their suggestions to
 "try" to boot into any kind of Safe Mode, so that will not help you.&nbsp; These "experts" seem to think that booting into Safe Mode or Clean Boot will magically replace missing files, but it doesn't.<br />
<br />
You will also not be able to properly run a browser on the afflicted system to get on the Internet to download one.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There is a also great computer security risk in downloading normaliz.dll from some Internet site.&nbsp; The best idea is to get a copy of normaliz.dll from another computer that has the same version of XP and IE and replace it from a USB device (which you can access
 from Task Manager), or using a working system, you can download one from my SkyDrive.<br />
<br />
You can still use Task Manager to run System Restore and that might restore it, but I have never tried it and never use SR anyway.<br />
<br />
If you recently did a bunch of Microsoft updates, you may have also gotten IE8 so maybe something went wrong there even though the normaliz.dll is the same for either version.<br />
<br />
When you see the error, you can click past it and eventually get to your desktop background image where you can press CTRL-ALT-DEL to launch Task Manager. From TM you can click File, New Task,
<b>Browse </b>and change the drop down "Files of type" to <b>All Files</b> so you can see all the files in folders.<br />
<br />
Navigate to c:\windows\system32 to see if normaliz.dll is really missing. If the error pops up again while you are browsing, just click OK to get past it.&nbsp; The explorer.exe is trying to run and can't until the missing file is replaced.<br />
<br />
If that is the only thing missing, you can get one from a working system of the same type as yours, copy it to a thumb drive or floppy and still using TM, browse, copy and paste it where it needs to be or you can download one from my SkyDrive.<br />
<br />
From TM, you can still access your thumb or other even floppy media by browsing, copy, paste, etc all work just fine.&nbsp; You use TM to browse to your thumb or floppy drive, copy the good normaliz.dll and then paste it into the c:\windows\system32 folder where
 it is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
If things get worse, just go back into TM and delete the file to get back to where you were in the first&nbsp; place and continue troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using a working system, you can also download a copy of the file from my SkyDrive and put it on a floppy or USB thumbdrive and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sneakernet</a> it to the afflicted system.&nbsp; Sneakernet means you carry it over to the afflicted system by hand.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these two folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called normaliz when the file name really needs to be called normaliz.dll (if the downloaded file has no extension you will
 have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />
That may not solve all your issues, but you will at least be past that part and then we can fix the rest.<br />

<p>Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Usually, a phone's dedicated USB cable is needed to connect it to a PC. In addition, there's a specific setting that enables the device to be recognized and how you do this depends on the phone model that you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, we'll need more information to properly address your concern. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the model of your Windows phone?</li><li>Do you encounter any specific error messages when you connect your phone? </li><li>If yes, where do you see the error? Is it on the phone or in your PC? <br />
</li><li>Have you tried connecting your phone to a different USB port? What about a different PC?</li><li>Have you tried connecting a different device to see if it will be recognized properly?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Answering these questions will help us better identify the potential cause of the issue. Feel free to post back and provide additional information.</p>

<h2>            Reliability and Performance Monitor</h2>
                    
<p>I operate a Vista Home Premium based HP laptop.</p>
<p>I am finding that I can no longer access the Reliability and Performace Monitor. When I try to access the report I get the following message coming up. Error: An error occured while trying to generate this report. The interface is unknown.</p>
<p>I have searched the internet, but have not been able to find a solution.</p>

<p>I know how to solve this</p>
<p>try this:</p>
<p>go to Reliability and Performace monitor then in reports section on the left, click on system diagnostics then delete all generated reports&nbsp; (right click on each then delete) in there, then try to generate report again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the reason for this error is that you have canceled or closed the report while it was generating it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
