                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>Question: Is there any way how to get this corrected?
</span></p>
<p><span>Not that it has any effect on how the device is working.
</span></p>
<p><span>It's just since I do know what this device should be specified as, I'd like to change it.</span></p>

<p><span>Any help would be appreciated</span>.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this issue occur with other USB devices on the computer?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> If the device does not get detected then, run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to automatically try and fix the problem and check if that helps.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;‘Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter’</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Update the drivers for the Alesis Q49 midi controller and check if the issue persists. Refer the following link to update the drivers.</p>
<p><b>‘Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly’</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>: If the above step did not help then, uninstall and reinstall the USB controllers and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then click Control Panel.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".</p>
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hello, </span></p>
<p><span>and thank you for trying to answer my question, but this is not my problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>I guess I've not place it correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>My USB microphone is working perfectly.
</span></p>
<p><span>The issue that I was asking about is with Unspecified Device in "Devices and Printers" where the microphone is detected under "Unspecified" as AK5370(that would indicate Logitech product, that
 I don't have) in fact it is Model:RF-USBMIC by Rocketfish</span></p>
<p><span>In Device Manager under "Sound, video and game controllers"s it is listed as USB Audio device with no problem and with driver from Microsoft version
 6.1.7601.17514 from 11/19/2010. </span><span>Rocketfish does not supply driver.
</span></p>
<p><span>So the question remains: Is it possible to have Windows 7 recognize it correctly as such?
</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe just cosmetics but.</span></p>

            I gather "Rocketfish" is a brand.&nbsp; There appear to be several brands selling similar/identical products.&nbsp; I bought one from "Dynex.&nbsp; Apparently Logitech had one also but no longer available.&nbsp; I have the same issue you posted, microphone works perfectly
 but is "recognized" as an Unspecified Device.<br />
<br />
This isn't a solution but I thought you'd appreciate knowing that you are not alone.&nbsp; Maybe we should worry about other things.<br />

<p>Hello Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that <em>Macromedia</em> <em>Projector</em> is an app that is required in order to run your game. That being said, can you tell us what game you're trying to run? Also, is this the first time you're running the game? If yes, it would be better
 to contact the game developer for better assistance regarding the require app needed to run their game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

            Hi, Thank you for getting back to me. No, this wasn't the first time. I played Hidden Expedition game. But I un&nbsp;installed Macromedia Projector. So, Saturday&nbsp; I re-installed Windows 10. Now I can play my game from the CD. All is well. Thank you, Anna.

    <title>Keyboard and mouse stop working at login screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard and mouse stop working at login screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Short story: Whenever I get to the Windows login screen, the keyboard and mouse stop working, rendering me unable to control the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story: I have a HP Compaq CQ58-201SA Notebook pre-installed with Windows 8. I accidentally deleted the recovery partition from the PC, and I needed to Refresh it, so I used a Windows 8.1 installation ISO file. After re-installing Windows, there were
 no problems, except the Wi-Fi wasn't working, even after installing drivers. I read somewhere that it's a good idea to delete the driver for the device in Device Manager, and then rebooting the PC, and letting it recognise and install generic working drivers
 for the adapter. So I did. When I rebooted again, I got to the login screen, and the Wi-Fi icon comes up as connected again, so it worked. But, my keyboard and mouse have stopped working now. They work at boot time, in the BIOS, in the Windows Recovery Environment,
 BUT, not in Safe Mode... and as soon as I get to the&nbsp;login screen, regardless of whether I'm in Safe Mode or not, they don't work. I have used an external mouse and keyboard. The lights come on for the external mouse, and then back off again as soon as the
 Login Screen shows up. By the way, I can use the Brightness buttons and the Airplane Mode Toggle on the function keys of the keyboard, but nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>
<p>Ali Hamza Mohammed</p>

            does these steps require login into windows ? because we obviously cannot do that . or device manager and troubleshooter shortcuts does works at booting ?

<h2>            Tales From The Borderlands achievements glitched.</h2>
                    
<p>My gamertag is Renegade Zephyr.<br />
<br />
I bought the season pass for Tales From the Borderlands by Telltale Games during the first time it was on sale(some time in December). I love how the series started, and I certainly enjoyed episode 2 from it just as much. I played episode 2 late on the night
 of 1st day release, so I figured there might be some glitches but not towards the achievements.<br />
<br />
I completed episode 2 after midnight, earning all the achievements for it which simply requires beating the episode; leading to a total of 400g(200g for the episode). During that night, I checked and it said 7 of 7 achievements unlocked, but there were 14 total
 after episode 2 came out. I figured it'd fix itself, and it slightly did.&nbsp;The next day and since it's told me I have 7 of 14 achievements unlocked, but when I click on the game it shows I have all 14 of 14 unlocked. I tried replaying the episode to see if
 it'd change anything, but it still remains the same. I also calculated my total gamerscore from every game with the 200g that's missing onto it. The number that comes out as a result is EXACTLY above what Xbox displays I have. So, to sum up and make simply,
 I have the achievements earned, but it's saying I don't and it's taken away the 200g from my overall score. But if I click the game, it shows I have them all. Replaying the episode didn't change anything.<br />
<br />
I'm an Achievement Hunter, so I please do need this fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Renegade Zephyr</strong> - I'm sorry to hear about the achievement issue, but with that said, thanks for posting up the detailed information. Let's try out some troubleshooting steps to see if we can get these achievements to sync up with your account.</p>

<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/delete-xbox-live-profile-from-xbox-360-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete your profile</a>&nbsp;<b>ONLY&nbsp;</b>from the Xbox 360 console.
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear the Xbox 360 cache three times</a>.
</li><li>Sign into Xbox.com with your account and check the achievement profile for the&nbsp;<a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Compare/Xbox/1480660026?gamertag=Renegade%20Zephyr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Tales from the Borderlands</a> game.
</li><li>Redownload your Gamertag back onto your Xbox 360 console. </li><li>Wait <strong>at least 3</strong> days to see if those missing achievements will pop while still trying to unlock other achievements in the mean time.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>If after 3 or more days have passed since you've tried these troubleshooting steps and nothing has changed, please post back and let me know. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>DOOM064</strong> - I'm sorry to hear about the achievement issues. I would suggest giving the troubleshooting steps above a try. If those don't do the trick for you, I would then recommend creating a new thread for what you're experiencing. This
 way you can receiving support catered specifically to you from our community. Thanks so much!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Steve̶, that is the Problem . . .
<br />
<br />You have already moved your Pictures folder to e new folder on your D Drive called Documents . . .
<br />
<br />You need to change the location of the Pictures Library to D:\Pictures
<br />
<br />Then change the location of your Documents folder to D:\Documents
<br />
<br />These need to be in separate folders on your D Drive . . .

<h2>            Can&#39;t open jpegs since update this morning</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very frustrated by the fact that I've just installed updates to windows 10 and now I can't open jpegs at all.&nbsp; First I tried from Windows Mail which is where I noticed the problem but now I can't open a normal jpeg file from anywhere.&nbsp; It also just so
 happened that after I installed the latest updates and prior to realizing I had this problem, I had a pop up window ask me if I wanted to clear previous updates because my computer was filling up and I said yes, so I can't revert back to an old one.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
 error message when trying to open a jpeg is something like "Windows cannot find the file"....then the file path, then it asks me to make sure I typed the name correctly.&nbsp; I've checked the program source that is opening the file and it says TWINUI and won't
 give me a photos option. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!! </p>
<p>

            Which application are you trying to view the JPEG in?
<br />
<br />If its the Photos app, try resetting it.
<br />	Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />	Scroll down to Photos
<br />	Select it
<br />	Click Advanced options
<br />	Click Reset
<br />
<br />	Restart
<br />
<br />	Check the Store for updates then check if you open JPEGs again.
<br />
<br />Also, point to one of the JPEGs, right click it 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, click Change
<br />Choose Photos
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />Try opening the JPEG
<br />
<br />If that does not work, right click the JPEG, click Open with, click Paint to see if it opens.

<h2>            Speech recognition slows down in Word&#59; doesn&#39;t show new text.</h2>
                    
<p>When I run Speech Recognition in MS Word, it is very slow to respond.&nbsp; Also, the cursor will move, but it only shows blank space until I dictate a period, say the "press enter" command, or move the area off the screen for a moment.&nbsp; Speech starts off running
 fine, and gradually slows down.&nbsp; When it gets really slow, it has difficulty doing any corrections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had an issue similar to this some time ago, and had to get some type of patch.&nbsp; I remember that it was emailed to me.&nbsp; I think there was a hyperlink in the email that I had to follow, and it had a password at the linked site.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi jeramee,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does speech recognition work properly with other applications like notepad or word pad?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From where did you get the patch?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that some third party program installed on the computer is conflicting with the speech recognition performance in Microsoft
 word.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you perform clean boot procedure and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong></span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>

<p>1. Speech recognition works with WordPad the same as it does with Word.&nbsp; It starts off fine for a few minutes, but then begins to slow down.&nbsp; When it needs to do a correction, it slows down almost immediately.&nbsp; I can get one or two corrections done if I
 am lucky, then the entire program slows to a crawl.</p>
<p>2. The last time it worked ok was about a month to 6 weeks ago.&nbsp; I don't think I have added any programs that run&nbsp; routinely since then.&nbsp; I did add Logitech's SetPoint for a mouse I purchased a couple weeks before that.&nbsp; The program&nbsp;isn't running in the
 clean boot environment, and it isn't making a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The patch came from microsoft.&nbsp; I looked for the email that it came in, but I have deleted it.&nbsp; I remember that the email code was time sensitive.&nbsp; It was only good for a few days, maybe a week.</p>
<p>After performing a clean boot, the problem continued.&nbsp; I didn't go past step 1 because that is just adding back services.&nbsp; (Since the problem is still occurring without any of those services running, then, logically, adding them back won't make it stop.&nbsp;
 Correct me if I missed something.)&nbsp; Please tell me there is a simple patch for this.&nbsp; I really, really like Speech Recognition, but, with my class schedule, I don't have a lot of time to spend doing diagnostics.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>

<p><span>Hi Jeramee,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This may also occur if there are some corrupt system files on the computer. I would suggest that you run a SFC scan which would
 scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Steps to perform SFC scan:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button</span></p>
<p><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening.
 You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></p>
<p><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'the system scan will begin'</span></p>
<p><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any
 integrity violations"</span></p>
<p><span>11. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that it finds. If information
 from the installation CD is needed to repair the problem, you may be prompted to insert your Windows Vista installation disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Halima,</p>
<p><span>I ran the SFC scan, and restarted the computer.<span>&nbsp;</span>This change the problem somewhat.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now, instead of not showing the text that I’ve spoken into speech recognition, it turns entire lines of “paper” black until I use the mouse to move the black portion of the screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When it comes back, it’s just fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I clicked the link below (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a>),&nbsp;and followed the first set of
 commands, including the "edit detailssfc.txt" command.<span>&nbsp; </span>The message I get back states:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Cannot repair member file [1: 24 {12}] “settings.ini” file of Microsoft – Windows – Sidebar, Version= 6.0.6 002.18005, pA = Processor_architecture<span>&nbsp;</span>AMD64
 &lt;9&gt;, Culture neutral, VersionScope = 1 nonSxS, PublicKeyToken ={1:8 B: 31bf 3856ad 364e 35}, Type neutral, TypeName neutral, PublicKey neutral in the store, hash mismatch</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think this means the settings.ini file of sidebar is corrupted.<span>&nbsp;</span>I’ve tried to use the takedown/F path_and_filename command, but
 I have two issues.<span>&nbsp;</span>First, I’m not sure where to find the path and filename of that program.<span>&nbsp;</span>Second, I need to know where I can get and uncorrupted copy of that program to use as a replacement file.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also,
 when I get the replacement file, do I need to store it in a particular place, where can I download into the temp files, and use it from there?</span></p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p><span>Hi Jeramee,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It looks there the Windows sidebar file is corrupted. I would suggest that you reset the sidebar to default and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open up a windows explorer window and then paste the following into the location bar:</span></p>
<p><span>%localappdata%\microsoft\Windows Sidebar</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This will open up the Sidebar gadgets folder, where you should see a file named Settings.ini</span></p>
<p><span>Now you will need to rename the file to settings.ini.old and later close all t he windows restart the computer, check if it
 works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Halima,</p>
<p>I renamed the Settings.ini folder &amp; restarted, but the problem persists.&nbsp; Should I uninstall Sidebar?&nbsp; At this point, I need a quick fix - this is taking me away from my studies too much.&nbsp; I would be willing to just get rid of Windows Sidebar in order to
 have speech recognition functioning again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>It appears that Sidebar can't be uninstalled.&nbsp; I removed ALL of the gadgets, and this has helped with the main problem.&nbsp; However, there are still some issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft word, I direct the computer to capitalize a word, and then say "repeat" to capitalize a second word.<span>&nbsp;</span>Instead of capitalizing the second word, speech recognition
 inserted the first word into the second where the cursor was positioned in the second word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the "click" command works, and sometimes it doesn't.<span>&nbsp;</span>For example, when I have text highlighted and say "click bold," sometimes it will format the text as bold,
 but other times it inserts " click bold" into the text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p><span>First I would suggest that you check if similar occur in the WordPad.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue only persists in the Microsoft office word then I would suggest that you repost your query in the Office forums using

<h2>            IR Blaster Xbox One - Please help. Spent 3 hours with tech support and they couldn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t even understand</h2>
                    I pre-ordered the Sunset Overdrive bundle. It got here and I re. ized I needed an IR cable to use some of the features. I live in Alabama and no one has them in stock around me. So, I ordered one online. It didn't work and holding my Samsung S3 camera
 up to it, I couldn't see a light (I can if I do that with remotes). So, I ordered a different style from a different place. It got here and the same thing happened. Both were single emitters. Both have 3.5 mm jacks with two bands. Please help. I don't want
 to send it back because I love it, but if I can't get tech support and can't use all the features, I'm going to have to. I just need a cable that works or to know the console is broken.

<p>Ira: Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Ira. Please give me a moment to review your question.</p>
<p>Michael: Ok. Basically, I go into setup oneguide and select satellite box. I try to send the power off, but holding the camera up, I do not see the infrared signal being sent. I've bought two different styles from two different places and neither work when
 plugged into my xbox</p>
<p>Michael: I can view the infrared from the regular tv remote holding my camera up</p>
<p>Ira: Thank you for that information Michael and just to verify, you are having an issue with your console and TV connection, right?</p>
<p>Michael: with changing the channels using an IR emitter cable</p>
<p>Ira: Alright, can you please explain further regarding this concern?</p>
<p>Michael: I just did. I plug the IR extension cable in, I go into setup. It tries to send a power off to the box, but holding a camera up and I can't see an IR signal being sent. I've tried two different cables from two different places</p>
<p>Ira: Thank you for that information, please give me a moment to review my resources here regarding your concern.</p>
<p>Ira: Thank you for waiting Michael, can you please try to apply these steps with your console ?</p>
<p>Michael: ok</p>
<p>Ira: Please go to Settings&gt;&gt;Disc &amp; Blu-ray &gt;&gt; Persistent Storage &gt;&gt; Clear Persistent Storage.</p>
<p>Michael: Even though this has nothing to do with the discs at all?</p>
<p>Ira: Yes Michael, this is like a clearing of unwated files which may affect the connection of this set up.</p>
<p>Michael: Ok...one sec</p>
<p>Ira: Oh sure Michael.</p>
<p>Michael: no</p>
<p>Michael: It did nothing</p>
<p>Ira: As long as you followed my instruction, it's alright.</p>
<p>Ira: Now, please go to Settings&gt;&gt; Network&gt;&gt;Advanced Settings&gt;&gt; Alternate MAC address&gt;&gt; Clear and restart.</p>
<p>Michael: Ok...but these have nothing to do with the IR cable</p>
<p>Ira: Alright, can you please try to set up the oneguide again?</p>
<p>Michael: Did nothing different</p>
<p>Ira: Alright, you are trying to set up Oneguide, right?</p>
<p>Michael: I'm trying to set up the xbox to control the set top box</p>
<p>Ira: What do you mean to control the set top box?</p>
<p>Michael: the satellite box....to be able to change channels using an IR cable</p>
<p>Ira: Oh thanks for that Michael. so your satellite box is not listed on the screen?</p>
<p>Michael: Can you give me your supervisor?</p>
<p>Michael: or next tier tech support</p>
<p>Michael: or somebody?</p>
<p>Ira: I apologize for this Michael but please give me a couple of minute to review this with my resources here.</p>
<p>Ira: Thank you for waiting Michael , upon reviewing my resources here that it is possible that this is not recommended with Xbox device that is why we cannot set this up successfully.</p>
<p>Michael: Can you give me next tier tech support or a supervisor?</p>
<p>Michael: Please connect me with the next tier technical support or a supervisor who may be able to understand the problem I'm having and help me solve it. I've been in here for 30 minutes and you've not been able to understand my problem. So, please hand
 me off to someone who may be able to help me. Thank you.</p>
<p>Ira: Alright, I understand you Michael and please give me a moment to connect you with our supervisor.</p>
<p>Michael: Thank you</p>
<p>info: Your chat transcript will be sent to <strong>[Mod Removed - Please don't post personal information]</strong>&nbsp;at the end of your chat.</p>
<p>Ira: Sorry for the long wait and I have now the supervisor and I will be connecting you for a moment.</p>
<p>Michael: ok</p>
<p>Michael: anyone yet?</p>
<p>Ira: I'm now connecting you to our supervisor this may take for a while.</p>
<p>Michael: Am I really going to have to send it back to the store because I can't get tech support for it after I bought it?</p>
<p>Ira: Alright, I am currently finding another manager for you because my manager is current engage to another customer. Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>Ira: Thank you for waiting Michael and while I am finding another manager for you I just need you to go to
<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://myservice.xbox.com</a></p>
<p>Ira: Please log in your account and register your Xbox Console first so that we can also check it here on our end.</p>

<p>Michael: yes</p>
<p>Ira: Thank you for that Michael and thank you for that it really helps.</p>
<p>Ira: Alright, can you please click to this link that I will provide.</p>
<p>Ira: Click Here</p>
<p>Michael: I've seen that link. That is what I've used from the beginning</p>
<p>Ira: I've exhausted everything here in my end and as I checked, you need to connect this cable at the back of your console on the port "IR out".</p>
<p>Michael: One hour ago, you told me that you'd give me a manager. I asked to escalate this call to an upper level tech support or a manager</p>
<p>Michael: I've been waiting one hour for that to happen</p>
<p>Ira: Yes Michael, I am still waiting for the manager for you and I am pulling up information regarding this issue as well. Don't worry, you will be connected to our manager for a while.</p>
<p>Francis: Sorry to keep you waiting Michael. This is Francis, one of the managers on the floor.</p>
<p>Michael: Hi</p>
<p>Francis: Hi Michael.</p>
<p>Francis: Sorry if it took as a while. We've been receiving a lot of volume today</p>
<p>Francis: us*</p>
<p>Michael: I'm hoping the problem I'm having is a simple one, but I've been in chat for 1 1/2 hours and the last person could not understand my problem or do anything other than read the website to me</p>
<p>Michael: I didn't know I needed an IR cable when I bought the Xbox One, but after I bought it, I purchased an IR cable. I plugged it in and it couldn't send a power off during setup. I held a camera up to it and couldn't see an IR beam. I bought another
 IR cable and the same thing is happening</p>
<p>Michael: On this website: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/live-tv/use-external-ir-with-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../use-external-ir-with-xbox-one</a> It says What kind of IR extension cable can I use with Xbox One? Almost any off-the-shelf IR extension cable will work with your Xbox One, as long as it meets the following requirements: It connects using
 a 3.5mm jack (similar to a pair of standard headphones). It has three or fewer emitters.</p>
<p>Michael: I've purchased two. Both were single emitters and neither have worked when plugged in to the xbox one</p>
<p>Francis: Just to confirm, you were trying to setup your cable/satellite box with the console and your remote is not sending a signal or is not being detected.</p>
<p>Michael: Not my remote....an IR cable</p>
<p>Francis: Could you provide a link or image for the IR cable that you were using so we could double check the information?</p>
<p>Michael: Sure...I bought two different styles from two different places</p>
<p>Michael: Let me get you links</p>
<p>Francis: No problem</p>
<p>Michael: This is the first one I tried</p>
<p>Michael: <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/5ft-IR-Extender-Cable-Sender/40499948" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.walmart.com/.../40499948</a></p>
<p>Michael: and this is the one I just tried</p>
<p>Michael: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/350843042271?_trksid=p2060778.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.ebay.com/.../350843042271</a></p>
<p>Francis: thanks</p>
<p>Francis: Did you check the IR by using a camera phone?</p>
<p>Michael: Yes...and I couldn't see a light on either, but if I aim my camera at a remote, I can see the light in the end, so I know my camera can do it</p>
<p>Francis: Hmm..</p>
<p>Francis: Are you using an android phone? I know it did detect the IR signal from the remote so it should also register the IR from the IR cable, but there are some phones that do not show certain levels of IR.</p>
<p>Michael: Yes. I'm using a samsung galaxy s3</p>
<p>Francis: That should be good.</p>
<p>Francis: Does your cable/satellite box have an option for an extension for its own IR? There are third party IR devices that doesn't work on the console so we normally advise to have a kinect setup with it.</p>
<p>Francis: I'm currently checking for other possible options here.</p>
<p>Francis: This is the basic guide for IR extensions that we have.</p>
<p>Francis: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/live-tv/use-external-ir-with-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../use-external-ir-with-xbox-one</a></p>
<p>Michael: No...not that I know of. I saw that page and it says any 3rd party should work as long as it has the right jack and 3 sensors or less</p>
<p>Michael: so I got single sensors</p>
<p>Francis: Just to check, the console already recognized the box and the TV, is that correct?</p>
<p>Michael: no..because it can't get past the IR cable portion of the setup</p>
<p>Michael: it can't send the original power off</p>
<p>Francis: Does the box have an HDMI port on it and is it already connected to the console?</p>
<p>Michael: Yes.....it's playing TV through it</p>
<p>Francis: I'm trying to recreate your issue just to be on the same page</p>
<p>Michael: Ok... If I select tv, it plays my tv...through the hdmi passthrough</p>
<p>Michael: then when I go to set up my cable box, it asks me if I want guided, I say yes</p>
<p>Michael: then it asks what I have....directv</p>
<p>Michael: then it tries different codes to send a power off</p>
<p>Michael: they don't work and if I hold a camera up to the sensor, I don't see the light</p>
<p>Francis: The image that you showed me from walmart, does the IR receiver have 2 or 3 black bands on the plug? 3 indicating that it's a 3.5mm jack.</p>
<p>Michael: let me check</p>
<p>Francis: I mean the one from the image is just an example.</p>
<p>Francis: So you might have something different.</p>
<p>Michael: one sec</p>
<p>Francis: No problem.</p>
<p>Francis: Take your time.</p>
<p>Michael: both look like they have 2 bands</p>
<p>Francis: I see.</p>
<p>Francis: That may be the cause of our problem.</p>
<p>Francis: The console needs the one that has 3 black bands on it which is a 3.5mm jack.</p>
<p>Michael: I just looked it up and it says 2 bands is 3.5 mm and if it has 3 bands it contains a microphone</p>
<p>Francis: It's actually similar to a headphone jack.</p>
<p>Francis: It's the same information we have on the link</p>
<p>Michael: yes...these are just like a headphone jack</p>
<p>Michael: So I need one with 3 bands?</p>
<p>Michael: Do they even make them?</p>
<p>Francis: I'm double checking any other options for this. You've already spent so much.</p>
<p>Michael: I just want to make sure it's the cables and not the xbox that is faulty</p>
<p>Francis: I totally understand. I'd hate to make a pingpong out of you. That's why we're trying your issue on our end as well. Would it be okay if we tried to do a factory reset on the console and make sure that the update installs then setup the cable again?</p>
<p>Michael: ok...will that delete my games?</p>
<p>Michael: I've got ryse, sunset overdrive and minecraft downloaded to it....</p>
<p>Francis: The games are associated to your profile as well, this means that once you download your profile to the console again, you'd be able to queue all your games again.</p>
<p>Francis: I'm currently double checking the license withIra on your account so we don't encounter any issue.</p>
<p>Francis: with Ira*</p>
<p>Michael: I'd rather buy a cable than redownload three games honestly</p>
<p>Francis: I understand.</p>
<p>Francis: Another way around this if you're willing to do it, since most retail stores have their own internet. You can bring the console with the IR cables so you can personally test it on the spot.</p>
<p>Michael: Well, that's another thing..... there are no IR cables in town. I have to buy them over the internet</p>
<p>Michael: That's why it's taken this long. I have to buy it then wait a week for it</p>
<p>Francis: Oh.</p>
<p>Michael: Walmart, best buy, radio shack....no one has them in stock</p>
<p>Francis: Do you have any friends or family members that also have an Xbox one?</p>
<p>Michael: Only one....with a kinect</p>
<p>Francis: That is actually perfect since they have a kinect.</p>
<p>Francis: You can try to setup the box with the kinect and see if the console works fine with it.</p>
<p>Francis: That way, we can safely say if it's a console or IR cable issue.</p>
<p>Francis: Use their kinect with your console. Once the setup completes and your console works.</p>
<p>Francis: Then it's the IR cables that are not compatible.</p>
<p>Michael: Ok....he lives an hour away... I'm in Alabama. Can you point me towards a cable that WILL work so I can buy it and know whether it's the console or cable?</p>
<p>Francis: Microsoft hasn't released any official version of the IR adapter yet. Normally, the setup is done with the cable/ satellite box using an Xbox with Kinect. The Xbox One without Kinect came out only a few months back.</p>
<p>Francis: By the way</p>
<p>Francis: Does your box have an option for IR out from it?</p>
<p>Francis: Like a port where you can stick a cable into it?</p>
<p>Michael: No..it's a directv box</p>
<p>Francis: I get it.</p>
<p>Francis: I'm currently checking for possible third party devices.</p>
<p>Michael: Ok thanks</p>
<p>Michael: If you find one that WILL work I'll buy it and then know for sure</p>
<p>Francis: Ira and I are checking for possible sources as well.</p>
<p>Michael: ok thanks</p>
<p>Francis: Sorry if this is taking forever.</p>
<p>Michael: thanks</p>
<p>Francis: If you prefer, we could send an email in a few minutes so that you can be mobile. So far we haven't found any specific brand that has been suggested.</p>
<p>Michael: ok thanks</p>
<p>Michael: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Francis: Thanks.</p>
<p>Francis: Just to confirm, this is also the email associated with the gamertag, is that correct?</p>
<p>Michael: yes</p>
<p>Francis: Sorry for the wait.</p>
<p>Francis: Your reference number is XXXXX.</p>
<p>Francis: You'll receive an email from us in about 30 mins regarding a possible retailer or at least a suitable model that has been suggested online by Xbox users.</p>
<p>Michael: thanks</p>

<p>Here is their email back to me and my reply:</p>
<p>It is absolutely insane that I spent almost three hours in chat and now you </p>
<p>waste my time completely and do nothing to solve the issue.</p>
<p>1. If you look on that page (which only covers one model of directv boxes), IT
</p>
<p>EVEN HAS A SOLUTION THERE TO THAT PROBLEM:</p>
<p>Known Solution</p>
<p>1. Change settings from RF to IR</p>
<p>THAT IS ON THE WEBSITE YOU REFERENCED ITSELF. IT IS A SOLUTION. Of course, </p>
<p>mine came set for IR because it's not the same model and I use IR remotes with
</p>
<p>it. </p>
<p>Regarding the IR cable that is 3.5mm with 2 bands, BOTH OF THE CABLES I HAVE </p>
<p>ARE. Your supervisor was claiming that they needed 3 bands, not 2. </p>
<p>So now it's very possible I will have to return the Xbox One because I can't </p>
<p>get technical support after buying it.</p>

<p>&gt; Hello Michael,</p>

<p>&gt; We've exhausted everything regarding this issue and We've gathered some</p>
<p>&gt; information regarding your Cable box which is DirectTV and it seems</p>
<p>&gt; that it is not compatible with IR settings, so I suggest to verify this</p>
<p>&gt; DirectTV box with your cable company if they have an option to set this</p>
<p>&gt; up with an IR emitter cable because the device is not native IR itself</p>

<p>&gt; </p>
<p>&gt; But this is still not assured because it is possible that the cable box</p>
<p>&gt; itself doesn't support the IR emitter cable that is why it can't</p>
<p>&gt; receive the power on.</p>

            <p>Hey there Tannhaus93!</p>
<p>First off, I'm sincerely sorry about the IR issues and any of the inconvenience this may have caused. I can understand how frustrating this can be, and I hope I can provide you with the answers you're looking for.</p>
<p>I definitely think that trying your family member's Kinect sensor will help us verify if your console is faulty or not. If the Kinect doesn't help with the issue, I recommend submitting a repair quest by contacting our phone support agents through our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page. Alternatively, you can set up the request yourself by visiting our&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service center</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I am sorry to hear about the frustration this may have caused. Please post back and let us know how things go!</p>

<p>He's a friend and he literally lives 90 miles from me. It just wouldn't work unless I waited a month or two for him to visit otherwise. I'd like to clear this up before then and I don't see how setting it up with a kinect would have any bearing on the IR
 cable working.</p>

            <p>Hey there Tannhaus93!</p>
<p>The purpose would be to verify if the console is accepting those signals in general since you are on your second IR blaster. If we can't try that, I unfortunately have to suggest submitting a repair request.</p>

<p>Just got my xbox one yesterday and it did not come with a kinect - didn't want one, but now it says I need the IR extension cable so I can control TV (cable) through the controller. They (microsoft) billed this xbox one as a huge control everything device
 but it's turning out to just be a fancy PS4. Can't even have PANDORA as an app. No youtube either. The smartest thing I can do is return it and stick with my xbox 360. They have no support and no IR ext. cables-even though that's what they say you need at
 set up. SMDH</p>

<p>We will use best efforts to return the same or similar special edition Xbox One console to you; this will depend on its availability at the time of service (special or custom editions may be out of production or inventory). If you are within the return policy of the retailer you originally purchased from, you always have that option as well!</p>

<p>Hi Sotero,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that you cannot add any account to your console and you are getting that specific error code. I recommend trying some console troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help&nbsp;then&nbsp;you will need to try out a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Console info</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Reset console</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Make sure to select "Keep my games &amp; apps" and have your account login information plus your WIFI password ready if you connect wireless because&nbsp;you will need to re-add the account's that were on the Xbox&nbsp;and re-connect
 to your network during the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try out the power cycle and soft factory reset and let us know the results!</p>

<p>With the help of other posts with that error code, some users said that fixed doing this:<br />
- Delete your account from your xbox one system<br />
- After that, re-enter your profile sign in as a new account.<br />
<br />
Let us know if worked.<br />

<h2>            no internet access at wifi hotspot</h2>
                    I live across the street from a college that has free WIFI. It says I'm connected but it also says "no internet access." I don't have this problem at any other hot-spot and I know anybody can access this college wifi and no access code is required. I have
 been able to connect before, but only while using Hotspot Shield. I have spoken with others and I seem to be the only one who can't access this wifi. I've noticed many of the students use Apple notebooks although I'm not sure if that matters or not. The S
 meter shows "Excellent" but there is a yellow triangle displayed on the S meter with an exclamation mark it it. I am using Windows 7 on a Compaq Presario CQ62 Notbood. I've tried everything I can think of including disabling the firewall and antivirus and
 I've tried the troubleshooter which isn't helpful. I've tried resetting the wifi adapter, etc. Still no Internet. Oddly, I am able to access the college website, but absolutely nothing else including the external links on the site. I

            <p>Maybe the IT Department is not being truthful and they are filtering your MAC address.</p>
<p>Also, depending on your Wireless standard built into your laptop, if its a Wireless G, then it might not be able to connect properly. Its also possible if its a Wireless N, it might be an earlier Wireless N standard that needs a firmware update to get better
 signal. </p>

            <p>If you do not have a MAC address (very unlikely), that would explain why you cannot connect - but you would not be able to connect at all. Apparently, you are getting a network connection but not getting Internet access. Possibly, the connection is limited
 in other ways that are not obvious or apparent to you.</p>
<p>[The MAC address is a unique value associated with a network <a href="http://compnetworking.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-adapter.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
adapter</a>. MAC addresses are also known as <b>hardware</b> addresses or <b>physical</b> addresses. They uniquely identify an adapter on a
<a href="http://compnetworking.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-lan.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LAN</a>.]</p>
<p>You say that no log-on is required for their network. Possibly that is true - I don not know. However, it would be unusual. Could it be that once you have established the initial network connection that there is a further log-on precedure for which you are
 not set up? In some such situations, the client opens the browser and is guided through the process. In others, the IT techs provide a log-on script which automatically runs on the client computer when it logs in.</p>
<p>In any case, a conversatiuon with them is needed. </p>
<p>Firmware udates, if available, are locatred on the download pages of your computer or the computer's motherboard maker -or- on the web pages of the maker of the plug-in PCI or PCI-E ir USB card or dongle. Sometimes updates are offered through the Microsoft
 update system depending on the options selected in Control Panel&nbsp; Windows Update.</p>

<p>It is my hope that no one here would knowingly subvert or&nbsp;assist anyone to&nbsp;subvert the security measures of a legitimate network.</p>

    <title>Black screen after changing SATA mode from AHCI to IDE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmcgee1125  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after changing SATA mode from AHCI to IDE</h2>
                    <p>I was in the BIOS and I changed my SATA mode from AHCI to IDE to try to make the BIOS/Windows 10 detect my new SSD. (Windows is installed on a separate HDD) After chaning this, I exited the BIOS and Windows gave me an error, INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE, and
 restarted. Now, I don't get any response from the PC at all. However, the fans do spin and I get beep codes when I remove RAM. (Removed to see if I has broken the BIOS or something else) I have tried:</p>
<p>A) Using the CLR_CMOS jumper.</p>
<p>B) Removing all non-essential components and trying to get into BIOS.</p>
<p>C) Removing all power from the PC (Including CMOS chip) to reset BIOS back to AHCI. (Default when I got PC)</p>
<p>D) Using only hardware I had before the error occurred. (Removed SSD)</p>
<p>I can't think of anything else to do and I can't access the BIOS (or Windows) at all. Is there some way I can change it back to AHCI without using any sort of UI (BIOS or otherwise)? I have no other computers to test that everything is working and I cannot
 replace the mobo because it uses its own special type of PSU connection that I have no adapters for. Using a Lenovo H50 with AMD A8 7650, 8 GB DDR3 RAM, 1 TB HDD with Windows 10, Crucial MX300 525 GB SSD (empty), and a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti SC. Anyone know of
 some way to change BIOS settings without turning PC on? (Using separate laptop to type this, cannot change any hardware on laptop though.)</p>

            Did a bit of quick reading, plug a flash drive into your system, press F12 just as your system starts up and from the boot menu select BIOS Setup (Settings) instead of booting from the Flash Drive . . .

            <p>Can't even do that. I have an HDMI cable plugged in but the monitor just switches between HDMI and Analog signals in the corner for a while then just says no signal. I tried plugging a flash drive in but it didn't change anything. I also have no Windows
 ISOs that I can use to create a bootable drive and grab my files off the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is absolutely no output from the computer at all and I can't send input. It doesn't take keyboards, flash drives, or any other cable. Everything appears to be working but nothing happens. I believe that the BIOS is intact however I cannot figure out
 what may have caused me to not be able to load either the boot menu or BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried taking out the CMOS and power, then attempting to start (to use up any leftover power in the system) and wait for ~40 minutes. Still nothing, and the 'loop' continues. Getting really desperate for a fix and I cannot find anything on Google or
 other sites that I either haven't tried or are even relevant. Nobody else seems to have this problem. For some reason other people have been able to launch Windows with this issue or have some way of resetting the BIOS or entering it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the make and model, like I said in my original posting: It is a Lenovo H50 with an AMD A8 processor and 8 GB RAM. It contains a UEFI BIOS and has no problems with the PSU as I can determine. Connected to the mobo is a 1 TB HDD, 525 SSD, and a disk
 read/writer. All 3 are hooked up to SATA 2 ports and 4 pin ATX power. The GTX 1050 Ti SC GPU requires no PSU power connection (All power through PCI-E 16x slot). All power cables are hooked up correctly, and I did not have any sort of problem with the computer
 before I did this. I have two 3 pin BIOS jumpers, one marked as CLR_CMOS and the other does not have any markings on it but is right next to the other one. I have tried all combinations of those to attempt to reset the BIOS.</p>

            <p>There should be no reason as to why you cannot get into your BIOS to reset your Sata Mode to AHCI, I have had to do this many times . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your system pressing and holding the F1 key whilst turning on your system should get you into BIOS, or Pressing F12 for Boot selection menu should also give you the option of entering BIOS.<br />
<br />
<strong>With regards to the CLR_CMOS jumper you need to move the jumper from the standard position (pins 1 and 2) to pins 2 and 3 for a 5 seconds to clear the CMOS chip</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if none of this works, try connecting your monitor via a VGA cable to the VGA output on your motherboard instead of connecting to your GPU, since due to the issues you are having you might not be getting HDMI output from your GPU . . .</p>

            Again, tried the CMOS Jumper and still nothing, tried the VGA port and got no signal, and holding F1/F12 did nothing either. Still a black screen and nothing is responding. The screen doesn't even flash and black out, the monitor doesn't even recognize
 that something is ever turned on (Besides waking out of sleep mode to display nothing)

            Then it's a hardware problem. I'm suspecting something happened to the motherboard but I don't know what. I hadn't opened the case before I did this so it couldn't be an electric shock or anything, maybe when I changed the settings the mobo got fried.
 Never heard of it happening before but I guess that's the only probable outcome, so I'll take it in to the manufacturer to get a replacement mobo or just buy a new one myself. Thanks for your help.

<p>It's very easy to install Windows 10 using the update assistant, it takes around 40 minutes with almost no user interaction, means you can go somewhere else or watch TV while your computer is upgrading itself to Windows 10. It's very important to check if
 your hardware is capable of properly running Windows 10 which the Assistant does for you.</p>

<p>It's odd that it should suddenly appear on your desktop.&nbsp; What are the properties of the item?</p>
<p>You should probably just delete it.&nbsp; The free upgrade to Windows 10 ended a long time ago.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Note that the advice from some others here is questionable at best.&nbsp; It's not clear what that shortcut actually is and whether it's legitimate.&nbsp; Are you interested in upgrading to Windows 10. Do you want to purchase an upgrade?</p>

Seems like it was part of the Assistive Technologies offer. The offer is no longer available and you can safely delete it. If you want to upgrade to Windows 10 using an existing Digital License or a Product Key download the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a> from Microsoft.

<p>
</p><p>it depends on the edition of Windows 10 being upgraded to.&nbsp; Win10 Professional costs more than Win10 Home.&nbsp;&nbsp; $119 for Win10 Home and $199 for Win10 Pro.</p>

            Hi NLDNLD
<br />
<br />Editing/changing the Hosts file can be difficult at the best of times
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download Hosts File Editor, a tiny free utility that you can use to edit your hosts file
<br />
<br />You can initially if you want choose File - Restore Default, to create a new hosts file or use the import feature to import a hosts file you created earlier . . .

<h2>            Desktop Folder Files no longer Displayed on my desktop</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This started yesterday: &nbsp;I have Vista Ultimate 32 bit installed on a Sony VAIO. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Behavior: &nbsp;I can save files to my desktop, if I open the actual desktop folder under /Users/username/Desktop I can see the files are there. &nbsp;However my actual computer desktop remains empty. &nbsp;The rest of my system functions fine, I have a sidebar,
 background, taskbar, etc. &nbsp;Just no files or shortcuts. &nbsp; They are in the desktop folder but the link seems somehow broken between that folder's contents and what is displayed on my desktop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Rebooting doesn't solve it, changing wallpaper doesn't solve it, &nbsp;--- appreciate any help. &nbsp;I use my desktop often while working. &nbsp;Its a major problem for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>Tom</div>

            Hi BaltimoreTommy,<br />
<br />
Right click on the desktop, go to "View", and make sure the option "Show Desktop Icons" is checked.<br />
<br />
People sometimes do this for pranks, except they take a picture with shortcuts and paste as the background.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>There's no way to remove the cheater mark unless your an unauthorised access investigation found in your favour. As for your other requests that's not happening either. It's a draconian punishment for a reason and if they bent the rules for you they'd have
 to bend them for everyone.</p>

About Gamerscore corrections
<p>A gamerscore correction occurs on a player’s LIVE account when they gain achievements through avoiding game play and the use of external tools.&nbsp; LIVE is committed to keeping the service free of this type of behavior as it violates the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LIVE
 Terms of Use</a>.&nbsp; When abnormal achievement or gamerscore activity is found, LIVE modifies the gamerscore of players who meet specific and automated criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A LIVE player who obtained their gamerscore in this abnormal way will</p>
<ul>
<li>Find their gamerscore reset to zero, and </li><li>Be unable to regain all previously earned achievements, and </li><li>Be labeled as a “cheater” for the community to view. </li></ul>
<p>While players who have been identified by these criteria will start from a zero gamerscore, they will still be able to gain achievements for future games.&nbsp; In other words, we give them another chance to earn future achievements by earning them as other “fair”
 players do.&nbsp; <span><b>The original gamerscore correction will&nbsp;<em>remain permanent without any way to appeal.</em></b></span>[/quote]<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/Live/Cheating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/Live/Cheating</a></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">While your apology may be sincere it is falling on mostly deaf ears as the majority of the community does not condone or tolerate modding/cheating of any kind anywhere on the service.
 If you were truly sorry you would not have cheated in the first place. The XBL Terms of Service and Code of Conduct tell everyone what they can and can not do while using the service. If more people would take the time to actually read those contracts that
 they so readily agree to without taking notice of then these types of situations may not be as commonplace as they are today.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You have been given another chance to earn achievements legit. It is just limited to games that were not played prior to the reset. That is part of the punishment.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The
<i>cheater</i> label will never be removed. That also is a part of the punishment.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It is too bad you only now have realized that XBL should be free of cheaters. If you had realized that sooner you might not even be in this situation.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Your only recourse would be to create a new account and start everything all over again and prove to the community that this time you will be legit. So long as you do not change consoles
 the two accounts will be able to share DLC, avatar items excluded. <br />

<h2>            Unable to download 360 profile on xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>So i get the grey screen which says Getting xbox 360 info...with a spinning circle and a progress bar that doesn't fill up no matter how long i wait or how many times i try. I've spoken to Microsoft chat and we followed a few trouble shooting steps such
 as deleting the 360 cache, removing my profile and signing back in, I've even factory reset my console. I've left this for about a year but COD WAW is out and i really want to play it but can't play any backward compatible game. I'm really stuck is there anyone
 out there that knows a way round this?</p>
